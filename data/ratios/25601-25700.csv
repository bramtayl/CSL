25601,Cost-effectiveness of iron supplementation and malaria chemoprophylaxis in the prevention of anaemia and malaria among Tanzanian infants,"Prerequisites for effective interventions against severe anaemia and malaria among infants are economic evaluations to aid the setting of priorities and the making of health policy. In the present study we analysed the cost and effectiveness of three control strategies hypothetically delivered through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). For the prevention of severe anaemia and from the perspective of the health provider, the cost-effectiveness ratios were, respectively, US$ 8, US$ 9, and US$ 21 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) for malaria chemoprophylaxis with Deltaprim (a combination of 3.125 mg pyrimethamine and 25 mg dapsone) + iron, Deltaprim alone, or iron supplementation alone. For malaria prevention, Deltaprim + iron cost US$ 9.7 per DALY and Deltaprim alone cost US$ 10.2 per DALY. From a sociocultural perspective the cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from US$ 9 to US$ 26 for severe anaemia prevention and from US$ 11 to US$ 12 for the prevention of clinical malaria. These ratios were highly cost-effective, as defined by the World Bank's proposed threshold of less than US$ 25 per DALY for comparative assessments. Furthermore, all the preventive interventions were less costly than the current malaria and anaemia control strategies that rely on clinical case management.

25609,The economics of HIV vaccines: projecting the impact of HIV vaccination of infants in sub-Saharan Africa,"Objectives: (i) To project vaccine parameters, economic consequences and market size associated with HIV-1 vaccination of infants in sub-Saharan Africa through the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI); and (ii) to assess threshold values for price and effectiveness. Study design and methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-analysis model linking epidemiological data with economic information. Epidemiological data on the burden of disease of HIV were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. The decision analysis model was constructed using estimates of lifetime chances of HIV infection. To assess threshold values for price and effectiveness, a maximum value for cost effectiveness in developing countries of $US100 was used in the base case. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analysis was performed on relevant parameters, assessing the impact of these parameters on the results of our analysis. In the base case, health benefits and consequences were discounted at a rate of 3%. Study perspective: Societal. Results: According to our model, introduction of an HIV-1 vaccine in the EPI would result in the vaccination of 8717112 infants in sub-Saharan Africa per year. This corresponds to the prevention of 1839355 cases of HIV per year, gaining 16461800 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention would be $US3.4 per DALY gained (1998 values) at a vaccine price in the base case of $US5. At the same price the estimated size of the market would be approximately $US44536111 per year. Conclusion: If technological and financial problems associated with the development of an HIV vaccine can be solved, HIV vaccination in Africa could be both cost effective and potentially profitable.",2001-01-0553,11700780,Pharmacoeconomics,J M Bos,2001,19 / 9,937-46,Yes,11700780,"J M Bos; M J Postma; JM Bos; MJ Postma; Andreas Lundin; Alma Sorberg Wallin; Daniel Falkstedt; Peter Allebeck; Tomas Hemmingsson; The economics of HIV vaccines: projecting the impact of HIV vaccination of infants in sub-Saharan Africa, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 19(9):1179-2027; 937-46",DALY,"Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Democratic Republic, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zimbabwe",Not Stated,Immunization,HIV vaccination through the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3,3.4,United States,1998,5.4
25610,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of environmental management for malaria control,"Roll back malaria (RBM) aims at halving the current burden of the disease by the year 2010. The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, and it is proposed to implement efficacious and cost-effective control strategies. But the evidence base of such information is scarce, and a notable missing element is the discussion of the potential of environmental management. We reviewed the literature and identified multiple malaria control programmes that incorporated environmental management as the central feature. Prominent among them are programmes launched in 1929 and implemented for two decades at copper mining communities in Zambia. The full package of control measures consisted of vegetation clearance, modification of river boundaries, draining swamps, oil application to open water bodies and house screening. Part of the population also was given quinine and was sleeping under mosquito nets. Monthly malaria incidence rates and vector densities were used for surveillance and adaptive tuning of the environmental management strategies to achieve a high level of performance. Within 3-5 years, malaria-related mortality, morbidity and incidence rates were reduced by 70-95%. Over the entire 20 years of implementation, the programme had averted an estimated 4173 deaths and 161,205 malaria attacks. The estimated costs per death and malaria attack averted were US$ 858 and US$ 22.20, respectively. Over the initial 3-5 years start-up period, analogous to the short-duration of cost-effectiveness analyses of current studies, we estimated that the costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted were US$ 524-591. However, the strategy has a track record of becoming cost-effective in the longer term, as maintenance costs were much lower: US$ 22-92 per DALY averted. In view of fewer adverse ecological effects, increased sustainability and better uses of local resources and knowledge, environmental management--integrated with pharmacological, insecticidal and bednet interventions--could substantially increase the chances of rolling back malaria.",2001-01-02875,11555434,Trop Med Int Health,J Utzinger,2001,6 / 9,677-87,No,11555434,"J Utzinger; Y Tozan; B H Singer; Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of environmental management for malaria control, Trop Med Int Health, 2001-Sep; 6(9):1360-2276; 677-87",DALY,Zambia,Not Stated,Environmental,"Environmental management consisting of vegetation clearance, modification of river bounderies, draining swamps, oil application to open water bodies and house screening in copper mining communities vs. Standard/Usual Care- Assumed care",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,", 20 years",Not Stated,3,524.24,United States,1995,890.28
25611,Cost-effectiveness analysis of dialysis and kidney transplants in Japan,"Although kidney transplantation is considered to be more desirable than dialysis in terms of cost-effectiveness and patients' quality of life, there have been very few cases of kidney transplants in Japan. This study was conducted to compare the cost-effectiveness of dialysis and kidney transplants using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) as an indicator of effectiveness. Most data necessary for the DALYs analysis were obtained from publications. The disability weights for dialysis patients and kidney transplant patients were estimated based on a questionnaire e-mailed to medical officials of the Japanese Government. Expected duration of treatment was estimated from the survival rates of dialysis patients and the graft-survival rates of transplant patients using the Weibull model method. The cost of dialysis and living-related donor (LRD) transplant included only medical expenditures and neglected all other costs, and the cost of cadaveric donor (CAD) transplant included the budget for organ procurement and distribution in addition to medical expenditures. The analysis showed that dialysis averted 138,019 DALYs/year, living-related donor transplant averted 5,740 DALYs/year, and CAD transplant averted 1,892 DALYs/year. The cost-effectiveness ratio (C-E ratio) was 9,546 thousand yen/DALY for dialysis, 1,809 thousand yen/DALY for LRD transplant, and 2,322 thousand yen/DALY for CAD transplant.

25614,Should programmes for community-level meningococcal vaccination be considered in Australia? An economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Disease due to serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis is life-threatening and potentially preventable by vaccination. In 1999, the UK instigated mass vaccination after a sustained increase in serogroup C meningococcal disease. In the same year, Victoria, Australia experienced a similar change in disease epidemiology. It is timely to undertake an economic evaluation of options for community vaccination in Australia based on local data. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses of three options for use of polysaccharide vaccine were undertaken for a hypothetical population aged 15--19 years. Baseline analyses assumed 5 years' duration of vaccine protection following a single year of programme implementation. Sensitivity analyses of key variables were performed, including vaccine coverage and effectiveness, case fatality rate and the discount rate. Outcomes included the number of people vaccinated, cases averted, life-years saved and disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) averted. Cost-benefit analysis used lost earnings avoided as a measure of vaccination benefit. RESULTS: Vaccination of people aged 15--19 years in a defined population with a high rate of disease was the most cost-effective option. Compared with no vaccination and assuming 5 years' duration of protection and exclusion of direct cost savings, this resulted in a discounted cost per life-year saved of $23,623, a cost per DALY avoided of $21,097 and benefits exceeding costs in discounted terms. The 'break-even' incidence rate for this option with exclusion of direct cost savings was 14.0/100,000.

METHODS: An assumed cohort of 2,000 cases was set up based on age-specific incidence of 794 newly registered smear-positive cases in Beijing in 1994. Prognostic trees and model diagrams of infectivity with natural history and DOTS intervention were constructed based on the epidemiological parameters. RESULTS: DOTS reduced 89.19% of YLL, 78.90% of YLD, and 99.98% of infectivity BOD. One DALY could be saved with 45.70 Yuan by DOTS with 3% discount. Sensitivity analysis showed that discount had effect on CER. Weight of age was insensitive to CER. The higher the DOTS cured rate, the more the cost-effectiveness.

Using a static model of the cohort of smokers alive in 1995, we estimated the number of smoking-attributable deaths that could be averted by: (1) price increases, (2) nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and (3) a package of non-price interventions other than NRT. We calculated the cost-effectiveness of these policy interventions by weighing the approximate public-sector costs against the years of healthy life saved, measured in disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs. Even with deliberately conservative assumptions, tax increases that would raise the real price of cigarettes by 10% worldwide would prevent between 5 and 16 million tobacco-related deaths, and could cost 3-70 US dollars per DALY saved in low-income and middle-income regions. NRT and a package of non-price interventions other than NRT are also cost-effective in low-income and middle-income regions, at 280-870 US dollars per DALY and 36-710 US dollars per DALY, respectively. In high-income countries, price increases were found to have a cost-effectiveness of 83-2771 US dollars per DALY, NRT 750-7206 US dollars per DALY and other non-price interventions 696-13,924 US dollars per DALY.

25649,The economic payoffs of integrated malaria control in the Zambian copperbelt between 1930 and 1950,"It has long been suggested that malaria is delaying the economic development of countries that are most severely affected by the disease. Several studies have documented the economic consequences of malaria at the household level, primarily in communities engaged in subsistence farming. A missing element is the appraisal of the economic impact of malaria on the industrial and service sectors that will probably become the backbone of many developing economies. We estimate the economic effects of integrated malaria control implemented during the colonial period and sustained for 20 years in four copper mining communities of the former Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Integrated malaria control was characterized by strong emphasis on environmental management, while part of the mining communities also benefited from rapid diagnosis and treatment and the use of bednets. The programmes were highly successful as an estimated 14,122 deaths, 517,284 malaria attacks and 942,347 work shift losses were averted. Overall, 127,226 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were averted per 3-year incremental period. The cumulative costs of malaria control interventions were 11,169,472 US dollars (in 1995 US dollars). Because the control programmes were so effective, the mining companies attracted a large reservoir of migrant labourers and sustained healthy work forces. The programmes averted an estimated 796,622 US dollars in direct treatment costs and 5,678,745 US dollars in indirect costs as a result of reduced work absenteeism. Within a few years of programme initiation, Northern Rhodesia became the leading copper producer in Africa, and mining generated the dominant share of national income. Copper production and revenues, which increased dramatically during malaria control interventions, amounted to the equivalent of 7.1 billion US dollars (in 1995 US dollars). Integrated malaria control in copper mining communities was a sound investment. It had payoff for public and occupational health, generally, and without it copper extraction and social and economic development would have been impossible.",2002-02-00973,12167093,Trop Med Int Health,Jürg Utzinger,2002,7 / 8,657-77,No,12167093,"Jürg Utzinger; Yesim Tozan; Fadi Doumani; Burton H Singer; The economic payoffs of integrated malaria control in the Zambian copperbelt between 1930 and 1950, Trop Med Int Health, 2002-Aug; 7(8):1360-2276; 657-77",DALY,Zambia,Not Stated,"Environmental, Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical","Integrated malaria control including quinine, house screening, oil on water, DDT, mosquito netting in copper mining communities of Roan Antelope vs. Standard/Usual Care",Not Stated,64 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3,20.66,United States,1995,35.09

A missing element is the appraisal of the economic impact of malaria on the industrial and service sectors that will probably become the backbone of many developing economies. We estimate the economic effects of integrated malaria control implemented during the colonial period and sustained for 20 years in four copper mining communities of the former Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Integrated malaria control was characterized by strong emphasis on environmental management, while part of the mining communities also benefited from rapid diagnosis and treatment and the use of bednets. The programmes were highly successful as an estimated 14,122 deaths, 517,284 malaria attacks and 942,347 work shift losses were averted. Overall, 127,226 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were averted per 3-year incremental period. The cumulative costs of malaria control interventions were 11,169,472 US dollars (in 1995 US dollars). Because the control programmes were so effective, the mining companies attracted a large reservoir of migrant labourers and sustained healthy work forces. The programmes averted an estimated 796,622 US dollars in direct treatment costs and 5,678,745 US dollars in indirect costs as a result of reduced work absenteeism. Within a few years of programme initiation, Northern Rhodesia became the leading copper producer in Africa, and mining generated the dominant share of national income. Copper production and revenues, which increased dramatically during malaria control interventions, amounted to the equivalent of 7.1 billion US dollars (in 1995 US dollars).

25658,Economic benefits of establishing a National Cancer Center in Louisiana,"This paper estimates the economic benefits of establishing a National Cancer Institute-designated center in Louisiana. Estimates of direct and indirect costs of cancer were used to derive the potential benefits of a cancer center. A fully functional cancer center should be able to prevent about 6,550 deaths over the next 10-year period implying a savings of about 23,000 disability-adjusted life years. The potential revenues to be generated through new patients from neighboring states, diversion of Louisiana patients back to the state from other out-of state facilities, and the indirect benefits derived through increased economic productivity (due to life years saved) makes the establishment of the center highly cost-effective. The benefit-cost ratio of establishing a cancer center becomes 8.5, i.e., spending one million dollars in a cancer center should generate about dollars 8.5 million worth of economic benefits for the State over a 10-year time horizon.",2003-01-00415,14748486,J La State Med Soc,M Mahmud Khan,2003,155 / 5,"248, 250-4",No,14748486,"M Mahmud Khan; Roy S Weiner; Monika Sawhney; Takahiko Sugihara; Tatsuro Ishizaki; Tadashi Hosoya; Shoko Iga; Waka Yokoyama; Fumio Hirano; Nobuyuki Miyasaka; Masayoshi Harigai; Economic benefits of establishing a National Cancer Center in Louisiana, J La State Med Soc, ; 155(5):0024-6921; 248, 250-4",DALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Care Delivery,Establishing a National Cancer Institute vs. Standard/Usual Care- Inadequate cancer care or seeking care in a different state,Louisiana,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,,5.00,5,3185.96,United States,2002,4583.44
25659,Effectiveness and costs of interventions to lower systolic blood pressure and cholesterol: a global and regional analysis on reduction of cardiovascular-disease risk,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease accounts for much morbidity and mortality in developed countries and is becoming increasingly important in less developed regions. Systolic blood pressure above 115 mm Hg accounts for two-thirds of strokes and almost half of ischaemic heart disease cases, and cholesterol concentrations exceeding 3.8 mmol/L for 18% and 55%, respectively. We report estimates of the population health effects, and costs of selected interventions to reduce the risks associated with high cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure in areas of the world with differing epidemiological profiles. METHODS: Effect sizes were derived from systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and the effect on health outcomes projected over time for populations with differing age, sex, and epidemiological profiles. Incidence data from estimates of burden of disease were used in a four-state longitudinal population model to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted and patients treated. Costs were taken from previous publications, or estimated by local experts, in 14 regions. FINDINGS: Non-personal health interventions, including government action to stimulate a reduction in the salt content of processed foods, are cost-effective ways to limit cardiovascular disease and could avert over 21 million DALYs per year worldwide. Combination treatment for people whose risk of a cardiovascular event over the next 10 years is above 35% is also cost effective leading to substantial additional health benefits by averting an additional 63 million DALYs per year worldwide.

25692,Effectiveness and costs of interventions to lower systolic blood pressure and cholesterol: a global and regional analysis on reduction of cardiovascular-disease risk,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease accounts for much morbidity and mortality in developed countries and is becoming increasingly important in less developed regions. Systolic blood pressure above 115 mm Hg accounts for two-thirds of strokes and almost half of ischaemic heart disease cases, and cholesterol concentrations exceeding 3.8 mmol/L for 18% and 55%, respectively. We report estimates of the population health effects, and costs of selected interventions to reduce the risks associated with high cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure in areas of the world with differing epidemiological profiles. METHODS: Effect sizes were derived from systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and the effect on health outcomes projected over time for populations with differing age, sex, and epidemiological profiles. Incidence data from estimates of burden of disease were used in a four-state longitudinal population model to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted and patients treated. Costs were taken from previous publications, or estimated by local experts, in 14 regions. FINDINGS: Non-personal health interventions, including government action to stimulate a reduction in the salt content of processed foods, are cost-effective ways to limit cardiovascular disease and could avert over 21 million DALYs per year worldwide. Combination treatment for people whose risk of a cardiovascular event over the next 10 years is above 35% is also cost effective leading to substantial additional health benefits by averting an additional 63 million DALYs per year worldwide.

25700,Human health benefits from livestock vaccination for brucellosis: case study,"To estimate the economic benefit, cost-effectiveness, and distribution of benefit of improving human health in Mongolia through the control of brucellosis by mass vaccination of livestock.Cost-effectiveness and economic benefit for human society and the agricultural sector of mass vaccination against brucellosis was modelled. The intervention consisted of a planned 10-year livestock mass vaccination campaign using Rev-1 livestock vaccine for small ruminants and S19 livestock vaccine for cattle. Cost-effectiveness, expressed as cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted, was the primary outcome.In a scenario of 52% reduction of brucellosis transmission between animals achieved by mass vaccination, a total of 49,027 DALYs could be averted. Estimated intervention costs were US$ 8.3 million, and the overall benefit was US$ 26.6 million. This results in a net present value of US$ 18.3 million and an average benefit-cost ratio for society of 3.2 (2.27-4.37). If the costs of the intervention were shared between the sectors in proportion to the benefit to each, the public health sector would contribute 11%, which gives a cost-effectiveness of US$ 19.1 per DALY averted (95% confidence interval 5.3-486.8). If private economic gain because of improved human health was included, the health sector should contribute 42% to the intervention costs and the cost-effectiveness would decrease to US$ 71.4 per DALY averted.If the costs of vaccination of livestock against brucellosis were allocated to all sectors in proportion to the benefits, the intervention might be profitable and cost effective for the agricultural and health sectors.",2003-99-13671,14997239,Bull World Health Organ,Felix Roth,2003,81 / 12,867-76,No,14997239,"Felix Roth; JAKOB Zinsstag; Dontor Orkhon; G Chimed-Ochir; Guy Hutton; Ottorino Cosivi; Guy Carrin; Joachim Otte; Human health benefits from livestock vaccination for brucellosis: case study, Bull World Health Organ, ; 81(12):0042-9686; 867-76",DALY,Mongolia,Not Stated,"Environmental, Health Education or Behavior, Immunization",Mass vaccination of livestock against brucellosis vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,,5.00,5,19.1,United States,2000,28.71
