801,Decision analysis of prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy in BRCA1-positive or BRCA2-positive patients,"PURPOSE: Young Ashkenazi Jewish women or those from high-risk families who test positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant genes have a significant risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer by the age of 70 years. Many question whether they should have prophylactic surgical procedures, ie, bilateral mastectomy and/or oophorectomy. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to determine the survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic surgical procedures. The probabilities of developing breast and ovarian cancer were based on literature review among women with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and mortality rates were determined from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data for 1973 to 1992. The costs for hospital and ambulatory care were estimated from Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) payments in 1995, supplemented by managed care and fee-for-service data. Utility measures for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were explicitly determined using the time-trade off method. Estimated risks for breast and ovarian cancer after prophylactic surgeries were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: For a 30-year-old woman, according to her cancer risks, prophylactic oophorectomy improved survival by 0.4 to 2.6 years; mastectomy, by 2.8 to 3.4 years; and mastectomy and oophorectomy, by 3.3 to 6.0 years over surveillance. The QALYs saved were 0.5 for oophorectomy and 1.9 for the combined procedures in the high-risk model. Prophylactic surgeries were cost-effective compared with surveillance for years of life saved, but not for QALYs. CONCLUSION: Among women who test positive for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, prophylactic surgery at a young age substantially improves survival, but unless genetic risk of cancer is high, provides no benefit for quality of life. Prophylactic surgery is cost-effective for years of life saved compared with other medical interventions that are deemed cost-effective.",1998-01-02013,9508180,J Clin Oncol,V R Grann,1998,16 / 3,979-85,No,9508180,"V R Grann; K S Panageas; W Whang; K H Antman; A I Neugut; Decision analysis of prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy in BRCA1-positive or BRCA2-positive patients, J Clin Oncol, 1998-Mar; 16(3):0732-183X; 979-85",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic oophorectomy vs. Frequent screening and close surveillance,Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,4756.67,United States,1995,8077.94

803,"Pretreatment evaluation of chronic hepatitis C: risks, benefits, and costs","CONTEXT: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection affects nearly 4 million people in the United States. Treatment with interferon alfa-2b has been limited by its cost and low likelihood of long-term response. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of alternative pretreatment management strategies for patients with CHC. DESIGN: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model to examine prevalence of genotypes, viral load, and histological characteristics in relation to the sustained response rate with treatment. Data were based on a previously published decision model and a MEDLINE literature search for hepatitis C, biopsy, and liver from 1966 to 1996. PATIENTS: A hypothetical population of patients with CHC infection and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase level. INTERVENTIONS: Combinations of liver biopsy, genotyping, and quantitative viral load determination prior to a single 6-month course of interferon alfa-2b; empirical interferon treatment; and conservative management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of sustained responders, lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS: Strategies involving hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing had marginal cost-effectiveness ratios up to $4400 per discounted quality-adjusted life-year gained but would miss up to 36% of sustained responders. Empirical interferon treatment had a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $12400 per discounted quality-adjusted life-year gained and reached all potential sustained responders. Strategies involving liver biopsy were more expensive and would miss 6% of sustained responders and yield slightly lower life expectancies. CONCLUSIONS: Routine liver biopsy before treatment with interferon increases the cost of managing patients with CHC without improving health outcomes.

806,Cost effectiveness of early treatment with oral aciclovir in adult chickenpox,"Treatment of adult chickenpox with aciclovir is controversial because of the relatively high cost of medication and small proven benefits of therapy. A decision-tree model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of aciclovir, from third-party payer and societal perspectives: the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated for aciclovir treatment of chickenpox compared with no antiviral therapy in immunocompetent adults who presented within 24 hours of the onset of chickenpox rash. Incremental costs for aciclovir compared with no antiviral treatment were 42,900 US dollars per QALY gained, when viewed from a third-party payer perspective; however, results are sensitive to variation of clinical parameters. From a societal perspective, aciclovir therapy was cost saving compared with no antiviral treatment; aciclovir remained cost saving or cost effective (less than 50,000 US dollars per QALY gained) when probabilities, quality-of-life utility values and costs were varied within clinically plausible ranges, and when other scenarios for chickenpox severity and aciclovir effectiveness were examined. From a societal perspective, oral aciclovir is cost effective, and perhaps cost saving, when given within 24 hours of rash onset in adult chickenpox. The argument for antiviral use may be less strong when viewed from the perspective of a third-party payer.",1998-01-02015,17165329,Pharmacoeconomics,K J Smith,1998,13 / 5 Pt 2,645-51,Yes,17165329,"K J Smith; M S Roberts; Cost effectiveness of early treatment with oral aciclovir in adult chickenpox, Pharmacoeconomics, 1998-May; 13(5 Pt 2):1179-2027; 645-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral aciclovir therapy vs. No antiviral therapy,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-108000,United States,1994,-188607.21
807,Treatments for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer: analysis of survival data and cost-effectiveness evaluation,"The main therapeutic options currently available for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer include: (i) cisplatin-based chemotherapy at conventional doses without paclitaxel, (ii) paclitaxel+cisplatin at conventional doses and (iii) high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic rescue. After conducting a literature search to identify large-scale clinical trials based on these three therapeutic modalities, we carried out an analysis of the survival data and evaluated the cost-effectiveness ratio where appropriate. Cost data were obtained from published information. Effectiveness was estimated by determining the values of mean lifetime survival (MLS). Our analysis included a total of 15 clinical trials. The values of MLS were 3.05 years per patient for cisplatin-based chemotherapy at conventional doses without paclitaxel (1931 patients), 2.95 years per patient for chemotherapy with paclitaxel+cisplatin at conventional doses (184 patients) and 5.76 years per patient for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic rescue (53 patients). As compared with cisplatin-based chemotherapy without paclitaxel, high-dose treatments with hematopoietic rescue yielded a significantly better survival. Using cisplatin-based chemotherapy as a reference term, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for high-dose treatments was $25641 per life year gained (discounted dollars per discounted life year gained). Sensitivity testing suggested that the ratio remained below $50000 under most circumstances. We conclude that in the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer, high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic rescue seems to be more effective and more cost-effective than standard treatments with cisplatin-based regimens at conventional doses.",1998-01-02016,9877236,Curr Surg,A Messori,1998,9 / 6,491-502,No,9877236,"A Messori; S Trippoli; P Becagli; E Tendi; Treatments for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer: analysis of survival data and cost-effectiveness evaluation, Curr Surg, 1998-Jul; 9(6):0149-7944; 491-502",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,High dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoetic rescue vs. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy at conventional doses,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,31915,United States,1996,52644.7
808,The cost and cardioprotective effects of enalapril in hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction,"This study examined the effect of enalapril on survival, resource use, and cost of care in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and hypertension using a retrospective analysis of patients who participated in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD). Among the 6797 SOLVD participants, 1917 patients had either elevated systolic (> or = 140 mm Hg) or diastolic (> or = 90 mm Hg) blood pressure. Therapy with enalapril was associated with a significant relative risk reduction for mortality (RR = 0.819, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.98; P = .03). This resulted in a gain of 0.11 years (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.20 years) of survival during the average 2.8 year follow-up for this subgroup and was projected to result in a gain of 2.14 years (95% CI: 0.05 to 4.21 years) during the patient's lifetime. Enalapril significantly reduced the risk of first hospitalization for heart failure by 37%. For all types of hospitalizations, there was an average reduction of 32 hospitalizations per 100 patients treated with enalapril during the trial period (95% CI: 11.8 to 52.2 hospitalizations avoided per 100 patients), resulting in an estimated net savings of $1656 per patient during the trial period (95% CI: increased cost of $191 to savings of $3502). Although the projected lifetime net savings of $1456 was not significant (95% CI: increased cost of $9243 to saving of $12,527), evaluation of the cost per life year saved indicated that enalapril represented a cost-effective strategy. The estimated clinical benefit of enalapril among the hypertensive subgroup in SOLVD supports the recommendation that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be considered as first line pharmacologic therapy for hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction. From both the clinical and economic viewpoints, ACE inhibitors provide important clinical benefits and are cost-effective.",1998-01-02017,9880125,Am J Hypertens,J R Cook,1998,11 / 12,1433-41,No,9880125,"J R Cook; H A Glick; W Gerth; B Kinosian; J B Kostis; The cost and cardioprotective effects of enalapril in hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction, Am J Hypertens, 1998-Dec; 11(12):0895-7061; 1433-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enalapril in addition to usual therapy vs. Placebo in addition to usual therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-1967.57,United States,1996,-3245.56

816,Cost effectiveness of newer antiviral agents for herpes zoster: is the evidence spotty?,"Famciclovir and valaciclovir were approved for use in the treatment of herpes zoster despite controversy over antiviral therapy in zoster due to high costs and uncertain benefits. To explore these issues, a Markov decision model was developed, and the incremental cost effectiveness of antiviral treatment for herpes zoster was estimated using these agents compared with no antiviral therapy. A third-party payer perspective was taken. Sensitivity analyses were performed, modeling differences in antiviral efficacy, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) risk, and other illness parameters. Treatment of severely symptomatic acute zoster was found reasonable from a cost-effectiveness standpoint in base-case and worst-case scenarios. Treatment of mildly symptomatic acute zoster was more expensive but would likely be considered cost effective in scenarios where PHN risk was higher, PHN duration longer, or antiviral shortening of PHN greater.

820,Prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis carriers: an economic evaluation,"The cloning of the CFTR gene has made it technically possible to avert the unwanted birth of a child with cystic fibrosis (CF). Several large trials offering prenatal CF carrier screening suggest that such screening is practical and that identified carriers generally use the information obtained. Therefore, a critical question is whether the cost of such screening is justified. Decision analysis was performed that used information about choices that pregnant women were observed to make at each stage in the Rochester prenatal carrier-screening trial. The cost of screening per CF birth voluntarily averted was estimated to be $1,320,000-$1,400,000. However, the lifetime medical cost of the care of a CF child in today's dollars was estimated to be slightly>$1,000,000. Therefore, despite both the high cost of carrier testing and the relative infrequency of CF conceptions in the general population, the averted medical-care cost resulting from choices freely made are estimated to offset approximately 74%-78% of the costs of a screening program. At present, if it is assumed that a pregnancy terminated because of CF is replaced, the marginal cost for prenatal CF carrier screening is estimated to be $8,290 per quality-adjusted life-year. This value compares favorably with that of many accepted medical services. The cost of prenatal CF carrier screening could fall to equal the averted costs of CF patient care if the cost of carrier testing were to fall to $100.",1998-01-02021,9758600,Am J Hum Genet,P T Rowley,1998,63 / 4,1160-74,No,9758600,"P T Rowley; S Loader; R M Kaplan; Prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis carriers: an economic evaluation, Am J Hum Genet, 1998-Oct; 63(4):0002-9297; 1160-74",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Free screening for carriers of the CFTR gene & free counseling of carriers vs. No screening offered,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,Not Stated,8290,United States,1996,13674.59
821,Test-treatment strategies for patients suspected of having Lyme disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of test-treatment strategies for patients suspected of having Lyme disease. DATA SOURCES: The medical literature was searched for information on outcomes and costs. Expert opinion was sought for information on utilities. STUDY SELECTION: Articles that described patient population, diagnostic criteria, dose and duration of therapy, and criteria for assessment of outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: The decision analysis evaluated the following strategies: 1) no testing-no treatment; 2) testing with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by antibiotic treatment of patients with positive results; 3) two-step testing with ELISA followed by Western blot and antibiotic treatment for patients with positive results on either test; and 4) empirical antibiotic therapy. Three patient scenarios were considered: myalgic symptoms, rash resembling erythema migrans, and recurrent oligoarticular inflammatory arthritis. Results were calculated as costs per quality-adjusted life-year and were subjected to sensitivity analysis. Adjustment was made for the diagnostic value of common clinical features of Lyme disease. DATA SYNTHESIS: For myalgic symptoms without other features suggestive of Lyme disease, the no testing-no treatment strategy was most economically attractive (that is, had the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio). For rash, empirical antibiotic therapy was less costly and more effective than other strategies. For oligoarticular arthritis with a history of rash and tick bite, two-step testing was associated with the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio. Testing with ELISA and empirical antibiotic therapy cost an additional $880,000 and $34,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. For oligoarticular arthritis with one or no other features suggestive of Lyme disease, two-step testing was most economically attractive.

DATA SYNTHESIS: For myalgic symptoms without other features suggestive of Lyme disease, the no testing-no treatment strategy was most economically attractive (that is, had the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio). For rash, empirical antibiotic therapy was less costly and more effective than other strategies. For oligoarticular arthritis with a history of rash and tick bite, two-step testing was associated with the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio. Testing with ELISA and empirical antibiotic therapy cost an additional $880,000 and $34,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively.

STUDY SELECTION: Articles that described patient population, diagnostic criteria, dose and duration of therapy, and criteria for assessment of outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: The decision analysis evaluated the following strategies: 1) no testing-no treatment; 2) testing with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by antibiotic treatment of patients with positive results; 3) two-step testing with ELISA followed by Western blot and antibiotic treatment for patients with positive results on either test; and 4) empirical antibiotic therapy. Three patient scenarios were considered: myalgic symptoms, rash resembling erythema migrans, and recurrent oligoarticular inflammatory arthritis. Results were calculated as costs per quality-adjusted life-year and were subjected to sensitivity analysis. Adjustment was made for the diagnostic value of common clinical features of Lyme disease. DATA SYNTHESIS: For myalgic symptoms without other features suggestive of Lyme disease, the no testing-no treatment strategy was most economically attractive (that is, had the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio). For rash, empirical antibiotic therapy was less costly and more effective than other strategies. For oligoarticular arthritis with a history of rash and tick bite, two-step testing was associated with the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio. Testing with ELISA and empirical antibiotic therapy cost an additional $880,000 and $34,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. For oligoarticular arthritis with one or no other features suggestive of Lyme disease, two-step testing was most economically attractive.

848,Cost-utility assessment of amifostine as first-line therapy for ovarian cancer,"Nearly 27,000 female patients were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the United States in 1997. While chemotherapeutic agents are effective in prolonging the time to progression of disease, concerns exist over treatment- related toxicities. In addition to considerations related to effectiveness, the decision to prescribe new cytoprotective agents requires consideration of costs and cost-effectiveness. The objective of this study was to describe cost-utility estimates of a new supportive care agent, amifostine, and to illustrate these issues for patients with ovarian cancer. The phase III Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensing trial found that pretreatment with amifostine prior to each cycle of chemotherapy resulted in reduction of cumulative toxicities with cyclophosphamide and cisplatinum. While amifostine use is approximately $3,146 more per patient, after adjustment for direct medical costs and potential health status changes from reductions in hematologic toxicity, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity, its use was estimated to cost $36,161 in direct medical costs per quality-adjusted life year saved. Sensitivity analyses indicated that cost-effectiveness estimates of amifostine therapy ranged front $25,474 to $78,574. Based on the phase III FDA licensing trial, amifostine use is associated with a favorable cost-utility profile that is in the range associated with widely used cancer therapeutic and supportive care agents. The decision to use (or not use) amifostine in conjunction with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide for women with ovarian cancer should be based on clinical, not economic, considerations.",1998-01-02040,6,Am J Manag Care,C L Bennett,1998,10 / 5,64-72,No,6,"C L Bennett; Cost-utility assessment of amifostine as first-line therapy for ovarian cancer, Am J Manag Care, ; 10(5):1096-1860; 64-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Amifostine pretreatment vs. No amifostine pretreatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,36161,United States,1996,59648.6

850,Cost effectiveness of budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) capsules as maintenance therapy versus no maintenance therapy for ileocaecal Crohn's disease in Sweden,"A decision-analytic model was designed to estimate the associated costs and outcomes of maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease with budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) capsules (Entocort((R)) capsules, Astra Draco, Lund, Sweden) versus no maintenance therapy. A third-party payer perspective was adopted to compare the direct costs associated with the medication and healthcare resource use for each therapy over a period of 12 four-week cycles. The costs of routine patient care and the consequences of failure, in terms of relapses, acute therapies, hospitalisations and surgery, were included. The outcome was measured as the average number of days in remission per patient per 12-cycle period. Based on the assumptions in the model, the results show that budesonide CIR capsules are associated with a reduction of 16.6 (26%) days in relapse, i.e. a 6% increase in days in remission, over a one-year period compared with no maintenance therapy. Direct healthcare costs are increased by 6% or Swedish kronor (SEK) 1673 ($US1 ~ SEK7.60). Overall, the model shows that there are substantial (non-drug associated) cost offsets from using budesonide CIR capsules as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. These cost offsets, in addition to improvements in patients' well-being and quality of life, indicate that maintenance therapy is cost effective compared with no maintenance therapy. The cost per added day in remission is relatively modest (SEK101 ~ $US13). If indirect costs are added to the calculation, it is realistic to argue that a net saving to society would be most likely.",1998-01-02051,10,Clin Drug Investig,I Noble,1998,15 / 2,123-36,Yes,10,"I Noble; Cost effectiveness of budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) capsules as maintenance therapy versus no maintenance therapy for ileocaecal Crohn's disease in Sweden, Clin Drug Investig, 1998; 15(2):1173-2563; 123-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Budesonide controlled ileal release capsules 6 mg/day as maintenance vs. No active maintenance treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,101394,Sweden,1994,22973.91
852,Temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery with a nondetachable silicone balloon catheter: analysis of technique and cost,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Temporary balloon occlusion has become a routine and medically accepted technique for the management of patients with aneurysms or intracranial or head/neck tumors. We describe our experience using a nondetachable silicone balloon (NDSB) catheter in 103 endovascular temporary balloon occlusions of the internal carotid artery, with attention focused on technique, complications, and cost. METHODS: Between 1993 and 1998, 103 patients underwent preoperative temporary balloon occlusion testing with a 1.5-mm NDSB catheter. Clinical testing during endovascular blockade was combined with qualitative cerebral blood flow analysis using technetium-99m HMPAO SPECT. Cost-effective analysis was performed, emphasizing cost and complication rates in comparison with those in previously reported series in which multiple types of temporary balloon occlusion catheters were used, predominantly not of the NDSB type. RESULTS: No carotid artery injury or complication, including cerebral infarction due to NDSB use, was encountered. Despite the increased cost of the NDSB catheter system, cost-effective analysis showed up to 40% reduction in cost per quality adjusted life years. CONCLUSION: Temporary balloon occlusion using the NDSB catheter is safe and cost-effective, owing to the low rate of complications.",1999-01-02023,10319959,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,P M Meyers,1999,20 / 4,559-64,No,10319959,"P M Meyers; G A Thakur; T A Tomsick; Temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery with a nondetachable silicone balloon catheter: analysis of technique and cost, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, 1999-Apr; 20(4):0195-6108; 559-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Temporary balloon occlution using a nondetachable silicone balloon (NDSB) catheter vs. Least expensive balloon catheter system,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,113,United States,1997,182.22
853,Diagnosis of suspected coronary artery disease in women: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The optimal strategy for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women is not well defined. We compared the cost-effectiveness of several strategies for diagnosing CAD in women with chest pain. METHODS: We performed decision and cost-effectiveness analyses with simulations of 55-year-old ambulatory women with chest pain. With a Markov model, simulations of patients underwent exercise electrocardiography, exercise testing with thallium scintigraphy, exercise echocardiography, angiography, or no workup. RESULTS: Diagnosis with angiography cost less than $17, 000 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with exercise echocardiography if the patient had definite angina and less than $76,000 per life-year if she had probable angina. If she had nonspecific chest pain, diagnosis with exercise echocardiography increased life-years compared with no testing. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of first-line diagnostic strategy for diagnosis of CAD in women varies mostly according to pretest probability of CAD. Diagnosis of coronary artery disease with angiography is cost-effective in 55-year-old women with definite angina. In 55-year-old women with probable angina, diagnosis with angiography would increase quality-adjusted life-years but significantly increase costs.

857,Diagnosis of suspected coronary artery disease in women: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The optimal strategy for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women is not well defined. We compared the cost-effectiveness of several strategies for diagnosing CAD in women with chest pain. METHODS: We performed decision and cost-effectiveness analyses with simulations of 55-year-old ambulatory women with chest pain. With a Markov model, simulations of patients underwent exercise electrocardiography, exercise testing with thallium scintigraphy, exercise echocardiography, angiography, or no workup. RESULTS: Diagnosis with angiography cost less than $17, 000 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with exercise echocardiography if the patient had definite angina and less than $76,000 per life-year if she had probable angina. If she had nonspecific chest pain, diagnosis with exercise echocardiography increased life-years compared with no testing.

862,Screening blood donors for hereditary hemochromatosis: decision analysis model comparing genotyping to phenotyping,"OBJECTIVE: The identification of a gene for hereditary hemochromatosis in 69-100% of typical hemochromatosis patients has resulted in a genotypic test to identify persons with the typical missense mutation. Population screening by genotyping has the potential to reduce screening costs because of a high specificity of the genetic test. METHODS: Decision analysis techniques are used to compare the outcome, utility, and incremental cost savings of a plan to screen voluntary blood donors and their siblings for hemochromatosis using a genotypic test (C282Y mutation) with phenotypic tests (transferrin saturation, serum ferritin). RESULTS: Genotypic screening is less expensive than phenotypic screening only if the cost of the initial genetic test is less than $20. The screening program saves money (dominant strategy) if the cost of the initial genetic test is less than $28. Incremental cost saving declines as the cost of the gene test increases. At a gene test cost of $173, it costs $109,358 to identify a homozygote with potential life-threatening illness. Incremental cost saving also declines as the penetrance of the hemochromatosis gene in the population screened decreases. Phenotypic screening with confirmatory genetic testing results in a cost of $2,711 per homozygote with life-threatening complications. CONCLUSIONS: Population screening programs for hemochromatosis have the potential to save money. Optimal strategies for screening include initial testing for iron overload (phenotyping) with confirmatory genetic testing, or initial genetic testing if the test is less than $28.",1999-01-02026,10364030,Am J Gastroenterol,P C Adams,1999,94 / 6,1593-600,No,10364030,"P C Adams; L S Valberg; Screening blood donors for hereditary hemochromatosis: decision analysis model comparing genotyping to phenotyping, Am J Gastroenterol, 1999-Jun; 94(6):0002-9270; 1593-600",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genotypic screening vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,Not Stated,20042,United States,1995,34036.02
863,Echocardiography in patients with suspected endocarditis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: We sought to determine the appropriate use of echocardiography for patients with suspected endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed a decision tree and Markov model using published data to simulate the outcomes and costs of care for patients with suspected endocarditis. RESULTS: Transesophageal imaging was optimal for patients who had a prior probability of endocarditis that is observed commonly in clinical practice (4% to 60%). In our base-case analysis (a 45-year-old man with a prior probability of endocarditis of 20%), use of transesophageal imaging improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALYs) by 9 days and reduced costs by $18 per person compared with the use of transthoracic echocardiography. Sequential test strategies that reserved the use of transesophageal echocardiography for patients who had an inadequate transthoracic study provided similar QALYs compared with the use of transesophageal echocardiography alone, but cost $230 to $250 more. For patients with prior probabilities of endocarditis greater than 60%, the optimal strategy is to treat for endocarditis without reliance on echocardiography for diagnosis. Patients with a prior probability of less than 2% should receive treatment for bacteremia without imaging. Transthoracic imaging was optimal for only a narrow range of prior probabilities (2% or 3%) of endocarditis. CONCLUSION: The appropriate use of echocardiography depends on the prior probability of endocarditis.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of cardioversion, with or without antiarrhythmic agents, with that of rate control plus warfarin or aspirin. DESIGN: A Markov decision-analytic model was designed to simulate long-term health and economic outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Published literature and hospital accounting information. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with different baseline risks for stroke. TIME HORIZON: 3 months. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Therapeutic strategies using different combinations of cardioversion alone, cardioversion plus amiodarone or quinidine therapy, and rate control with antithrombotic treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Strategies involving cardioversion alone were more effective and less costly than those not involving this option. For patients at high risk for ischemic stroke (5.3% per year), cardioversion alone followed by repeated cardioversion plus amiodarone therapy on relapse was most cost-effective ($9300 per QALY) compared with cardioversion alone followed by warfarin therapy on relapse. This strategy was also preferred for the moderate-risk cohort (3.6% per year), but the benefit was more expensive ($18,900 per QALY).

882,Cost-effectiveness of cardioversion and antiarrhythmic therapy in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Physicians managing patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation must consider the risks, benefits, and costs of treatments designed to restore and maintain sinus rhythm compared with those of rate control with antithrombotic prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of cardioversion, with or without antiarrhythmic agents, with that of rate control plus warfarin or aspirin. DESIGN: A Markov decision-analytic model was designed to simulate long-term health and economic outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Published literature and hospital accounting information. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with different baseline risks for stroke. TIME HORIZON: 3 months. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Therapeutic strategies using different combinations of cardioversion alone, cardioversion plus amiodarone or quinidine therapy, and rate control with antithrombotic treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Strategies involving cardioversion alone were more effective and less costly than those not involving this option. For patients at high risk for ischemic stroke (5.3% per year), cardioversion alone followed by repeated cardioversion plus amiodarone therapy on relapse was most cost-effective ($9300 per QALY) compared with cardioversion alone followed by warfarin therapy on relapse. This strategy was also preferred for the moderate-risk cohort (3.6% per year), but the benefit was more expensive ($18,900 per QALY). In the lowest-risk cohort (1.6% per year), cardioversion alone followed by aspirin therapy on relapse was optimal. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The choice of optimal strategy and incremental cost-effectiveness was substantially influenced by the baseline risk for stroke, rate of stroke in sinus rhythm, efficacy of warfarin, and costs and utilities for long-term warfarin and amiodarone therapy.

Home sleep studies can be performed at lower cost, but results are somewhat less reliable. Bedside diagnosis of OSAS without any testing has also been discussed. OBJECTIVE: To model the costs and utility of laboratory polysomnography, home study, and no testing during the 5 years after initial evaluation for OSAS. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published data. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of persons suspected of having OSAS. TIME HORIZON: The 5 years after initial evaluation for OSAS. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Nasal continuous positive airway pressure when OSAS was diagnosed. MEASUREMENTS: Quality of life, survival and charges (as proxies for costs) for each diagnostic method. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Under almost all modeled conditions, polysomnography provided maximal quality-adjusted life-years in the 5 years after the initial diagnostic evaluation. The incremental charges for polysomnography over home study or no testing were about $13,400 and $9200, respectively, per quality-adjusted life-year gained during this period.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of the accuracy of alternative diagnostic tests plus decision analysis to assess the health outcomes and costs of alternative diagnostic strategies for patients at intermediate pretest risk for coronary disease. DATA SOURCES: Studies of test accuracy that met inclusion criteria; published information on treatment effectiveness and disease prevalence. TARGET POPULATION: Men and women 45, 55, and 65 years of age with a 25% to 75% pretest risk for coronary disease. TIME HORIZON: 30 years. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic strategies were initial angiography and initial testing with one of five noninvasive tests--exercise treadmill testing, planar thallium imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), stress echocardiography, and positron emission tomography (PET)--followed by coronary angiography if noninvasive test results were positive.

INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic strategies were initial angiography and initial testing with one of five noninvasive tests--exercise treadmill testing, planar thallium imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), stress echocardiography, and positron emission tomography (PET)--followed by coronary angiography if noninvasive test results were positive. Testing was followed by observation, medical treatment, or revascularization. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and costs per QALY. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Life expectancy varied little with the initial diagnostic test; for a 55-year-old man, the best-performing test increased life expectancy by 7 more days than the worst-performing test. More sensitive tests increased QALYs more. Echocardiography improved health outcomes and reduced costs relative to stress testing and planar thallium imaging. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $75,000/QALY for SPECT relative to echocardiography and was greater than $640,000 for PET relative to SPECT. Compared with SPECT, immediate angiography had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $94,000/QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Qualitative findings varied little with age, sex, pretest probability of disease, or the test indeterminancy rate. Results varied most with sensitivity to severe coronary disease. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography, SPECT, and immediate angiography are cost-effective alternatives to PET and other diagnostic approaches.

894,Cost-effectiveness of alternative test strategies for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease,"BACKGROUND: The appropriate roles for several diagnostic tests for coronary disease are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to diagnosis of coronary disease. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of the accuracy of alternative diagnostic tests plus decision analysis to assess the health outcomes and costs of alternative diagnostic strategies for patients at intermediate pretest risk for coronary disease.

895,Cost-effectiveness of transesophageal echocardiography to determine the duration of therapy for intravascular catheter-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia,"BACKGROUND: The appropriate duration of therapy for catheter-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is controversial. Conventional practice dictates that all patients receive prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics. Some clinicians recommend abbreviated therapeutic courses, but an alternate approach involves prospectively identifying patients for whom abbreviated therapy is appropriate. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in establishing duration of therapy for catheter-associated S. aureus bacteremia. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search of literature; clinical data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia (n = 196) and patients with endocarditis (n = 60); and costs obtained from the study institution, regional home health agency, and national estimates of professional and technical fees. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with catheter-associated S. aureus bacteremia on native heart valves without intravenous drug use or clinically apparent metastatic infection, immunosuppression, or indwelling prosthetic devices. TIME HORIZON: Patient lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment based on TEE results compared with 2- or 4-week empirical therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with empirical short-course therapy, the TEE strategy cost $4938 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The effectiveness of the TEE strategy and the effectiveness of the long-course strategy were sufficiently similar that the additional cost of empirical long-course therapy ($1,667,971 per QALY) was higher than that which society usually considers cost-effective. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: In a four-way sensitivity analysis (endocarditis prevalence, TEE cost, short-course relapse rate, and TEE specificity), compared with empirical short-course therapy, the TEE strategy results ranged from cost savings to $155,624 per QALY.

897,Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for patients with chest pain,"BACKGROUND: Many noninvasive tests exist to determine whether patients should undergo coronary angiography. The routine use of coronary angiography without previous noninvasive testing is typically not advocated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for patients with chest pain. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published data. TARGET POPULATION: Patients who present with chest pain, have no history of myocardial infarction, and are able to perform an exercise stress test. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: No testing, exercise electrocardiography, exercise echocardiography, exercise single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and coronary angiography alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of routine coronary angiography compared with exercise echocardiography was $36,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved for 55-year-old men with typical angina. For 55-year-old men with atypical angina, exercise echocardiography compared with exercise electrocardiography cost $41,900 per QALY saved. If adequate exercise echocardiography was not available, exercise SPECT cost $54,800 per QALY saved compared with exercise electrocardiography for these patients. For 55-year-old men with nonspecific chest pain, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of exercise electrocardiography compared with no testing was $57,700 per QALY saved. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: On the basis of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there is a 75% chance that exercise echocardiography costs less than $50,900 per QALY saved for 55-year-old men with atypical angina.
