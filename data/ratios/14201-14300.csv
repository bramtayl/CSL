14201,Economic analysis of rapid and sensitive polymerase chain reaction testing in the emergency department for influenza infections in children,"BACKGROUND: Rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays simultaneously detect several respiratory viral pathogens with high sensitivity. Maximizing detection of influenza at the point of care has the potential to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, laboratory tests and hospitalizations. However, the cost-effectiveness of rapid multiplex PCR assays for influenza has not been compared with other diagnostic methods in children. METHODS: For children presenting to the emergency department with influenza-like illness, we compared costs and outcomes using 4 different testing strategies for detection of influenza: (1) a rapid multiplex PCR platform (FilmArray); (2) traditional PCR; (3) direct-fluorescent antibody and (4) rapid antigen tests. Costs were assessed from the hospital perspective, and effectiveness was defined as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Input parameters were obtained from previous studies, and the model was run separately for children aged 3-36 months and 3-18 years. RESULTS: Rapid multiplex PCR testing was the most effective testing strategy for children in both age groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness when compared with rapid antigen tests was $115,556 per QALY for children aged 3-36 months and from $228,000 per QALY for children aged 3-18 years. The cost-effectiveness of rapid multiplex PCR was sensitive to estimates for influenza prevalence, the proportion of patients treated with antivirals and the cost per test. CONCLUSIONS: Our model identifies scenarios in which identification of influenza in the emergency department using rapid multiplex PCR testing is a cost-effective strategy for infants and children 3 months through 18 years.

14207,Cost-utility analysis of percutaneous mitral valve repair in inoperable patients with functional mitral regurgitation in German settings,"BACKGROUND: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR) using Carillon(R) Mitral Contour System(R) (Cardiac Dimensions Inc., Kirkland, WA, USA) in patients with congestive heart failure accompanied by moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) compared to the prolongation of optimal medical treatment (OMT). METHODS: Cost-utility analysis using a combination of a decision tree and Markov process was performed. The clinical effectiveness was determined based on the results of the Transcatheter Implantation of Carillon Mitral Annuloplasty Device (TITAN) trial. The mean age of the target population was 62 years, 77% of the patients were males, 64% of the patients had severe FMR and all patients had New York Heart Association functional class III. The epidemiological, cost and utility data were derived from the literature. The analysis was performed from the German statutory health insurance perspective over 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Over 10 years, the total cost was euro36,785 in the PMVR arm and euro18,944 in the OMT arm. However, PMVR provided additional benefits to patients with an 1.15 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and an 1.41 incremental life years. The percutaneous procedure was cost-effective in comparison to OMT with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro15,533/QALY. Results were robust in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis with a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro35,000/QALY, PMVR had a 84 % probability of being cost-effective.

14208,Hepatitis B virus screening before adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Most patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) have no symptoms, and many are unaware of the infection. However, HBV can reactivate with immunosuppression; chemotherapy causes reactivation in 22 % of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients. HBV reactivation can be fatal. HBV reactivation can be prevented, provided that HBV is recognized prior to chemotherapy. The objective of this study is to estimate the health and economic effects of HBV screening strategies in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. We developed a state-transition microsimulation model to examine the cost-effectiveness of three HBV screening strategies: (1) ""No screening""; (2) ""Screen-and-Treat to prevent reactivation"" (screen-all) with either lamivudine/tenofovir (LAM/TDF) or entecavir (ETV); and (3) ""Screen-and-Treat high-risk only"" (screen-HR) and treat with either LAM/TDF or ETV. Model data were obtained from the published literature. We used a payer's perspective, a lifetime horizon, and a 5 % discount rate for the analysis. ""Screen-all"" would prevent at least 38 severe reactivations per 100,000 persons screened over the lifetime of the cohort. ""Screen-all"" was associated with an increase of 0.0034-0.0035 QALYs and an additional cost of C$164-C$266 per person, which translated into an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of C$47,808/QALY-C$76,527/QALY gained compared with ""No screening"" depending on the antiviral therapy received.

14212,Cost-effectiveness analysis of axitinib through a probabilistic decision model,"INTRODUCTION: The Oncology field is characterised by a steady increase in demand and a consistent launching of innovative and expensive products. Therefore, cost-effectiveness analysis can contribute as a significant decision-making tool by elucidating the most economically efficient ways to satisfy compelling health needs. AREAS COVERED: The scope of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of axitinib versus sorafenib, for the second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. A literature review for evidence synthesis was performed and a probabilistic Markov Model was employed to simulate disease progression. This study will also assess Value of Information. EXPERT OPINION: Compared to sorafenib, axitinib resulted in an incremental cost of 87,936 euro per quality adjusted life year.

14213,Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of solifenacin and oral controlled adsorption system formulation of tamsulosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia,"BACKGROUND: Storage symptoms, associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), often co-exist with voiding symptoms in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Storage symptoms are likely to be most bothersome, and may not be adequately resolved by treatment with alpha-blocker or antimuscarinic monotherapy. A recent randomised controlled phase 3 trial (NEPTUNE) demonstrated that a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of solifenacin 6 mg plus an oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) formulation of tamsulosin (TOCAS, 0.4 mg) improved storage symptoms, as well as quality of life, compared with TOCAS alone in men with moderate-to-severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms. This analysis aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a FDC tablet of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS relative to tolterodine plus tamsulosin given concomitantly, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model was developed for men aged >/=45 years with LUTS/BPH who have moderate-to-severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms. The model calculated cost-effectiveness over an analytical time horizon of 1 year and estimated total treatment costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The FDC tablet of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS was associated with lower total annual costs ( pound860 versus pound959) and increased QALYs (0.839 versus 0.836), and was therefore dominant compared with tolterodine plus tamsulosin. Time horizon, discontinuation or withdrawal rates, drug cost and utility values were the main drivers of cost-effectiveness. The probability that the FDC tablet of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS is cost-effective was 100% versus tolterodine plus tamsulosin, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The FDC tablet of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS provides important clinical benefits and is a cost-effective treatment strategy in the UK NHS compared with tolterodine plus tamsulosin for men with both storage and voiding LUTS/BPH.",2015-01-18114,25956727,BMC Urol,Jameel Nazir,2015,15 /,41,No,25956727,"Jameel Nazir; Lars Heemstra; Anke van Engen; Zalmai Hakimi; Cristina Ivanescu; Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of solifenacin and oral controlled adsorption system formulation of tamsulosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, BMC Urol, 2015; 15():1471-2490; 41",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fixed-dose combination tablet solifenacin 6 mg + oral controlled absorption system formulation of tamsulosin vs. Tolterodine + tamsulosin,moderate-to-severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms,Not Stated,45 Years,Male,Full,"1 Year, 3, 5, and 10 years",3.50,3.50,-24750,United Kingdom,2013,-43009.63
14214,Cost-utility of cognitive behavioral therapy for low back pain from the commercial payer perspective,"STUDY DESIGN: Markov cost-utility model. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of persistent nonspecific low back pain (LBP) from the perspective of US commercial payers. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CBT is widely deemed clinically effective for LBP treatment. The evidence is suggestive of cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We constructed and validated a Markov intention-to-treat model to estimate the cost-utility of CBT, with 1-year and 10-year time horizons. We applied likelihood of improvement and utilities from a randomized controlled trial assessing CBT to treat LBP. The trial randomized subjects to treatment but subjects freely sought health care services. We derived the cost of equivalent rates and types of services from US commercial claims for LBP for a similar population. For the 10-year estimates, we derived recurrence rates from the literature. The base case included medical and pharmaceutical services and assumed gradual loss of skill in applying CBT techniques. Sensitivity analyses assessed the distribution of service utilization, utility values, and rate of LBP recurrence. We compared health plan designs. Results are based on 5000 iterations of each model and expressed as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: The incremental cost-utility of CBT was $7197 per quality-adjusted life-year in the first year and $5855 per quality-adjusted life-year over 10 years. The results are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. No change of parameter estimate resulted in a difference of more than 7% from the base case for either time horizon. Including chiropractic and/or acupuncture care did not substantively affect cost-effectiveness. The model with medical but no pharmaceutical costs was more cost-effective ($5238 for 1 yr and $3849 for 10 yr). CONCLUSION: CBT is a cost-effective approach to manage chronic LBP among commercial health plans members. Cost-effectiveness is demonstrated for multiple plan designs.

METHODS: The Cardiff Model was used to simulate disease progression and estimate the long-term effect of treatments on patients. Systematic literature reviews and hospital surveys were conducted to obtain patients profiles, clinical data, and costs. Health insurance costs (2014 yen) were estimated over a 40-year period. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: SAXA + MET had lower predicted incidences of cardiovascular and hypoglycemia events and a decreased total cost compared with GLI + MET ( yen241,072,807 vs yen285,455,177). There were increased numbers of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 1.01/patient) and life-years (Lys; 0.03/patient) gained with SAXA + MET compared with GLI + MET, and the incremental cost of SAXA + MET vs GLI + MET (- yen44,382) resulted in - yen43,883/QALY and - yen1,710,926/LY gained with SAXA + MET. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the results were robust. CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM in China, SAXA + MET was more cost-effective and was well tolerated with fewer adverse effects (AEs) compared with GLI + MET.

14216,Incorporating ulipristal acetate in the care of symptomatic uterine fibroids: a Canadian cost-utility analysis of pharmacotherapy management,"OBJECTIVE: To present a Canadian economic evaluation on the cost-utility of ulipristal acetate (5 mg orally daily) compared to leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg intramuscular monthly) in the treatment of moderate-to-severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in women eligible for surgery. METHODS: A probabilistic decision tree was constructed to model the pre-operative pharmacological management of uterine fibroids under the primary perspective of the Ontario public payer. The model parameterized data from clinical trials, observational studies, and public costing databases. The outcome measure was the incremental cost-utility ratio. Uncertainty in the model was explored through sensitivity and scenario analyses. RESULTS: Ulipristal was associated with faster control of excessive menstrual bleeding, fewer symptoms of hot flashes and lower health care resource consumption. The ulipristal strategy dominated leuprolide as it provided patients with more quality-adjusted life years (0.177 versus 0.165) at a lower cost ($1,273 versus $1,366). Across a range of sensitivity analyses, the results remained robust except to the dose of the comparator drug. If leuprolide was administered at 11.25 mg, once every 3 months, the expected cost for the leuprolide strategy would decline and the associated incremental cost-utility ratio for ulipristal would be $168/quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION: Ulipristal offers a unique opportunity to effectively and rapidly control menstrual bleeding in patients with uterine fibroids; thereby improving their quality of life while minimizing the probability of moderate-to-severe hot flashes that are common with leuprolide. The current economic analysis suggests that ulipristal remains the dominant strategy across extensive sensitivity analyses.",2015-01-18129,25945062,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Bernice Tsoi,2015,7 /,213-25,No,25945062,"Bernice Tsoi; Gord Blackhouse; Simon Ferrazzi; Clare J Reade; Innie Chen; Ron Goeree; Incorporating ulipristal acetate in the care of symptomatic uterine fibroids: a Canadian cost-utility analysis of pharmacotherapy management, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 7():1178-6981; 213-25",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ulipristal acetate (5 mg orally daily) vs. Leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg intramuscular monthly),eligible for surgery,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-7678.33,Canada,2013,-8285.09
14217,The cost-effectiveness of initiating ranibizumab therapy in eyes with neovascular AMD with good vision: an economic model using real-world outcomes,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immediate treatment with ranibizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) with good (better than 6/12) starting visual acuity compared with current UK clinical guidance of waiting until vision falls below 6/12 to begin treatment, using real-world outcomes data. DESIGN: A patient-level health economic state transition model based on levels of visual acuity in the better seeing eye was constructed to simulate the costs and consequences of treating patients with nAMD with ranibizumab. SETTING: The model took the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). PARTICIPANTS: The model was populated with real-world outcomes and resource use from a prospective multicentre national nAMD database study containing 92,976 ranibizumab treatment episodes. INTERVENTIONS: Two treatment approaches were compared: immediate intervention with 0.5 mg ranibizumab pro re nata, PRN (on detection of nAMD) or delayed intervention (waiting until vision fell to 6/12 before beginning treatment). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for health states and healthcare costs were accrued for each strategy, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were employed to test the uncertainty of the model. RESULTS: Over a 2-year time horizon, based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the early treatment arm accumulated 1.59 QALYs and pound8469.79 cost. The delayed treatment arm accumulated 1.35 QALYs and pound7460.21 cost. The central ICER estimate was pound4251.60. CONCLUSIONS: A model based on real-world data is likely to be a realistic reflection of the health gains and resource use of ranibizumab for nAMD in the UK NHS.

This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of (90)Y-resin microspheres compared to best supportive care (BSC) from a UK perspective. METHODS: Survival data from a comparative retrospective cohort study was analyzed and used in a state-transition cost-effectiveness model, using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as the measure of effectiveness. The model incorporated costs for the SIRT procedure, monitoring, further treatment, adverse events, and death. Utility values, reflecting patient quality-of-life, were taken from a published source. RESULTS: SIRT using (90)Y-resin microspheres compared to BSC improved overall survival by a mean of 1.12 life years and resulted in a cost per QALY gained of pound28,216. In sensitivity analysis, this varied between pound25,015- pound28,817.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a decision model to evaluate NGS panel testing compared with current standard of care in patients referred to a cancer genetics clinic. We obtained data on the prevalence of genetic variants from a large academic laboratory and calculated the costs and health benefits of identifying relatives with a pathogenic variant, in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We classified the CRCP syndromes according to their type of inheritance and penetrance of colorectal cancer. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: Evaluation with an NGS panel that included Lynch syndrome genes and other genes associated with highly penetrant CRCP syndromes led to an average increase of 0.151 year of life, 0.128 QALY, and $4,650 per patient, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,500 per QALY compared with standard care and a 99% probability that this panel was cost effective at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. When compared with this panel, the addition of genes with low colorectal cancer penetrance resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $77,300 per QALY.

RESULTS: Evaluation with an NGS panel that included Lynch syndrome genes and other genes associated with highly penetrant CRCP syndromes led to an average increase of 0.151 year of life, 0.128 QALY, and $4,650 per patient, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,500 per QALY compared with standard care and a 99% probability that this panel was cost effective at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. When compared with this panel, the addition of genes with low colorectal cancer penetrance resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $77,300 per QALY.

14227,Early stage cost-effectiveness analysis of a BRCA1-like test to detect triple negative breast cancers responsive to high dose alkylating chemotherapy,"PURPOSE: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) with a BRCA1-like profile may benefit from high dose alkylating chemotherapy (HDAC). This study examines whether BRCA1-like testing to target effective HDAC in TNBC patients can be more cost-effective than treating all patients with standard chemotherapy. Additionally, we estimated the minimum required prevalence of BRCA1-like and the required positive predictive value (PPV) for a BRCA1-like test to become cost-effective. METHODS: Our Markov model compared 1) the incremental costs; 2) the incremental number of respondents; 3) the incremental number of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs); and 4) the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of treating TNBC women with personalized HDAC based on BRCA1-like testing vs. standard chemotherapy, from a Dutch societal perspective and a 20-year time horizon, using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we performed one-way sensitivity analysis (SA) to all model parameters, and two-way SA to prevalence and PPV. Data were obtained from a current trial (NCT01057069), published literature and expert opinions. RESULTS: BRCA1-like testing to target effective HDAC would presently not be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro80.000/QALY (euro81.981/QALY). SAs show that PPV drives the ICER changes. Lower bounds for the prevalence and the PPV were found to be 58.5% and 73.0% respectively. CONCLUSION: BRCA1-like testing to target effective HDAC treatment in TNBC patients is currently not cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of euro80.000/QALY, but it can be when a minimum PPV of 73% is obtained in clinical practice.

DESIGN: Value-Based Medicine (Center for Value-Based Medicine, Flourtown, PA) 14-year, cost-utility analysis using patient preferences and 2012 United States real dollars. PARTICIPANTS: Published data from the identical Ranibizumab Injection in Subjects with Clinically Significant Macular Edema with Center Involvement Secondary to Diabetes Mellitus (RISE and RIDE) clinical trials. METHODS: An incremental cost-utility analysis was performed using societal and third-party insurer cost perspectives. Costs and outcomes were discounted with net present value analysis at 3% per annum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental comparative effectiveness was measured in: (1) quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain and (2) percent patient value (quality-of-life) gain. Cost effectiveness was quantified with the cost-utility ratio (CUR) measured as $/QALY. RESULTS: The 14-year, incremental patient value gain conferred by intravitreal ranibizumab therapy for diabetic maculopathy was 0.9981 QALY, equating to an 11.6% improvement in quality of life. The direct, ophthalmic medical cost for ranibizumab therapy in 1 eye was $30 116, whereas for 2 eyes it was $56 336. The direct, nonophthalmic, medical costs saved from decreased depression, injury, skilled nursing facility admissions, nursing home admissions, and other vision-associated costs totaled $51 758, resulting in an overall direct medical cost of $4578. The net mean societal cost for bilateral ranibizumab therapy was -$30 807. Of this total, decreased caregiver costs accrued a $31 406 savings against the direct medical costs, whereas decreased wage losses accrued a $3978 savings. The third-party insurer CUR for bilateral ranibizumab therapy was $4587/QALY. The societal cost perspective for bilateral therapy was -$30 807/QALY, indicating that ranibizumab therapy dominated sham therapy because it conferred both a positive QALY gain of 0.9981 and a financial value gain (positive financial return on investment) of $30 807 referent to the direct ophthalmic medical costs expended.

14231,Cost-effectiveness of DTG + ABC/3TC versus EFV/TDF/FTC for first-line treatment of HIV-1 in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Data from the SINGLE trial demonstrated that 88% of treatment-naive HIV-1 patients treated with dolutegravir and abacavir/lamivudine (DTG + ABC/3TC) achieved viral suppression at 48 weeks compared with 81% of patients treated with efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC). It is unclear how this difference in short-term efficacy impacts long-term cost-effectiveness of these regimens. This study sought to evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness of DTG + ABC/3TC vs EFV/TDF/FTC from a US payer perspective. METHODS: This study is an individual discrete-event simulation which tracked the disease status and treatment pathway of HIV-1 patients. The model simulated treatment over a lifetime horizon by tracking change in patients' CD4 count, clinical events occurrence (opportunistic infections, cancer, and cardiovascular events), treatment switch, and death. The model included up to four lines of treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, efficacy, and safety of DTG + ABC/3TC and EFV/TDF/FTC were informed by data from the SINGLE trial. The efficacy of subsequent treatment lines, clinical event risks, mortality, cost, and utility inputs were based on literature and expert opinion. Outcomes were lifetime discounted medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC increased lifetime costs by $19,153 and per person survival by 0.12 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $158,890/QALY. ICERs comparing DTG + ABC/3TC to EFV/TDF/FTC remained above the traditional, US willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained in all scenarios, and above $100,000 or $150,000/QALY gained in most scenarios. LIMITATIONS: Due to data limitations, the treatment patterns, CD4 count during viral rebound and treatment switch, viral rebound after trial end, and long-term adverse event-related treatment discontinuation were based on assumptions, presented to and approved by clinical experts. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC resulted in higher cost and only slightly increased QALYs over a lifetime, with an ICER that exceeded the standard cost-effectiveness threshold.

14235,Cost-effectiveness of prucalopride in the treatment of chronic constipation in the Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of prucalopride vs. continued laxative treatment for chronic constipation in patients in the Netherlands in whom laxatives have failed to provide adequate relief. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of prucalopride in patients with chronic constipation receiving standard laxative treatment from the perspective of Dutch payers in 2011. Data sources included published prucalopride clinical trials, published Dutch price/tariff lists, and national population statistics. The model simulated the clinical and economic outcomes associated with prucalopride vs. standard treatment and had a cycle length of 1 month and a follow-up time of 1 year. Response to treatment was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved ""normal bowel function"". One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the base case. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the cost of prucalopride relative to continued laxative treatment was euro 9015 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses confirmed that the base case cost-effectiveness estimate was robust. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the model was most sensitive in response to prucalopride; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from euro 6475 to 15,380 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that there is a greater than 80% probability that prucalopride would be cost-effective compared with continued standard treatment, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro 20,000 per QALY from a Dutch societal perspective. A scenario analysis was performed for women only, which resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 7773 per QALY.

14236,Cost Effectiveness of Sequencing 34 Cancer-Associated Genes as an Aid for Treatment Selection in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 34 cancer-associated genes would cost-effectively aid in the treatment selection for patients with metastatic melanoma, compared with a single-site BRAF V600 mutation test. METHODS: A decision model was developed to estimate the costs and health outcomes of the two test strategies. The cost effectiveness of these two strategies was analyzed from a payer perspective over a 2-year time horizon with model parameters taken from the literature. RESULTS: In the base case, the gene sequencing panel strategy resulted in a cost of US$120,022 and 0.721 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, whereas the single-site mutation test strategy resulted in a cost of US$128,965 and 0.704 QALYs. Thus, the gene sequencing panel strategy cost US$8943 less per patient and increased QALYs by 0.0174 per patient. Sensitivity analyses showed that, compared with the single-site mutation test strategy, the gene sequencing panel strategy had a 90.9% chance of having reduced costs and increased QALYs, with the cost of the gene sequencing panel test having minimal effect on the incremental cost. CONCLUSION: Compared with the single-site mutation test, the use of an NGS panel of 34 cancer-associated genes as an aid in selecting therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma reduced costs and increased QALYs. If the base-case results were applied to the 8900 patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in the USA each year, the gene sequencing panel strategy could result in an annual savings of US$79.6 million and a gain of 155 QALYs.",2015-01-18170,25926090,Mol Diagn Ther,Yonghong Li,2015,19 / 3,169-77,No,25926090,"Yonghong Li; Lance A Bare; Richard A Bender; John J Sninsky; Leslie S Wilson; James J Devlin; Frederic M Waldman; Cost Effectiveness of Sequencing 34 Cancer-Associated Genes as an Aid for Treatment Selection in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma, Mol Diagn Ther, 2015 Jun; 19(3):1177-1062; 169-77",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Next-generation sequencing (ngs) panel of 34 cancer-associated genes paired with personalized therapy vs. Single-site BRAF V600 mutation test with vermurafenib or ipilimumab therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-513965.5,United States,2013,-571006.34
14237,Cost-effectiveness of para-aortic lymphadenectomy before chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nodal staging surgery before chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer in the era of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). METHODS: A modified Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of para-aortic staging surgery before definite CRT when no uptake is recorded in the para-aortic lymph nodes (PALN) on PET/CT. Survival and complication rates were estimated based on the published literature. Cost data were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Strategies were compared using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed, including estimates for the performance of PET/CT, postoperative complication rate, and varying survival rates according to the radiation field. RESULTS: We compared two strategies: strategy 1, pelvic CRT for all patients; and strategy 2, nodal staging surgery followed by extended-field CRT when PALN metastasis was found and pelvic CRT otherwise. The ICER for strategy 2 compared to strategy 1 was $19,505 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Under deterministic sensitivity analyses, the model was relatively sensitive to survival reduction in patients who undergo pelvic CRT alone despite having occult PALN metastasis. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the case results, with a 91% probability of cost-effectiveness at the willingness-to-pay thresholds of $60,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: Nodal staging surgery before definite CRT may be cost-effective when PET/CT imaging shows no evidence of PALN metastasis.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this method for cervical screening, comparing five ploidy strategies (using different numbers of aneuploid cells as cut points) with liquid-based Papanicolaou smear and no screening. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model simulated the natural history of HPV infection and possible progression into cervical neoplasia in a cohort of 12-year-old females.

Outcomes modeled were the incidence of MDR-TB, MDR-TB with FQN resistance, TB-related death, quality-adjusted life years, and health system costs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: FQN preventive therapy resulted in health system savings, lower incidence of MDR-TB, and lower mortality than no treatment. We found the incidence of MDR-TB with acquired FQN resistance would also be lower with FQN therapy of infected contacts. CONCLUSIONS: In our model, FQN preventive therapy resulted in substantial health system savings and in reduced mortality, incidence of MDR-TB, and incidence of acquired FQN-resistant disease as well as improved quality of life. FQN therapy remained cost saving with improved outcomes even if the effectiveness of therapy in preventing MDR-TB was as low as 10%.",2015-01-18205,25915791,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,Gregory J Fox,2015,192 / 2,229-37,No,25915791,"Gregory J Fox; Olivia Oxlade; Dick Menzies; Fluoroquinolone Therapy for the Prevention of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Contacts.

14248,Health and economic impacts of eight different dietary salt reduction interventions,"BACKGROUND: Given the high importance of dietary sodium (salt) as a global disease risk factor, our objective was to compare the impact of eight sodium reduction interventions, including feasible and more theoretical ones, to assist prioritisation. METHODS: Epidemiological modelling and cost-utility analysis were performed using a Markov macro-simulation model. The setting was New Zealand (NZ) (2.3 million citizens, aged 35+ years) which has detailed individual-level administrative cost data. RESULTS: Of the most feasible interventions, the largest health gains were from (in descending order): (i) mandatory 25% reduction in sodium levels in all processed foods; (ii) the package of interventions performed in the United Kingdom (UK); (iii) mandatory 25% reduction in sodium levels in bread, processed meats and sauces; (iv) media campaign (as per a previous UK one); (v) voluntary food labelling as currently used in NZ; (vi) dietary counselling as currently used in NZ. Even larger health gains came from the more theoretical options of a ""sinking lid"" on the amount of food salt released to the national market to achieve an average adult intake of 2300 mg sodium/day (211,000 QALYs gained, 95% uncertainty interval: 170,000-255,000), and from a salt tax. All the interventions produced net cost savings (except counseling--albeit still cost-effective). Cost savings were especially large with the sinking lid (NZ$ 1.1 billion, US$ 0.7 billion).

14256,A model-based assessment of the cost-utility of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Individuals with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian and other cancers. Lynch syndrome remains underdiagnosed in the UK. Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients is proposed as a method to identify more families affected by Lynch syndrome and offer surveillance to reduce cancer risks, although cost-effectiveness is viewed as a barrier to implementation. The objective of this project was to estimate the cost-utility of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in individuals with early-onset colorectal cancer in the NHS. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed which simulated diagnostic and long-term outcomes over a lifetime horizon for colorectal cancer patients with and without Lynch syndrome and for relatives of those patients. Nine diagnostic strategies were modelled which included microsatellite instability (MSI) testing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), BRAF mutation testing (methylation testing in a scenario analysis), diagnostic mutation testing and Amsterdam II criteria. Biennial colonoscopic surveillance was included for individuals diagnosed with Lynch syndrome and accepting surveillance. Prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (H-BSO) was similarly included for women diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. Costs from NHS and Personal Social Services perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated and discounted at 3.5% per annum. RESULTS: All strategies included for the identification of Lynch syndrome were cost-effective versus no testing. The strategy with the greatest net health benefit was MSI followed by BRAF followed by diagnostic genetic testing, costing pound5,491 per QALY gained over no testing. The effect of prophylactic H-BSO on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is uncertain and could outweigh the health benefits of testing, resulting in overall QALY loss. CONCLUSIONS: Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients is predicted to be a cost-effective use of limited financial resources in England and Wales.

14259,A model-based assessment of the cost-utility of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Individuals with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian and other cancers. Lynch syndrome remains underdiagnosed in the UK. Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer patients is proposed as a method to identify more families affected by Lynch syndrome and offer surveillance to reduce cancer risks, although cost-effectiveness is viewed as a barrier to implementation. The objective of this project was to estimate the cost-utility of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in individuals with early-onset colorectal cancer in the NHS. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed which simulated diagnostic and long-term outcomes over a lifetime horizon for colorectal cancer patients with and without Lynch syndrome and for relatives of those patients. Nine diagnostic strategies were modelled which included microsatellite instability (MSI) testing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), BRAF mutation testing (methylation testing in a scenario analysis), diagnostic mutation testing and Amsterdam II criteria. Biennial colonoscopic surveillance was included for individuals diagnosed with Lynch syndrome and accepting surveillance. Prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (H-BSO) was similarly included for women diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. Costs from NHS and Personal Social Services perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated and discounted at 3.5% per annum. RESULTS: All strategies included for the identification of Lynch syndrome were cost-effective versus no testing.

14264,Economic evaluation of hormonal therapies for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitor (ai) therapy has been subjected to numerous cost-effectiveness analyses. However, with most ais having reached the end of patent protection and with maturation of the clinical trials data, a re-analysis of ai cost-effectiveness and a consideration of ai use as part of sequential therapy is desirable. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 5-year upfront and sequential tamoxifen (tam) and ai hormonal strategies currently used for treating patients with estrogen receptor (er)-positive early breast cancer. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis used a Markov model that took a Canadian health system perspective with a lifetime time horizon. The base case involved 65-year-old women with er-positive early breast cancer. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to incorporate parameter uncertainties. An expected-value-of-perfect-information test was performed to identify future research directions. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) and costs. RESULTS: The sequential tam-ai strategy was less costly than the other strategies, but less effective than upfront ai and more effective than upfront tam. Upfront ai was more effective and less costly than upfront tam because of less breast cancer recurrence and differences in adverse events. In an exploratory analysis that included a sequential ai-tam strategy, ai-tam dominated based on small numerical differences unlikely to be clinically significant; that strategy was thus not used in the base-case analysis.

This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the company and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC) final decision in October 2014. The clinical evidence for dabrafenib was derived from an ongoing phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BREAK-3) involving 230 patients randomized 2:1 to receive either dabrafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) was reported in the dabrafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. Vemurafenib is considered a more appropriate comparator than is dacarbazine. The clinical evidence for vemurafenib was derived from a completed phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BRIM-3) involving 675 patients randomized 1:1 to receive either vemurafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median PFS and OS was reported in the vemurafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. As there is no direct evidence comparing dabrafenib versus vemurafenib, the company presented an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that demonstrated no statistical differences between dabrafenib and vemurafenib for PFS or OS. The ERG expressed concerns with the ITC, mainly in relation to the validity of the assumptions underpinning the methodology; the ERG concluded this resulted in findings that are unlikely to be robust or reliable. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are both available to patients treated by the National Health Service (NHS) in England via a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) in which the costs of the drugs are discounted. Using these discounted costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) generated by the company were pound60,980 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and pound11,046 per QALY gained for dabrafenib versus vemurafenib.

14268,Cost-effectiveness analysis of quadrivalent influenza vaccination in at-risk adults and the elderly: an updated analysis in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To update an earlier evaluation estimating the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccination (QIV) compared with trivalent influenza vaccination (TIV) in the adult population currently recommended for influenza vaccination in the UK (all people aged >/=65 years and people aged 18-64 years with clinical risk conditions). METHODS: This analysis takes into account updated vaccine prices, reference costs, influenza strain circulation, and burden of illness data. A lifetime, multi-cohort, static Markov model was constructed with seven age groups. The model was run in 1-year cycles for a lifetime, i.e., until the youngest patients at entry reached the age of 100 years. The base-case analysis was from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, with a secondary analysis from the societal perspective. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Herd effects were not included. Inputs were derived from systematic reviews, peer-reviewed articles, and government publications and databases. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case, QIV would be expected to avoid 1,413,392 influenza cases, 41,780 hospitalizations, and 19,906 deaths over the lifetime horizon, compared with TIV. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound14,645 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. From the societal perspective, the estimated ICER was pound13,497/QALY. A strategy of vaccinating only people aged >/=65 years had an estimated ICER of pound11,998/QALY.

The most recently introduced PI, simeprevir (SMV), offers high levels of viral eradication combined with a reduced overall duration of therapy. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of SMV + PR vs PR alone or in combination with telaprevir (TVR) or boceprevir (BOC) in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV Method: A cost-utility model was constructed, incorporating two phases, capturing the efficacy of therapy in an initial treatment phase, followed by a long-term post-treatment Markov phase, capturing lifetime outcomes according to whether a sustained viral response (SVR) had been achieved on treatment.

14275,Cost-effectiveness of quantitative pretest probability intended to reduce unnecessary medical radiation exposure in emergency department patients with chest pain and dyspnea,"OBJECTIVES: Quantitative pretest probability (qPTP) incorporated into a decision support tool with advice can reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing among patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and pulmonary embolism (PE), reducing 30-day costs without an increase in 90-day adverse outcomes. This study estimates long-term (beyond 90-day) costs and outcomes associated with qPTP. The authors hypothesized that qPTP reduces lifetime costs and improves outcomes in low-risk patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS and PE. METHODS: This was a cost-effectiveness analysis of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of adult emergency patients with dyspnea and chest pain, in which a clinician encountering a low-risk patient with symptoms suggestive of ACS or PE conducted either the intervention (qPTP for ACS and PE with advice) or the sham (no qPTP and no advice). Effect of the intervention over a patient's lifetime was assessed using a Markov microsimulation model. Short-term costs and outcomes were from the trial; long-term outcomes and costs were from the literature. Outcomes included lifetime transition to PE, ACS, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); mortality from cancer, ICH, PE, ACS, renal failure, and ischemic stroke; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); and total medical costs compared between simulated intervention and sham groups. RESULTS: Markov microsimulation for a 40-year-old patient receiving qPTP found lifetime cost savings of $497 for women and $528 for men, associated with small gains in QALYs (2 and 6 days, respectively) and lower rates of cancer mortality in both sexes, but a reduction in ICH only in males. Sensitivity analysis for patients aged 60 years predicted that qPTP would continue to save costs and also reduce mortality from both ICH and cancer. Use of qPTP significantly reduced the lifetime probability of PE diagnosis, with lower probability of death from PE in both sexes aged 40 to 60 years. However, use of qPTP reduced the rate of ACS diagnosis and death from ACS at age 40, but increased the death rate from ACS at age 60 for both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread use of a combined qPTP for both ACS and PE has the potential to decrease costs by reducing diagnostic testing, while improving most long-term outcomes in emergency patients with chest pain and dyspnea.",2015-01-18237,25899550,Acad Emerg Med,Jennifer L Troyer,2015,22 / 5,525-35,No,25899550,"Jennifer L Troyer; Alan E Jones; Nathan I Shapiro; Alice M Mitchell; Ian Hewer; Jeffrey A Kline; Cost-effectiveness of quantitative pretest probability intended to reduce unnecessary medical radiation exposure in emergency department patients with chest pain and dyspnea, Acad Emerg Med, 2015 May; 22(5):1069-6563; 525-35",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quantitative pretest probability (qptp) vs. Placebo,Not Stated,60 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-89244.07,United States,2013,-99148.54
14276,Cost-effectiveness of case-based training for primary care physicians in evidence-based medicine of patients with coronary heart disease,"BACKGROUND: We have shown that a case-based training programme for general practitioners, aimed to implement evidence-based care of patients at very high risk of coronary death, was associated with decreased mortality. In the present study we assessed long-term cost-effectiveness of this programme. DESIGN: Registry-based long-term cost-effectiveness analysis on a clinical trial. METHODS: Costs of the programme, health care, drugs and added years of life were included. Costs were adjusted to 2012 level and discounted by 3%. Life-years gained were estimated as the difference between the survival curves of the trial. The effectiveness measure, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), was constructed by multiplying each life-year with a quality of life weight corresponding to the health status of that year. QALYs were also discounted by 3%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as the incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: The number of undiscounted life-years gained was 365 days in the intervention group as compared to control (p = 0.02). The number of discounted QALYs gained was 0.66. The net increase in total costs was estimated as 17,862 euro when costs of added years of life were included and 4621 euro exclusive of these costs. This implied an ICER of 27,063 euro per gained QALY. This ICER is well below commonly used threshold values of the societal willingness to pay for a QALY.

Also, we calculate cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences commonly prescribed to predict effects and costs if patients had received a different treatment sequence. METHODS: Real-world data including patient and disease characteristics, treatment information and resource use were collected from 1054 elderly patients with MM. Patients received first-line treatment during 2004-2007 (cohort 1) and 2008-2013 (cohort 2). The two cohorts were compared using a patient-level simulation (PLS) model comprising regression models which used patient and disease characteristics to estimate time to next treatment and death. Effects and costs from cohort 2 were compared to 4 commonly prescribed real-world sequences. RESULTS: Utilisation of novel agents was higher for cohort 2 compared to cohort 1. Modelled average OS for cohort 1 was 38 months (median 25) and total costs euro44 200. OS for cohort 2 was 42 months (median 28) and total costs euro69 017.

14280,A cost-effectiveness analysis of real-world treatment for elderly patients with multiple myeloma using a full disease model,"OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of novel treatments for elderly (>/=66 yr) patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in daily practice by comparing real-world effects [overall survival (OS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and costs over time. Also, we calculate cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences commonly prescribed to predict effects and costs if patients had received a different treatment sequence. METHODS: Real-world data including patient and disease characteristics, treatment information and resource use were collected from 1054 elderly patients with MM. Patients received first-line treatment during 2004-2007 (cohort 1) and 2008-2013 (cohort 2). The two cohorts were compared using a patient-level simulation (PLS) model comprising regression models which used patient and disease characteristics to estimate time to next treatment and death. Effects and costs from cohort 2 were compared to 4 commonly prescribed real-world sequences. RESULTS: Utilisation of novel agents was higher for cohort 2 compared to cohort 1. Modelled average OS for cohort 1 was 38 months (median 25) and total costs euro44 200. OS for cohort 2 was 42 months (median 28) and total costs euro69 017. The model identified potential OS gains if all patients were to be treated using combinations containing thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib in that particular order. This sequence had, compared to real-world treatment, the most favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, euro24 618 per life year gained and euro34 875 per QALY.

14281,Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin with or without pegylated interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Italy,"OBJECTIVE: Across Italy up to 7.3% of the population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), with long-term complications resulting in high medical costs and significant morbidity and mortality. Current treatment options have limitations due to side effects, interferon intolerability and ineligibility, long treatment durations and low sustained virological response (SVR) rates, especially for the most severe patients). Sofosbuvir is the first nucleotide polymerase inhibitor with pan-genotypic activity. Sofosbuvir, administered with ribavirin (RBV) and with or without pegylated interferon (PEG-INF), resulted in >90% SVR across treatment-naive (TN) genotype (GT) 1-6 patients. It is also the first treatment option for patients that are unsuitable for interferon (UI). This analysis evaluates the cost - effectiveness of sofosbuvir for GTs 1-6 in Italy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model followed a cohort of 10,000 patients until they reached 80 years old. Approximately 20% of naive and 30% of experienced patients initiated treatment at the cirrhosis stage. Comparators included PEG-INF + RBV for all GTs and plus telaprevir or boceprevir for GT1, or no treatment. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% and the cost perspective was that of the National Health Service in Italy. RESULTS: Sofosbuvir was cost-effective with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below euro40,000/QALY in all patient populations, particularly in cirrhotic patients. The exception was for a mixed cohort of GT2 TN patients where the ICER was euro68,500/QALY and for a cirrhotic cohort of GT4/5/6 where the ICER was euro68,434/QALY. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HCV in this patient population is expected to be low. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis.

14290,Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin with or without pegylated interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Italy,"OBJECTIVE: Across Italy up to 7.3% of the population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), with long-term complications resulting in high medical costs and significant morbidity and mortality. Current treatment options have limitations due to side effects, interferon intolerability and ineligibility, long treatment durations and low sustained virological response (SVR) rates, especially for the most severe patients). Sofosbuvir is the first nucleotide polymerase inhibitor with pan-genotypic activity. Sofosbuvir, administered with ribavirin (RBV) and with or without pegylated interferon (PEG-INF), resulted in >90% SVR across treatment-naive (TN) genotype (GT) 1-6 patients. It is also the first treatment option for patients that are unsuitable for interferon (UI). This analysis evaluates the cost - effectiveness of sofosbuvir for GTs 1-6 in Italy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model followed a cohort of 10,000 patients until they reached 80 years old. Approximately 20% of naive and 30% of experienced patients initiated treatment at the cirrhosis stage. Comparators included PEG-INF + RBV for all GTs and plus telaprevir or boceprevir for GT1, or no treatment. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% and the cost perspective was that of the National Health Service in Italy. RESULTS: Sofosbuvir was cost-effective with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below euro40,000/QALY in all patient populations, particularly in cirrhotic patients. The exception was for a mixed cohort of GT2 TN patients where the ICER was euro68,500/QALY and for a cirrhotic cohort of GT4/5/6 where the ICER was euro68,434/QALY. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HCV in this patient population is expected to be low. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis.

14299,Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy for assessing resectability in pancreatic and periampullary cancer,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for pancreatic and periampullary cancer, but many patients undergo unnecessary laparotomy because tumours can be understaged by computerised tomography (CT). A recent Cochrane review found diagnostic laparoscopy can decrease unnecessary laparotomy. We compared the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy prior to laparotomy versus direct laparotomy in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer with resectable disease based on CT scanning. METHOD: Model based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. A decision tree model was constructed using probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: When laparotomy following diagnostic laparoscopy occurred in a subsequent admission, diagnostic laparoscopy incurred similar mean costs per patient to direct laparotomy ( pound7470 versus pound7480); diagnostic laparoscopy costs ( pound995) were offset by avoiding unnecessary laparotomy costs. Diagnostic laparoscopy produced significantly more mean QALYs per patient than direct laparotomy (0.346 versus 0.337). Results were sensitive to the accuracy of diagnostic laparoscopy and the probability that disease was unresectable. Diagnostic laparoscopy had 63 to 66% probability of being cost-effective at a maximum willingness to pay for a QALY of pound20 000 to pound30 000. When laparotomy was undertaken in the same admission as diagnostic laparoscopy the mean cost per patient of diagnostic laparoscopy increased to pound8224.

14300,"Cost effectiveness of option B plus for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in resource-limited countries: evidence from Kumasi, Ghana","BACKGROUND: Achieving the goal of eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) necessitates increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected pregnant women. Option B provides ART through pregnancy and breastfeeding, whereas Option B+ recommends continuous ART regardless of CD4 count, thus potentially reducing MTCT during future pregnancies. Our objective was to compare maternal and pediatric health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of Option B+ versus Option B in Ghana. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate HIV progression in mothers and transmission (in utero, during birth, or through breastfeeding) to current and all future children. Clinical parameters, including antenatal care access and fertility rates, were estimated from a retrospective review of 817 medical records at two hospitals in Ghana. Additional parameters were obtained from published literature. Modeled outcomes include HIV infections averted among newborn children, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: HIV-infected women in Ghana have a lifetime average of 2.3 children (SD 1.3). Projected maternal life expectancy under Option B+ is 16.1 years, versus 16.0 years with Option B, yielding a gain of 0.1 maternal QALYs and 3.2 additional QALYs per child. Despite higher initial ART costs, Option B+ costs $785/QALY gained, a value considered very cost-effective by World Health Organization benchmarks. Widespread implementation of Option B+ in Ghana could theoretically prevent up to 668 HIV infections among children annually. Cost-effectiveness estimates remained favorable over robust sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Although more expensive than Option B, Option B+ substantially reduces MTCT in future pregnancies, increases both maternal and pediatric QALYs, and is a cost-effective use of limited resources in Ghana.",2015-01-18262,25887574,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,Adam VanDeusen,2015,15 /,130,No,25887574,"Adam VanDeusen; Elijah Paintsil; Thomas Agyarko-Poku; Elisa F Long; Cost effectiveness of option B plus for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in resource-limited countries: evidence from Kumasi, Ghana, J Manag Care Spec Pharm, 2015; 15():2376-1032; 130",QALY,Ghana,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Option B+: HIV-infected pregnant women receive lifelong antiretroviral therapy beginning at their first pregnancy.
