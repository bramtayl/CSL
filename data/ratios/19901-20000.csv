19901,Cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b treatment-naive patients in China,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C is the second fastest growing infectious disease in China. The standard-of-care for chronic hepatitis C in China is Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PR), which is associated with tolerability and efficacy issues. An interferon- and ribavirin-free, all-oral regimen comprising daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV), which displays higher efficacy and tolerability, has recently been approved in China. OBJECTIVES: This study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DCV+ASV (24 weeks) for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b treatment-naive patients compared with PR regimen (48 weeks) in China. METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed from Chinese payer perspective to project the lifetime outcomes of treating 10,000 patients with an average age of 44.5 with two hypothetical regimens, DCV+ASV and PR. Chinese-specific health state costs and efficacy data were used. The annual discount rate was 5%. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted. RESULTS: For HCV Genotype 1b treatment-naive patients, DCV+ASV proved to be dominant over PR, with a cost saving of yen33,480(5,096 USD) and gains in QALYs and life years of 1.29 and 0.85, respectively. The lifetime risk of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death was greatly reduced with DCV+ASV. Univariate sensitivity analysis demonstrated that key influencers were the discount rate, time horizon, initial disease severity and sustained virological response rate of DCV+ASV, with all scenarios resulting in additional benefit. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that DCV+ASV has a high likelihood (100%) of being cost-effective. CONCLUSION: DCV+ASV is not only an effective and well-tolerated regimen to treat chronic HCV genotype 1b infection treatment-naive patients, but also is more cost-effective than PR regimen. DCV+ASV can benefit both the public health and reimbursement system in China.",2018-01-27518,29634736,PLoS One,Yun Lu,2018,13 / 4,e0195117,No,29634736,"Yun Lu; Xiuze Jin; Cheng-A-Xin Duan; Feng Chang; Cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b treatment-naive patients in China, PLoS One , 2018; 13(4):1932-6203; e0195117",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Daclatasvir + Asunaprevir vs. Standard/Usual Care- Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin,Genotype 1b,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-25953.49,China,2015,-4510.76
19902,Cost-effectiveness of antiviral treatment after resection in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients with compensated cirrhosis,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imposes a heavy disease burden on China due to its high morbidity and mortality. China accounts for about 50% of the total new cases and deaths worldwide. Most cases are related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and are associated with cirrhosis at diagnosis. Antiviral treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) after resection in HBV-related HCC can reduce recurrence and improve survival. Such treatment is in fact recommended by Chinese guidelines. However, cost-effectiveness studies regarding this treatment are rare. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NA treatment after resection in HBV-related HCC patients with compensated cirrhosis. A Markov model was constructed to simulate HBV-related HCC patients with compensated cirrhosis and detectable HBV DNA, with or without NA treatment after resection, followed up over their lifetime. Costs, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for each strategy from the societal perspective. The parameters of the model were derived from published studies, government documents, and our surveys. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of parameters on the uncertainty of the results. NA treatment produced 4.22 QALYs, costing $39,898, while non-NA treatment achieved 2.80 QALYs, costing $16,048. The ICER of NA treatment versus non-NA treatment was $16,848/QALY, which was between 2 and 3 times gross domestic product per capita and was therefore deemed cost-effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed that NA treatment was cost-effective, with a probability of 0.852. CONCLUSION: NA treatment after liver resection was likely cost-effective in HBV-related HCC patients with compensated cirrhosis.

19903,First- and second-line bevacizumab in ovarian cancer: A Belgian cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Currently, in Belgium, bevacizumab is reimbursed for ovarian cancer patients, based on a contract between the Minister and the manufacturer including confidential agreements. This reimbursement will be re-evaluated in 2018. OBJECTIVE: To support the reimbursement reassessment by calculating the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab: (1) in addition to first-line chemotherapy; (2) in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant). METHODS: A health economic model has been developed for the Belgian situation according to the Belgian guidelines for economic evaluations. The lifetime Markov model was set up from the perspective of the health care payer (government and patient), including direct healthcare related costs. Results are expressed as the extra costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Calculations were based on results of four international trials. Both probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of first-line bevacizumab are on average 158 000/QALY (GOG-0218 trial) and 443 000/QALY (ICON7 trial). The most favourable scenario is based on the stage IV subgroup of the GOG-0218 trial (euro52 000/QALY). Since subgroup findings are often exploratory and require confirmatory studies, results of the economic evaluation based on this subgroup analysis should be considered with caution. For second-line bevacizumab, ICERs are on average euro587 000/QALY (OCEANS trial) and euro172 000/QALY (AURELIA trial). Sensitivity analysis shows that results are most sensitive to the price of bevacizumab. CONCLUSION: From a health economic perspective, ICERs of bevacizumab are relatively high.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model from the health care system perspective over a 6-month time frame for 50-year-old patients with clinical findings consistent with adhesive capsulitis was used to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of three techniques for administering intraarticular steroid to the glenohumeral joint: landmark based (also called blind), ultrasound guided, and fluoroscopy guided. Input data on cost, probability, and utility estimates were obtained through a comprehensive literature search and from expert opinion. The primary effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Costs were estimated in 2017 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided injections were the dominant strategy for the base case, because it was the least expensive ($1280) and most effective (0.4096 QALY) strategy of the three options overall. The model was sensitive to the probabilities of getting the steroid into the joint by means of blind, ultrasound-guided, and fluoroscopy-guided techniques and to the costs of the ultrasound-guided and blind techniques. Two-way sensitivity analyses showed that ultrasound-guided injections were favored over blind and fluoroscopy-guided injections over a range of reasonable probabilities and costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ultrasound-guided injections were cost-effective in 44% of simulations, compared with 34% for blind injections and 22% for fluoroscopy-guided injections and over a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds.

19911,Patients with unilateral transfemoral amputation treated with a percutaneous osseointegrated prosthesis,"Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment with an osseointegrated percutaneous (OI-) prosthesis and a socket-suspended (S-) prosthesis for patients with a transfemoral amputation. Patients and Methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate the medical costs and changes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) attributable to treatment of unilateral transfemoral amputation over a projected period of 20 years from a healthcare perspective. Data were collected alongside a prospective clinical study of 51 patients followed for two years. Results: OI-prostheses had an incremental cost per QALY gained of euro83 374 compared with S-prostheses. The clinical improvement seen with OI-prostheses was reflected in QALYs gained. Results were most sensitive to the utility value for both treatment arms. The impact of an annual decline in utility values of 1%, 2%, and 3%, for patients with S-prostheses resulted in a cost per QALY gained of euro37 020, euro24 662, and euro18 952, respectively, over 20 years. Conclusion: From a healthcare perspective, treatment with an OI-prosthesis results in improved quality of life at a relatively high cost compared with that for S-prosthesis. When patients treated with S-prostheses had a decline in quality of life over time, the cost per QALY gained by OI-prosthesis treatment was considerably reduced.

METHODS: We undertook a cost-utility analysis using the Sheffield Type 1 Diabetes Policy Model and data from the Relative Effectiveness of Pumps over Structured Education (REPOSE) trial to estimate the lifetime incidence of diabetic complications, intervention-based resource use and associated effects on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). All economic analyses took a National Health Service and personal social services perspective and discounted costs and QALYs at 3.5% per annum. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed on the base case. Further uncertainties in the cost of pumps and the evidence used to inform the model were explored using scenario analyses. SETTING: Eight diabetes centres in England and Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with T1DM who were eligible to receive a structured education course and did not have a strong clinical indication or a preference for a pump. INTERVENTION: Pumps+DAFNE. COMPARATOR: MDI+DAFNE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs, incremental QALYs gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Compared with MDI+DAFNE, pumps+DAFNE was associated with an incremental discounted lifetime cost of + pound18 853 (95% CI pound6175 to pound31 645) and a gain in discounted lifetime QALYs of +0.13 (95% CI -0.70 to +0.96). The base case mean ICER was pound142 195 per QALY gained. The probability of pump+DAFNE being cost-effective using a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000 per QALY gained was 14.0%. All scenario and subgroup analyses examined indicated that the ICER was unlikely to fall below pound30 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the REPOSE data suggests that routine use of pumps in adults without an immediate clinical need for a pump, as identified by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, would not be cost-effective.

19913,Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS): A cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preventive ceftriaxone vs standard stroke unit care without preventive antimicrobial therapy in acute stroke patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial with masked endpoint assessment, 2,550 patients with acute stroke were included between 2010 and 2014. Economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 3 months. Volumes and costs of direct, indirect, medical, and nonmedical care were assessed. Primary outcome was cost per unit of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 2,538 patients were available for the intention-to-treat analysis. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, 2,538 patients were available for in-hospital resource use and 1,453 for other resource use. Use of institutional care resources, out-of-pocket expenses, and productivity losses was comparable between treatment groups. The mean score on mRS was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.31-2.44) vs 2.44 (95% CI 2.37-2.51) in the ceftriaxone vs control group, the decrease by 0.06 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.16) in favor of ceftriaxone treatment being nonsignificant. However, the number of QALYs was 0.163 (95% CI 0.159-0.166) vs 0.155 (95% CI 0.152-0.158) in the ceftriaxone vs control group, with the difference of 0.008 (95% CI 0.003-0.012) in favor of ceftriaxone (p = 0.006) at 3 months. The probability of ceftriaxone being cost-effective ranged between 0.67 and 0.89. Probability of 0.75 was attained at a willing-to-pay level of euro2,290 per unit decrease in the mRS score and of euro12,200 per QALY.

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of heparin coated versus standard polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for bypass surgery in peripheral artery disease from a long-term healthcare system perspective. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness evaluation was conducted alongside the Danish part of the Scandinavian Propaten trial in which 431 patients planned for femoro-femoral or femoro-popliteal bypass surgery were randomised to either type of graft and followed for 5 years. Based on the intention to treat principle, the differences in healthcare costs (general practice, prescription medication, hospital admission, rehabilitation, and long-term care in 2015 Euros), life years (LYs), and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were analysed as arithmetic means with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were used to illustrate the probability of cost-effectiveness for a range of threshold values of willingness to pay (WTP). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences between the randomisation groups were observed for costs or gains of LYs or QALYs. The average cost per QALY was estimated at euro10,792. For a WTP threshold of euro40,000 per QALY, the overall probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at 62%, but owing to cost savings in patients with critical ischaemia (cost per QALY <euro0), it increased to 89% for this subgroup.

Adopting either as a first-line therapy carries major cost and resource implications. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib and TACE in advanced HCC. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed in a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 60 years with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis over a 2-year time frame. Three strategies (full or dose-adjusted sorafenib and TACE) were compared in two cost settings: China and the USA. Transition probabilities, utility and costs were extracted from systematic review of 27 articles. Sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Full and dose-adjusted sorafenib respectively produced 0.435 and 0.482 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) while TACE produced 0.375 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of full-dose sorafenib versus TACE was $101,028.83/QALY in China whereas full-dose sorafenib is a dominant strategy (ICER of -$1,014,507.20/ QALY) compared with TACE in the USA.

However, dose-adjusted sorafenib is not available currently, so full-dose sorafenib should be compared with TACE.

19921,Cost-utility analysis on telemonitoring of users with pacemakers: The PONIENTE study,"Introduction Few studies have confirmed the cost-saving of telemonitoring of users with pacemakers (PMs). The purpose of this controlled, non-randomised, non-masked clinical trial was to perform an economic assessment of telemonitoring (TM) of users with PMs and check whether TM offers a cost-utility alternative to conventional follow-up in hospital. Methods Eighty-two patients implanted with an internet-based transmission PM were selected to receive either conventional follow-up in hospital ( n = 52) or TM ( n = 30) from their homes. The data were collected during 12 months while patients were being monitored. The economic assessment of the PONIENTE study was performed as per the perspectives of National Health Service (NHS) and patients. A cost-utility analysis was conducted to measure whether the TM of patients with PMs is cost-effective in terms of costs per gained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results There was a significant cost-saving for participants in the TM group in comparison with the participants in the conventional follow-up group. From the NHS''s perspective, the patients in the TM group gained 0.09 QALYs more than the patients in the conventional follow-up group over 12 months, with a cost saving of 57.64% (euro46.51 versus euro109.79, respectively; p < 0.001) per participant per year. In-office visits were reduced by 52.49% in the TM group. The costs related to the patient perspective were lower in the TM group than in the conventional follow-up group (euro31.82 versus euro73.48, respectively; p < 0.005). The costs per QALY were 61.68% higher in the in-office monitoring group.

19922,"Cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with high disease activity in England","AIMS: Cladribine tablets were the first oral short-course treatment approved for highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The Association of British Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS (HDA-RRMS). This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets in HDA-RRMS compared with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model with 11 health states (10 Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed. Transition matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the natural history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard ratios for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and the literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was assessed via probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cladribine tablets were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant strategy in fully incremental analyses. Incremental cost was driven largely by drug acquisition and administration costs, and incremental QALY gain largely by differences in delayed EDSS progression.

19923,"Cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with high disease activity in England","AIMS: Cladribine tablets were the first oral short-course treatment approved for highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The Association of British Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS (HDA-RRMS). This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets in HDA-RRMS compared with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model with 11 health states (10 Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed. Transition matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the natural history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard ratios for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and the literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was assessed via probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cladribine tablets were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant strategy in fully incremental analyses. Incremental cost was driven largely by drug acquisition and administration costs, and incremental QALY gain largely by differences in delayed EDSS progression.

19924,Rituximab versus the modified Ponticelli regimen in the treatment of primary membranous nephropathy: a Health Economic Model,"Background: Membranous nephropathy is among the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome worldwide, with a high healthcare burden. Treatment using the modified Ponticelli regimen (mPR) has remained the standard of care for decades, but newer therapies such as rituximab offer promising results with reduced side effects. The cost of this treatment, however, is perceived as a barrier to widespread use, especially in resource limited healthcare systems. Methods: We developed a decision-analytic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rituximab versus the mPR from the perspective of the National Health Service in the UK over a 1 year, 5 year and lifetime horizon. Primary outcome is the cost-effectiveness of rituximab versus mPR at 5 years post-treatment. Secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness at 1 and 10 years post-treatment and over a lifetime. Results: At 1-year post-treatment, rituximab therapy dominates mPR. At 5 years post-treatment, rituximab therapy is cheaper than the Ponticelli regimen but at a loss of 0.014 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound95 494.13. Over a lifetime, rituximab remains the cheaper option with an incremental cost of - pound5251.03 but with a reduced quality of life (incremental QALY of -0.512) giving an ICER of pound10 246.09.

19928,Cost Effectiveness of Early Insertion of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts for Recurrent Ascites,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment options for recurrent ascites resulting from decompensated cirrhosis include serial large-volume paracentesis and albumin infusion (LVP+A) or insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Insertion of TIPSs with covered stents during early stages of ascites (early TIPS, defined as 2 LVPs within the past 3 weeks and <6 LVPs in the prior 3 months) significantly improves chances of survival and reduces complications of cirrhosis compared with LVP+A. However, it is not clear if TIPS insertion is cost effective in these patients. METHODS: We developed a Markov model using the payer perspective for a hypothetical cohort of patients with cirrhosis with recurrent ascites receiving early TIPSs or LVP+A using data from publications and national databases collected from 2012 to 2018. Projected outcomes included quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), costs (2017 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; $/QALY). Sensitivity analyses (1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic) were conducted. ICERs less than $100,000 per QALY were considered cost effective. RESULTS: In base-case analysis, early insertion of TIPS had a higher cost ($22,770) than LVP+A ($19,180), but also increased QALY (0.73 for early TIPSs and 0.65 for LVP+A), resulting in an ICER of $46,310/QALY. Results were sensitive to cost of uncomplicated TIPS insertion and transplant, need for LVP+A, probability of transplant, and decompensated QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, TIPS insertion was the optimal strategy in 59.1% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on Markov model analysis, early placement of TIPSs appears to be a cost-effective strategy for management of specific patients with cirrhosis and recurrent ascites. TIPS placement should be considered early and as a first-line treatment option for select patients.",2018-01-27580,29609068,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Nicole T Shen,2018,16 / 9,1503-1510.e3,No,29609068,"Nicole T Shen; Yecheskel Schneider; Stephen E Congly; Russell E Rosenblatt; Yunseok Namn; Brett E Fortune; Arun Jesudian; Robert S Jr. Brown; Cost Effectiveness of Early Insertion of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts for Recurrent Ascites, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2018 Sep; 16(9):1542-3565; 1503-1510.e3",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt vs. Serial large-volume paracentesis and albumin infusion,Manifested by recurrent ascites,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,46310,United States,2017,48896.61
19929,Pharmacologic Hemostatic Agents in Total Joint Arthroplasty-A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Total knee and hip arthroplasties can be associated with substantial blood loss, affecting morbidity and even mortality. Two pharmacological antifibrinolytics, epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA) have been used to minimize perioperative blood loss, but both have associated morbidity. Given the added cost of these medications and the risks associated with then, a cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken to ascertain the best strategy. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was constructed using the payoffs of cost (in United States dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life expectancy, in days). The medical literature was used to ascertain various complications, their probabilities, utility values, and direct medical costs associated with various health states. A time horizon of 10 years and a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 was used. RESULTS: The total cost and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life expectancy, in days) was $459.77, $951.22, and $1174.87 and 3411.19, 3248.02, and 3342.69 for TXA, no pharmacologic hemostatic agent, and EACA, respectively. Because TXA is less expensive and more effective than the competing alternatives, it was the favored strategy. One-way sensitivity analyses for probability of transfusion and myocardial infarction for all 3 strategies revealed that TXA remains the dominant strategy across all clinically plausible values.

Methods: An Excel-based simulation model was developed to compare bone SPECT/CT versus CT or MARS-MRI from a payer perspective.

One-way (+/-25%) sensitivity analysis was performed to gauge the model robustness. Results: For every 1,000 TKA patients, diagnostic bone SPECT/CT was expected to lead to three-year cost savings up to $1,867,695 vs. CT (or $622.6 per-patient-per-year) and $1,723,435 vs. MARS-MRI (or $574.5 per-patient-per-year) for a payer.

19933,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Sacubitril/Valsartan for the Treatment of Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Sacubitril/valsartan (SAC/VAL) has been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) compared with enalapril but at a substantially higher cost. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of SAC/VAL versus enalapril in patients with HFrEF over a 5-year time horizon from the U.S. payer perspective. METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between SAC/VAL and enalapril in patients with HFrEF over a 5-year time horizon. Markov states included New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (II-IV) and death. Treatment discontinuation, HF-related hospitalizations, and NYHA class progression were modeled as transition states based on data from the PARADIGM trial. Other probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from published literature and public databases. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, SAC/VAL cost more than enalapril ($81,943 vs $67,287) and was more effective (2.647 QALYs vs 2.546 QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $143,891/QALY gained. At a willingness to pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY, SAC/VAL was cost-effective up to a cost of $298/month. Results were most sensitive to SAC/VAL cost, SAC/VAL mortality benefit, and NYHA progression probability. SAC/VAL had a 10% and 52% probability of being cost-effective at WTP thresholds of $100,000/QALY and $150,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SAC/VAL is associated with clinical benefit and may be cost-effective compared with the current standard of care over realistic treatment durations from the payer perspective.

RESULTS: Screening peanut skin testing of all children with early-onset eczema and/or egg allergy before in-office peanut introduction was dominated by a no screening approach, in terms of number of cases of peanut allergy prevented, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and healthcare costs, although screening resulted in a slightly lower rate of allergic reactions to peanut per patient in high-risk children. Considering costs of peanut allergy in high-risk children, the per-patient cost of early introduction without screening over the model horizon was $6556.69 (95%CI, $6512.76-$6600.62), compared with a cost of $7576.32 (95%CI, $7531.38-$7621.26) for skin test screening prior to introduction. From a US societal perspective, screening prior to introduction cost $654 115 322 and resulted in 3208 additional peanut allergy diagnoses.

19939,Cost-effectiveness of hydromorphone for severe opioid use disorder: findings from the SALOME randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous research has found diacetylmorphine, delivered under supervision, to be cost-effective in the treatment of severe opioid use disorder, but diacetylmorphine is not available in many settings. The Study to Assess Long-term Opioid Maintenance Effectiveness (SALOME) randomized controlled trial provided evidence that injectable hydromorphone is non-inferior to diacetylmorphine. The current study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of hydromorphone directly with diacetylmorphine and indirectly with methadone maintenance treatment. DESIGN: A within-trial analysis was conducted using the patient level data from the 6-month, double-blind, non-inferiority SALOME trial. A life-time analysis extrapolated costs and outcomes using a decision analytical cohort model. The model incorporated data from a previous trial to include an indirect comparison to methadone maintenance. SETTING: A supervised clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 202 long-term street opioid injectors who had at least two attempts at treatment, including one with methadone (or other substitution), were randomized to hydromorphone (n = 100) or diacetylmorphine (n = 102). MEASUREMENTS: We measured the utilization of drugs, visits to health professionals, hospitalizations, criminal activity, mortality and quality of life. This enabled us to estimate incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness ratios from a societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses considered different sources of evidence, assumptions and perspectives. FINDINGS: The within-trial analysis found hydromorphone provided similar QALYs to diacetylmorphine [0.377, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.361-0.393 versus 0.375, 95% CI = 0.357-0.391], but accumulated marginally greater costs [$49 830 ($28 401-73 637) versus $34 320 ($21 780-55 998)].

19942,Cost effectiveness analysis of afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer from the Singapore healthcare payer's perspective,"BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker recommended in clinical guidelines as a first-line treatment for NSCLC which harbours an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive NSCLC in Singapore. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free, progressive disease and death) was developed from a healthcare payer perspective. Survival curves from the LUX-Lung 3 trial (afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy) were extrapolated beyond the trial period to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and overall survival parametric distributions. Rates of adverse reactions were also estimated from LUX-Lung 3 while health utilities from overseas were derived from the literature in the absence of local estimates. Direct costs were sourced from public healthcare institutions in Singapore. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a 5 year time horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and additional scenario analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on the cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the ICER for afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin was SG$137,648 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and SG$109,172 per life-year gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to variations in the utility values, the cost of afatinib and time horizon. Scenario analyses showed that even reducing the cost of afatinib by 50% led to a high ICER which was unlikely to represent a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with pemetrexed-cisplatin, afatinib is not cost-effective as a first-line treatment for advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in Singapore. The findings from our study will be useful to inform local healthcare decision-making and resource allocations for NSCLC treatments, together with other considerations such as clinical effectiveness, safety and affordability of TKIs.",2018-01-27618,29587666,BMC Cancer,Ping-Tee Tan,2018,18 / 1,352,No,29587666,"Ping-Tee Tan; Mohamed Ismail Abdul Aziz; Fiona Pearce; Wan-Teck Lim; David Bin-Chia Wu; Kwong Ng; Cost effectiveness analysis of afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer from the Singapore healthcare payer's perspective, BMC Cancer, 2018 Mar 7; 18(1):1471-2407; 352",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Afatinib as first-line treatment vs. Pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy as first-line treatment,Locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,137648,Singapore,2016,107698.84
19943,Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab in Second-line Advanced Bladder Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Immune-modulating drugs have recently been introduced to the second-line setting of advanced bladder cancer. Pembrolizumab increases overall survival and is associated with less toxicity compared with chemotherapy in this setting based on the Keynote 045 study. The high cost of immunotherapy necessitates an assessment of its value by considering both efficacy and cost. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for the second-line treatment of advanced bladder cancer from the perspective of payers in multiple countries. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab with those of chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of advanced bladder cancer based on the Keynote 045 study. Drug costs were acquired for the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, and Australia. All costs were converted from local currency to US dollars at the exchange rates in September 2017. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Pembrolizumab generated a gain of 0.36-0.37 QALYs compared with chemotherapy. Our analysis established the following incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in second-line advanced bladder cancer treatment: US $122 557/QALY; UK $91 995/QALY; Canada $90 099/QALY; and Australia $99 966/QALY. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds per QALY are considered to be around 100 000-150 000 US dollars for the US, 20 000-50 000 pounds for the UK (US$25 000-65 000), 20 000-100 000 CAD for Canada (US$16 000-80 000), and 40 000-75 000 AUD for Australia (US$32 000-60 000). CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness and WTP thresholds vary between countries. Compared with the other countries examined, US drug prices were found to be the highest, leading to the highest ICER. With standard WTP thresholds, pembrolizumab may be considered cost-effective in the US but not in the other countries examined. PATIENT SUMMARY: This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic bladder cancer who had previously failed one treatment regimen. It would cost $122 557 in the United States, $91 995 in the United Kingdom, $90 099 in Canada, and $99 966 in Australia to gain one quality-adjusted life-year with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in these patients, which may be considered cost-effective only in the United States because of the differences in willingness-to-pay thresholds.",2018-01-27640,29576265,Eur Urol,Michal Sarfaty,2018,74 / 1,57-62,No,29576265,"Michal Sarfaty; Peter S Hall; Kelvin K W Chan; Kiran Virik; Moshe Leshno; Noa Gordon; Assaf Moore; Victoria Neiman; Eli Rosenbaum; Daniel A Goldstein; Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab in Second-line Advanced Bladder Cancer, Eur Urol, 2018 Jul; 74(1):0302-2838; 57-62",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Pembrolizumab vs. Chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,122557,United States,2017,129402.33

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab with those of chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of advanced bladder cancer based on the Keynote 045 study. Drug costs were acquired for the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, and Australia. All costs were converted from local currency to US dollars at the exchange rates in September 2017. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Pembrolizumab generated a gain of 0.36-0.37 QALYs compared with chemotherapy. Our analysis established the following incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in second-line advanced bladder cancer treatment: US $122 557/QALY; UK $91 995/QALY; Canada $90 099/QALY; and Australia $99 966/QALY. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds per QALY are considered to be around 100 000-150 000 US dollars for the US, 20 000-50 000 pounds for the UK (US$25 000-65 000), 20 000-100 000 CAD for Canada (US$16 000-80 000), and 40 000-75 000 AUD for Australia (US$32 000-60 000). CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness and WTP thresholds vary between countries. Compared with the other countries examined, US drug prices were found to be the highest, leading to the highest ICER.

19951,Impact of increasing treatment rates on cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) in respiratory allergy: a decision analytic modelling approach,"BACKGROUND: Specific immunotherapy is the only causal treatment in respiratory allergy. Due to high treatment cost and possible severe side effects subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is not indicated in all patients. Nevertheless, reported treatment rates seem to be low. This study aims to analyze the effects of increasing treatment rates of SCIT in respiratory allergy in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). METHODS: A state-transition Markov model simulates the course of disease of patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma and both diseases over 10 years including a symptom-free state and death. Treatment comprises symptomatic pharmacotherapy alone or combined with SCIT. The model compares two strategies of increased and status quo treatment rates. Transition probabilities are based on routine data. Costs are calculated from the societal perspective applying German unit costs to literature-derived resource consumption. QALYs are determined by translating the mean change in non-preference-based quality of life scores to a change in utility. Key parameters are subjected to deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Increasing treatment rates is a cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3484euro/QALY compared to the status quo. The most influential parameters are SCIT discontinuation rates, treatment effects on the transition probabilities and cost of SCIT. Across all parameter variations, the best case leads to dominance of increased treatment rates while the worst case ICER is 34,315euro/QALY. Excluding indirect cost leads to a twofold increase in the ICER.

19952,A trial based economic evaluation of occupational therapy discharge planning for older adults: the HOME randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of two occupational therapy-led discharge planning interventions from the HOME trial. DESIGN: An economic evaluation was conducted within the superiority randomized HOME trial to assess the difference in costs and health-related outcomes associated with the enhanced program and the in-hospital consultation. Total costs of health and community service utilization were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, activities of daily living and quality-adjusted life years. SETTING: Medical and acute care wards of Australian hospitals ( n=5). SUBJECTS: A total of 400 people >/= 70 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to either (1) an enhanced program (HOME), involving pre/post discharge visits and two follow-up phone calls, or (2) an in-hospital consultation using the home and community environment assessment and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living assessment. MAIN MEASURES: Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (global measure of activities of daily living) and SF-12V2, transformed into SF-6D (quality-adjusted life year) measured at baseline and three months post discharge. RESULTS: The cost of the enhanced program was higher than that of the in-hospital consultation. However, a higher proportion of patients showed improvement in activities of daily living in the enhanced program with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $61,906.00 per person with clinically meaningful improvement. CONCLUSION: Health services would not save money by implementing the enhanced program as a routine intervention in medical and acute care wards.

19953,Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line Sevelamer and Lanthanum versus Calcium-Based Binders for Hyperphosphatemia of Chronic Kidney Disease,"BACKGROUND: Phosphate binders are used to treat hyperphosphatemia among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVES: To conduct an economic evaluation comparing calcium-free binders sevelamer and lanthanum with calcium-based binders for patients with CKD. METHODS: Effectiveness data were obtained from a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials. Effectiveness was measured as life-years gained and translated to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using utility weights from the literature. A Markov model consisting of non-dialysis-dependent (NDD)-CKD, dialysis-dependent (DD)-CKD, and death was developed to estimate the incremental costs and effects of sevelamer and lanthanum versus those of calcium-based binders. A lifetime horizon was used and both costs and effects were discounted at 1.5%. All costs are presented in 2015 Canadian dollars from the Canadian public payer perspective. Results of probabilistic sensitivity analysis were presented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for risk pooling methods, omission of dialysis costs, and persistence of drug effects on mortality. RESULTS: Sevelamer resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $106,522/QALY for NDD-CKD and $133,847/QALY for DD-CKD cohorts. Excluding dialysis costs, sevelamer was cost-effective in the NDD-CKD cohort ($5,847/QALY) and the DD-CKD cohort ($11,178/QALY).

19955,Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line Sevelamer and Lanthanum versus Calcium-Based Binders for Hyperphosphatemia of Chronic Kidney Disease,"BACKGROUND: Phosphate binders are used to treat hyperphosphatemia among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVES: To conduct an economic evaluation comparing calcium-free binders sevelamer and lanthanum with calcium-based binders for patients with CKD. METHODS: Effectiveness data were obtained from a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials. Effectiveness was measured as life-years gained and translated to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using utility weights from the literature. A Markov model consisting of non-dialysis-dependent (NDD)-CKD, dialysis-dependent (DD)-CKD, and death was developed to estimate the incremental costs and effects of sevelamer and lanthanum versus those of calcium-based binders. A lifetime horizon was used and both costs and effects were discounted at 1.5%. All costs are presented in 2015 Canadian dollars from the Canadian public payer perspective. Results of probabilistic sensitivity analysis were presented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for risk pooling methods, omission of dialysis costs, and persistence of drug effects on mortality. RESULTS: Sevelamer resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $106,522/QALY for NDD-CKD and $133,847/QALY for DD-CKD cohorts. Excluding dialysis costs, sevelamer was cost-effective in the NDD-CKD cohort ($5,847/QALY) and the DD-CKD cohort ($11,178/QALY).

19957,Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis Strategies for Transrectal Prostate Biopsy in an Era of Increasing Antimicrobial Resistance,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the optimal antibiotic prophylaxis strategy for transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) as a function of the local antibiotic resistance profile. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of four antibiotic prophylaxis strategies: ciprofloxacin alone, ceftriaxone alone, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone in combination, and directed prophylaxis selection based on susceptibility testing. We used a payer''s perspective and estimated the health care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with each strategy for a cohort of 66-year-old men undergoing TRPB. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Base-case resistance prevalence was 29% to ciprofloxacin and 7% to ceftriaxone, reflecting susceptibility patterns observed at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Resistance levels were varied in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base case, single-agent prophylaxis strategies were dominated. Directed prophylaxis strategy was the optimal strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. Relative to the directed prophylaxis strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the combination strategy was $123,333/QALY gained over the lifetime time horizon. In sensitivity analysis, single-agent prophylaxis strategies were preferred only at extreme levels of resistance.

19961,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Lesinurad/Allopurinol Versus Febuxostat for the Management of Gout/Hyperuricemia in Italy,"BACKGROUND: Until very recently the only therapeutic alternative for the management of patients affected by gout/hyperuricemia that did not respond to a first-line treatment based on allopurinol alone or who cannot tolerate allopurinol was febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase non-purine-selective inhibitor. Lately, however, a new therapeutic alternative has become available for the management of this pathology: lesinurad, a urate transporter inhibitor. OBJECTIVE: To objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of lesinurad/allopurinol in comparison with febuxostat as a second-line therapeutic strategy for the management of patients affected by gout and hyperuricemia that did not respond to a first-line therapy based on allopurinol alone. METHODS: A Markov model was built based on the natural history of the pathology; patients entered the model according to their level of serum uric acid concentration and flowed across it according to their response to the therapy. The analysis was carried out considering the perspective of the Italian National Health Service on a lifetime horizon and 6-month cycles. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at a 3.5% yearly rate. The results of the model were expressed in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Both a one-way and a multi-way Monte-Carlo analysis were carried out in order to check the robustness of the results achieved. RESULTS: The ICER derived from the comparison was equal to euro77.53/QALY on the lifetime horizon, as there was a higher level of costs associated with the combination as compared with febuxostat (euro10,658.27 vs. euro10,645.87, for a differential of euro12.40) and a higher level of QALYs achieved (7.77 vs. 7.61, for a differential of 0.16).

METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the cost-utility of TKA and NM in 6 BMI groups (nonobese [BMI 18.5-24.9], overweight [25-29.9], obese [30-34.9], severely obese [35-39.9], morbidly obese [40-49.9], and super-obese [50+] patients) over a 15-year period. Model parameters for transition probability (ie, revision, re-revision, death), utility, and costs were estimated from the literature. Direct medical costs but not indirect societal costs were included in the model. Costs and utilities were discounted 3% annually. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of TKA vs NM. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were performed to determine the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Over the 15-year period, the ICERs for the TKA vs NM for the different BMI categories were nonobese ($3317/quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), overweight ($2837/QALY), obese ($2947/QALY), severely obese ($3536/QALY), morbidly obese ($5531/QALY), and super-obese ($11,878/QALY). The higher BMI groups tended to have higher incremental QALYs and also higher incremental costs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis with an ICER threshold of $30,000/QALY showed that TKA would be cost-effective in 100% of simulations of patients with a BMI<50 and 99.16% of super-obese simulations.

METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the cost-utility of TKA and NM in 6 BMI groups (nonobese [BMI 18.5-24.9], overweight [25-29.9], obese [30-34.9], severely obese [35-39.9], morbidly obese [40-49.9], and super-obese [50+] patients) over a 15-year period. Model parameters for transition probability (ie, revision, re-revision, death), utility, and costs were estimated from the literature. Direct medical costs but not indirect societal costs were included in the model. Costs and utilities were discounted 3% annually. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of TKA vs NM. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were performed to determine the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Over the 15-year period, the ICERs for the TKA vs NM for the different BMI categories were nonobese ($3317/quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), overweight ($2837/QALY), obese ($2947/QALY), severely obese ($3536/QALY), morbidly obese ($5531/QALY), and super-obese ($11,878/QALY). The higher BMI groups tended to have higher incremental QALYs and also higher incremental costs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis with an ICER threshold of $30,000/QALY showed that TKA would be cost-effective in 100% of simulations of patients with a BMI<50 and 99.16% of super-obese simulations.

19968,Cost-effectiveness analysis of elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen for treating hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease patients in France,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimen in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment. DESIGN: This study uses a health economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating previously untreated and treatment experienced chronic hepatitis C patients who have severe and end stage renal disease with the elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus no treatment in the French context. The lifetime homogeneous markovian model comprises of forty combined health states including hepatitis C virus and chronic kidney disease. The model parameters were from a multicentre randomized controlled trial, ANRS CO22 HEPATHER French cohort and literature. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations of patient health states for each treatment strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% confidence intervals calculations. The results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. PATIENTS: The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage 4, 33% had a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal impairment stage 5 treated by dialysis. INTERVENTION: Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir compared to no-treatment. RESULTS: EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no treatment (5.1 years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was higher for the new treatment because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was of euro15,212 per QALY gained for the base case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that simultaneously looks at the disease evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon and ribavirin, produced the greatest benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in treatment-naive or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients. Based on shape of the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of euro20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.",2018-01-27712,29543897,PLoS One,Franck Maunoury,2018,13 / 3,e0194329,No,29543897,"Franck Maunoury; Aurore Clement; Chizoba Nwankwo; Laurie Levy-Bachelot; Armand Abergel; Vincent Di Martino; Eric Thervet; Isabelle Durand-Zaleski; Cost-effectiveness analysis of elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen for treating hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease patients in France, PLoS One , 2018; 13(3):1932-6203; e0194329",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Elbasvir/grazoprevir regimen vs. None,Severe and end stage renal disease,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,15212,Euro,2015,18433.44

The DALI study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, undertaken to add to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of interventions for pregnant women at increased risk for GDM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the healthy eating and/or physical activity promotion intervention compared to usual care among pregnant women at increased risk of GDM from a societal perspective. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a European multicenter-randomized controlled trial. A total of 435 pregnant women at increased risk of GDM in primary and secondary care settings in nine European countries, were recruited and randomly allocated to a healthy eating and physical activity promotion intervention (HE + PA intervention), a healthy eating promotion intervention (HE intervention), or a physical activity promotion intervention (PA intervention). Main outcome measures were gestational weight gain, fasting glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and societal costs. RESULTS: Between-group total cost and effect differences were not significant, besides significantly less gestational weight gain in the HE + PA group compared with the usual care group at 35-37 weeks (-2.3;95%CI:-3.7;-0.9). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the HE + PA intervention was the preferred intervention strategy. At 35-37 weeks, it depends on the decision-makers'' willingness to pay per kilogram reduction in gestational weight gain whether the HE + PA intervention is cost-effective for gestational weight gain, whereas it was not cost-effective for fasting glucose and HOMA-IR. After delivery, the HE + PA intervention was cost-effective for QALYs, which was predominantly caused by a large reduction in delivery-related costs. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy eating and physical activity promotion was found to be the preferred strategy for limiting gestational weight gain.

19976,Effects of Arthroscopy for Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome on Quality of Life and Economic Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) have increased steadily within the past decade, and research indicates clinically significant improvements after treatment of FAI with hip arthroscopy. PURPOSE: This study examined the societal and economic impact of hip arthroscopy by high-volume surgeons for patients with FAI syndrome aged <50 years with noncontroversial diagnosis and indications for surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of hip arthroscopy versus nonoperative treatment was evaluated by calculating direct and indirect treatment costs. Direct cost was calculated with Current Procedural Terminology medical codes associated with FAI treatment. Indirect cost was measured with the patient-reported data of 102 patients who underwent arthroscopy and from the reimbursement records of 32,143 individuals between the ages of 16 and 79 years who had information in a private insurance claims data set contained within the PearlDiver Patient Records Database. The indirect economic benefits of hip arthroscopy were inferred through regression analysis to estimate the statistical relationship between functional status and productivity. A simulation-based approach was then used to estimate the change in productivity associated with the change in functional status observed in the treatment cohort between baseline and follow-up. To analyze cost-effectiveness, 1-, 2-, and 3-way sensitivity analyses were performed on all variables in the model, and Monte Carlo analysis evaluated the impact of uncertainty in the model assumptions. RESULTS: Analysis of indirect costs identified a statistically significant increase of mean aggregate productivity of $8968 after surgery. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a mean cumulative total 10-year societal savings of $67,418 per patient from hip arthroscopy versus nonoperative treatment. Hip arthroscopy also conferred a gain of 2.03 quality-adjusted life years over this period. The mean cost for hip arthroscopy was estimated at $23,120 +/- $10,279, and the mean cost of nonoperative treatment was estimated at $91,602 +/- $14,675. In 99% of trials, hip arthroscopy was recognized as the preferred cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSION: FAI syndrome produces a substantial economic burden on society that may be reduced through the indirect cost savings and economic benefits from hip arthroscopy.",2018-01-27742,29533689,Am J Sports Med,Richard C 3rd Mather,2018,46 / 5,1205-1213,No,29533689,"Richard C 3rd Mather; Shane J Nho; Andrew Federer; Berna Demiralp; Jennifer Nguyen; Asha Saavoss; Michael J Salata; Marc J Philippon; Asheesh Bedi; Christopher M Larson; J W Thomas Byrd; Lane Koenig; Effects of Arthroscopy for Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome on Quality of Life and Economic Outcomes, Am J Sports Med, 2018 Apr; 46(5):1552-3365; 1205-1213",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Surgical","Hip arthroscopy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Nonoperative treatment (including activity modification, physical therapy, oral analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, and injectable corticosteriods)",Not Stated,50 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-33734.98,United States,2015,-36836.95

DESIGN: We used the European study on Quantifying Utility of Investment in Protection from Tobacco model (EQUIPTMOD), a Markov-based state transition economic model, to estimate the return on investment (ROI) of: (a) the current provision of smoking cessation services (brief physician advice and printed self-helped material + smoking ban and tobacco duty at current levels); and (b) four alternative scenarios to complement the current provision: coverage of proactive telephone calls; nicotine replacement therapy (mono and combo) [prescription nicotine replacement therapy (Rx NRT)]; varenicline (standard duration); or bupropion. A rate of 3% was used to discount life-time costs and benefits. SETTING: Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Adult smoking population (16+ years). MEASUREMENTS: Health-care costs associated with treatment of smoking attributable diseases (lung cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary infection and stroke); intervention costs; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were summarized using various ROI estimates. FINDINGS: The cost of implementing the current provision of smoking cessation services is approximately euro61 million in the current year. This translates to 18 quitters per 1000 smokers and a life-time benefit-cost ratio of 5, compared with no such provision. All alternative scenarios were dominant (cost-saving: less expensive to run and generated more QALYs) from the life-time perspective, compared with the current provision.

Next, a value of information analysis is performed to inform decisions about future research. METHODS: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis applying seemingly unrelated regressions using data from a multicentre RCT of MCST versus treatment as usual in a population which had already received 7 weeks of CST for dementia (ISRCTN: 26286067). The findings from the cost-effectiveness analysis are used to inform a value of information analysis. RESULTS: The results are dependent upon how quality adjusted life years (QALYs) are measured. MCST might be cost-effective compared to standard treatment for those who live alone and those with higher levels of cognitive functioning. If a further RCT was to be conducted for this sub-group of the population, value of information analysis suggests a total sample of 48 complete cases for both sub-groups would be required for a two-arm trial.
