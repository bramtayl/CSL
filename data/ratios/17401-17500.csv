17401,Cost-Effectiveness of Screening Patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease for Barrett's Esophagus With a Minimally Invasive Cell Sampling Device,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is important to identify patients with Barrett''s esophagus (BE), the precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Patients with BE are usually identified by endoscopy, which is expensive. The cytosponge, which collects tissue from the esophagus non-invasively, could be a cost-effective tool for screening individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), who are at increased risk for BE. We developed a model to analyze the cost effectiveness of using cytosponge in first-line screening of patients with GERD for BE with endoscopic confirmation, compared to endoscopy screening only, METHODS: We incorporated data from a large clinical trial of cytosponge performance into 2 validated microsimulation models of EAC progression (the esophageal adenocarcinoma model from the Massachusetts General Hospital and the microsimulation screening analysis model from Erasmus University Medical Center). The models had been calibrated for United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results data on EAC incidence and mortality. In each model, we simulated the effect of a 1-time screen for BE in male patients with GERD, 60 years of age, using endoscopy alone or cytosponge collection of tissue and analysis for level of trefoil factor 3 with endoscopic confirmation of positive results. For each strategy we recorded the number of cases of EAC that developed, the number of EAC cases detected screening by cytosponge only or by subsequent targeted surveillance, and the number of endoscopies needed. Additionally, we recorded the cumulative costs (including indirect costs) incurred and quality-adjusted years of life lived within each strategy, discounted at a rate of 3% per year, and computed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) among the 3 strategies. RESULTS: According to the models, screening patients with GERD by cytosponge with follow-up confirmation of positive results by endoscopy would reduce the cost of screening by 38%-41%, compared to screening by endoscopy, but led to 1.8 to 4.0 (per 1000 patients) fewer quality-adjusted life years. The ICERs for cytosponge screening compared to no screening ranged from $28,791 to $33,307. For screening patients by endoscopy compared to cytosponge, the ICERs ranged from $143,041 to $330,361. These results were sensitive to cytosponge cost within a plausible range of values. CONCLUSION: In a comparative modeling analysis of screening strategies for BE in patients with GERD, we found cytosponge screening with endoscopic confirmation to be a cost-effective strategy. The greatest benefit was achieved by endoscopic screening, but with an unfavorable cost margin.",2017-01-23707,28238953,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Curtis R Heberle,2017,/,,No,28238953,"Curtis R Heberle; Amir-Houshang Omidvari; Ayman Ali; Sonja Kroep; Chung Yin Kong; John M Inadomi; Joel H Rubenstein; Angela C Tramontano; Emily C Dowling; William D Hazelton; E Georg Luebeck; Iris Lansdorp-Vogelaar; Chin Hur; Cost-Effectiveness of Screening Patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease for Barrett's Esophagus With a Minimally Invasive Cell Sampling Device, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2017 Feb 23; ():1542-3565",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cytosponge screening for Barrett's Esophagus (BE) vs. None,Not Stated,60 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,26358,United States,2015,28781.65

17403,Cost-effectiveness of capecitabine and bevacizumab maintenance treatment after first-line induction treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer,"AIM: Capecitabine and bevacizumab (CAP-B) maintenance therapy has shown to be more effective compared with observation in metastatic colorectal cancer patients achieving stable disease or better after six cycles of first-line capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab treatment in terms of progression-free survival. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CAP-B maintenance treatment. METHODS: Decision analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CAP-B maintenance compared with observation was performed based on CAIRO3 study results (n = 558). An additional analysis was performed in patients with complete or partial response. The primary outcomes were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) defined as the additional cost per life year (LY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, calculated from EQ-5D questionnaires and literature and LYs gained. Univariable sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the influence of input parameters on the ICER, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis represents uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: CAP-B maintenance compared with observation resulted in 0.21 QALYs (0.18LYs) gained at a mean cost increase of euro36,845, yielding an ICER of euro175,452 per QALY (euro204,694 per LY). Varying the difference in health-related quality of life between CAP-B maintenance and observation influenced the ICER most. For patients achieving complete or partial response on capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab induction treatment, an ICER of euro149,300 per QALY was calculated. CONCLUSION: CAP-B maintenance results in improved health outcomes measured in QALYs and LYs compared with observation, but also in a relevant increase in costs. Despite the fact that there is no consensus on cost-effectiveness thresholds in cancer treatment, CAP-B maintenance may not be considered cost-effective.",2017-01-23710,28237866,Eur J Cancer,M D Franken,2017,75 /,204-212,No,28237866,"M D Franken; E M van Rooijen; A M May; H Koffijberg; H van Tinteren; L Mol; A J Ten Tije; G J Creemers; A M T van der Velden; B C Tanis; C A Uyl-de Groot; C J A Punt; M Koopman; M G H van Oijen; Cost-effectiveness of capecitabine and bevacizumab maintenance treatment after first-line induction treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer, Eur J Cancer, 2017 Apr; 75():0959-8049; 204-212",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Capecitabine and bevacizumab (CAP-B) maintenance vs. None,Metastatic Colorectal cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,175452,Euro,2014,255047.39
17404,Comparing the cost-effectiveness of linezolid to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: a healthcare system perspective,"OBJECTIVE: Few industry-independent studies have been conducted to compare the relative costs and benefits of drugs to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. We performed a stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two treatment strategies-linezolid versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin-for the treatment of MRSA infection. METHODS: We used cost and effectiveness data from a previously conducted clinical trial, complementing with other data from published literature, to compare the two regimens from a healthcare system perspective. Effectiveness was expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Several sensitivity analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulation, to measure the effect of potential parameter changes on the base-case model results, including potential differences related to type of infection and drug toxicity. RESULTS: Treatment of MRSA infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin and linezolid were found to cost on average euro146 and euro2536, and lead to a gain of 0.916 and 0.881 QALYs, respectively. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was found to be more cost-effective than linezolid in the base case and remained dominant over linezolid in most alternative scenarios, including different types of MRSA infection and potential disadvantages in terms of toxicity. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro0, euro50 000 and euro200 000 per QALY gained, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was dominant in 100%, 96% and 85% of model iterations. A 95% discount on the current purchasing price of linezolid would be needed when it goes off-patent for it to represent better value for money compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin.

17408,"Estimated Cost-Effectiveness, Cost Benefit, and Risk Reduction Associated with an Endocrinologist-Pharmacist Diabetes Intense Medical Management ""Tune-Up"" Clinic","BACKGROUND: In 2012 U.S. diabetes costs were estimated to be $245 billion, with $176 billion related to direct diabetes treatment and associated complications. Although a few studies have reported positive glycemic and economic benefits for diabetes patients treated under primary care physician (PCP)-pharmacist collaborative practice models, no studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of an endocrinologist-pharmacist collaborative practice model treating complex diabetes patients versus usual PCP care for similar patients. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost benefit of a collaborative endocrinologist-pharmacist Diabetes Intense Medical Management (DIMM) ""Tune-Up"" clinic for complex diabetes patients versus usual PCP care from 3 perspectives (clinic, health system, payer) and time frames. METHODS: Data from a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) >/= 8% who were referred to the DIMM clinic at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Health System were used for cost analyses against a comparator group of PCP patients meeting the same criteria. The DIMM clinic took more time with patients, compared with usual PCP visits. It provided personalized care in three 60-minute visits over 6 months, combining medication therapy management with patient-specific diabetes education, to achieve A1c treatment goals before discharge back to the PCP. Data for DIMM versus PCP patients were used to evaluate cost-effectiveness and cost benefit. Analyses included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at 6 months, 3-year estimated total medical costs avoided and return on investment (ROI), absolute risk reduction of complications, resultant medical costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 10 years. RESULTS: Base case ICER results indicated that from the clinic perspective, the DIMM clinic costs $21 per additional percentage point of A1c improvement and $115-$164 per additional patient at target A1c goal level compared with the PCP group. From the health system perspective, medical cost avoidance due to improved A1c was $8,793 per DIMM patient versus $3,506 per PCP patient (P = 0.009), resulting in an ROI of $9.01 per dollar spent. From the payer perspective, DIMM patients had estimated lower total medical costs, a greater number of QALYs gained, and appreciable risk reductions for diabetes-related complications over 2-, 5- and 10-year time frames, indicating that the DIMM clinic was dominant. Sensitivity analyses indicated results were robust, and overall conclusions did not change appreciably when key parameters (including DIMM clinic effectiveness and cost) were varied within plausible ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The DIMM clinic endocrinologist-pharmacist collaborative practice model, in which the pharmacist spent more time providing personalized care, improved glycemic control at a minimal cost per additional A1c benefit gained and produced greater cost avoidance, appreciable ROI, reduction in long-term complication risk, and lower cost for a greater gain in QALYs. Overall, the DIMM clinic represents an advanced pharmacy practice model with proven clinical and economic benefits from multiple perspectives for patients with T2DM and high medication and comorbidity complexity.

Existing evidence for cCBT has been informed by developer-led trials. This is the first study based on a large independent pragmatic trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of cCBT as an adjunct to usual general practitioner (GP) care compared with usual GP care alone and to establish the differential cost-effectiveness of a free-to-use cCBT programme (MoodGYM) in comparison with a commercial programme (Beating the Blues) in primary care. METHOD: Costs were estimated from a healthcare perspective and outcomes measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 2 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness of each cCBT programme was compared with usual GP care. Uncertainty was estimated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: Neither cCBT programme was found to be cost-effective compared with usual GP care alone. At a pound20 000 per QALY threshold, usual GP care alone had the highest probability of being cost-effective (0.55) followed by MoodGYM (0.42) and Beating the Blues (0.04).

17411,"Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Imaging-Guided Prostate Biopsy Techniques: Systematic Transrectal Ultrasound, Direct In-Bore MRI, and Image Fusion","OBJECTIVE: Three commonly used prostate biopsy approaches are systematic transrectal ultrasound guided, direct in-bore MRI guided, and image fusion guided. The aim of this study was to calculate which strategy is most cost-effective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model were developed to compare cost-effectiveness. Literature review and expert opinion were used as input. A strategy was deemed cost-effective if the costs of gaining one quality-adjusted life year (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) did not exceed the willingness-to-pay threshold of euro80,000 ( approximately $85,000 in January 2017). A base case analysis was performed to compare systematic transrectal ultrasound- and image fusion-guided biopsies. Because of a lack of appropriate literature regarding the accuracy of direct in-bore MRI-guided biopsy, a threshold analysis was performed. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for fusion-guided biopsy compared with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was euro1386 ($1470) per quality-adjusted life year gained, which was below the willingness-to-pay threshold and thus assumed cost-effective. If MRI findings are normal in a patient with clinically significant prostate cancer, the sensitivity of direct in-bore MRI-guided biopsy has to be at least 88.8%. If that is the case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is euro80,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained and thus cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Fusion-guided biopsy seems to be cost-effective compared with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Future research is needed to determine whether direct in-bore MRI-guided biopsy is the best pathway; in this study a threshold was calculated at which it would be cost-effective.",2017-01-23735,28225639,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Wulphert Venderink,2017,208 / 5,1058-1063,No,28225639,"Wulphert Venderink; Tim M Govers; Maarten de Rooij; Jurgen J Futterer; J P Michiel Sedelaar; Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Imaging-Guided Prostate Biopsy Techniques: Systematic Transrectal Ultrasound, Direct In-Bore MRI, and Image Fusion, AJR Am J Roentgenol, 2017 May; 208(5):0361-803X; 1058-1063",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion guided prostate biopsy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Transrectal Ultrasound guided prostate biopsy,Biopsy-naive patients in whom clinically significant prostate cancer was suspected on the basis of an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level or abnormal digital rectal examination finding,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,18 Years,4.00,1.50,1386,Euro,2017,1653.73
17412,Liraglutide Versus Lixisenatide: Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Therapy for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in Spain,"INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are used successfully in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes as they are associated with low hypoglycemia rates, weight loss and improved glycemic control. This study compared, in the Spanish setting, the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 mug, both GLP-1 receptor agonists, for patients with type 2 diabetes who had not achieved glycemic control targets on metformin monotherapy. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical outcomes and costs, expressed in 2015 Euros, over patient lifetimes. Baseline cohort data and treatment effects were taken from the 26-week, open-label LIRA-LIXI trial (NCT01973231). Treatment and management costs of diabetes-related complications were retrieved from published sources and databases. Future benefits and costs were discounted by 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with lixisenatide 20 mug, liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with higher life expectancy (14.42 vs. 14.29 years), higher quality-adjusted life expectancy [9.40 versus 9.26 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications. Higher acquisition costs resulted in higher total costs for liraglutide 1.8 mg (EUR 42,689) than for lixisenatide 20 mug (EUR 42,143), but these were partly offset by reduced costs of treating diabetes-related complications (EUR 29,613 vs. EUR 30,636). Projected clinical outcomes and costs resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 4113 per QALY gained for liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 mug. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections in the Spanish setting suggest that liraglutide 1.8 mg is likely to be cost-effective compared with lixisenatide 20 mug in type 2 diabetes patients who have not achieved glycemic control targets on metformin monotherapy. Liraglutide 1.8 mg presents a clinically and economically attractive treatment option in the Spanish setting.",2017-01-23736,28224463,Diabetes Ther,Pedro Mezquita-Raya,2017,8 / 2,401-415,No,28224463,"Pedro Mezquita-Raya; Antonio Ramirez de Arellano; Nana Kragh; Gabriela Vega-Hernandez; Johannes Pohlmann; William J Valentine; Barnaby Hunt; Liraglutide Versus Lixisenatide: Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Therapy for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in Spain, Diabetes Ther, 2017 Apr; 8(2):1869-6953; 401-415",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Liraglutide vs. Lixisenatide 20lg,Patients with diabetes type II who failed to achieve glycemic control on metformin mnotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 20 years, 10 years",3.00,3.00,4113,Euro,2015,4984.01
17413,Cost-Effectiveness of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in BRAF Wild-Type Advanced Melanoma,"Purpose Patients who are diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma have an estimated 5-year relative survival rate of only 17%. Randomized controlled trials of recent US Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors-pembrolizumab (PEM), nivolumab (NIVO), and ipilumumab (IPI)-demonstrate improved patient outcomes, but the optimal treatment sequence in patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma remains unclear. To inform policy makers about the value of these treatments, we developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for sequencing novel agents for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Materials and Methods We developed Markov models by using a US-payer perspective and lifetime horizon to estimate costs (2016 US$) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for treatment sequences with first-line NIVO, IPI, NIVO + IPI, PEM every 2 weeks, and PEM every 3 weeks. Health states were defined for initial treatment, first and second progression, and death. Rates for drug discontinuation, frequency of adverse events, disease progression, and death obtained from randomized phase III trials were used to determine the likelihood of transition between states. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty. Results PEM every 3 weeks followed by second-line IPI was both more effective and less costly than dacarbazine followed by IPI then NIVO, or IPI followed by NIVO. Compared with the first-line dacarbazine treatment strategy, NIVO followed by IPI produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $90,871/QALY, and first-line NIVO + IPI followed by carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $198,867/QALY.

We therefore aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a H. pylori serology-based screening program in New Zealand, a country that includes population groups with relatively high gastric cancer rates. METHODS: A Markov model was developed using life-tables and morbidity data from a national burden of disease study. The modelled screening program reduced the incidence of non-cardia gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori, if infection was identified by serology screening, and for the population expected to be reached by the screening program. A health system perspective was taken and detailed individual-level costing data was used. RESULTS: For adults aged 25-69 years old, nation-wide screening for H. pylori was found to have an incremental cost of US$196 million (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI]: $182-$211 million) with health gains of 14,200 QALYs (95% UI: 5,100-26,300).

We therefore aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a H. pylori serology-based screening program in New Zealand, a country that includes population groups with relatively high gastric cancer rates. METHODS: A Markov model was developed using life-tables and morbidity data from a national burden of disease study. The modelled screening program reduced the incidence of non-cardia gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori, if infection was identified by serology screening, and for the population expected to be reached by the screening program.

17425,Cost-effectiveness of grass pollen SCIT compared with SLIT and symptomatic treatment,"BACKGROUND: Whereas specific immunotherapy (SIT) has already been shown to be cost-effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis compared with symptomatic treatment, only a small number of investigations have compared sublingual (SLIT) and subcutaneous (SCIT) immunotherapeutic approaches. This analysis discusses the cost-effectiveness of SCIT compared with SLIT and a symptomatic treatment modality. At the same time, particular attention is paid to preparation-specific characteristics. METHODS: The investigation is based on a previously published health economic model calculation. A Markov model, with predefined disease stages and a time period of 9 years, formed the basis of the analysis. The data on specific SCIT (Allergovit(R)) and SLIT (Oralair(R)) preparations required for the calculation were adjusted for the present analysis. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on symptom scores were calculated as the endpoint for effectiveness. Furthermore, the total costs and cost effectiveness of SCIT were determined. Model uncertainties were estimated by means of additional sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: With regard to effectiveness, both the SCIT and SLIT preparations proved superior compared to symptomatic treatment. Although more expensive, SIT seem to be cost-effective. A direct comparison of SCIT (Allergovit(R)) and SLIT (Oralair(R)) showed lower total costs for SCIT treatment over the study period (SCIT 1159 euro versus SLIT 1322 euro) and improved effectiveness (SCIT 7.112 QALYs versus SLIT 7.060 QALYs). DISCUSSION: SIT represents a cost-effective treatment option for patients with allergic rhinitis compared with symptomatic treatment. The comparison of SCIT (Allergovit(R)) and SLIT (Oralair(R)) showed SCIT to be predominant and cost-effective, due in particular to somewhat greater patient compliance and lower drug costs. It also became evident that, as far as possible, product-specific model variables are required for an economic evaluation of SIT treatment.",2017-01-23746,28217432,Allergo J Int,Thomas Reinhold,2017,26 / 1,7-15,No,28217432,"Thomas Reinhold; Bernd Bruggenjurgen; Cost-effectiveness of grass pollen SCIT compared with SLIT and symptomatic treatment, Allergo J Int, 2017; 26(1):2197-0378; 7-15",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) vs. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT),Patients with grass pollen associated allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,9 Years,3.00,3.00,11000,United States,2015,12011.46
17426,Cost-Effectiveness of Intensifying Lipid-Lowering Therapy With Statins Based on Individual Absolute Benefit in Coronary Artery Disease Patients,"BACKGROUND: A validated prediction model estimates the absolute benefit of intensive versus standard lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) with statins on next major cardiovascular events for individual patients with coronary artery disease. We aimed to assess whether targeting intensive LLT therapy to coronary artery disease patients with the highest predicted absolute benefit is cost-effective compared to treating all with standard or all with intensive LLT. METHODS AND RESULTS: A lifetime Markov model was constructed for coronary artery disease patients (n=10 000) with mean age 61 years. Number of major cardiovascular events, (non) vascular death, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for the following strategies: (1) standard LLT for all (reference strategy); (2) intensive LLT for those with 5-year absolute major cardiovascular events risk reduction (ARR) >/=3%, >/=2.3%, or >/=1.5% (corresponding to >/=20%, >/=15%, or >/=10% 5-year major cardiovascular events risk); and (3) intensive LLT for all. With intensive LLT for those with >/=3% 5-year ARR (13% of patients), 380 QALYs were gained for euro2423/QALY. Using a threshold of >/=2.3% ARR (26% of patients), 630 QALYs were gained for euro5653/QALY. Using a threshold of >/=1.5% ARR (56% of patients), 1020 QALYs were gained for euro10 960/QALY. By treating all intensively, 1410 QALYs were gained (0.14 QALY per patient) for euro17 223/QALY. With benefit-based treatment, 0.16 to 0.17 QALY was gained per treated patient. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive LLT with statins for all coronary artery disease patients results in the highest overall QALY gain against acceptable costs. However, the number of QALYs gained with intensive LLT by statins in individual patients can be increased with selective benefit-based treatment.

17430,Economic evaluation of universal prenatal HIV screening compared with current 'at risk' policy in a very low prevalence country,"OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to economically evaluate universal HIV prenatal screening in Israel, a very low prevalence country (0.1%), compared with the current policy of testing only women belonging to high-risk (HR) groups. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analytical model was constructed. Life expectancies, direct medical costs and utility weights of an HIV-positive newborn and a healthy newborn were derived from the literature. Screening was assessed using fourth-generation combo tests. Structural uncertainties were discussed with leading Israeli HIV experts. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainty of the model''s parameters. RESULTS: Under the current policy, about 2700 women are tested annually identifying 27 HIV-positive women. With the universal screening, 171 000 women would be tested yearly identifying 37 as HIV positive. The analysis included the increased life expectancy of vertically infected children based on current standards of care. Over the lifetime expectancy, universal screening is projected to grant 15 additional quality-adjusted life years and save $177 521 when compared with the current HR only policy.

17431,Cost-effectiveness of the 2014 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendations for Intensive Behavioral Counseling Interventions for Adults With Cardiovascular Risk Factors,"OBJECTIVE: In 2014, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended behavioral counseling interventions for overweight or obese adults with the following known cardiovascular disease risk factors: impaired fasting glucose (IFG), hypertension, dyslipidemia, or metabolic syndrome. We assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness (CE) of implementing the recommended interventions in the U.S. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a disease progression model to simulate the 25-year CE of the USPSTF recommendation for eligible U.S. adults and subgroups defined by a combination of the risk factors. The baseline population was estimated using 2005-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The cost and effectiveness of the intervention were obtained from systematic reviews. Incremental CE ratios (ICERs), measured in cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), were used to assess the CE of the intervention compared with no intervention. Future QALYs and costs (reported in 2014 U.S. dollars) were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: We estimated that approximately 98 million U.S. adults (44%) would be eligible for the recommended intervention. Compared with no intervention, the ICER of the intervention would be $13,900/QALY. CE varied widely among subgroups, ranging from a cost saving of $302 per capita for those who were obese with IFG, hypertension, and dyslipidemia to a cost of $103,200/QALY in overweight people without these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended intervention is cost effective based on the conventional CE threshold. Considerable variation in CE across the recommended subpopulations suggests that prioritization based on risk level would yield larger total health gains per dollar spent.",2017-01-23753,28213373,Diabetes Care,Ji Lin,2017,40 / 5,640-646,No,28213373,"Ji Lin; Xiaohui Zhuo; Barbara Bardenheier; Deborah B Rolka; W Edward Gregg; Yuling Hong; Guijing Wang; Ann Albright; Ping Zhang; Cost-effectiveness of the 2014 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendations for Intensive Behavioral Counseling Interventions for Adults With Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Diabetes Care, 2017 May; 40(5):0149-5992; 640-646",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,2014 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendations for Intensive Behavioral Counseling Interventions vs. None,"overweight or obese adults with the following known cardiovascular disease risk factors: impaired fasting glucose (IFG), hypertension, dyslipidemia, or metabolic syndrome",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,13900,United States,2014,15196.14
17432,Costs and Outcomes of Increasing Access to Bariatric Surgery: Cohort Study and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Using Electronic Health Records,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate costs and outcomes of increasing access to bariatric surgery in obese adults and in population subgroups of age, sex, deprivation, comorbidity, and obesity category. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using primary care electronic health records, with linked hospital utilization data, for 3,045 participants who underwent bariatric surgery and 247,537 participants who did not undergo bariatric surgery. Epidemiological analyses informed a probabilistic Markov model to compare bariatric surgery, including equal proportions with adjustable gastric banding, gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy, with standard nonsurgical management of obesity. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and net monetary benefits at a threshold of pound30,000 per QALY. RESULTS: In a UK population of 250,000 adults, there may be 7,163 people with morbid obesity including 1,406 with diabetes. The immediate cost of 1,000 bariatric surgical procedures is pound9.16 million, with incremental discounted lifetime health care costs of pound15.26 million (95% confidence interval pound15.18- pound15.36 million). Patient-years with diabetes mellitus will decrease by 8,320 (range 8,123-8,502). Incremental QALYs will increase by 2,142 (range 2,032-2,256). The estimated cost per QALY gained is pound7,129 (range pound6,775- pound7,506). Net monetary benefits will be pound49.02 million (range pound45.72- pound52.41 million).

METHODS: A simple, short-term model was used to evaluate the costs and effects of treatment with IDeg versus IGlar U100 over a 12-month period in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. New-to-market basal insulin analogues were evaluated in scenario analyses. RESULTS: IDeg is dominant (more effective and less costly) versus IGlar U100 in patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM on a basal-only therapy regimen (T2DMBOT), and is cost-effective versus IGlar U100 in patients with T2DM on a basal-bolus regimen (T2DMB/B). In T1DM, lower costs are primarily driven by lower insulin costs, as a result of a lower daily dose of IDeg. In T2DMBOT, lower overall costs with IDeg are driven by lower costs of severe hypoglycaemic events due to the significant reduction in number of events with IDeg versus IGlar U100. Improvements in clinical outcomes in all three patient groups are a result of the reduced incidence of hypoglycaemic events. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the results are robust. Scenario analyses versus two new-to-market basal insulin analogues indicate that in patients with T1DM and T2DMBOT, IDeg is likely to be highly cost-effective versus IGlar biosimilar Abasaglar(R) and dominant versus IGlar U300 (Toujeo(R)). In T2DMB/B, IDeg is likely to be cost-effective versus both comparators, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below the accepted threshold.

17436,Cost-effectiveness of denosumab versus oral alendronate for elderly osteoporotic women in Japan,"We constructed a Markov microsimulation model among hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling elderly osteoporotic Japanese women without prior hip or vertebral fractures over a lifetime horizon. Compared with weekly oral alendronate for 5 years, denosumab every 6 months for 5 years is cost-saving or cost-effective at a conventionally accepted threshold. INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous denosumab every 6 months for 5 years compared with weekly oral alendronate for 5 years in Japan. METHODS: We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] (2016 US dollars [$] per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), using a Markov microsimulation model among hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling osteoporotic Japanese women without prior hip or vertebral fractures at various ages of therapy initiation (65, 70, 75, and 80 years) over a lifetime horizon from three perspectives: societal, healthcare sector, and government. RESULTS: Denosumab was cost-saving compared with alendronate at ages 75 and 80 years from any of the three perspectives. The ICERs of denosumab compared with alendronate were $25,700 and $5000 per QALY at ages 65 and 70 years from a societal perspective and did not exceed a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY from the other two perspectives. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to changes in the effectiveness of denosumab for reducing hip fracture and clinical vertebral fracture and the rate ratio of non-persistence with denosumab compared to alendronate. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of denosumab being cost-effective compared with alendronate were 89-100% at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY.

RESULTS: Denosumab was cost-saving compared with alendronate at ages 75 and 80 years from any of the three perspectives. The ICERs of denosumab compared with alendronate were $25,700 and $5000 per QALY at ages 65 and 70 years from a societal perspective and did not exceed a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY from the other two perspectives. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to changes in the effectiveness of denosumab for reducing hip fracture and clinical vertebral fracture and the rate ratio of non-persistence with denosumab compared to alendronate. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of denosumab being cost-effective compared with alendronate were 89-100% at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Among community-dwelling elderly osteoporotic women in Japan, denosumab every 6 months for 5 years is cost-saving or cost-effective at a conventionally accepted threshold of willingness-to-pay at all ages examined, compared with weekly alendronate for 5 years.

17445,The cost-effectiveness of a NSCLC patient assistance program for pemetrexed maintenance therapy in People's Republic of China,"BACKGROUND: Eli Lilly and the China Primary Health Care Foundation are currently implementing a patient assistance program (PAP) in China, which allows first-line nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who complete four cycles of pemetrexed induction therapy to receive free, continuous pemetrexed maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed maintenance therapy vs basic standard care (BSC) and the economic impacts of providing a PAP for pemetrexed maintenance therapy to NSCLC patients who have completed pemetrexed induction therapy in a Chinese health care setting. METHODS: We developed a novel decision-analytic model to evaluate the long-term costs and clinical efficacy of pemetrexed plus BSC vs BSC alone. We utilized a three-state (progression-free survival, progressed disease, and dead) partition survival model for both the clinical and economic aspects of the analysis. Cost and health utility estimates were derived from the literature. We performed a scenario analysis to estimate the real-world impact of introducing the PAP in China by comparing the use of the PAP vs non-PAP. Model uncertainty was evaluated using one-way and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Compared to BSC, pemetrexed plus BSC resulted in a gain of 0.22 years of life (95% credible range [CR]: 0.04-0.46) and 0.13 quality-adjusted life years (95% CR: 0.04-0.26) per patient, at an increased cost of $28,105 (95% CR: -$22,720 to $48,646) without a PAP and $3,068 (95% CR: -$1,263 to $9,163) with a PAP. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for pemetrexed plus BSC vs BSC alone was cost-prohibitive at $222,700 for non-PAP, but cost-effective at $24,319 with a PAP. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that maintenance pemetrexed therapy following pemetrexed induction for patients with advanced NSCLC is likely to be highly non-cost-effective in the absence of a PAP, but the pending implementation of the PAP promises to make it cost-effective, with a >90% probability of cost-effectiveness at a Chinese willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life year.",2017-01-23769,28210100,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Qiang Shi,2017,9 /,99-106,No,28210100,"Qiang Shi; Shanlian Hu; Wesley E Furnback; Gregory F Guzauskas; Jiejing Shen; Bruce Cm Wang; The cost-effectiveness of a NSCLC patient assistance program for pemetrexed maintenance therapy in People's Republic of China, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2017; 9():1178-6981; 99-106",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pemetrexed maintenance chemotherapy in addition to best supportive care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Best supportive care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,24319,United States,2013,27017.97
17446,Cost-utility of First-line Disease-modifying Treatments for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatments of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (dimethyl fumarate [DMF] 240 mg PO BID, teriflunomide 14 mg once daily, glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC once daily, interferon [IFN]-beta1a 44 microg TIW, IFN-beta1b 250 microg EOD, and IFN-beta1a 30 microg IM QW) and best supportive care (BSC) in the health care payer setting in Finland. METHODS: The primary outcome was the modeled incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; euro/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained, 3%/y discounting). Markov cohort modeling with a 15-year time horizon was employed. During each 1-year modeling cycle, patients either maintained the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or experienced progression, developed secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or showed EDSS progression in SPMS, experienced relapse with/without hospitalization, experienced an adverse event (AE), or died. Patients characteristics, RRMS progression probabilities, and standardized mortality ratios were derived from a registry of patients with MS in Finland. A mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) informed the treatment effects. Finnish EuroQol Five-Dimensional Questionnaire, Three-Level Version quality-of-life and direct-cost estimates associated with EDSS scores, relapses, and AEs were applied. Four approaches were used to assess the outcomes: cost-effectiveness plane and efficiency frontiers (relative value of efficient treatments); cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, which demonstrated optimal treatment to maximize net benefit; Bayesian treatment ranking (BTR); and an impact investment assessment (IIA; a cost-benefit assessment), which increased the clinical interpretation and appeal of modeled outcomes in terms of absolute benefit gained with fixed drug-related budget. Robustness of results was tested extensively with sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Based on the modeled results, teriflunomide was less costly, with greater QALYs, versus glatiramer acetate and the IFNs. Teriflunomide had the lowest ICER (24,081) versus BSC. DMF brought marginally more QALYs (0.089) than did teriflunomide, with greater costs over the 15 years. The ICER for DMF versus teriflunomide was 75,431. Teriflunomide had >50% cost-effectiveness probabilities with a willingness-to-pay threshold of <euro77,416/QALY gained. According to BTR, teriflunomide was first-best among the disease-modifying therapies, with potential willingness-to-pay thresholds of up to euro68,000/QALY gained. In the IIA, teriflunomide was associated with the longest incremental quality-adjusted survival and time without cane use.

METHODS: The primary outcome was the modeled incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; euro/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained, 3%/y discounting). Markov cohort modeling with a 15-year time horizon was employed. During each 1-year modeling cycle, patients either maintained the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or experienced progression, developed secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or showed EDSS progression in SPMS, experienced relapse with/without hospitalization, experienced an adverse event (AE), or died. Patients characteristics, RRMS progression probabilities, and standardized mortality ratios were derived from a registry of patients with MS in Finland. A mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) informed the treatment effects. Finnish EuroQol Five-Dimensional Questionnaire, Three-Level Version quality-of-life and direct-cost estimates associated with EDSS scores, relapses, and AEs were applied. Four approaches were used to assess the outcomes: cost-effectiveness plane and efficiency frontiers (relative value of efficient treatments); cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, which demonstrated optimal treatment to maximize net benefit; Bayesian treatment ranking (BTR); and an impact investment assessment (IIA; a cost-benefit assessment), which increased the clinical interpretation and appeal of modeled outcomes in terms of absolute benefit gained with fixed drug-related budget. Robustness of results was tested extensively with sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Based on the modeled results, teriflunomide was less costly, with greater QALYs, versus glatiramer acetate and the IFNs. Teriflunomide had the lowest ICER (24,081) versus BSC.

17458,Economic evaluation of mobile phone text message interventions to improve adherence to HIV therapy in Kenya,"BACKGROUND: A surge in mobile phone availability has fueled low cost short messaging service (SMS) adherence interventions. Multiple systematic reviews have concluded that some SMS-based interventions are effective at improving antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and they are hypothesized to improve retention in care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SMS-based adherence interventions and explore the added value of retention benefits. METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of weekly SMS interventions compared to standard care among HIV+ individuals initiating ART for the first time in Kenya. We used an individual level micro-simulation model populated with data from two SMS-intervention trials, an East-African HIV+ cohort and published literature. We estimated average quality adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime HIV-related costs from a healthcare perspective. We explored a wide range of scenarios and assumptions in one-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We found that SMS-based adherence interventions were cost-effective by WHO standards, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1,037/QALY. In the secondary analysis, potential retention benefits improved the cost-effectiveness of SMS intervention (ICER = $864/QALY). In multivariate sensitivity analyses, the interventions remained cost-effective in most analyses, but the ICER was highly sensitive to intervention costs, effectiveness and average cohort CD4 count at ART initiation. SMS interventions remained cost-effective in a test and treat scenario where individuals were assumed to initiate ART upon HIV detection.

17460,Cost-effectiveness of groin hernia repair from a randomized clinical trial comparing commercial versus low-cost mesh in a low-income country,"BACKGROUND: Over 200 million people worldwide live with groin hernia and 20 million are operated on each year. In resource-scarce settings, the superior surgical technique using a synthetic mesh is not affordable. A low-cost alternative is needed. The objective of this study was to calculate and compare costs and cost-effectiveness of inguinal hernia mesh repair using a low-cost versus a commercial mesh in a rural setting in Uganda. METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis of a double-blinded RCT comparing outcomes from groin hernia mesh repair using a low-cost mesh and a commercially available mesh. Cost-effectiveness was expressed in US dollars (with euros in parentheses, exchange rate 30 December 2016) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The cost difference resulting from the choice of mesh was $124.7 (euro118.1). In the low-cost mesh group, the cost per DALY averted and QALY gained were $16.8 (euro15.9) and $7.6 (euro7.2) respectively. The corresponding costs were $58.2 (euro55.1) and $33.3 (euro31.5) in the commercial mesh group. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken including cost variations and different health outcome scenarios. The maximum costs per DALY averted and QALY gained were $148.4 (euro140.5) and $84.7 (euro80.2) respectively. CONCLUSION: Repair using both meshes was highly cost-effective in the study setting. A potential cost reduction of over $120 (nearly euro120) per operation with use of the low-cost mesh is important if the mesh technique is to be made available to the many millions of patients in countries with limited resources.

17461,Dalteparin or vitamin K antagonists to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism in cancer patients: a patient-level economic analysis for France and Austria,"BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend extended duration secondary prophylaxis in cancer patients who develop primary venous thromboembolism (VTE). Agent selection is guided in part by one large randomized trial (i.e., CLOT; Lee et al., N Engl J Med 349:146-53, 2003) which demonstrated that dalteparin reduced the relative risk of recurrence by 52% compared with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKA; HR = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.77). In a subgroup analysis from that same trial, patients with renal impairment also derived benefit with dalteparin (VTE rates = 3% vs. 17%; p = 0.011). To measure the economic value of secondary VTE prophylaxis with dalteparin, a patient-level pharmacoeconomic analysis was conducted from the Austrian and French healthcare system perspectives. METHODS: Chapter 1 Healthcare resource use collected during the CLOT trial was extracted and converted into direct cost estimates. Incremental cost differences between the dalteparin and VKA groups were then combined with health state utilities to measure the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The dalteparin group had significantly higher costs than the VKA group in both countries (Austria: dalteparin = euro2687 vs. VKA = euro2012; France: dalteparin = euro2053 vs. VKA = euro1352: p < 0.001). However, when the incremental costs were combined with the utility gain, dalteparin had a cost of euro6600 and euro4900 per QALY gained in Austria and France, respectively.

17463,The Cost-effectiveness of Sequences of Biological Disease-modifying Antirheumatic Drug Treatment in England for Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Can Tolerate Methotrexate,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether strategies of treatment with a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) are cost-effective in an English setting. Results are presented for those patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and those with severe RA. METHODS: An economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 7 bDMARD was developed. A systematic literature review and network metaanalysis was undertaken to establish relative clinical effectiveness. The results were used to populate the model, together with estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score following European League Against Rheumatism response; annual costs, and utility, per HAQ band; trajectory of HAQ for patients taking bDMARD; and trajectory of HAQ for patients using nonbiologic therapy (NBT). Results were presented as those associated with the strategy with the median cost-effectiveness. Supplementary analyses were undertaken assessing the change in cost-effectiveness when only patients with the most severe prognoses taking NBT were provided with bDMARD treatment. The costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) values were compared with reported thresholds from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence of pound20,000 to pound30,000 (US$24,700 to US$37,000). RESULTS: In the primary analyses, the cost per QALY of a bDMARD strategy was pound41,600 for patients with severe RA and pound51,100 for those with moderate to severe RA. Under the supplementary analyses, the cost per QALY fell to pound25,300 for those with severe RA and to pound28,500 for those with moderate to severe RA.

17465,Economic Analysis and Budget Impact of Tenofovir and Entecavir in the First-Line Treatment of Hepatitis B Virus in Italy,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B is a common, progressive disease, particularly when viral replication is detected. Oral antivirals can suppress viral replication and prevent or delay the development of cirrhosis and liver-related complications. The treatments of chronic hepatitis B cannot totally cure the disease but can prevent its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma, decreasing the levels of both morbidity and mortality. To date, there are several therapies indicated by the international guidelines as first-line treatments for the management of hepatitis B; two of the most effective are those based on either tenofovir or entecavir. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tenofovir and entecavir in the treatment of naive patients with chronic hepatitis B. The two treatments are compared with the ""no treatment"" and to one another. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model; patients entered one of the following health states: chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated), hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation or death. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service by considering a life-time horizon with cycles lasting 1 year and with costs and QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) discounted at a rate of 3.5%. The results of the model were analysed in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: ICERs for tenofovir and entecavir emerging from the comparison versus ""no treatment"" were equal to euro10,274.73 and euro16,300.44 per QALY gained, respectively, on the life-time horizon. Tenofovir was dominant in the direct comparison with entecavir, indicating more QALYs and a lower consumption of resources. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that in 97% (tenofovir) and in 85% (entecavir) of the scenarios performed, the cost per QALY fell below the threshold of euro30,000/QALY. The budget impact analysis showed savings for tenofovir amounting to 33% compared to entecavir in the first year on treatment and to 31% in following years. CONCLUSIONS: Entecavir and tenofovir are recommended for the treatment of patients with chronic Hepatitis B in the Italian Health System.

17468,Cost-Effectiveness of Autologous Stem Cell Treatment as Compared to Conventional Chemotherapy for Treatment of Multiple Myeloma in India,"Recent innovations in treatment of multiple myeloma include autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) along with high dose chemotherapy (HDC). We undertook this study to estimate incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY) with use of ASCT along with HDC as compared to conventional chemotherapy (CC) alone in treatment of multiple myeloma. A combination of decision tree and markov model was used to undertake the analysis. Incremental costs and effects of ASCT were compared against the baseline scenario of CC (based on Melphalan and Prednisolone regimen) in the patients of multiple myeloma. A lifetime study horizon was used and future costs and consequences were discounted at 5%. Consequences were valued in terms of QALYs. Incremental cost per QALY gained using ASCT as against CC for treatment of multiple myeloma was estimated using both a health system and societal perspective. The cost of providing ASCT (with HDC) for multiple myeloma patients was INR 500,631, while the cost of CC alone was INR 159,775. In the long run, cost per patient per year for ASCT and CC arms was estimated to be INR 119,740 and INR 111,565 respectively. The number of QALYs lived per patient in case of ASCT and HDC alone were found to be 4.1 and 3.5 years respectively. From a societal perspective, ASCT was found to incur an incremental cost of INR 334,433 per QALY gained. If the ASCT is initiated early to patients, the incremental cost for ASCT was found to be INR 180,434 per QALY gained. With current mix of patients, stem cell treatment for multiple myeloma is not cost effective at a threshold of GDP per capita. It becomes marginally cost-effective at 3-times the GDP per capita threshold. However, accounting for the model uncertainties, the probability of ASCT to be cost effective is 59%.

17469,Cost-effectiveness of Pazopanib Versus Sunitinib as First-line Treatment for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma from an Italian National Health Service Perspective,"PURPOSE: A prior randomized controlled trial (COMPARZ [Comparing the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Pazopanib versus Sunitinib]) found non-inferior progression-free survival for pazopanib versus sunitinib as first-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma from an Italian National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A partitioned-survival analysis model with 3 health states (progression-free survival, post-progression survival, and dead) was employed. The model time horizon was 5 years. For each treatment strategy, the model generated expected progression-free life years, post-progression life years, overall life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. Results were reported as incremental costs per QALY gained and the net monetary benefit of pazopanib versus sunitinib. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact on results of methodological and parameter uncertainty. FINDINGS: In the base case, pazopanib was associated with higher QALYs and lower costs and dominated sunitinib. Using willingness-to-pay thresholds of euro30,000 and euro50,000 per QALY, the net monetary benefits with pazopanib were euro6508 and euro7702 per patient, respectively, versus sunitinib. The probability that pazopanib is cost-effective versus sunitinib was estimated to be 85% at a cost-effectiveness threshold of euro20,000, 86% at a threshold of euro30,000, and 81% at a threshold of euro50,000 per QALY. Results were robust to changes in key parameter values and assumptions.

17472,Long-term economic evaluation of cognitive-behavioural group treatment versus enhanced usual care for functional somatic syndromes,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with functional somatic syndromes (FSS) such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome have a poor outcome and can incur high healthcare and societal costs. We aimed to compare the medium-term (16months) cost-effectiveness and the long-term (40months) economic outcomes of a bespoke cognitive-behavioural group treatment (STreSS) with that of enhanced usual care (EUC). METHODS: We obtained complete data on healthcare and indirect costs (i.e. labour marked-related and health-related benefits) from public registries for 120 participants from a randomised controlled trial. Costs were calculated as per capita public expenses in 2010 euro. QALYs gained were estimated from the SF-6D. We conducted a medium-term cost-effectiveness analysis and a long-term cost-minimization analysis from both a healthcare (i.e. direct cost) and a societal (i.e. total cost) perspective. RESULTS: In the medium term, the probability that STreSS was cost-effective at thresholds of 25,000 to 35,000 euro per QALY was 93-95% from a healthcare perspective, but only 50-55% from a societal perspective. In the long term, however, STreSS was associated with increasing savings in indirect costs, mainly due to a greater number of patients self-supporting. When combined with stable long-term reductions in healthcare expenditures, there were total cost savings of 7184 euro (95% CI 2271 to 12,096, p=0.004) during the third year after treatment. CONCLUSION: STreSS treatment costs an average of 1545 euro. This cost was more than offset by subsequent savings in direct and indirect costs.

17473,Cost-effectiveness analysis of late prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment for severe haemophilia A in Italy,"INTRODUCTION: Long-term regular administrations of factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate (prophylaxis) initiated at an early age prevents bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A (HA). The 5-year prospective Italian POTTER study provided evidence of benefits in adolescents and adults of late prophylaxis (LP) vs. on-demand therapy (OD) in reducing bleeding episodes and joint morbidity and improving quality of life; however, costs were increased. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of LP vs. OD with sucrose-formulated recombinant FVIII in adolescents and adults with severe HA in Italy. METHODS: A Markov model evaluated lifetime cost-effectiveness of LP vs. OD in patients with severe HA in Italy, from both the healthcare and societal perspectives. Clinical input parameters were taken from the POTTER study and published literature. Health utility values were assigned to each health state as measured by the joint disease severity Pettersson score. Costs were expressed in Euro (euro) 2014, including drug and other medical costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed considering societal perspective (including productivity lost) and varying relative risk of bleeding episodes between regimens. Clinical outcomes and costs were discounted at 6% according to previous studies. RESULTS: Lifetime incremental discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were +4.26, whereas incremental discounted costs were +euro229,694 from a healthcare perspective, with estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) equal to euro53,978/QALY. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the base-case results showing lower ICERs with the societal perspective.

17474,Management of continuous positive airway pressure treatment compliance using telemonitoring in obstructive sleep apnoea,"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but treatment compliance is often unsatisfactory. This study investigated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring for improving CPAP compliance.100 newly diagnosed OSA patients requiring CPAP (apnoea-hypopnoea index >15 events.h-1) were randomised to standard management or a telemonitoring programme that collected daily information about compliance, air leaks and residual respiratory events, and initiated patient contact to resolve issues. Clinical/anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness and quality of life were recorded at baseline and after 3 months. Patient satisfaction, additional visits/calls, side-effects and total costs were assessed.There were no significant differences between the standard and telemedicine groups in terms of CPAP compliance (4.9+/-2.2 versus 5.1+/-2.1 h.night-1), symptoms, clinical variables, quality of life and unwanted effects. Telemedicine was less expensive than standard management (EUR123.65 versus EUR170.97; p=0.022) and was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio EUR17 358.65 per quality-adjusted life-year gained). Overall patient satisfaction was high, but significantly more patients rated satisfaction as high/very high in the standard management versus telemedicine group (96% versus 74%; p=0.034).Telemonitoring did not improve CPAP treatment compliance and was associated with lower patient satisfaction.

17475,The cost-effectiveness of real-time pulmonary artery pressure monitoring in heart failure patients: a European perspective,"AIMS: Heart failure (HF) treatment guided by physicians with access to real-time pressure measurement from a wireless implantable pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) sensor (CardioMEMS), has previously been shown to reduce HF-related hospital admissions in the CHAMPION trial. However, uncertainty remains regarding the value of CardioMEMS in European health systems where healthcare costs are significantly lower than in the USA. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PAP-guided treatment of HF using the CardioMEMS HF system compared with usual care. Cost-effectiveness was measured as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In the base case analysis over a time horizon of 10 years, PAP-guided HF therapy increased cost compared with usual care by pound10 916 (euro14 030). QALYs per patient for usual care and PAP-guided patients were 2.57 and 3.14, respectively, reflecting an increase of 0.57 QALYs with PAP-guided treatment. The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is pound19 274 (euro24 772) per QALY gained. The base case analysis did not include staff time, due to a lack of data concerning this variable. Running the model with estimated staff time included resulted in an increased ICER of between pound22 342 and pound25 464 per QALY gained (euro28 709-32 721).

17476,Cost-utility analysis of dynamic intraligamentary stabilization versus early reconstruction after rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) technique in comparison with reconstructive surgery (ACLR) in the treatment of isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures from the perspective of the community of insured citizens in Germany. METHODS: Because of the specific decision problem at hand, namely that with DIS the procedure has to take place within 21 days after the initial trauma, a decision tree was developed. The time horizon of the model was set to 3 years. Input data was taken from official tariffs, payer data, the literature and assumptions based on expert opinion when necessary. RESULTS: The decision tree analysis identified the DIS strategy as the superior one with 2.34 QALY versus 2.26 QALY for the ACLR branch. The higher QALY also came with higher costs of 5,398.05 euro for the DIS branch versus 4,632.68 euro for the ACLR branch respectively, leading to an ICER of 9,092.66 euro per QALY. Results were robust after sensitivity analysis. Uncertainty was examined via probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulting in a slightly higher ICER of 9,567.13 euro per QALY gained.

Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the two available vaccines, bivalent and quadrivalent, against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in Venezuelan girls in order to inform decision-makers. METHODS: A previously published Markov cohort model, informed by the best available evidence, was adapted to the Venezuelan context to evaluate the effects of vaccination on health and healthcare costs from the perspective of the healthcare payer in an 11-year-old girls cohort of 264,489. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 5%. Eight scenarios were analyzed to depict the cost-effectiveness under alternative vaccine prices, exchange rates and dosing schemes. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared to screening only, the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines were cost-saving in all scenarios, avoiding 2,310 and 2,143 deaths, 4,781 and 4,431 CCs up to 18,459 GW for the quadrivalent vaccine and gaining 4,486 and 4,395 discounted QALYs respectively. For both vaccines, the main determinants of variations in the incremental costs-effectiveness ratio after running deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were transition probabilities, vaccine and cancer-treatment costs and HPV 16 and 18 distribution in CC cases. When comparing vaccines, none of them was consistently more cost-effective than the other. In sensitivity analyses, for these comparisons, the main determinants were GW incidence, the level of cross-protection and, for some scenarios, vaccines costs. CONCLUSIONS: Immunization with the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccines showed to be cost-saving or cost-effective in Venezuela, falling below the threshold of one Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (104,404 VEF) per QALY gained.

17480,Cost-effectiveness Analysis for Apixaban in the Acute Treatment and Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in the Netherlands,"PURPOSE: Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are the current standard treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of recurrent VTE. The direct oral anticoagulant apixaban was recently found noninferior in efficacy and superior in preventing major bleeding compared with LMWH/VKAs in the AMPLIFY (Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep-Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy) trial. The objective of this study was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared with LMWH/VKA in the treatment of acute VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in the Netherlands. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate a cohort of 1,000 VTE patients receiving either apixaban or LMWH/VKA. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from the AMPLIFY trial and other literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the societal perspective; therefore, the model included both direct (inside and outside the health care sector) and indirect costs. In the univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) the robustness of the results was tested, and various additional scenario analyses were conducted. FINDINGS: In the base-case analysis, apixaban saved euro236 and 0.044 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.039 LYs were gained compared with LMWH/VKA. In the univariate sensitivity analysis the model appeared to be robust. The results of 2,000 iterations in the PSA found that the probability of apixaban being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY was 100% and cost-saving was 94%. The scenario of 18-month treatment duration was the only scenario not indicating cost-savings with an ICER of euro425/QALY. IMPLICATIONS: In acute anticoagulation use apixaban was found to be cost-saving. A longer anticoagulation period (18 months) resulted in a higher difference in drug costs, indicating a higher ICER. The cost-effectiveness of long-term or life-long use should be examined in future research.",2017-01-23890,28139289,Clin Ther,Lisa A de Jong,2017,39 / 2,288-302.e4,Yes,28139289,"Lisa A de Jong; Evgeni Dvortsin; Kristel J Janssen; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness Analysis for Apixaban in the Acute Treatment and Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in the Netherlands, Clin Ther, 2017 Feb; 39(2):1879-114X; 288-302.e4",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Standard/Usual Care- Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,4.00,0.00,-5488.37,Euro,2015,-6650.64

To reduce the risk of recurrent events, extended prophylaxis with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is available for use. However, in a large randomized trial (Comparison of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer [CLOT]; Lee et al), extended duration dalteparin reduced the relative risk of recurrent VTE by 52% compared to VKA (p=0.002). A recent subgroup analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment also revealed lower absolute VTE rates with dalteparin (3% vs. 17%; p=0.011). To measure the economic value of dalteparin as an alternative to VKA, a patient-level cost utility analysis was conducted from a Canadian perspective. METHODS: Resource use data captured during the CLOT trial were extracted and linked to 2015 Canadian unit cost estimates. Health state utilities were then measured using the Time-Trade-Off technique in 24 randomly selected members of the general Canadian public to estimate the gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: For the entire CLOT trial population (n=676), the dalteparin group had significantly higher mean costs compared to the VKA group ($Can5,771 vs. $Can2,569; p<0.001).

17483,Cost-Effectiveness of Pembrolizumab Versus Ipilimumab in Ipilimumab-Naive Patients with Advanced Melanoma in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have shown that pembrolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival compared with ipilimumab in ipilimumab-naive patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. However, there has been no published evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for this indication. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in ipilimumab-naive patients with unresectable or meta-static melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective. METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed, which divided overall survival time into progression-free survival and postprogression survival. The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. Extrapolation of progression-free survival and overall survival beyond the clinical trial was based on parametric functions and literature data. The base-case time horizon was 20 years, and costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Clinical data-including progression-free survival and overall survival data spanning a median follow-up time of 15 months, as well as quality of life and adverse event data from the ongoing KEYNOTE-006 trial-and cost data from public sources were used to populate the model. Costs included those of drug acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and disease management of advanced melanoma. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost difference per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was the main outcome, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In the base case, pembrolizumab was projected to increase the life expectancy of U.S. patients with advanced melanoma by 1.14 years, corresponding to a gain of 0.79 discounted QALYs over ipilimumab. The model also projected an average increase of $63,680 in discounted perpatient costs of treatment with pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab. The corresponding ICER was $81,091 per QALY ($68,712 per life-year) over a 20-year time horizon. With $100,000 per QALY as the threshold, when input parameters were varied in deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses, the use of pembrolizumab was cost-effective relative to ipilimumab in most ranges. Further, in a comprehensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the ICER was cost-effective in 83% of the simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab had higher expected QALYs and was cost-effective for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective.

17484,Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of liraglutide vs lixisenatide for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK setting,"AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, liraglutide 1.8 mg and lixisenatide 20 microg, in the UK setting based on the LIRA-LIXI trial (NCT01973231). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Projections of costs (in 2015 pounds sterling [ pound]) and clinical outcomes were made over patient lifetimes using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model (IMS Health, Basel, Switzerland). The baseline cohort and treatment effects applied after initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonists were taken from the LIRA-LIXI trial. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (8.87 vs 8.76 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) vs lixisenatide 20 microg. A greater reduction in glycated haemoglobin with liraglutide 1.8 mg led to fewer diabetes-related complications and delayed their time of onset. Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with increased total costs ( pound37 153 vs pound36 174), driven by higher acquisition costs, but this was partially offset by savings from diabetes-related complications avoided ( pound26 969 vs pound27 912). Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound8901 per QALY gained vs lixisenatide 20 microg.

17485,Cost-utility analysis of cardiac rehabilitation after conventional heart valve surgery versus usual care,"Background While cardiac rehabilitation in patients with ischaemic heart disease and heart failure is considered cost-effective, this evidence may not be transferable to heart valve surgery patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation following heart valve surgery. Design We conducted a cost-utility analysis based on a randomised controlled trial of 147 patients who had undergone heart valve surgery and were followed for 6 months. Methods Patients were randomised to cardiac rehabilitation consisting of 12 weeks of physical exercise training and monthly psycho-educational consultations or to usual care. Costs were measured from a societal perspective and quality-adjusted life years were based on the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D). Estimates were presented as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on bootstrapping. Costs and effect differences were presented in a cost-effectiveness plane and were transformed into net benefit and presented in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Results No statistically significant differences were found in total societal costs (-1609 Euros; 95% CI: -6162 to 2942 Euros) or in quality-adjusted life years (-0.000; 95% CI -0.021 to 0.020) between groups. However, approximately 70% of the cost and effect differences were located below the x-axis in the cost-effectiveness plane, and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability for cost- effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation compared to usual care is at minimum 75%, driven by a tendency towards costs savings. Conclusions Cardiac rehabilitation after heart valve surgery may not have improved health-related quality of life in this study, but is likely to be cost-effective for society, outweighing the extra costs of cardiac rehabilitation.",2017-01-23925,28121172,Eur J Prev Cardiol,Tina Birgitte Hansen,2017,24 / 7,698-707,No,28121172,"Tina Birgitte Hansen; Ann Dorthe Zwisler; Selina Kikkenborg Berg; Kirstine Laerum Sibilitz; Lau Caspar Thygesen; Jakob Kjellberg; Patrick Doherty; Neil Oldridge; Rikke Sogaard; Cost-utility analysis of cardiac rehabilitation after conventional heart valve surgery versus usual care, Eur J Prev Cardiol , 2017 May; 24(7):2047-4881; 698-707",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiac rehabilitation vs. None,patients with heart valve surgery,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2611000,Euro,2014,3795503.79
17486,The cost-effectiveness of changes to the care pathway used to identify depression and provide treatment amongst people with diabetes in England: a model-based economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with premature death and a number of serious complications. The presence of comorbid depression makes these outcomes more likely and results in increased healthcare costs. The aim of this work was to assess the health economic outcomes associated with having both diabetes and depression, and assess the cost-effectiveness of potential policy changes to improve the care pathway: improved opportunistic screening for depression, collaborative care for depression treatment, and the combination of both. METHODS: A mathematical model of the care pathways experienced by people diagnosed with type-2 diabetes in England was developed. Both an NHS perspective and wider social benefits were considered. Evidence was taken from the published literature, identified via scoping and targeted searches. RESULTS: Compared with current practice, all three policies reduced both the time spent with depression and the number of diabetes-related complications experienced. The policies were associated with an improvement in quality of life, but with an increase in health care costs. In an incremental analysis, collaborative care dominated improved opportunistic screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for collaborative care compared with current practice was pound10,798 per QALY. Compared to collaborative care, the combined policy had an ICER of pound68,017 per QALY.

17492,Cost-effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy and pathological ultrastaging in patients with early-stage cervical cancer,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of radical hysterectomy (RH) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for the management of early-stage cervical cancer (stage IA2-IB1). METHODS: A simple decision tree model was developed to follow a simulated cohort of patients with early-stage cervical cancer treated with RH and 1 of 3 lymph node assessment strategies: systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), SLNB using technetium 99 (Tc99) and blue dye, and SLNB using Tc99 only. SLNB using indocyanine green (ICG) was used as an exploratory strategy. Relevant studies were identified to extract the probability data and utility parameters and to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and absolute life-years (ALYs). Only direct medical costs were modeled, and the time horizon for the study was 5 years. RESULTS: SLNB using Tc99 and blue dye cost $21,089 and yielded 4.54 QALYs and 4.90 ALYs. PLND cost $22,353 and yielded 4.47 QALYs and 4.91 ALYs. SLNB using blue dye and Tc99 was the most cost-effective strategy when ALYs were considered with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $144,531. When QALYs were considered, the SLNB technique using Tc99 and blue dye dominated all other strategies. SLNB using ICG cost $20,624 and yielded 4.90 ALYs and 4.54 QALYs. It was clinically superior to and less expensive than all other strategies when QALYs were the outcome of interest and had an ICER of $221,171 per ALY in comparison with RH plus PLND.

17494,Cost-effectiveness of cytochrome P450 2C19 *2 genotype-guided selection of clopidogrel or ticagrelor in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome,"The choice of antiplatelet therapy among Asian populations for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is complicated owing to the high prevalence of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genetic polymorphism that has been associated with reduced efficacy of clopidogrel. Ticagrelor is a potent but more expensive alternative antiplatelet agent that is not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from the Hong Kong health-care provider''s perspective, of CYP2C19*2 genotype-guided selection of antiplatelet therapy compared with the universal use of clopidogrel or ticagrelor among ACS patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In the present study, a two-part model consisting of a 1-year decision tree and a lifetime Markov model was built to simulate the progress of a typical cohort of 60-year-old Chinese patients until age 85 years and compare three treatment strategies: (i) generic clopidogrel or ticagrelor based on CYP2C19*2 genotype, (ii) universal use of generic clopidogrel or (iii) universal use of ticagrelor for all patients. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of <1 gross domestic product per capita locally (US dollar (USD)42 423/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) were considered cost-effective. Base-case results showed universal ticagrelor use was cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel, but was dominated by genotype-guided treatment. Genotype-guided treatment was cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel use (ICER of USD2560/QALY). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that with the cost of genotype testing up to USD400, CYP2C19*2 genotype-guided antiplatelet treatment remained a cost-effective strategy compared with either universal use of generic clopidogrel or ticagrelor in post-PCI ACS patients in Hong Kong.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 24 January 2017; doi:10.1038/tpj.2016.94.",2017-01-23933,28117433,Age Ageing,Y Wang,2017,/,,No,28117433,"Y Wang; B P Yan; D Liew; V W Y Lee; Cost-effectiveness of cytochrome P450 2C19 *2 genotype-guided selection of clopidogrel or ticagrelor in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome, Age Ageing, 2017 Jan 24; ():1468-2834",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genotype-guided treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- Universally treated with clopidogrel without genetic testing,Underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),85 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2560,United States,2016,2760.57
17495,Cost-effectiveness of cytochrome P450 2C19 *2 genotype-guided selection of clopidogrel or ticagrelor in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome,"The choice of antiplatelet therapy among Asian populations for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is complicated owing to the high prevalence of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genetic polymorphism that has been associated with reduced efficacy of clopidogrel. Ticagrelor is a potent but more expensive alternative antiplatelet agent that is not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism.

17496,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus low molecular weight heparin/vitamin k antagonist for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and the prevention of recurrences,"BACKGROUND: Prior analyses beyond clinical trials are yet to evaluate the projected lifetime benefit of apixaban treatment compared to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)/vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of recurrences. The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of initial plus extended treatment with apixaban versus LMWH/VKA for either initial treatment only or initial plus extended treatment. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrences with apixaban (starting at 10 mg BID for 1 week, then 5 mg BID for 6 months, then 2.5 mg BID for an additional 12 months) versus LMWH/VKA for 6 months and either no further treatment or extended treatment with VKA for an additional 12 months. Clinical event rates to inform the model were taken from the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT trials and a network meta-analysis. Background mortality rates, costs, and utilities were obtained from published sources. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service. The evaluated outcomes included the number of events avoided in a 1000-patient cohort, total costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Initial plus extended treatment with apixaban was superior to both treatment durations of LMWH/VKA in reducing the number of bleeding events, and was superior to initial LMWH/VKA for 6 months followed by no therapy, in reducing VTE recurrences. Apixaban treatment was cost-effective compared to 6-month treatment with LMWH/VKA at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound6692 per QALY. When initial LMWH/VKA was followed by further VKA therapy for an additional 12 months (i.e., total treatment duration of 18 months), apixaban was cost-effective at an ICER of pound8528 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis suggested these findings were robust over a wide range of inputs and scenarios for the model.

17498,Economic evaluation of an implementation strategy for the management of low back pain in general practice,"In connection with the publication of a clinical practice guideline on the management of low back pain (LBP) in general practice in Denmark, a cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted. In this trial, a multifaceted guideline implementation strategy to improve general practitioners'' treatment of patients with LBP was compared with a usual implementation strategy. The aim was to determine whether the multifaceted strategy was cost effective, as compared with the usual implementation strategy. The economic evaluation was conducted as a cost-utility analysis where cost collected from a societal perspective and quality-adjusted life years were used as outcome measures. The analysis was conducted as a within-trial analysis with a 12-month time horizon consistent with the follow-up period of the clinical trial. To adjust for a priori selected covariates, generalised linear models with a gamma family were used to estimate incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years. Furthermore, both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results showed that costs associated with primary health care were higher, whereas secondary health care costs were lower for the intervention group when compared with the control group. When adjusting for covariates, the intervention was less costly, and there was no significant difference in effect between the 2 groups. Sensitivity analyses showed that results were sensitive to uncertainty. In conclusion, the multifaceted implementation strategy was cost saving when compared with the usual strategy for implementing LBP clinical practice guidelines in general practice. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in effect, and the estimate was sensitive to uncertainty.",2017-01-23937,28114182,Pain,Cathrine Elgaard Jensen,2017,158 / 5,891-899,No,28114182,"Cathrine Elgaard Jensen; Allan Riis; Karin Dam Petersen; Martin Bach Jensen; Kjeld Moller Pedersen; Economic evaluation of an implementation strategy for the management of low back pain in general practice, Pain, 2017 May; 158(5):1872-6623; 891-899",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multifaceted guideline implementation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Usual implementation strategy,Not Stated,64 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,26000,Euro,2015,31506.02
17499,Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic cranial irradiation with hippocampal avoidance in limited stage small cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) prevents brain metastases and improves survival, with the potential for neurocognitive toxicity. RTOG0933 demonstrated that hippocampal avoidance (HA) during whole brain radiotherapy preserves neurocognition. This study''s objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HA-PCI in LS-SCLC through decision analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the clinical course of LS-SCLC who received HA-PCI or conventional PCI (C-PCI). A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY was used. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the parameter thresholds and to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, HA-PCI is more cost-effective than C-PCI, with an ICER of $47,107/QALY. HA-PCI was preferred over C-PCI provided that the risk of developing brain metastases was not increased by at least 14%, or if neurocognitive dysfunction rates were reduced by at least 40%. HA-PCI was the cost-effective strategy in 68% of tested iterations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HA-PCI is more cost-effective than C-PCI in LS-SCLC.

17500,Cost-effectiveness analysis in the Spanish setting of the PEAK trial of panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 compared with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of panitumumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin) vs bevacizumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 as first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Spain. METHODS: A semi-Markov model was developed including the following health states: Progression free; Progressive disease: Treat with best supportive care; Progressive disease: Treat with subsequent active therapy; Attempted resection of metastases; Disease free after metastases resection; Progressive disease: after resection and relapse; and Death. Parametric survival analyses of patient-level progression free survival and overall survival data from the PEAK Phase II clinical trial were used to estimate health state transitions. Additional data from the PEAK trial were considered for the dose and duration of therapy, the use of subsequent therapy, the occurrence of adverse events, and the incidence and probability of time to metastasis resection. Utility weightings were calculated from patient-level data from panitumumab trials evaluating first-, second-, and third-line treatments. The study was performed from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective including only direct costs. A life-time horizon was applied. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Based on the PEAK trial, which demonstrated greater efficacy of panitumumab vs bevacizumab, both in combination with mFOLFOX6 first-line in wild-type RAS mCRC patients, the estimated incremental cost per life-year gained was euro16,567 and the estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was euro22,794. The sensitivity analyses showed the model was robust to alternative parameters and assumptions. LIMITATIONS: The analysis was based on a simulation model and, therefore, the results should be interpreted cautiously. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the PEAK Phase II clinical trial and taking into account Spanish costs, the results of the analysis showed that first-line treatment of mCRC with panitumumab + mFOLFOX6 could be considered a cost-effective option compared with bevacizumab + mFOLFOX6 for the Spanish NHS.",2017-01-23951,28107090,J Med Econ,Fernando Rivera,2017,20 / 6,574-584,Yes,28107090,"Fernando Rivera; Manuel Valladares; Salvador Gea; Noemi Lopez-Martinez; Cost-effectiveness analysis in the Spanish setting of the PEAK trial of panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 compared with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, J Med Econ, 2017 Jun; 20(6):1369-6998; 574-584",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Panitumumab + oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (mFOLFOX6) vs. Bevacizumab + oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (mFOLFOX6)","Patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy, or bevacizumab therapy",Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,22794,Euro,2015,27621.08
