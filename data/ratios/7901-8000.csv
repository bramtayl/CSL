7901,Comparative Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of the Implantable Miniature Telescope,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the preference-based comparative effectiveness (human value gain) and the cost-utility (cost-effectiveness) of a telescope prosthesis (implantable miniature telescope) for the treatment of end-stage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: A value-based medicine, second-eye model, cost-utility analysis was performed to quantify the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapy with the telescope prosthesis. PARTICIPANTS: Published, evidence-based data from the IMT002 Study Group clinical trial. Ophthalmic utilities were obtained from a validated cohort of >1000 patients with ocular diseases. METHODS: Comparative effectiveness data were converted from visual acuity to utility (value-based) format. The incremental costs (Medicare) of therapy versus no therapy were integrated with the value gain conferred by the telescope prosthesis to assess its average cost-utility. The incremental value gains and incremental costs of therapy referent to (1) a fellow eye cohort and (2) a fellow eye cohort of those who underwent intra-study cataract surgery were integrated in incremental cost-utility analyses. All value outcomes and costs were discounted at a 3% annual rate, as per the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparative effectiveness was quantified using the (1) quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain and (2) percent human value gain (improvement in quality of life). The QALY gain was integrated with incremental costs into the cost-utility ratio ($/QALY, or US dollars expended per QALY gained). RESULTS: The mean, discounted QALY gain associated with use of the telescope prosthesis over 12 years was 0.7577. When the QALY loss of 0.0004 attributable to the adverse events was factored into the model, the final QALY gain was 0.7573. This resulted in a 12.5% quality of life gain for the average patient during the 12 years of the model. The average cost-utility versus no therapy for use of the telescope prosthesis was $14389/QALY. The incremental cost-utility referent to control fellow eyes was $14063/QALY, whereas the incremental cost-utility referent to fellow eyes that underwent intra-study cataract surgery was $11805/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with the telescope prosthesis considerably improves quality of life and at the same time is cost-effective by conventional standards.

7903,Cost-effectiveness of implementing the chronic care model for diabetes care in a military population,"Background: Applying the chronic care model (CCM) for diabetes management helps improve health outcomes and patient care. The CCM was implemented at U.S. Air Force Wilford Hall Medical Center through the Diabetes Outreach Clinic (DOC) in 2006, but its cost-effectiveness in this setting is unknown. Methods: We constructed a Markov decision model to estimate DOC cost-effectiveness compared with usual care (UC) over a 20-year period. Based on empirical, post-intervention demographic and clinical data, we applied United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk equations to predict long-term probabilities of developing microvascular or macrovascular complications. Health care system and societal perspectives were considered, discounting costs and benefits at 3% annually. Intervention costs and outcomes were obtained from military data, while other costs, disease progression data, and utilities were drawn from published literature. Results: From a health care system perspective, the DOC cost $45,495 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with UC; from a societal perspective, the DOC compared with UC cost $42,051/QALY (when the model started with the uncomplicated diabetes cohort), $61,243/QALY (when starting with the DOC cohort), or $61,813/QALY (when starting with the UC cohort). In one-way sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to yearly costs for specialty care visits. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the DOC was favored in 51% of model iterations using an acceptability threshold of $50,000/QALY and in 72% at a threshold of $100,000/QALY.

7905,Cost-Effectiveness of Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator in the 3- to 4.5-Hour Time Window for Acute Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment in the 3- to 4.5-hour time window after ischemic stroke. METHODS: Decision-analytic and Markov state-transition models were created to determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment of ischemic stroke patients with intravenous tPA administered in the 3- to 4.5-hour time window compared with medical therapy without tPA. Health benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The economic outcome measure of the model was the difference in estimated healthcare costs between the 2 treatment alternatives. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated by dividing the cost difference by the difference in QALYs. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The administration of tPA compared with standard medical therapy resulted in a lifetime gain of 0.28 QALYs for an additional cost of $6050, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21 978 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to the cost of hospitalization for patients who received tPA. Based on probabilistic analysis, there is an 88% probability that tPA is the preferred treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The balance of costs and benefits favors treatment with intravenous tPA in the 3- to 4.5-hour time window. This supports, from a societal perspective, the use of tPA therapy in this treatment time window for acute ischemic stroke.",2011-01-07488,21719767,Stroke,Christie E Tung,2011,/,,No,21719767,"Christie E Tung; Sandra S Win; Maarten G Lansberg; Cost-Effectiveness of Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator in the 3- to 4.5-Hour Time Window for Acute Ischemic Stroke, Stroke, 2011-Jun-30; ():1524-4628",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment in the 3-4.5 hour time window after ischemic stroke vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,21978,United States,2010,26085.72
7906,Cost-effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine in Spanish patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist for adjuvant treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been shown to be as effective as insulin glargine (IG) for reducing glycated hemoglobin levels combined with metformin or/and sulphonylureas. Exenatide is associated to weight reduction and a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of exenatide as compared to IG in obese patients with T2DM not achieving an adequate blood glucose control from the perspective of the Spanish healthcare system. METHODS: Pharmacoeconomic model inputs were obtained from an obese subpopulation (BMI = 30 k/m(2)) of an international, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing exenatide with IG in poorly controlled T2DM patients, and were supplemented with country-specific data. RESULTS: Exenatide was associated to improvements in life-years gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.11 and 0.62 respectively versus IG. Direct costs were € 9,306 higher as compared to IG (€ 47,010 versus € 37,704, with increased pharmacy costs as the main driver). Exenatideís incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was € 15,068 per QALY gained versus IG. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide was associated to greater clinical benefits and higher costs in obese T2DM patients as compared to IG. Considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of € 30,000 per QALY gained in the Spanish setting, exenatide represents an efficient option in comparison with IG.",2011-01-07489,21719364,Endocrinol Nutr,Gordon Goodall,2011,/,,No,21719364,"Gordon Goodall; Mar?a Costi; Louise Timlin; Jes?s Reviriego; Jos?

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community-dwelling women aged 65 to 75 living in Vancouver, British Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-three of the 155 community-dwelling women aged 65 to 75 years who originally were randomly allocated to once-weekly resistance training (n=54), twice-weekly resistance training (n=52), or twice-weekly balance and tone exercises (control group; n=49) participated in the 12-month follow-up study. Of these, 98 took part in the economic evaluation (twice-weekly balance and tone exercises, n=28; once-weekly resistance training, n=35; twice-weekly resistance training, n=35).

7909,The Business Case for Quality Improvement: Oral Anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation,"Background The potential to save money within a short time frame provides a more compelling ""business case"" for quality improvement than merely demonstrating cost-effectiveness. Our objective was to demonstrate the potential for cost savings from improved control in patients anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation. Methods and Results Our population consisted of 67 077 Veterans Health Administration patients anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation between October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2008. We simulated the number of adverse events and their associated costs and utilities, both before and after various degrees of improvement in percent time in therapeutic range (TTR). The simulation had a 2-year time horizon, and costs were calculated from the perspective of the payer. In the base-case analysis, improving TTR by 5% prevented 1114 adverse events, including 662 deaths; it gained 863 quality-adjusted life-years and saved $15.9 million compared with the status quo, not accounting for the cost of the quality improvement program. Improving TTR by 10% prevented 2087 events, gained 1606 quality-adjusted life-years, and saved $29.7 million. In sensitivity analyses, costs were most sensitive to the estimated risk of stroke and the expected stroke reduction from improved TTR. Utilities were most sensitive to the estimated risk of death and the expected mortality benefit from improved TTR. Conclusions A quality improvement program to improve anticoagulation control probably would be cost-saving for the payer, even if it were only modestly effective in improving control and even without considering the value of improved health. This study demonstrates how to make a business case for a quality improvement initiative.",2011-01-07499,21712521,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,Adam J Rose,2011,/,,No,21712521,"Adam J Rose; Dan R Berlowitz; Arlene S Ash; Al Ozonoff; Elaine M Hylek; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; The Business Case for Quality Improvement: Oral Anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation, Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, 2011-Jun-28; ():1941-7705",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quality improvement (QI) program vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,18424.1,United States,2008,22147.21
7910,Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients? A cost-utility study,"BACKGROUND: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients. OBJECTIVES: This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. METHOD: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with =2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. RESULTS: Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with =2 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. CONCLUSION: Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.",2011-01-07500,21712147,Res Social Adm Pharm,Arijit Ganguli,2011,/,,No,21712147,"Arijit Ganguli; Junling Wang; Dick R Gourley; Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?

7911,Cost-Effectiveness of a Health Intervention Program with Risk Reductions for Getting Demented: Results of a Markov Model in a Swedish/Finnish Setting,"Risk scores based on modifiable factors have recently been developed for dementia. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a potential preventive intervention program meant to lower the score related to increased dementia risk. Analyses were based on a Markov model adapted to Swedish circumstances. Risk score categories and risk probabilities were derived from the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) study in Finland. Figures of costs, utilities, and mortality were obtained from literature or databases. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were carried out to investigate the robustness of the model and to identify which model inputs had most impact on the results. In the base case, the usual care had a cost of 621,000 SEK and utilities of 11.8438 quality-adjusted life year (QALYs). The intervention had a cost of 599, 026 SEK and utilities of 11.8950 QALYs. The cost was 21,974 SEK lower in the intervention with 0.0511 QALYs gained over a 20 years horizon, indicating absolute dominance. The support for cost-effectiveness was insensitive to changes in the value of QALY for demented, mortality, and risk of dementia. If the intervention program was assumed to run every year, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio did not show absolute dominance but was still under the willingness-to-pay level. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated cost effectiveness in 67% of the samplings given a willingness-to-pay level of 600,000 SEK/year. This is a promising outlook for future research on preventive interventions in dementia, emphasizing the need of conducting multi-domain randomized trials.",2011-01-07502,21709377,J Alzheimers Dis,Yanlei Zhang,2011,/,,No,21709377,"Yanlei Zhang; Miia Kivipelto; Alina Solomon; Anders Wimo; Cost-Effectiveness of a Health Intervention Program with Risk Reductions for Getting Demented: Results of a Markov Model in a Swedish/Finnish Setting, J Alzheimers Dis, 2011-Jun-27; ():1387-2877",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multi-domain preventive intervention program consisting of health promotion and pharmacological treatment vs. Usual Care,Not Stated,70 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-430019.56,Sweden,2005,-76523.46
7912,Cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for primary prevention in a low-cost statin era,"Background- With wide availability of low-cost generics, primary prevention with statins has become less expensive. We projected the cost-effectiveness of expanded statin prescribing strategies using low-cost generics and identified conditions under which aggressive prescribing ceases to be cost-effective. Methods and Results- We simulated expanded statin prescribing strategies with the coronary heart disease policy model, a Markov model of the US population ã35 years of age. If statins cost $4/mo, treatment thresholds of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ã160 mg/dL for low-risk persons (0 to 1 risk factor), ã130 mg/dL for moderate-risk persons (=2 risk factors and 10-year risk <10%), and ã100 mg/dL for moderately high-risk persons (=2 risk factors and 10-year risk ã10%) would reduce annual healthcare costs by $430 million compared with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Lowering thresholds to ã130 mg/dL for persons with 0 risk factors and ã100 mg/dL for persons with 1 risk factor and treating all moderate- and moderately high-risk persons regardless of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol would provide additional health benefits for $9900 per quality-adjusted life-year. These findings are insensitive to most adverse effect assumptions (including statin-associated diabetes mellitus and severe hypothetical effects) but are sensitive to large reductions in the efficacy of statins or to a long-term disutility burden for which a patient would trade 30 to 80 days of life to avoid 30 years of statins.

However, the devices used to deliver it are costly and can impose a significant burden to the relatively constrained health budgets of middle-income countries such as Brazil. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed, representing the follow-up of a hypothetical cohort of HF patients, with a 20-year time horizon. Input data were based on information from a Brazilian cohort of 316 HF patients, as well as meta-analyses of data on devices'' effectiveness and risks.

7919,Cost-effectiveness of lapatinib plus capecitabine in women with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who have received prior therapy with trastuzumab,"BACKGROUND: In a phase III trial of women with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with trastuzumab, an anthracycline, and taxanes (EGF100151), lapatinib plus capecitabine (L + C) improved time to progression (TTP) versus capecitabine monotherapy (C-only). In a trial including HER2+ MBC patients who had received at least one prior course of trastuzumab and no more than one prior course of palliative chemotherapy (GBG 26/BIG 03-05), continued trastuzumab plus capecitabine (T + C) also improved TTP. METHODS: An economic model using patient-level data from EGF100151 and published results of GBG 26/BIG 03-05 as well as other literature were used to evaluate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained with L + C versus C-only and versus T + C in women with HER2+ MBC previously treated with trastuzumab from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. RESULTS: Expected costs were £28,816 with L + C, £13,985 with C-only and £28,924 with T + C. Corresponding QALYs were 0.927, 0.737 and 0.896. In the base case, L + C was estimated to provide more QALYs at a lower cost compared with T + C; cost per QALY gained was £77,993 with L + C versus C-only. In pairwise probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability that L + C is preferred to C-only was 0.03 given a threshold of £30,000. The probability that L + C is preferred to T + C was 0.54 regardless of the threshold. CONCLUSIONS: When compared against capecitabine alone, the addition of lapatinib has a cost-effectiveness ratio exceeding the threshold normally used by NICE.

7921,Cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery in Japan,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery through measurement of the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in Japan. METHODS: A total of 549 patients scheduled for cataract surgery at 12 clinical sites from November 2008 through February 2010 were included in the study. Prospective assessment of patient preference-based quality of life (utility) was performed before and after the surgery using the time tradeoff method, EuroQol, and Health Utilities Index Mark 3. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the correlation between utility and visual acuity. The QALYs gained through cataract surgery were estimated, and cost-utility analysis was performed. RESULTS: The utilities significantly correlated with the visual acuity in the better seeing eye. In all the subgroups (first eye surgery, second eye surgery, and bilateral surgery), mean utility improvement was statistically significant.

7923,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Adjunct VSL#3 Therapy Versus Standard Medical Therapy in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis,"BACKGROUND:: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are costly chronic gastrointestinal diseases, with pediatric IBD representing increased costs per patient compared to adult disease. Healthcare expenditures for ulcerative colitis (UC) are more than 2 billion dollars annually. It is not clear whether the addition of VSL#3 to standard medical therapy in UC induction and maintenance of remission is a cost-effective strategy. METHODS:: We performed a systematic review of the literature, and created a Markov model simulating a cohort of 10 year-old patients with severe UC, following them until 100 years of age or death. We compared two strategies: standard medical therapy vs. medical therapy + VSL#3. For both strategies, we assumed that patients progressed through escalating therapies: mesalamine, azathioprine, and infliximab prior to receiving a colectomy + IPAA if the 3 medical therapy options were exhausted. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the difference of costs between strategies for each quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on variables to determine the key variables impacting cost-effectiveness. RESULTS:: Standard medical care accrued a lifetime cost of $203,317 per patient, compared to $212,582 per patient for medical therapy + VSL#3. Lifetime QALYs-gained was comparable for standard medical therapy and medical therapy + VSL#3 at 24.93 vs. 25.05, respectively. Using the definition of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <50,000/QALY as a cost effective intervention, medical therapy + VSL#3 produced an ICER of $79,910 per QALY-gained, making this strategy cost-ineffective. Sensitivity analyses showed that 4 key parameters could impact the cost-effectiveness of the 2 strategies: cost of colectomy + IPAA, maintenance cost after surgery, probability of developing pouchitis after surgery, and the quality of life after a colectomy + IPAA. High surgical and post-surgical costs, a high probability of developing pouchitis, and a low quality of life after a colectomy + IPAA could make adjunct VSL#3 use a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS:: Given current data, adjunct VSL#3 use for pediatric UC induction and maintenance of remission is not cost-effective, although several key parameters could make this strategy cost-effective. The quality of life after an IPAA is the single most important variable predicting whether this procedure benefits patients over escalating standard medical therapy.",2011-01-07517,21694634,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,K T Park,2011,/,,No,21694634,"K T Park; Felipe Perez; Raymond Tsai; Anita Honkanen; Dorsey Bass; Alan Garber; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Adjunct VSL#3 Therapy Versus Standard Medical Therapy in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis, J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr, 2011-Jun-17; ():1536-4801",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Medical therapy + VSL#3 vs. Standard medical therapy,Not Stated,10 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,79910,United States,2009,96401.03
7924,"Insomnia - treatment pathways, costs and quality of life","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Insomnia is perhaps the most common sleep disorder in the general population, and is characterised by a range of complaints around difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, together with impaired waking function. There is little quantitative information on treatment pathways, costs and outcomes. The aims of this New Zealand study were to determine from which healthcare practitioners patients with insomnia sought treatment, treatment pathways followed, the net costs of treatment and the quality of life improvements obtained. METHODS: The study was retrospective and prevalence based, and was both cost effectiveness (CEA) and a cost utility (CUA) analysis. Micro costing techniques were used and a societal analytic perspective was adopted. A deterministic decision tree model was used to estimate base case values, and a stochastic version, with Monte Carlo simulation, was used to perform sensitivity analysis. A probability and cost were attached to each event which enabled the costs for the treatment pathways and average treatment cost to be calculated. The inputs to the model were prevalence, event probabilities, resource utilisations, and unit costs. Direct costs and QALYs gained were evaluated. RESULTS: The total net benefit of treating a person with insomnia was $482 (the total base case cost of $145 less health costs avoided of $628). When these results were applied to the total at-risk population in New Zealand additional treatment costs incurred were $6.6 million, costs avoided $28.4 million and net benefits were $21.8 million. The incremental net benefit when insomnia was ""successfully"" treated was $3,072 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The study has brought to light a number of problems relating to the treatment of insomnia in New Zealand. There is both inadequate access to publicly funded treatment and insufficient publicly available information from which a consumer is able to make an informed decision on the treatment and provider options. This study suggests that successful treatment of insomnia leads to direct cost savings and improved quality of life.",2011-01-07519,21693060,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Guy W Scott,2011,9 / 1,10,Yes,21693060,"Guy W Scott; Helen M Scott; Karyn M O'Keeffe; Philippa H Gander; Insomnia - treatment pathways, costs and quality of life, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2011-Jun-21; 9(1):1478-7547; 10",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insomnia treatment vs. None,Not Stated,59 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,3072,New Zealand,2009,2320.38
7925,Cost Effectiveness of Denosumab Compared with Oral Bisphosphonates in the Treatment of Post-Menopausal Osteoporotic Women in Belgium,"Background: Denosumab has recently been shown to be well tolerated, to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and to significantly reduce the risk of hip, vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in the FREEDOM (Fracture REduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis every 6 Months) trial. It is becoming increasingly important to evaluate not only the therapeutic value of a new drug but also the cost effectiveness compared with the most relevant treatment alternatives. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of denosumab compared with oral bisphosphonates (branded and generic drugs) in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporotic women in Belgium. Methods: Cost effectiveness of 3 years of treatment with denosumab was compared with branded risedronate and branded and generic alendronate using an updated version of a previously validated Markov microsimulation model. The model was populated with relevant cost, adherence and epidemiological data for Belgium from a payer perspective and the results were presented as costs per QALY gained (&U20AC;, year 2009 values). Analyses were performed in populations (aged =60 years) in which osteoporosis medications are currently reimbursed in many European countries, i.e. those with BMD T-score of -2.5 or less or prevalent vertebral fracture. Patients receiving denosumab were assumed to have a 46% lower risk of discontinuation than those receiving oral bisphosphonates, and the effect of denosumab after treatment cessation was assumed to decline linearly to zero over a maximum of 1 year. Results: Denosumab was cost effective compared with all other therapies, assuming a willingness to pay of &U20AC;40?000 per QALY gained. In particular, denosumab was found to be cost effective compared with branded alendronate and risedronate at a threshold value of &U20AC;30?000 per QALY and denosumab was dominant (i.e. lower cost and greater effectiveness) compared with risedronate from the age of 70 years in women with a T-score of -2.5 or less and no prior fractures. The cost effectiveness of denosumab compared with generic alendronate was estimated at &U20AC;38?514, &U20AC;22?220 and &U20AC;27?862 per QALY for women aged 60, 70 and 80 years, respectively, with T-scores of -2.5 or less. The equivalent values were &U20AC;37?167, &U20AC;19?718 and &U20AC;19?638 per QALY for women with prevalent vertebral fractures. Conclusion: This study suggests, on the basis of currently available data, that denosumab is a cost-effective strategy compared with oral bisphosphonates (including generic alendronate) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporotic women, aged =60 years in Belgium. Denosumab therefore appears to have the potential to become a first-line treatment for post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.

7933,Cost Effectiveness of Denosumab Compared with Oral Bisphosphonates in the Treatment of Post-Menopausal Osteoporotic Women in Belgium,"Background: Denosumab has recently been shown to be well tolerated, to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and to significantly reduce the risk of hip, vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in the FREEDOM (Fracture REduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis every 6 Months) trial. It is becoming increasingly important to evaluate not only the therapeutic value of a new drug but also the cost effectiveness compared with the most relevant treatment alternatives. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of denosumab compared with oral bisphosphonates (branded and generic drugs) in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporotic women in Belgium. Methods: Cost effectiveness of 3 years of treatment with denosumab was compared with branded risedronate and branded and generic alendronate using an updated version of a previously validated Markov microsimulation model. The model was populated with relevant cost, adherence and epidemiological data for Belgium from a payer perspective and the results were presented as costs per QALY gained (&U20AC;, year 2009 values). Analyses were performed in populations (aged =60 years) in which osteoporosis medications are currently reimbursed in many European countries, i.e. those with BMD T-score of -2.5 or less or prevalent vertebral fracture. Patients receiving denosumab were assumed to have a 46% lower risk of discontinuation than those receiving oral bisphosphonates, and the effect of denosumab after treatment cessation was assumed to decline linearly to zero over a maximum of 1 year. Results: Denosumab was cost effective compared with all other therapies, assuming a willingness to pay of &U20AC;40?000 per QALY gained. In particular, denosumab was found to be cost effective compared with branded alendronate and risedronate at a threshold value of &U20AC;30?000 per QALY and denosumab was dominant (i.e. lower cost and greater effectiveness) compared with risedronate from the age of 70 years in women with a T-score of -2.5 or less and no prior fractures. The cost effectiveness of denosumab compared with generic alendronate was estimated at &U20AC;38?514, &U20AC;22?220 and &U20AC;27?862 per QALY for women aged 60, 70 and 80 years, respectively, with T-scores of -2.5 or less.

7935,Cost-Effectiveness of Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy Versus Routine Surveillance in Patients With Unilateral Breast Cancer,"PURPOSE Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) rates in women with unilateral breast cancer are increasing despite controversy regarding survival advantage. Current scrutiny of the medical costs led us to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CPM versus routine surveillance as an alternative contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk management strategy. METHODS Using a Markov model, we simulated patients with breast cancer from mastectomy to death. Model parameters were gathered from published literature or national databases. Base-case analysis focused on patients with average-risk breast cancer, 45 years of age at treatment. Outcomes were valued in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Patients' age, risk level of breast cancer, and quality of life (QOL) were varied to assess their impact on results. Results Mean costs of treatment for women age 45 years are comparable: $36,594 for the CPM and $35,182 for surveillance. CPM provides 21.22 mean QALYs compared with 20.93 for surveillance, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $4,869/QALY gained for CPM. To prevent one CBC, six CPMs would be needed. CPM is no longer cost-effective for patients older than 70 years (ICER $62,750/QALY). For BRCA-positive patients, CPM is clearly cost-effective, providing more QALYs while being less costly. In non-BRCA patients, cost-effectiveness of CPM is highly dependent on assumptions regarding QOL for CPM versus surveillance strategy. CONCLUSION CPM is cost-effective compared with surveillance for patients with breast cancer who are younger than 70 years. Results are sensitive to BRCA-positive status and assumptions of QOL differences between CPM and surveillance patients.

7936,Intussusception in children: cost-effectiveness of ultrasound vs diagnostic contrast enema,"Purpose: The aim of the study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of different imaging strategies for the diagnosis of pediatric intussusception using a decision analytic model. Methods: A Markov decision model was constructed to model effects of radiation exposure at the time of intussusception in a hypothetical cohort of 2-year-old children. The 2 strategies compared were ultrasound followed conditionally by contrast enema (US/CE) vs contrast enema (CE) alone. The model simulated short-term and long-term outcomes of the patients, calculating the average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs associated with each arm. Results: The use of ultrasound as a first-line diagnostic modality would result in a decrease of 79.3 and 59.7 cases of radiation-induced malignancy per 100,000 male and female children evaluated, respectively. For male and female children with intussusception, US/CE was both the most costly initial imaging strategy and the most effective compared with CE. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US/CE to CE was $70,100 (boy) and $92,227 (girl) per quality-adjusted life years gained.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of telbivudine for the viewpoint of the Brazilian public system, comparing it to lamivudine. Methods: A Markov model was used to project lifetime complications and costs of treatment with lamivudine or telbivudine for chronic hepatitis B in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. To evaluate disease progression, probabilities and utilities of virologic response, virologic resistance, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment, interruption of treatment, death and seroconversion were collected in systematic reviews. Costs were collected in DATASUS, ABC da Saúde and scientific literature. Results: Higher rate of virologic response and seroconversion was obtained with telbivudine, and also higher values of quality adjusted life years. However lamivudine is associated with lower costs and also lower cost-effectiveness values. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for telbivudine, when compared with lamivudine, were US$ 30,575 and US$ 40,457, respectively for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients.

7940,Ticagrelor versus Genotype-Driven Antiplatelet Therapy for Secondary Prevention after Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Clopidogrel's effectiveness is likely reduced significantly for prevention of thrombotic events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients exhibiting a decreased ability to metabolize clopidogrel into its active form. A genetic mutation responsible for this reduced effectiveness is detectable by genotyping. Ticagrelor is not dependent on gene-based metabolic activation and demonstrated greater clinical efficacy than clopidogrel in a recent secondary prevention trial. In 2011, clopidogrel will lose its patent protection and likely will be substantially less expensive than ticagrelor. Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with a genotype-driven selection of antiplatelet agents. Methods: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was used to estimate the 5-year medical costs (in 2009 US$) and outcomes for a cohort of ACS patients enrolled in Medicare receiving either genotype-driven or ticagrelor-only treatment. Outcomes included life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Data comparing the clinical performance of ticagrelor and clopidogrel were derived from the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes trial. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for universal ticagrelor was $10,059 per QALY compared to genotype-driven treatment, and was most sensitive to the price of ticagrelor and the hazard ratio for death for ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. The ICER remained below $50,000 per QALY until a monthly ticagrelor price of $693 or a 0.93 hazard ratio for death for ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel. In probabilistic analyses, universal ticagrelor was below $50,000 per QALY in 97.7% of simulations.

Methods: A mathematical model was constructed simulating the experience of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Three strategies were modeled: primary prophylaxis (G-CSFs administered in all cycles), secondary prophylaxis (G-CSFs administered in all cycles after an FN event), and no G-CSF prophylaxis. Three G-CSFs were considered: filgrastim, lenograstim, and pegfilgrastim. Costs were taken from UK databases and utility values from published sources. A systematic review provided data on G-CSF efficacy. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses examined the effects of uncertainty in model parameters. Results: In the UK, base-case analysis with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £20K per quality-adjusted life year gained and also using list prices, the most cost-effective strategy was primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim for a patient with baseline FN risk greater than 38%, secondary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim for baseline FN risk 11% to 37%, and no G-CSFs for baseline FN risk less than 11%. Using a WTP threshold of £30K and list prices, primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim was cost-effective for baseline FN risks greater than 29%. In all analyses, pegfilgrastim dominated filgrastim and lenograstim.

7953,Economic Evaluation of Reamed versus Unreamed Intramedullary Nailing in Patients with Closed and Open Tibial Fractures: Results from the Study to Prospectively Evaluate Reamed Intramedullary Nails in Patients with Tibial Fractures (SPRINT),"Introduction: Recently, results from the large, randomized study to prospectively evaluate reamed intramedullary nails in patients with tibial fractures (SPRINT) trial suggested a benefit for reamed intramedullary nail insertion in patients with closed tibial shaft fractures largely based on cost-neutral autodynamizations and a potential advantage for unreamed intramedullary nailing in open fractures. We performed an economic evaluation to compare resource use and effectiveness of reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing using a cost-utility analysis. Methods: We calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each patient from a self-administered health utility index 3 questionnaire for the first 12 months following the intramedullary nailing. A convenience sample of 235 SPRINT patients provided data on costs associated with health care resource utilization. All costs are reported in Canadian dollars for the 2008 financial year. Results: We found incremental effects of -0.017 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.021-0.058) and -0.002 (95% CI -0.060-0.062) QALYs for patients treated with reamed compared with unreamed intramedullary nails in closed and open fractures, respectively. The incremental costs for reamed compared with unreamed intramedullary nailing were $51 Canadian dollars (95% CI -$2298-$2400) in closed tibial fractures and $2546 Canadian dollars (95%CI -$1773-$6864) in open tibial fractures. Unreamed nailing dominated reamed nailing for both closed and open tibial fractures; however, the cost and the utility results had high variability.

We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness (C/E) of these consolidation strategies. METHODS: A decision model was developed based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols #178 and #218. Arm 1 is 6 cycles of CP. Arm 2 is 6 cycles of CP followed by 12 cycles of P (CP+P). Arm 3 is 1 cycle of CP, 5 cycles of CPB, and 16 cycles of B (CPB+B). Parameters include PFS, overall survival (OS), cost, complications (neuropathy for P and bowel perforation for B), and quality-of-life utility values. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CT+T is $13,402/quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to CP. For CPB+B compared to CP, the ICER is $326,530/QALY. When compared simultaneously, CPB+B is dominated, i.e. is more costly and less effective than CP+P. Results were robust to parameter variation. At a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, CP+P was the preferred option throughout most of the decision space. Sensitivity analyses suggest that CPB+B would become the preferred option if it were to improve OS by 6.1years over CP+P. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, B consolidation for advanced EOC was associated with a modest improvement in effectiveness that is less than that with P consolidation and more costly.

7957,Cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in the Netherlands; the results of a consensus model,"Background: Each year rotavirus gastroenteritis results in thousands of pediatric hospitalizations and primary care visits in the Netherlands. While two vaccines against rotavirus are registered, routine immunization of infants has not yet been implemented. Existing cost-effectiveness studies showed inconsistent results for these vaccines because of lack of consensus on the impact. We aimed to investigate which factors had a major impact on cost-effectiveness and were primarily responsible for the large differences in previously estimated cost-effectiveness ratios. Methods: Based on updated data on health outcomes and cost estimates, we re-assessed the cost-effectiveness of routine pediatric rotavirus vaccination within the National Immunization Program for the Netherlands. Two consensus meetings were organized with national and international experts in the field to achieve consensus and resolve potential controversies. Results: It was estimated that rotavirus vaccination in the Netherlands could avert 34,214 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis in children aged less than 5 years. Notably, 2,779 hospitalizations were averted of which 315 were extensions of existing hospital stays due to nosocomial rotavirus infection. With a threshold varying from 20K € - 50K € per QALY and according to the base-case scenario, the full vaccination costs per child leading to cost-effectiveness was € 57.76 -€ 77.71. Results were sensitive to the inclusion of potential vaccine induced herd protection, QALY losses and number of deaths associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis.

7960,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of peri-operative versus post-operative chemotherapy for resectable colorectal liver metastases,"BACKGROUND: The role of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to hepatectomy in patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases is currently a matter of debate. The aim of the present study was to analyse life-expectancy, quality adjusted life-expectancy and cost-effectiveness of the two chemotherapeutic strategies. METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed, on the basis of parameters derived from an extensive literature search of the last ten years, to compare outcomes of peri-operative versus post-operative chemotherapy. RESULTS: Life-expectancy observed for peri-operative chemotherapy was 54.56months and 52.62months with post-operative chemotherapy only; the quality-adjusted life-expectancy with peri-operative chemotherapy was 39.33 quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs) and 37.84 QALMs with post-operative chemotherapy. Peri-operative chemotherapy results in an increase in total costs of 1180€ over ten years and in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 791.9€/QALM. The model was more sensitive to the expected 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cost of hepatic resection: with respect to an expected 3-year RFS?25% the peri-operative approach was more cost-effective than post-operative strategy but differences in average cost-effectiveness were small. The relationship between ICER and cost of hepatic resection was inverse because the higher the cost of hepatic resection, the higher the cost saving due to patients becoming unresectable during neo-adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of resectable colorectal liver metastases, the addition of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy could be cost-effective because it makes it possible to avoid hepatic resection in patients who do not respond to the neo-adjuvant approach; however, the life-expectancy of the two strategies is very similar.",2011-01-07567,21652204,Eur J Cancer,Giorgio Ercolani,2011,/,,No,21652204,"Giorgio Ercolani; Alessandro Cucchetti; Matteo Cescon; Eugenia Peri; Giovanni Brandi; Massimo Del Gaudio; Matteo Ravaioli; Matteo Zanello; Antonio Daniele Pinna; Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of peri-operative versus post-operative chemotherapy for resectable colorectal liver metastases, Eur J Cancer, 2011-Jun-06; ():0959-8049",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Peri-operative (heptatectomy) chemotherapy vs. Post-operative (heptatectomy) chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,Not Stated,9502.8,Euro,2010,14926.9
7961,Cost effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia in the United States,"Abstract Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of duloxetine when considered as an alternative treatment for patients in the United States (US) being treated for fibromyalgia pain. Research design and methods: A Markov model was used to evaluate the economic and clinical advantages of duloxetine in controlling fibromyalgia pain symptoms over a 2-year time horizon. A base-case treatment sequence was adopted from clinical guidelines, based on tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, and opioids. Treatment response was modeled using changes from baseline in pain severity, and response thresholds: full response (at least a 50% change), response (30-49% change), and no response (less than a 30% change). Clinical efficacy and discontinuation data were taken from placebo- and active-controlled trials identified in a systematic literature review and mixed-treatment comparison. Utility data were based on EQ-5D data. Main outcome measures: Additional symptom-control months (SCMs), defined as the amount of time at a response level of 30% or less, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over a 2-year time horizon. Results: For every 1000 patients, first-line duloxetine resulted in an additional 665 SCMs and 12.3 QALYs, at a cost of $582,911 (equivalent to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] of $877 per SCM and $47,560 per QALY). Second-line duloxetine resulted in an additional 460 SCMs and 8.7 QALYs, at a cost of $143,752 (equivalent to ICERs of $312 per SMC and $16,565 per QALY). Limitations: Response data for TCAs are limited to 30% improvement levels, reported trials are small, and have low placebo response rates. The model necessarily assumes that response rates are independent of placement in the treatment sequence.

Cost-effectiveness analysis with a dynamic model of the US population of pregnant women and infants who were <6 months incorporated seasonal variation in influenza incidence. Compared with no vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnancy costs $70,089 per quality-adjusted life year. Most of the benefit for infants was limited to those whose mothers were vaccinated within the first 4 weeks of vaccine availability. Once all women who were pregnant at the time of vaccine availability were vaccinated, vaccination of newly pregnant women had benefits for mothers but not infants. Delay of vaccination beyond November reduced both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The greatest population benefit from seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnancy was realized if pregnant women were vaccinated as soon as possible after trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine became available. Efforts to increase vaccine rates should be concentrated early in the influenza season.",2011-01-07572,21640230,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Evan R Myers,2011,204 / 6 Suppl 1,S128-40,No,21640230,"Evan R Myers; Derek A Misurski; Geeta K Swamy; Influence of timing of seasonal influenza vaccination on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in pregnancy, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 2011-Jun; 204(6 Suppl 1):0002-9378; S128-40",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Seasonal influenza vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,70089,United States,2010,83188.74

Setting: A single outpatient COPD clinic at the Mater Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland between. Method: CUA alongside a randomised control trial. The economic analysis used data from 127 COPD patients aged over 45 years, with an FEV1 of 30-80% of the predicted normal value. Participants received either a pharmacy-led education and self-management programme, or usual care. One year costs were estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated based on responses to the EQ-5D at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Main outcome measure: Cost per QALY gained. Results: The mean differences in costs and effects between the self-management and education programme and usual care were -£671.59 (95 CI%: -£1,584.73 to -£68.14) and 0.065 (95% CI; 0.000-0.128). Thus the intervention was the dominant strategy as it was both less costly and more effective than usual care. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 95% at a threshold of £20,000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated that conclusions were robust to variations in most of the key parameters.

7965,Cost-effectiveness of multilevel hemilaminectomy for lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Laminectomy for lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy is associated with improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life. However, given rising health-care costs, attention has been turned to question the cost-effectiveness of lumbar decompressive procedures. The cost-effectiveness of multilevel hemilaminectomy for radiculopathy remains unclear. PURPOSE: To assess the comprehensive medical and societal costs of multilevel hemilaminectomy at our institution and determine its cost-effectiveness in the treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective single cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty-four consecutive patients undergoing multilevel hemilaminectomy for lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy after at least 6 months of failed conservative therapy were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported measures were assessed using an outcomes questionnaire that incorporated total back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and improvement in leg pain (visual analog scale for leg pain [VAS-LP]), disability (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), quality of life (Short Form-12 [SF-12]), and health state values (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], calculated from EuroQuol 5D [EQ-5D] with US valuation). METHODS: Over a 2-year period, total back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and improvement in leg pain (VAS-LP), disability (ODI), quality of life (SF-12), and health state values (QALYs, calculated from EQ-5D with US valuation) were assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost), and patient and caregiver workday losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). Mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after multilevel hemilaminectomy was assessed. RESULTS: Compared with preoperative health states reported after at least 6 months of medical management, a significant improvement in VAS-LP, ODI, and SF-12 (physical and mental components) was observed 2 years after multilevel hemilaminectomy, with a mean 2-year gain of 0.72 QALYs. Mean±standard deviation total 2-year cost of multilevel hemilaminectomy was $24,264±10,319 (surgery cost, $10,220±80.57; outpatient resource utilization cost, $3,592±3,243; and indirect cost, $10,452±9,364). Multilevel hemilaminectomy was associated with a mean 2-year cost per QALY gained of $33,700. CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel hemilaminectomy improved pain, disability, and quality of life in patients with lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy. Total cost per QALY gained for multilevel hemilaminectomy was $33,700 when evaluated 2 years after surgery with Medicare fees, suggesting that multilevel hemilaminectomy is a cost-effective treatment of lumbar radiculopathy.",2011-01-07582,21641874,Spine J,Scott L Parker,2011,/,,No,21641874,"Scott L Parker; Erin C Fulchiero; Brandon J Davis; Owoicho Adogwa; Oran S Aaronson; Joseph S Cheng; Clinton J Devin; Matthew J McGirt; Cost-effectiveness of multilevel hemilaminectomy for lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy, Spine J, 2011-Jun-03; ():1529-9430",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multilevel hemilaminectomy vs. Medical management,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,33700,United States,2009,40654.67
7966,A cost-utility analysis of mechanical thrombectomy as an adjunct to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator for acute large-vessel ischemic stroke,"Background and purpose: Mechanical thrombectomy has the potential to improve recanalization rates and outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke, but potential gains could be offset by procedural complications and costs. We evaluated the cost and utility of combined intravenous (IV) tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and mechanical thrombectomy compared to IV tPA alone for acute large-vessel ischemic stroke. Methods: We constructed a decision tree for a hypothetical 68-year-old with a large-vessel ischemic stroke who is eligible for IV tPA. The interventional strategy was IV tPA, a cerebral angiogram, and mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis if indicated. Recanalization, hemorrhage complications, and outcomes for the interventional strategy were from the Multi-MERCI study. The medical strategy was IV tPA using inputs from a comprehensive systematic review. Costs were estimated from Medicare reimbursements. We modeled lifetime costs and utilities for disability using a Markov model and Monte-Carlo multivariable sensitivity analysis. Results: For the baseline scenario, the recanalization rate was 72.9% for the interventional strategy and 46.2% for the medical strategy. For the interventional strategy, the symptomatic hemorrhage rate was 8.6% with recanalization and 15.4% without. For the medical strategy, the corresponding rates were 3.6% and 13.3%, respectively. The interventional strategy was cost-effective in 97.6% of simulations (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $16 001/quality-adjusted life year; 95% CI, $2736-$39,232). Conclusions: Based on observational data, the combination of IV tPA and mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel ischemic stroke appears to be cost-effective compared to IV tPA alone.

7967,Effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention in promoting the well-being of independently living older people: results of the Well Elderly 2 Randomised Controlled Trial,"Background Older people are at risk for health decline and loss of independence. Lifestyle interventions offer potential for reducing such negative outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a preventive lifestyle-based occupational therapy intervention, administered in a variety of community-based sites, in improving mental and physical well-being and cognitive functioning in ethnically diverse older people. Methods A randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing an occupational therapy intervention and a no-treatment control condition over a 6-month experimental phase. Participants included 460 men and women aged 60-95&emsp14;years (mean age 74.9±7.7&emsp14;years; 53% <$12?000 annual income) recruited from 21 sites in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results Intervention participants, relative to untreated controls, showed more favourable change scores on indices of bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health, composite mental functioning, life satisfaction and depressive symptomatology (ps<0.05). The intervention group had a significantly greater increment in quality-adjusted life years (p<0.02), which was achieved cost-effectively (US $41?218/UK £24?868 per unit). No intervention effect was found for cognitive functioning outcome measures. Conclusions A lifestyle-oriented occupational therapy intervention has beneficial effects for ethnically diverse older people recruited from a wide array of community settings. Because the intervention is cost-effective and is applicable on a wide-scale basis, it has the potential to help reduce health decline and promote well-being in older people.

7968,An Integrated Health-Economic Analysis of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategies in the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Study objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder associated with substantially increased cardiovascular risks, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of motor vehicle collisions due to daytime sleepiness. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of three commonly used diagnostic strategies (full-night polysomnography, split-night polysomnography, unattended portable home-monitoring) in conjunction with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. Design: A Markov model was created to compare costs and effectiveness of different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies over a 10-year interval and the expected lifetime of the patient. The primary measure of cost-effectiveness was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Patients or participants: Baseline computations were performed for a hypothetical average cohort of 50-year-old males with a 50% pretest probability of having moderate-to-severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 15 events per hour). Measurements and results: For a patient with moderate-to-severe OSA, CPAP therapy has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $15,915 per QALY gained for the lifetime horizon. Over the lifetime horizon in a population with 50% prevalence of OSA, full-night polysomnography in conjunction with CPAP therapy is the most economically efficient strategy at any willingness-to-pay greater than $17,131 per-QALY gained because it dominates all other strategies in comparative analysis. Conclusions: Full-night polysomnography (PSG) is cost-effective and is the preferred diagnostic strategy for adults suspected to have moderate-to-severe OSA when all diagnostic options are available. Split-night PSG and unattended home monitoring can be considered cost-effective alternatives when full-night PSG is not available.

We compared the cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in three settings, sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics serving men who have sex with men, hospital emergency departments (EDs), settings where patients are likely to be diagnosed early, and inpatient diagnosis based on clinical manifestations. Methods and findings: We developed the Progression and Transmission of HIV/AIDS model, a health state transition model that tracks index patients and their infected partners from HIV infection to death. We used program characteristics for each setting to compare the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from early versus late diagnosis and treatment. We ran the model for 10,000 index patients for each setting, examining alternative scenarios, excluding and including transmission to partners, and assuming HAART was initiated at a CD4 count of either 350 or 500 cells/µL. Screening in STD clinics and EDs was cost-effective compared with diagnosing inpatients, even when including only the benefits to the index patients. Screening patients in STD clinics, who have less-advanced disease, was cost-effective compared with ED screening when treatment with HAART was initiated at a CD4 count of 500 cells/µL. When the benefits of reduced transmission to partners from early diagnosis were included, screening in settings with less-advanced disease stages was cost-saving compared with screening later in the course of infection. The study was limited by a small number of observations on CD4 count at diagnosis and by including transmission only to first generation partners of the index patients.

7981,Tubular diskectomy versus conventional microdiskectomy for the treatment of lumbar disk related sciatica: cost utility analysis alongside a double-blinded randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND:: Conventional microdiskectomy is the most frequently performed surgery for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disk herniation. Transmuscular tubular diskectomy has been introduced to increase the rate of recovery, although evidence is lacking of its efficacy. OBJECTIVE:: To determine whether a favorable cost effectiveness for tubular diskectomy compared with conventional microdiskectomy is attained METHODS:: Cost utility analysis alongside a double-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted among 325 patients with lumbar disk related sciatica lasting more than 6-8 weeks at seven Dutch hospitals comparing tubular diskectomy with conventional microdiskectomy. Main outcome measures are quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at one year and societal costs, estimated from patient reported utilities (US and NL EuroQol, SF-6D, and visual analogue scale) and diaries on costs (healthcare, patient costs, and productivity). RESULTS:: QALYs during all four quarters and according to all utility measures were not statistically different between tubular diskectomy and conventional microdiskectomy (difference US EuroQol -0.012, 95% confidence interval -0.046 to 0.021). From the healthcare perspective, tubular diskectomy resulted in non-significant higher costs (difference US$ 460, 95% confidence interval $-243 to $1163). From the societal perspective, a non-significant difference of US$ 1491 (95% confidence interval $-1335 to $4318) in favor of conventional microdiskectomy was found. The non-significant differences in costs and QALYs in favor of conventional microdiskectomy result in a low probability that tubular diskectomy is more cost effective than conventional microdiskectomy. CONCLUSION:: Tubular diskectomy is unlikely to be cost effective compared with conventional microdiskectomy.

Metabolic effects and cost-effectiveness in aripiprazole versus olanzapine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of aripiprazole versus olanzapine in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in Sweden with focus on the metabolic impact of the treatments. Method: A Markov health-state transition model was developed. The risks of developing metabolic syndrome after one year of treatment with aripiprazole or olanzapine were derived from a pooled analysis of three randomised clinical trials. The subsequent risks of developing diabetes or coronary heart disease were based on previously published risk models. A societal perspective was applied, adopting a lifetime horizon. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Treatment with aripiprazole dominates over olanzapine in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In schizophrenia, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were 0.08 and cost savings Swedish kronor (SEK) 30 570 (USD 4000); in bipolar disorder, QALYs gained were 0.09 and cost savings SEK 28 450 (USD 3720). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, aripiprazole resulted in a dominant outcome in 84% of cases in schizophrenia and in 77% of cases in bipolar syndrome.

Methods and Results- On the basis of the results from Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) and other trials, we developed a decision-analysis model to compare the cost and quality-adjusted survival of various antithrombotic therapies. We ran our Markov model in a hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with AF using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50 000/quality-adjusted life-year.

7988,Cost-effectiveness of early detection of breast cancer in Catalonia (Spain),"Background: Breast cancer (BC) causes more deaths than any other cancer among women in Catalonia. Early detection has contributed to the observed decline in BC mortality. However, there is debate on the optimal screening strategy. We performed an economic evaluation of 20 screening strategies taking into account the cost over time of screening and subsequent medical costs, including diagnostic confirmation, initial treatment, follow-up and advanced care. Methods: We used a probabilistic model to estimate the effect and costs over time of each scenario. The effect was measured as years of life (YL), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and lives extended (LE). Costs of screening and treatment were obtained from the Early Detection Program and hospital databases of the IMAS-Hospital del Mar in Barcelona. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to compare the relative costs and outcomes of different scenarios. Results: Strategies that start at ages 40 or 45 and end at 69 predominate when the effect is measured as YL or QALYs. Biennial strategies 50-69, 45-69 or annual 45-69, 40-69 and 40-74 were selected as cost-effective for both effect measures (YL or QALYs). The ICER increases considerably when moving from biennial to annual scenarios. Moving from no screening to biennial 50-69 years represented an ICER of 4,469€ per QALY.

7994,A short-term cost-effectiveness study comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic and open retropubic radical prostatectomy,"Abstract Objective: To evaluate cost effectiveness and cost utility comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) versus retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP). Methods: In a retrospective cohort study a total of 231 men between the age of 50 and 69 years and with clinically localised prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at the Department of Urology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2007, were included. The RALP and RRP patients were matched 1:2 on the basis of age and the D'Amico Risk Classification of Prostate Cancer; 77 RALP and 154 RRP. An economic evaluation was made to estimate direct costs of the first postoperative year and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per successful surgical treatment and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). A successful RP was defined as: no residual cancer (PSA <0.2?ng/ml, preserved urinary continence and erectile function. A one-way sensitivity analysis was made to investigate the impact of changing one variable at a time. Results: The ICER per extra successful treatment was €64,343 using RALP. For indirect costs, the ICER per extra successful treatment was €13,514 using RALP. The difference in effectiveness between RALP and RRP procedures was 7% in favour of RALP. In the present study no QALY was gained 1 year after RALP, however this result is uncertain due to a high degree of missing data. The sensitivity analysis did not change the results noticeably. Limitations: The study was limited by the design resulting in a low percentage of information on the effect of medication for erectile dysfunction and only short-term quality of life was measured at 1 year postoperatively. Conclusion: RALP was more effective and more costly. A way to improve the cost effectiveness may be to perform RALP at fewer high volume urology centres and utilise the full potential of each robot.",2011-01-07624,21604962,J Med Econ,Lena Hohw?,2011,14 / 4,403-9,Yes,21604962,"Lena Hohw?; Michael Borre; Lars Ehlers; Knud Venborg Pedersen; A short-term cost-effectiveness study comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic and open retropubic radical prostatectomy, J Med Econ, 2011; 14(4):1369-6998; 403-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP),Not Stated,69 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-727692.31,Euro,2008,-1288111.35

To date, no analysis has evaluated the economic costs and benefits associated with fesoterodine, compared to antimuscarinics in Spain. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the economic value of OAB treatment with fesoterodine relative to extended release tolterodine and solifenacin, from the societal perspective.Methods: The economic model was based on data from two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, and multicenter trials comparing fesoterodine and tolterodine extended released (ER). Treatment response rates for solifenacin were extracted from the published literature. Discontinuation and efficacy were based on the results of a 12-week multinational randomized clinical trial extrapolated to 52 weeks. Changes in health related quality of life were assessed with the King's Health Questionnaire, which was transformed into preference-based utility values. Medical costs included (expressed in € 2010) were antimuscarinics, physician visits, laboratory tests, incontinence pads and the costs of OAB-related comorbidities, fractures, skin infections, urinary tract infections, depression, and nursing home admissions associated with incontinence. Time lost from work was also considered. Univariate sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results: At week 12, continents accounted for 50.6%, 40.6% and 47.2% of patients in the fesoterodine, tolterodine, and solifenacin groups, respectively. By week 52, the projected proportions of patients remaining on therapy were 33.1%, 26.5% and 30.8%, respectively. The projected quality- adjusted life years (QALY) gain (compared to baseline) over the 52-week simulation period were 0.01014, 0.00846 and 0.00957, respectively. The overall treatment cost was estimated at €1,937, €2,089 and €1,960 for fesoterodine, tolterodine and solifenacin, respectively. Therefore, treatment with fesoterodine resulted in similar overall costs and greater QALY gain than treatment with either tolterodine or solifenacin. Sensitivity analysis showed that these results were robust to all changes performed. Conclusions: The results of this economic analysis suggest that fesoterodine is a cost-effective alternative to tolterodine and solifenacin for the treatment of patients with OAB in Spain.

7997,"Cost-effectiveness of combination versus sequential docetaxel and carboplatin for the treatment of platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer","BACKGROUND: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, the combination weekly docetaxel and carboplatin was associated a with progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.7 months compared with 8.4 months for sequential, single-agent docetaxel followed by carboplatin. The objective of the current study was to construct a cost-utility model to compare these 2 regimens with the incorporation of prospectively collected quality-of-life (QoL) data. METHODS: An RCT of concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin (cDC) versus docetaxel followed by carboplatin (sequential docetaxel and carboplatin [sDC]) was the basis for a Markov decision model, and the primary effectiveness outcome was PFS. Costs were estimated using US dollars based on Medicare reimbursements for chemotherapy regimens, bone marrow support, and management of adverse events. QoL data obtained using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaire were converted to utilities. Costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported in US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Extensive 1-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: The least expensive strategy was sDC, which cost an average of $20,381, compared with cDC, which cost an average of $25,122. cDC had an ICER of $25,239 per QALY compared with sDC. cDC remained cost-effective, with an ICER <$50,000 per QALY, over a range of costs and estimates. In Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis using a $50,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, cDC was either dominant or cost-effective with an ICER <$50,000 per QALY in 83% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Combined weekly cDC appeared to be cost-effective compared with sDC as treatment strategy for patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, even when accounting for slightly lower QoL during treatment.

7998,A model to incorporate genetic testing (5-HTTLPR) in pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorders,"Abstract Objective. To evaluate the benefit of pharmacogenetics in antidepressant treatment. Methods. In a simulated trial 100,000 subjects in a current episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) received citalopram or bupropion based on the clinician's decision (algorithm A) or following indications from 5-HTTLPR genetic testing (algorithm B), which effect size of was estimated from a meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic trials. A and B were compared in a cost-utility analysis (12 weeks). Costs (international $, 2010) were drawn from official sources. Treatment effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life weeks (QALWs). Outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results. Under base-case conditions, genetic test use was associated with increases in antidepressant response (0.062 QALWs) and tolerability (0.016 QALWs) but cost benefit was not acceptable (ICER = $2,890; $1,800-$4,091). However, when the joint effect on antidepressant response and tolerability was analyzed in two recurrent episodes, ICER dropped to $1,392 ($837-$1,982). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) showed a >80% probability that ICER value fell below the commonly accepted 3 times Gross Domestic Product (GDP) threshold (World Health Organization) and therefore suggesting cost-effectiveness.

To predict the undiscounted future health economic consequences of the reduction of dietary salt and SFA, the model results were extrapolated for the years 2010-2030 by replacing the baseline population in the year 2007 with the extrapolated populations from the official Finnish statistics. Finnish costs (\[euro]2009, societal perspective) and EQ-5D utilities were obtained from published references.Results:During the next 20 years, a population-wide intervention directed at salt intake and dietary fat quality could potentially lead to 8000-13?000 prevented CVD cases among the Finnish adults compared the situation in year 2007. In addition, the reduced incidence of CVDs could gain 26?000-45?000 quality-adjusted life years and save \[euro]150-225 million over the same time period.Conclusion:A modest reduction of salt and replacement of SFA with PUFA in food products can significantly reduce the burden of CVD in the adult Finnish population.

8000,Cost-Effectiveness of Combination Nonbiologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug Strategies in Patients with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the costs and benefits of alternative combination strategies of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and DMARD monotherapy in patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Data were drawn from randomized controlled trials that compared DMARD monotherapy or any DMARD combination strategy, with or without combined steroid therapy. Mixed treatment comparison methods were used to estimate the relative effectiveness of the different strategies. A mathematical model was developed to compare the longterm costs and benefits of the alternative strategies, combining data from a variety of sources. Costs were considered from a health sector viewpoint and benefits were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). RESULTS: If decision makers use a threshold of £20,000 (US$29,000) per QALY, then the strategies most likely to be cost-effective are either DMARD combination therapy with downward titration (probability of being optimal = 0.50) or intensive, triple DMARD combination therapy (probability of being optimal = 0.43). The intensive DMARD strategy generated an additional cost of £27,392 per additional QALY gained compared to the downward titration strategy. Other combination strategies were unlikely to be considered cost-effective compared to DMARD monotherapy. Results were robust to a range of scenario sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Combination DMARD therapy is likely to be cost-effective compared to DMARD monotherapy where treatment entails rapid downward dose titration or intensive, triple DMARD therapy.",2011-01-07648,21572149,J Rheumatol,Jonathan C Tosh,2011,/,,No,21572149,"Jonathan C Tosh; Allan J Wailoo; David L Scott; Chris M Deighton; Cost-Effectiveness of Combination Nonbiologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug Strategies in Patients with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, J Rheumatol, 2011-May-15; ():0315-162X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Step-up combination: DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) monotherapy followed by second DMARD vs. DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) monotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,2852,United Kingdom,2008,6357.76
