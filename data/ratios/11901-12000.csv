11901,Cost-effectiveness of injectable opioid treatment v. oral methadone for chronic heroin addiction,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of the effectiveness of injectable opioid treatment compared with oral methadone for chronic heroin addiction, the additional cost of injectable treatment is considerable, and cost-effectiveness uncertain. AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of supervised injectable heroin and injectable methadone with optimised oral methadone for chronic refractory heroin addiction. METHOD: Multisite, open-label, randomised controlled trial. Outcomes were assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Economic perspective included health, social services and criminal justice resources. RESULTS: Intervention costs over 26 weeks were significantly higher for injectable heroin (mean pound8995 v. pound4674 injectable methadone and pound2596 oral methadone; P<0.0001). Costs overall were highest for oral methadone (mean pound15 805 v. pound13 410 injectable methadone and pound10 945 injectable heroin; P = n.s.) due to higher costs of criminal activity. In cost-effectiveness analysis, oral methadone was dominated by injectable heroin and injectable methadone (more expensive and less effective). At willingness to pay of pound30 000 per QALY, there is a higher probability of injectable methadone being more cost-effective (80%) than injectable heroin. CONCLUSIONS: Injectable opioid treatments are more cost-effective than optimised oral methadone for chronic refractory heroin addiction. The choice between supervised injectable heroin and injectable methadone is less clear. There is currently evidence to suggest superior effectiveness of injectable heroin but at a cost that policy makers may find unacceptable.

11903,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the Belgian healthcare setting,"BACKGROUND: Warfarin, an inexpensive drug that has been available for over half a century, has been the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Recently, rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) which offers some distinct advantages over warfarin, the standard of care in a world without NOACs, has been introduced and is now recommended by international guidelines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate, from a Belgian healthcare payer perspective, the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus use of warfarin for the treatment of patients with non-valvular AF at moderate to high risk. METHODS: A Markov model was designed and populated with local cost estimates, safety-on-treatment clinical results from the pivotal phase III ROCKET AF trial and utility values obtained from the literature. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban treatment was associated with fewer ischemic strokes and systemic embolisms (0.308 vs. 0.321 events), intracranial bleeds (0.048 vs. 0.063), and myocardial infarctions (0.082 vs. 0.095) per patient compared with warfarin. Over a lifetime time horizon, rivaroxaban led to a reduction of 0.042 life-threatening events per patient, and increases of 0.111 life-years and 0.094 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus warfarin treatment. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro8,809 per QALY or euro7,493 per life-year gained. These results are based on valuated data from 2010. Sensitivity analysis indicated that these results were robust and that rivaroxaban is cost-effective compared with warfarin in 87 % of cases should a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro35,000/QALY gained be considered. CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis suggests that rivaroxaban is a cost-effective alternative to warfarin therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF in the Belgian healthcare setting.",2013-01-14334,24030788,Pharmacoeconomics,Joris Kleintjens,2013,31 / 10,909-18,Yes,24030788,"Joris Kleintjens; Xiao Li; Steven Simoens; Vincent Thijs; Marnix Goethals; Ernst R Rietzschel; Yumi Asukai; Omer Saka; Thomas Evers; Petra Faes; Stefaan Vansieleghem; Mimi De Ruyck; Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the Belgian healthcare setting, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 31(10):1179-2027; 909-18",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban for stroke prevention vs. Warfarin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,8809,Euro,2010,13837.08

11907,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the surgical treatment of female urinary incontinence using slings and meshes,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of the surgical treatment of female urinary incontinence using suburethral slings and prolapse meshes compared with therapeutic abstention. STUDY DESIGN: An economic analysis was performed on 69 women receiving surgical treatment for urinary incontinence using suburethral slings and prolapse meshes. To calculate the procedure''s cost-effectiveness, an incremental analysis up to one year was performed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The costs were calculated using a cost-by-process model. Answers to the health-related quality of life questionnaires EQ-5D (generic) and International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Short-form (specific) were collected before the operation and as well as one month and one year post-operation to calculate the utility, using quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and the effectiveness, respectively. To complete the economic evaluation, we derived confidence ellipses and acceptability curves. The analysis was conducted for the entire sample and also for each type of urinary incontinence. RESULTS: In total, 45 women presented with stress incontinence, 15 with mixed incontinence and 9 with incontinence associated with prolapse. The average cost per patient at one year post-operation was 1220 euro. The QALY achieved at one year was 0.046.

11911,Pre-emptive virology screening in the pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant population: a cost effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at a uniquely high risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. The pre-emptive treatment model whereby asymptomatic post-transplant patients are routinely screened with treatment initiated if found viremic has recently been shown to be superior in terms of patient mortality when compared to deferring laboratory assessment and treatment until symptoms emerge. This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of the pre-emptive therapy model in patient care dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Utilization and outcome data were compiled as a retrospective cohort study of 96 pediatric patients receiving HSCT at University of California Los Angeles Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department between the years 2006 and 2010. Two-decision tree models were constructed for each the pre-emptive model and the deferred model wherein costs and probability assumptions were based on either previously published literature or calculated from this study cohort. RESULTS: The pre-emptive model resulted in a five-year survival of 71%, during which time 4% of patients were found to be EBV viremic, while 33% were found to be CMV viremic. The average actual cost of EBV/CMV virology screening per patient in the cohort following the pre-emptive model was $9699 while the expected cost following the deferred model was $19,284. This results in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio illustrating pre-emptive model cost-savings of $2367/QALY.

11912,"Prospective study of pain, quality of life and the economic impact of open inguinal hernia repair","BACKGROUND: There are variations in quality of life (QoL) and reported risk of chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement in pain and QoL after open inguinal hernia repair, and the economic impact. METHODS: Patients undergoing open mesh repair of a primary unilateral inguinal hernia were stratified depending on preoperative levels of symptoms and pain. Short Form 36 (SF-36(R)) and EQ-5D questionnaires were filled in before, and at 3 and 12 months after surgery. EQ-5D data, together with information on the mean value of a quality-adjusted life-year and the societal cost of hernia repair, were used to calculate the monetary value of QoL gained and the mean return on investment. RESULTS: Of 225 patients who began the study, 184 completed follow-up at 12 months. Some 77.2 per cent reported improvement in pain and 5.4 per cent reported increased pain after surgery. Significant improvement in SF-36(R) scores, pain scores measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), and symptoms were found in the majority of patients, even those with mild symptoms before surgery. For the whole group, the bodily pain score increased from 56.4 before surgery to 82.6 at 12 months after hernia repair (P < 0.050), and the VAS score decreased from a median of 4 to 0 (P < 0.050). The return on investment was positive for all groups of patients, including those with mild symptoms.

METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to project lifetime health-related outcomes, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness of Stribild compared with Atripla as first-line antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected US patients. Patients progressed in 12-week cycles through second-line, third-line, and nonsuppressive therapies, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and death. Baseline characteristics and first-line virologic suppression, change in CD4 count, and adverse effects (lipid, central nervous system, rash, renal) were based on 48-week clinical trial results. These results demonstrated equivalent virologic suppression between the two regimens. Point estimates for virologic suppression (favoring Stribild) were used in the base case, and equivalency was used in the scenario analysis. Published sources and expert opinion were used to estimate costs, utilities, risk of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, mortality, subsequent-line CD4 count, clinical efficacy, and adverse events. Costs were reported in 2012 US dollars. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness of results. RESULTS: Compared with patients initiating Atripla, patients initiating Stribild were estimated to have higher lifetime costs. Stribild added 0.041 QALYs over a lifetime at an additional cost of $6,886, producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $166,287/QALY gained. Results were most sensitive to first-line response rates, product costs, and likelihood of renal adverse events. When equivalent efficacy was assumed, Atripla dominated Stribild with lower costs and greater QALYs. CONCLUSION: At a societal willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY, Stribild was not cost-effective in the base case compared with Atripla for first-line HIV treatment.",2013-01-14353,24039438,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Timothy Juday,2013,5 /,437-45,No,24039438,"Timothy Juday; Todd Correll; Ayanna Anene; Michael S Broder; Jesse Ortendahl; Tanya Bentley; Cost-effectiveness of the once-daily efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir tablet compared with the once-daily elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir tablet as first-line antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected adults in the US, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 5():1178-6981; 437-45",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Once-daily tablet of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Stribild) vs. once-daily tablet of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Atripla),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,166287,United States,2012,187447.86
11914,EVEREST II high risk study based UK cost-effectiveness analysis of MitraClip(R) in patients with severe mitral regurgitation ineligible for conventional repair/replacement surgery,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MitraClip, an interventional procedure for patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation. METHODS: A decision analytic model with a lifetime horizon was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of MitraClip vs conventional medical management in patients with severe mitral regurgitation, ineligible for surgery. The analysis was performed from a UK NHS perspective and the estimates for mortality, adverse events, and cross-sectional NYHA class were obtained from the EVEREST II High Risk Study (HRS). Utility decrements were obtained from a heath technology assessment on Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, while unit costs were obtained from national databases. The concept model was clinically validated. Costs (2011 poundUK) and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. RESULTS: Compared to medical management, over 2- and 10-year periods MitraClip had incremental Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains of 0.48 and 2.04, respectively. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios for MitraClip at 2 and 10 years are pound52,947 and pound14,800 per QALY gained. Overall, the model was most sensitive to the choice of time horizon, the discount rate applied to benefits, the starting age of cohort, the utility decrement associated with NYHA II, and cost of the MitraClip procedure. The model was insensitive to changes in all other parameters. MitraClip was also found to be cost-effective, regardless of the modelling approach, and insensitive to the key assumptions of the procedure cost. STUDY LIMITATIONS: The primary limitation of the analysis is the reliance on aggregate data from a modestly sized non-randomized study with a short-term follow-up period. Aligned to this was the need to extrapolate survival well beyond the study period in order to generate meaningful results. The impact of both of these limitations was explored via extensive sensitivity analyses.

11915,Genetic screening for the predisposition to venous thromboembolism: a cost-utility analysis of clinical practice in the Italian health care system,"OBJECTIVES: In the Italian health care system, genetic tests for factor V Leiden and factor II are routinely prescribed to assess the predisposition to venous thromboembolism (VTE) of women who request oral contraception. With specific reference to two subpopulations of women already at risk (i.e., familial history or previous event of VTE), the study aimed to assess whether current screening practices in Italy are cost-effective. METHODS: Two decisional models accrued costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) annually from the perspective of the National Health Service. The two models were derived from a decision analysis exercise concerning testing practices and consequent prescribing behavior for oral contraception conducted with 250 Italian gynecologists. Health care costs were compiled on the basis of 10-year hospital discharge records and the activities of a thrombosis center. Whenever possible, input data were based on the Italian context; otherwise, the data were taken from the international literature. RESULTS: Current testing practices on women with a familial history of VTE generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro72,412/QALY, which is well above the acceptable threshold of cost-effectiveness of euro40,000 to euro50,000/QALY. In the case of women with a previous event of VTE, the most frequently used testing strategy is cost-ineffective and leads to an overall loss of QALY.

11918,Cost-effectiveness of baseline low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer: the Israeli experience,"OBJECTIVE: Reduced mortality with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening was demonstrated in a large randomized controlled study of high-risk individuals. Cost-effectiveness must be assessed before routine LDCT screening is considered. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT lung cancer screening in Israel. METHODS: A decision analytic framework was used to evaluate the decision to screen or not screen from the health system perspective. The screening arm included 842 moderate-to-heavy smokers aged 45 years or older, screened at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center from 1998 to 2004. In the usual-care arm, stage distribution and stage-specific life expectancy were obtained from the Israel National Cancer Registry data for 1994 to 2006. Lifetime stage-specific costs were estimated from medical records of patients diagnosed and treated at Hadassah Medical Center in the period 2003 to 2004. The analysis considered possible biases-lead time, overdiagnosis, and self-selection. Cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained by screening was estimated. RESULTS: Base-case incremental cost per QALY gained was $1464 (2011 prices). Extensive sensitivity analysis affirmed the low cost per QALY gained. The cost per QALY gained is lower than $10,000 with probability 0.937 and is lower than $20,000 with probability 0.978.

11919,Cost-utility of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing compared to conventional total hip replacement in young active patients with osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty (MoM HRA) has emerged as an alternative to total hip arthroplasty (THA) for younger active patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Birmingham hip resurfacing is the most common MoM HRA in Alberta, and is therefore compared with conventional THA. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected cost-utility of MoM HRA versus THA, in younger patients with OA, using a decision analytic model with a 15-year time horizon. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov decision analytic model was constructed to estimate the expected cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of MoM HRA versus THA from a health care payer perspective. The base case considered patients with OA aged 50 years; men comprised 65.9% of the cohort. Sensitivity analyses evaluated cohort age, utility values, failure probabilities, and treatment costs. Data were derived from the Hip Improvement Project and the Hip and Knee Replacement Pilot databases in Alberta, the 2010 National Joint Replacement Registry of the Australian Orthopaedic Association, and the literature. RESULTS: In the base case, THA was dominated by MoM HRA (incremental mean costs of -$583 and incremental mean QALYs of 0.079). In subgroup analyses, THA remained dominated when cohort age was 40 years instead of 50 years or when only men were assessed. THA dominated when the cohort age was 60 years or when only women were assessed. Results were sensitive to utilities, surgery costs, and MoM HRA revision and conversion probabilities. At a willingness-to-pay of Can $50,000/QALY, there was a 58% probability that MoM HRA is cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that, on average, MoM HRA was preferred to THA for younger and male patients, but THA is still a reasonable option if the patient or clinician prefers given the small absolute differences between the options and the confidence ellipses around the cost-effectiveness estimates.",2013-01-14359,24041344,Value Health,Sanne Heintzbergen,2013,16 / 6,942-52,Yes,24041344,"Sanne Heintzbergen; Nathalie A Kulin; Maarten J Ijzerman; Lotte M G Steuten; Jason Werle; Hoa Khong; Deborah A Marshall; Cost-utility of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing compared to conventional total hip replacement in young active patients with osteoarthritis, Value Health, ; 16(6):1098-3015; 942-52",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Metal-on-metal Birmingham hip resurfacing arthroplasty (MoM HRA) vs. total hip arthroplasty (THA),Active individuals,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,-7379.75,Canada,2011,-8588.35

Birmingham hip resurfacing is the most common MoM HRA in Alberta, and is therefore compared with conventional THA. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected cost-utility of MoM HRA versus THA, in younger patients with OA, using a decision analytic model with a 15-year time horizon. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov decision analytic model was constructed to estimate the expected cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of MoM HRA versus THA from a health care payer perspective. The base case considered patients with OA aged 50 years; men comprised 65.9% of the cohort. Sensitivity analyses evaluated cohort age, utility values, failure probabilities, and treatment costs. Data were derived from the Hip Improvement Project and the Hip and Knee Replacement Pilot databases in Alberta, the 2010 National Joint Replacement Registry of the Australian Orthopaedic Association, and the literature. RESULTS: In the base case, THA was dominated by MoM HRA (incremental mean costs of -$583 and incremental mean QALYs of 0.079).

11927,Lifetime cost-effectiveness of trial of labor after cesarean in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a trial of labor after one previous cesarean (TOLAC) when incorporating long-term events and outcomes. METHODS: A Markov model comparing TOLAC with elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) was developed for a hypothetical cohort with no contraindication to a TOLAC. Women were selected from a prospective study to derive probability estimates for potential events through three subsequent pregnancies. Probabilities for cerebral palsy and stress urinary incontinence, cost data, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were obtained from the literature. The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness measured as the marginal cost per QALY gained, with a $50,000 threshold per QALY used to define cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The TOLAC strategy dominated the ERCD strategy at baseline, with $164.2 million saved and 500 QALYs gained per 100,000 women. The model was sensitive to six variables: the probability of uterine rupture and successful TOLAC among women with no prior vaginal delivery, the frequency of stress urinary incontinence, and the costs of failed TOLAC, successful TOLAC, and ERCD. When the probability of TOLAC success was at the base value, 67.2%, TOLAC was preferred if the probability of uterine rupture was 3.1% or less. When the probability of uterine rupture was at the base value, 0.8%, the TOLAC strategy was preferred as long as the probability of success was 47.2% or more. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Under baseline circumstances, TOLAC is less expensive and more effective than an ERCD when considering long-term consequences when the likelihood of success is 47.2% or more.",2013-01-14360,24041345,Value Health,Sharon A Gilbert,2013,16 / 6,953-64,Yes,24041345,"Sharon A Gilbert; William A Grobman; Mark B Landon; Michael W Varner; Ronald J Wapner; Yoram Sorokin; Baha M Sibai; John M Thorp; Susan M Ramin; Brian M Mercer; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National; Lifetime cost-effectiveness of trial of labor after cesarean in the United States, Value Health, ; 16(6):1098-3015; 953-64",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Trial of labor after one previous cesarean (TOLAC) vs. elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD),without prior vaginal delivery,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-328400,United States,2009,-396171.91
11928,Economic assessment of an anti-HCV screening program in Italy,"BACKGROUND: The progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease usually occurs over a 10-year period. HCV-related complications as well as the highly debilitating effects on patients represent a significant item of expenditure for the National Health Service. Early detection of HCV infection is an excellent opportunity to improve patients'' quality of life and to rationalize resource allocation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a cost-effectiveness evaluation of an anti-HCV screening program in the Italian National Health Service perspective. METHODS: We built a Markov model made up of two arms. The ''''Test Strategy'''' arm involves a screening program based on the enzyme immunoassay for detection of antibodies as first-level test and the research of HCV RNA as second-level detection; patients with positive test results are treated with peg-interferon alfa in combination with ribavirine. Parameters were derived from the literature and validated through experts'' opinion. Costs and benefits were discounted by 3.5%. Results were expressed as cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained through the screening program compared with the treatment of symptomatic patients. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the ''''Test Strategy'''' is euro5171/QALY, definitively below the cost/QALY of other approved treatments in Italy.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of treatment with BOC in previously treated patients with chronic hepatitis C in the United States using treatment-related data from RESPOND-2 and PROVIDE studies. METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model to project the burden of HCV disease, lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life-years associated with PR and two BOC-based therapies-response-guided therapy (BOC/RGT) and fixed-duration therapy for 48 weeks (BOC/PR48). We estimated treatment-related inputs (efficacy, adverse events, and discontinuations) from clinical trials and obtained disease progression rates, costs, and quality-of-life data from published studies. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for BOC-based regimens as studied in RESPOND-2, as well as by patient''s prior response to treatment and the IL-28B genotype. RESULTS: BOC-based regimens were projected to reduce the lifetime incidence of liver-related complications by 43% to 53% in comparison with treatment with PR. The ICER of BOC/RGT in comparison with that of PR was $30,200, and the ICER of BOC/PR48 in comparison with that of BOC/RGT was $91,500. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, the probabilities of BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 being the preferred option were 0.74 and 0.25, respectively.

METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model to project the burden of HCV disease, lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life-years associated with PR and two BOC-based therapies-response-guided therapy (BOC/RGT) and fixed-duration therapy for 48 weeks (BOC/PR48). We estimated treatment-related inputs (efficacy, adverse events, and discontinuations) from clinical trials and obtained disease progression rates, costs, and quality-of-life data from published studies. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for BOC-based regimens as studied in RESPOND-2, as well as by patient''s prior response to treatment and the IL-28B genotype. RESULTS: BOC-based regimens were projected to reduce the lifetime incidence of liver-related complications by 43% to 53% in comparison with treatment with PR. The ICER of BOC/RGT in comparison with that of PR was $30,200, and the ICER of BOC/PR48 in comparison with that of BOC/RGT was $91,500. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, the probabilities of BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 being the preferred option were 0.74 and 0.25, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients previously treated for chronic HCV genotype-1 infection, BOC was projected to increase quality-adjusted life-years and reduce the lifetime incidence of liver complications.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of treatment with BOC in previously treated patients with chronic hepatitis C in the United States using treatment-related data from RESPOND-2 and PROVIDE studies. METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model to project the burden of HCV disease, lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life-years associated with PR and two BOC-based therapies-response-guided therapy (BOC/RGT) and fixed-duration therapy for 48 weeks (BOC/PR48).

11950,Cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-participated warfarin therapy management in Thailand,"INTRODUCTION: Although pharmacist-participated warfarin therapy management (PWTM) is well established, the economic evaluation of PWTM is still lacking particularly in Asia-Pacific region. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PWTM in Thailand using local data where available. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued to patients receiving warfarin therapy through PWTM or usual care (UC). The model was populated with relevant information from both health care system and societal perspectives. Input data were obtained from literatures and database analyses. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were presented as year 2012 values. A base-case analysis was performed for patients at age 45 years old. Sensitivity analyses including one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were constructed to determine the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: From societal perspective, PWTM and UC results in 39.5 and 38.7 QALY, respectively. Thus, PWTM increase QALY by 0.79, and increase costs by 92,491 THB (3,083 USD) compared with UC (ICER 116,468 THB [3,882.3 USD] per QALY gained). While, from health care system perspective, PWTM also results in 0.79 QALY, and increase costs by 92,788 THB (3,093 USD) compared with UC (ICER 116,842 THB [3,894.7 USD] per QALY gained). Thus, PWTM was cost-effective compared with usual care, assuming willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 150,000 THB/QALY. Results were sensitive to the discount rate and cost of clinic set-up. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggests that PWTM is a cost-effective intervention. Policy-makers may consider our finding as part of information in their decision-making for implementing this strategy into healthcare benefit package.

METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate the natural evolution of HPV and its progress to cervical cancer, considering the current preventive programs and treatment costs. The one-year transition probabilities were mainly based on empirical data of local and national studies. The model evaluated the addition of the vaccine to three cervical cancer-screening scenarios (0, 3 or 10 exams throughout life). RESULTS: The scenario of three Pap tests resulted in satisfactory calibration (base case). The addition of HPV vaccination would reduce by 35% the incidence of cervical cancer (70% vaccination coverage). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ 825 for each quality-adjusted life year gained. The sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of this result, and duration of immunity was the parameter with greater variation in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

11954,Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,"Chinese translation BACKGROUND: In the TEMPO (Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes) trial, tolvaptan significantly reduced expansion of kidney volume and loss of kidney function. OBJECTIVE: To determine how the benefits of tolvaptan seen in TEMPO may relate to longer-term health outcomes, such as progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death, and cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: A decision-analytic model. DATA SOURCES: Published literature from 1993 to 2012. TARGET POPULATION: Persons with early autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Patients received tolvaptan therapy until death, development of ESRD, or liver complications or no tolvaptan therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Median age at ESRD onset, life expectancy, discounted quality-adjusted life-years and lifetime costs (in 2010 U.S. dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Tolvaptan prolonged the median age at ESRD onset by 6.5 years and increased life expectancy by 2.6 years. At $5760 per month, tolvaptan cost $744 100 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with standard care. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: For patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease that progressed more slowly, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was even greater for tolvaptan. LIMITATION: Although TEMPO followed patients for 3 years, the main analysis assumed that clinical benefits persisted over patients'' lifetimes. CONCLUSION: Assuming that the benefits of tolvaptan persist in the longer term, the drug may slow progression to ESRD and reduce mortality rates. However, barring an approximately 95% reduction in price, cost-effectiveness does not compare favorably with many other commonly accepted medical interventions.

11955,The Cost-Utility Analysis of PET-Scan in Diagnosis and Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma in Iran,"BACKGROUND: PET scan is a non-invasive, complex and expensive medical imaging technology that is normally used for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases including lung cancer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of this technology in the diagnosis and treatment of non- small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main electronic databases including The Cochrane Library and Medline were searched to identify available evidence about the performance and effectiveness of technology. A standard decision tree model with seven strategies was used to perform the economic evaluation. Retrieved studies and expert opinion were used to estimate the cost of each treatment strategy in Iran. The costs were divided into three categories including capital costs (depreciation costs of buildings and equipment), staff costs and other expenses (including cost of consumables, running and maintenance costs). The costs were estimated in both IR-Rials and US-Dollars with an exchange rate of 10.000 IR Rials per one US Dollar according to the exchange rate in 2008. RESULTS: The total annual running cost of a PET scan was about 8850 to 13000 million Rials, (0.9 to 1.3 million US$). The average cost of performing a PET scan varied between 3 and 4.5 million Rials (300 to 450US$). The strategies 3 (mediastinoscopy alone) and 7 (mediastinoscopy after PET scan) were more cost-effective than other strategies, especially when the result of the CT-scan performed before PET scan was negative. CONCLUSION: The technical performance of PET scan is significantly higher than similar technologies for staging and treatment of NSCLC. In addition, it might slightly improve the treatment process and lead to a small level of increase in the quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained by these patients making it cost-effective for the treatment of NSCLC.",2013-01-14379,24046780,Iran J Radiol,Ali Akbari Sari,2013,10 / 2,61-7,No,24046780,"Ali Akbari Sari; Hamid Ravaghi; Mohammadreza Mobinizadeh; Sima Sarvari; The Cost-Utility Analysis of PET-Scan in Diagnosis and Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma in Iran, Iran J Radiol, ; 10(2):1735-1065; 61-7",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Not Stated,Positron emission tomography (PET) scan + sending all patients for surgery vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,9355666,Iran,2008,1124.62
11956,Cost-effectiveness of renin-guided treatment of hypertension,"BACKGROUND: A plasma renin activity (PRA)-guided strategy is more effective than standard care in treating hypertension (HTN). However, its clinical implementation has been slow, presumably due in part to economic concerns. We estimated the cost effectiveness of a PRA-guided treatment strategy compared with standard care in a treated but uncontrolled HTN population. METHODS: We estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PRA-guided therapy compared to standard care using a state-transition simulation model with alternate patient characteristic scenarios and sensitivity analyses. Patient-specific inputs for the base case scenario, males average age 63 years, reflected best available data from a recent clinical trial of PRA-guided therapy. Transition probabilities were estimated using Framingham risk equations or derived from the literature; costs and utilities were derived from the literature. RESULTS: In the base case scenario for males, the lifetime discounted costs and QALYs were $23,648 and 12.727 for PRA-guided therapy and $22,077 and 12.618 for standard care, respectively. The base case ICER was $14,497/QALY gained. In alternative scenario analyses varying patient input parameters, the results were sensitive to age, gender, baseline systolic blood pressure, and the addition of cardiovascular risk factors. Univariate sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results were most sensitive to varying the treatment effect of PRA-guided therapy and the cost of the PRA test. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PRA-guided therapy compared with standard care increases QALYs and medical costs in most scenarios.

11957,Telemonitoring after discharge from hospital with heart failure: cost-effectiveness modelling of alternative service designs,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring strategies versus usual care for adults recently discharged after a heart failure (HF) exacerbation. DESIGN: Decision analysis modelling of cost-effectiveness using secondary data sources. SETTING: Acute hospitals in the UK. PATIENTS: Patients recently discharged (within 28 days) after a HF exacerbation. INTERVENTIONS: Structured telephone support (STS) via human to machine (STS HM) interface, (2) STS via human to human (STS HH) contact and (3) home telemonitoring (TM), compared with (4) usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by each strategy compared to the next most effective alternative and the probability of each strategy being cost-effective at varying willingness to pay per QALY gained. RESULTS: TM was the most cost-effective strategy in the scenario using these base case costs.

11963,Complex ventral hernia repair using components separation with or without biologic mesh: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: A complex ventral hernia requiring abdominal wall reconstruction presents a challenging scenario to the surgeon. The use of biologic mesh in addition to performing a components separation (CS) is controversial. Our goal was to perform the first cost-utility analysis on the use of biologic mesh in addition to performing CS when performing complex ventral hernia repair. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify published complication and recurrence rates for ventral hernia repairs requiring CS with or without biologic mesh. The probabilities of the most common complications were combined with Medicare Current Procedural Terminology reimbursement codes, diagnosis related group reimbursement codes, and expert utility estimates to fit into a decision model to evaluate the cost utility of CS with and without biologic mesh in reconstructing ventral hernias. RESULTS: The decision model revealed a baseline cost increase of $775.65 and a 0.0517 increase in the quality-adjusted life-years when using biologic mesh yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio of $15,002.90/quality-adjusted life-year. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that using biologic mesh was cost-effective using Medicare reimbursement rates but not at retail costs. The maximum price of biologic mesh to be cost-effective was $1813.53. CONCLUSIONS: The cost utility of biologic mesh when used with CS in ventral hernia repair is dependent on the financial perspective. It is cost-ineffective for hospitals and physicians paying retail costs but cost-effective for third-party payers providing Medicare reimbursement.",2013-01-14390,24051454,Ann Plast Surg,Abhishek Chatterjee,2015,74 / 4,,No,24051454,"Abhishek Chatterjee; Naveen M Krishnan; Joseph M Rosen; Complex ventral hernia repair using components separation with or without biologic mesh: a cost-utility analysis, Ann Plast Surg, 2015 Apr; 74(4):1536-3708",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Components separation (CS) With Biologic Mesh vs. Components separation (CS) alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,15002,United States,2012,16911.08
11964,"Comparison of an adjustable anchored single-incision mini-sling, Ajust((R)) , with a standard mid-urethral sling, TVT-O(TM) : a health economic evaluation","OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost, quality of life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness of a single-incision mini-sling (SIMS; Ajust((R)) , C. R. Bard Inc., New Providence, NJ, USA) compared with a standard mid-urethral sling (SMUS; TVT-O, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) in the surgical management of female stress urinary incontinence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 137 women, in a secondary care setting, were randomized between October 2009 and October 2011 to undergo SIMS placement (n = 69) under local anaesthesia as an opt-out policy or SMUS placement (n = 68) under general anaesthesia. Clinical outcome measures included the patient-reported success rate (Patient Global Impression of Improvement [PGI-I]) and the impact on the patients'' QoL (King''s Health Questionnaire [KHQ]). Health economic data (cost and quality-adjusted life year [QALY] data) were compared using linear regression models to generate an incremental cost per QALY estimate, in order to determine a measure of cost-effectiveness. Deterministic sensitivity analyses investigated uncertainty in the results, and non-parametric bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate a probability of cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the KHQ total score (P = 0.27) or the patient-reported success rate (P = 1.00, odds ratio: 0.895; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.344 to 2.330). There was no significant difference in QALYs for the SIMS group compared with the SMUS group (mean difference: -0.003; 95% CI: -0.008 to +0.002). The SIMS was on average less costly, - pound142.41 95% CI: (-316.99 to 32.17) and generated cost savings of pound48 419 per QALY loss with 94% probability of cost savings to the health services. Taking a wider perspective on the costing analysis by including the wider community benefit associated with the significantly earlier return to work observed in the SIMS group (P = 0.006, 95% CI: 11.756 to 17.217), there was an increase in cost savings to - pound477, (95% CI: -823.65 to -129.63), with a probability of 100% of cost savings to the wider economy. CONCLUSIONS: The adjustable anchored SIMS (Ajust), performed under local anaesthesia as an opt-out policy, delivers cost savings to the health service provider when compared with the SMUS (TVT-O), and is likely to be cost-effective up to 1 year after placement.

11965,The cost-effectiveness of a family meetings intervention to prevent depression and anxiety in family caregivers of patients with dementia: a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Dementia imposes a heavy burden on health and social care systems as well as on family caregivers who provide a substantial portion of the care. Interventions that effectively support caregivers may prevent or delay patient institutionalization and hence be cost-effective. However, evidence about the cost-effectiveness of such interventions is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a family meetings intervention for family caregivers of dementia patients in comparison with usual care over a period of 12 months. METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective alongside a randomized trial of 192 primary caregivers with community-dwelling dementia patients. Outcome measures included the Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALY) of caregivers and patients and the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders in caregivers. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputations. Bootstrapping was used to estimate uncertainty around the cost-differences and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The bootstrapped cost-effect pairs were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane and used to estimate cost-effectiveness curves. RESULTS: No significant differences in costs and effects between the groups were found. At 12 months, total costs per patient and primary caregiver dyad were substantial: euro77,832 for the intervention group and euro75,201 for the usual care group (adjusted mean difference per dyad euro4,149, 95% CI -13,371 to 21,956, ICER 157,534). The main cost driver was informal care (66% of total costs), followed by patients'' day treatment and costs of hospital and long-term care facility admissions (23%). Based on the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, the maximum probability that the intervention was considered cost-effective in comparison with usual care reached 0.4 for the outcome QALY per patient-caregiver dyad and 0.6 for the caregivers'' incidence of depression and/or anxiety disorders regardless of the willingness to pay. CONCLUSIONS: The annual costs of caring for a person with dementia were substantial with informal care being by far the largest contributor to the total societal costs. Based on this study, family meetings cannot be considered a cost-effective intervention strategy in comparison with usual care.

11966,A structured training programme for caregivers of inpatients after stroke (TRACS): a cluster randomised controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Most patients who have had a stroke are dependent on informal caregivers for activities of daily living. The TRACS trial investigated a training programme for caregivers (the London Stroke Carers Training Course, LSCTC) on physical and psychological outcomes, including cost-effectiveness, for patients and caregivers after a disabling stroke. METHODS: We undertook a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis. Stroke units were eligible if four of five criteria used to define a stroke unit were met, a substantial number of patients on the unit had a diagnosis of stroke, staff were able to deliver the LSCTC, and most patients were discharged to a permanent place of residence. Stroke units were randomly assigned to either LSCTC or usual care (control group), stratified by geographical region and quality of care, and using blocks of size 2. Patients with a diagnosis of stroke, likely to return home with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were eligible. The primary outcome for patients was self-reported extended activities of daily living at 6 months, measured with the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) scale. The primary outcome for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months, measured with the caregivers burden scale (CBS). We combined patient and caregiver costs with primary outcomes and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to assess cost-effectiveness. This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN 49208824. FINDINGS: We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility, of which 36 were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. Between Feb 27, 2008, and Feb 9, 2010, 928 patient and caregiver dyads were registered, of which 450 were in the intervention group, and 478 in the control group. Patients'' self-reported extended activities of daily living did not differ between groups at 6 months (adjusted mean NEADL score 27.4 in the intervention group versus 27.6 in the control group, difference -0.2 points [95% CI -3.0 to 2.5], p value=0.866, ICC=0.027). The caregiver burden scale did not differ between groups either (adjusted mean CBS 45.5 in the intervention group versus 45.0 in the control group, difference 0.5 points [95% CI -1.7 to 2.7], p value=0.660, ICC=0.013). Patient and caregiver costs were similar in both groups (length of the initial stroke admission and associated costs were pound13,127 for the intervention group and pound12,471 for the control group; adjusted mean difference pound1243 [95% CI -1533 to 4019]; p value=0.380). Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on QALYs were low. INTERPRETATION: In a large scale, robust evaluation, results from this study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any of the assessed outcomes. The immediate period after stroke might not be the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training.

11967,Trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis comparing surgical and endoscopic drainage in patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis,"OBJECTIVE: Published evidence indicates that surgical drainage of the pancreatic duct was more effective than endoscopic drainage for patients with chronic pancreatitis. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus endoscopic drainage in obstructive chronic pancreatitis. DESIGN: This trial-based cost-utility analysis (ISRCTN04572410) was conducted from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective and during a 79-month time horizon. During the trial the details of the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and pancreatic insufficiency were collected. The resource use was varied in the sensitivity analysis based on a review of the literature. The health outcome was the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), generated using EQ-5D data collected during the trial. There were no pancreas-related deaths in the trial. All-cause mortality from the trial was incorporated into the QALY estimates in the sensitivity analysis. SETTING: Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, QALYs and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The result of the base-case analysis was that surgical drainage dominated endoscopic drainage, being both more effective and less costly. The sensitivity analysis varied mortality and resource use and showed that the surgical option remained dominant in all scenarios. The probability of cost-effectiveness for surgical drainage was 100% for the base case and 82% in the assessed most conservative case scenario.

11968,Sexually transmitted infections screening at HIV treatment centers for MSM can be cost-effective,OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of anorectal chlamydia screening among men who have sex with men (MSM) in care at HIV treatment centers. DESIGN: Transmission model combined with economic analysis over a 20-year period. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: MSM in care at HIV treatment centers. INTERVENTION: Once-yearly or twice-yearly screening for anorectal chlamydia among MSM in care at HIV treatment centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Averted HIV and chlamydia infections; discounted quality-adjusted life-years and costs; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Costs will be saved by routine chlamydia screening of MSM in care at HIV treatment centers if these patients seek little or no screening elsewhere. Nonroutine screening is considerably more expensive than routine screening offered within a scheduled visit. Adding once-yearly chlamydia screening for MSM in care at HIV treatment centers is cost saving when 30% or fewer of those men seek once-yearly screening elsewhere (1.5 to 8.1 million euro saved).

DESIGN: Transmission model combined with economic analysis over a 20-year period. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: MSM in care at HIV treatment centers. INTERVENTION: Once-yearly or twice-yearly screening for anorectal chlamydia among MSM in care at HIV treatment centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Averted HIV and chlamydia infections; discounted quality-adjusted life-years and costs; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Costs will be saved by routine chlamydia screening of MSM in care at HIV treatment centers if these patients seek little or no screening elsewhere. Nonroutine screening is considerably more expensive than routine screening offered within a scheduled visit. Adding once-yearly chlamydia screening for MSM in care at HIV treatment centers is cost saving when 30% or fewer of those men seek once-yearly screening elsewhere (1.5 to 8.1 million euro saved).

11972,Health economic evaluation of vaccination strategies for the prevention of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a self-limiting painful skin rash affecting mostly individuals from 50 years of age. The main complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a long-lasting pain after rash has resolved. A HZ-vaccine has recently been licensed in Europe for individuals older than 50 years. To support an informed decision-making for a potential vaccination recommendation, we conducted a health economic evaluation to identify the most cost-effective vaccination strategy. METHODS: We developed a static Markov-cohort model, which compared a vaccine-scenario with no vaccination. The cohort entering the model was 50 years of age, vaccinated at age 60, and stayed over life-time in the model. Transition probabilities were based on HZ/PHN-epidemiology and demographic data from Germany, as well as vaccine efficacy (VE) data from clinical trials. Costs for vaccination and HZ/PHN-treatment (in Euros; 2010), as well as outcomes were discounted equally with 3% p.a. We accounted results from both, payer and societal perspective. We calculated benefit-cost-ratio (BCR), number-needed-to-vaccinate (NNV), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for costs per HZ-case avoided, per PHN-case avoided, and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Different target age-groups were compared to identify the most cost-effective vaccination strategy. Base-case-analysis as well as structural, descriptive-, and probabilistic-sensitivity-analyses (DSA, PSA) were performed. RESULTS: When vaccinating 20% of a cohort of 1 million 50 year old individuals at the age of 60 years, approximately 20,000 HZ-cases will be avoided over life-time. The NNV to avoid one HZ (PHN)-case was 10 (144). However, with a BCR of 0.34 this vaccination-strategy did not save costs. The base-case-analysis yielded an ICER of 1,419 (20,809) Euros per avoided HZ (PHN)-case and 28,146 Euros per QALY gained. Vaccination at the age of 60 was identified in most (sensitivity) analyses to be the most cost-effective vaccination strategy. In DSA, vaccine price and VE were shown to be the most critical input-data. CONCLUSIONS: According to our evaluation, HZ-vaccination is expected to avoid HZ/PHN-cases and gain QALYs to higher costs. However, the vaccine price had the highest impact on the ICERs. Among different scenarios, targeting individuals aged 60 years seems to represent the most cost-effective vaccination-strategy.",2013-01-14422,24070414,BMC Health Serv Res,Bernhard Ultsch,2013,13 /,359,Yes,24070414,"Bernhard Ultsch; Felix Weidemann; Thomas Reinhold; Anette Siedler; Gerard Krause; Ole Wichmann; Health economic evaluation of vaccination strategies for the prevention of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in Germany, BMC Health Serv Res, ; 13():1472-6963; 359",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccine against herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,34000,Euro,2010,53406.84

VeriStrat, a serum proteomic test, can be used to guide treatment decisions for NSCLC patients. The test classifies patients as likely to benefit from either of these two treatment options. The objective of this research was to model the anticipated survival and cost-effectiveness of four different treatment strategies: chemotherapy for all patients (C-all), EGFR inhibitor for all (E-all), a performance status guided selection strategy (PS-guided), and a strategy guided by VeriStrat test results (V-guided). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model with the perspective of the U.S. health care system. Model inputs were taken from published literature for the base-case analysis. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The C-all treatment strategy showed the best overall survival outcome (10.1 months), followed by V-guided (9.6 months), PS-guided (9.2 months), and E-all (8.2 months) strategies.

11979,Cost effectiveness of tibial nonunion treatment: A comparison between rhBMP-7 and autologous bone graft in two Italian centres,"Current evidences show that recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 (rhBMP-7, eptotermin alfa) can be considered an effective alternative to autologous bone graft (ABG) in the treatment of tibial nonunions. Few studies, so far, have analysed the costs of treating tibial nonunions with either rhBMP-7 or ABG and none of them has specifically considered the Italian situation. The aim of the present study was to capture, through observational retrospective methods, the direct medical costs associated with the treatment of tibial nonunions with rhBMP-7 or ABG in Italy and to compare the cost effectiveness of the two interventions. The secondary objective was to perform a cost-reimbursement analysis for hospitalisations associated with the two treatments. Data of 54 patients with indication for tibial nonunion were collected from existing data sources. Of these patients, 26 were treated with ABG and 28 with rhBMP-7. The study captured the direct medical costs for treating each tibial nonunion, considering both inpatient and outpatient care. The hospital reimbursement was calculated from discharge registries, based on diagnosis-related group (DRG) values. A subgroup of patients (n=30) was also interviewed to capture perceived health during the follow-up, and the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were subsequently computed. The two groups were similar for what concerns baseline characteristics. While the medical costs incurred during the hospitalisation associated with treatment were on average euro3091.21 higher (P<0.001) in patients treated with rhBMP-7 (reflecting the product procurement costs), the costs incurred during the follow-up were on average euro2344.45 higher (P=0.02) in patients treated with ABG. Considering all costs incurred from the treatment, there was a borderline statistical evidence (P=0.04) for a mean increase of euro795.42, in the rhBMP-7 group. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that, without appropriate reimbursement, the hospital undergoes significant losses (P=0.003) when using rhBMP-7 instead of ABG. In contrast to these losses, in Italy, the average cost to achieve a successful outcome was euro488.96 lower in patients treated with rhBMP-7 and, additionally, the cost per QALY gained was below the cost-utility threshold of $50,000.",2013-01-14431,24074829,Injury,Maria Giorgio Calori,2013,44 / 12,1871-9,No,24074829,"Maria Giorgio Calori; Rodolfo Capanna; Massimiliano Colombo; Pietro De Biase; Carol O'Sullivan; Valentina Cartareggia; Costanza Conti; Cost effectiveness of tibial nonunion treatment: A comparison between rhBMP-7 and autologous bone graft in two Italian centres, Injury, ; 44(12):1879-0267; 1871-9",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 (rhBMP-7, eptotermin alfa) vs. Autologous bone graft (ABG)",Not Stated,64 Years,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-36136.36,Euro,2009,-60750.05

Algorithm A: citalopram was continued until study endpoint (week 26). Algorithm B: patients who remitted during level 1 continued citalopram. Those who did not remit could opt for switching to another antidepressant (venlafaxine; sertraline) (b1) or adding bupropion to citalopram treatment (augmentation; b2). Algorithm B increased remission rate by 10.6% over Algorithm A (number needed to treat: 9.9; sensitivity range: 9.1-12.5). As a comparison, differences between active antidepressants and placebo are associated with NNT values of 6 to 8. In CUA Algorithm B was dominant with an ICER of $11,813 (sensitivity range=$1783 - $21,784), which is <1GDP per capita cost-effectiveness threshold (USA=$47,193). Among Algorithm B options, switching (b1) dominated Algorithm A with a smaller number of responders than augmentation approach (b2) (NNT 11 vs. 7.7), whereas ICER values were similar (b1: $14,738; b2: $15,458).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct an economic analysis of the CHD risk assessment with Cardio inCode(R), which incorporates the patient''s genetic risk into the functions of REGICOR and Framingham, compared with the standard method (using only the functions). METHODS: A Markov model was developed with seven states of health (low CHD risk, moderate CHD risk, high CHD risk, CHD event, recurrent CHD, chronic CHD, and death). The reclassification of CHD risk derived from genetic information and transition probabilities between states was obtained from a validation study conducted in cohorts of REGICOR (Spain) and Framingham (USA). It was assumed that patients classified as at moderate risk by the standard method were the best candidates to test the risk reclassification with Cardio inCode(R). The utilities and costs (euro; year 2011 values) of Markov states were obtained from the literature and Spanish sources. The analysis was performed from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System, for a life expectancy of 82 years in Spain. An annual discount rate of 3.5 % for costs and benefits was applied. RESULTS: For a Cardio inCode(R) price of euro400, the cost per QALY gained compared with the standard method [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)] would be euro12,969 and euro21,385 in REGICOR and Framingham cohorts, respectively.

METHODS: A Markov-type cost-utility simulation model was constructed and used to simulate, for men and women, morbidity and mortality for GH-treated and -untreated individuals over a 20-year period. The calculations were performed using current available prices concerning morbidity-related healthcare costs and costs for Genotropin(R). All costs and treatment effects were discounted at 3%. Costs were expressed in Euro (1euro = 9.03 SEK). GH-treated Swedish patients (n = 434) were identified from the KIMS database (Pfizer International Metabolic Database) and untreated patients (n = 2135) from the Swedish Cancer Registry and the Hospital Discharge Registry. RESULTS: The results are reported as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, including both direct and indirect costs for GH-treated versus untreated patients. The weighted sum of all subgroup incremental cost per QALY was euro15,975 and euro20,241 for men and women, respectively.

11990,Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for curatively resected gastric cancer with S-1,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of specific regimens of adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer has not been verified by large clinical trials. Recently, several large trials attempted to verify the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy. The Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer in Japan, a randomized controlled trial of adjuvant S-1 therapy for resected gastric cancer, demonstrated significant improvement in overall and relapse-free survival, compared to surgery alone. To evaluate value for money of S-1 therapy, cost-effective analysis was carried out. METHODS: The analysis was carried out from a payer''s perspective. As an economic measure, cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was estimated. Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, up to 5-year observation. Beyond this period, it was simulated by the modified Boag model. Utility score is derived from interviews with sampled patients using a time trade-off method. Costs were estimated from trial data during observation, while in the period beyond observation they were estimated using simulation results. To explore uncertainty of the results, qualitative and stochastic sensitivity analyses were done. RESULTS: Adjuvant S-1 therapy gained 1.24 QALYs per patient and increased costs by $3,722 per patient for over lifetime (3% discount rate for both effect and costs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (95% confidence intervals) for over lifetime was estimated to be $3,016 ($1,441, $8,840) per QALY. The sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of these results. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant S-1 therapy for curatively resected gastric cancer is likely cost-effective.

11991,Economic evaluation alongside a single RCT of an integrative psychotherapeutic nursing home programme,"BACKGROUND: There is an 80% prevalence of two or more psychiatric symptoms in psychogeriatric patients. Multiple psychiatric symptoms (MPS) have many negative effects on quality of life of the patient as well as on caregiver burden and competence. Irrespective of the effectiveness of an intervention programme, it is important to take into account its economic aspects. METHODS: The economic evaluation was performed alongside a single open RCT and conducted between 2001 and 2006. The patients who met the selection criteria were asked to participate in the RCT. After the patient or his caregiver signed a written informed consent form, he was then randomly assigned to either IRR or UC.The costs and effects of IRR were compared to those of UC. We assessed the cost-utility of IRR as well as the cost-effectiveness of both conditions. Primary outcome variable: severity of MPS (NPI) of patients; secondary outcome variables: general caregiver burden (CB) and caregiver competence (CCL), quality of life (EQ5D) of the patient, and total medical costs per patient (TiC-P). Cost-utility was evaluated on the basis of differences in total medical costs). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by comparing differences of total medical costs and effects on NPI, CB and CCL (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio: ICER). CEAC-analyses were performed for QALY and NPI-severity. All significant testing was fixed at p<0.05 (two-tailed). The data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT)-principle. A complete cases approach (CC) was used. RESULTS: IRR turned out to be non-significantly, 10.5% more expensive than UC (euro 36 per day). The number of QALYs was 0.01 higher (non-significant) in IRR, resulting in euro 276,290 per QALY. According to the ICER-method, IRR was significantly more cost-effective on NPI-sum-severity of the patient (up to 34%), CB and CCL (up to 50%), with ICERs varying from euro 130 to euro 540 per additional point of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found on QALYs. In IRR patients improved significantly more on severity of MPS, and caregivers on general burden and competence, with incremental costs varying from euro 130 to euro 540 per additional point of improvement. The surplus costs of IRR are considered acceptable, taking into account the high societal costs of suffering from MPS of psychogeriatric patients and the high burden of caregivers. The large discrepancy in economic evaluation between QALYs (based on EQ5D) and ICERs (based on clinically relevant outcomes) demands further research on the validity of EQ5D in psychogeriatric cost-utility studies.

11992,Evaluation of telemedicine for screening of diabetic retinopathy in the Veterans Health Administration,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine for the screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and identify changes within the demographics of a patient population after telemedicine implementation. DESIGN: A retrospective medical chart review (cohort study) was conducted. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 900 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in a medical system with a telemedicine screening program for DR. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of the DR telemedicine program was determined by using a finite-horizon, discrete time, discounted Markov decision process model populated by parameters and testing frequency obtained from patient records. The model estimated the progression of DR and determined average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved and average additional cost incurred by the telemedicine screening program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, blindness, and associated QALYs. RESULTS: The results indicate that telemedicine screening is cost-effective for DR under most conditions. On average, it is cost-effective for patient populations of >3500, patients aged <80 years, and all racial groups. Observable trends were identified in the screening population since the implementation of telemedicine screening: the number of known DR cases has increased, the overall age of patients receiving screenings has decreased, the percentage of nonwhites receiving screenings has increased, the average number of miles traveled by a patient to receive a screening has decreased, and the teleretinal screening participation is increasing. CONCLUSIONS: The current teleretinal screening program is effective in terms of being cost-effective and increasing population reach. Future screening policies should give consideration to the age of patients receiving screenings and the system''s patient pool size because our results indicate it is not cost-effective to screen patients aged older than 80 years or in populations with <3500 patients.",2013-01-14448,24084501,Ophthalmology,Eser Kirkizlar,2013,120 / 12,2604-10,No,24084501,"Eser Kirkizlar; Nicoleta Serban; Jennifer A Sisson; Julie L Swann; Claire S Barnes; Michael D Williams; Evaluation of telemedicine for screening of diabetic retinopathy in the Veterans Health Administration, Ophthalmology, ; 120(12):0161-6420; 2604-10",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Telemedicine for screening of diabetic retinopathy in the Veterans Health Administration vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,79 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,34517,United States,2011,39714.68
11993,Cost-effectiveness of preoperative imaging for appendicitis after indeterminate ultrasonography in the second or third trimester of pregnancy,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after indeterminate ultrasonography in pregnant women with suspected appendicitis. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate appendicitis during pregnancy taking into consideration the health outcomes for both the pregnant women and developing fetuses. Strategies included diagnostic laparoscopy, CT, and MRI. Outcomes included positive appendectomy, negative appendectomy, maternal perioperative complications, preterm delivery, fetal loss, childhood cancer, lifetime costs, discounted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging is the most cost-effective strategy, costing $6,767 per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to CT, well below the generally accepted $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year threshold. In a setting where MRI is unavailable, CT is cost-effective even when considering the increased risk of radiation-associated childhood cancer ($560 per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to diagnostic laparoscopy). Unless the negative appendectomy rate is less than 1%, imaging of any type is more cost-effective than proceeding directly to diagnostic laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on imaging costs and resource availability, both CT and MRI are potentially cost-effective. The risk of radiation-associated childhood cancer from CT has little effect on population-level outcomes or cost-effectiveness but is a concern for individual patients.

11995,Societal and economic impact of anterior cruciate ligament tears,"BACKGROUND: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a common knee injury, particularly among young and active individuals. Little is known, however, about the societal impacts of ACL tears, which could be large given the typical patient age and increased lifetime risk of knee osteoarthritis. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of ACL reconstruction compared with structured rehabilitation only. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of ACL reconstruction compared with structured rehabilitation only was conducted with use of a Markov decision model over two time horizons: the short to intermediate term (six years), on the basis of Level-I evidence derived from the KANON Study and the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) database; and the lifetime, on the basis of a comprehensive literature review. Utilities were assessed with use of the SF-6D. Costs (in 2012 U.S. dollars) were estimated from the societal perspective and included the effects of the ACL tear on work status, earnings, and disability. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: In the short to intermediate term, ACL reconstruction was both less costly (a cost reduction of $4503) and more effective (a QALY gain of 0.18) compared with rehabilitation. In the long term, the mean lifetime cost to society for a typical patient undergoing ACL reconstruction was $38,121 compared with $88,538 for rehabilitation. ACL reconstruction resulted in a mean incremental cost savings of $50,417 while providing an incremental QALY gain of 0.72 compared with rehabilitation. Effectiveness gains were driven by the higher probability of an unstable knee and associated lower utility in the rehabilitation group. Results were most sensitive to the rate of knee instability after initial rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: ACL reconstruction is the preferred cost-effective treatment strategy for ACL tears and yields reduced societal costs relative to rehabilitation once indirect cost factors, such as work status and earnings, are considered. The cost of an ACL tear over the lifetime of a patient is substantial, and resources should be directed to developing innovations for injury prevention and for altering the natural history of an ACL injury.",2013-01-14453,24088967,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Richard C 3rd Mather,2013,95 / 19,1751-9,No,24088967,"Richard C 3rd Mather; Lane Koenig; Mininder S Kocher; Timothy M Dall; Paul Gallo; Daniel J Scott; Bernard R Jr Bach; Kurt P Spindler; MOON Knee Group; Societal and economic impact of anterior cruciate ligament tears, J Bone Joint Surg Am, ; 95(19):0021-9355; 1751-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear reconstruction (short term) vs. rehabilitation,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,"Lifetime, 6 years",3.00,3.00,-25016.67,United States,2012,-28200.16
11996,Cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and generic clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome in Switzerland,"QUESTION UNDER STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and generic clopidogrel as add-on therapy to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), from a Swiss perspective. METHODS: Based on the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, one-year mean healthcare costs per patient treated with ticagrelor or generic clopidogrel were analysed from a payer perspective in 2011. A two-part decision-analytic model estimated treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), life years and the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and generic clopidogrel in patients with ACS up to a lifetime at a discount of 2.5% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Over a patient''s lifetime, treatment with ticagrelor generates an additional 0.1694 QALYs and 0.1999 life years at a cost of CHF 260 compared with generic clopidogrel. This results in an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of CHF 1,536 per QALY and CHF 1,301 per life year gained. Ticagrelor dominated generic clopidogrel over the five-year and one-year periods with treatment generating cost savings of CHF 224 and 372 while gaining 0.0461 and 0.0051 QALYs and moreover 0.0517 and 0.0062 life years, respectively. Univariate sensitivity analyses confirmed the dominant position of ticagrelor in the first five years and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed a high probability of cost-effectiveness over a lifetime. CONCLUSION: During the first five years after ACS, treatment with ticagrelor dominates generic clopidogrel in Switzerland. Over a patient''s lifetime, ticagrelor is highly cost-effective compared with generic clopidogrel, proven by ICERs significantly below commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.",2013-01-14454,24089294,Swiss Med Wkly,David Gasche,2013,143 /,w13851,No,24089294,"David Gasche; Tanja Ulle; Bernhard Meier; Roger-Axel Greiner; Cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and generic clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome in Switzerland, Swiss Med Wkly, ; 143():1424-7860; w13851",QALY,Switzerland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ticagrelor vs. generic clopidogrel,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 1 year, 5 years",2.50,2.50,1536,Switzerland,2011,2001.93
11997,Cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation,"Objective. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation for rhythm control compared to antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have previously failed on an AAD. Methods. An economic model was developed to compare (1) catheter ablation and (2) AAD (amiodarone 200 mg/day). At the end of the initial 12 month phase of the model, patients are classified as being in normal sinus rhythm or with AF, based on data from a meta-analysis. In the 5-year Markov phase of the model, patients are at risk of ischemic stroke each 3-month model cycle. Results. The model estimated that, compared to the AAD strategy, ablation had $8,539 higher costs, 0.033 fewer strokes, and 0.144 more QALYS over the 5-year time horizon. The incremental cost per QALY of ablation compared to AAD was estimated to be $59,194. The probability of ablation being cost-effective for willingness to pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 was estimated to be 0.89 and 0.90, respectively. Conclusion. Based on current evidence, pulmonary vein ablation for treatment of AF is cost-effective if decision makers willingness to pay for a QALY is $59,194 or higher.",2013-01-14455,24089640,Int J Vasc Med,Gord Blackhouse,2013,2013 /,262809,No,24089640,"Gord Blackhouse; Nazila Assasi; Feng Xie; Kathryn Gaebel; Kaitryn Campbell; Jeff S Healey; Daria O'Reilly; Ron Goeree; Cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation, Int J Vasc Med, ; 2013():2090-2824; 262809",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Catheter ablation for rhythm control vs. antiarrhythmic drug,Not Stated,Not Stated,56 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,59194,Canada,2010,68247.96
11998,"A pragmatic randomised controlled trial of ""PhysioDirect"" telephone assessment and advice services for patients with musculoskeletal problems: economic evaluation","OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of PhysioDirect with usual physiotherapy care for patients with musculoskeletal problems. DESIGN: (1) Cost-consequences comparing cost to the National Health Service (NHS), to patients, and the value of lost productivity with a range of outcomes. (2) Cost-utility analysis comparing cost to the NHS with Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). SETTING: Four physiotherapy services in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (18+) referred by their general practitioner or self-referred for physiotherapy. INTERVENTIONS: PhysioDirect involved telephone assessment and advice followed by face-to-face care if needed. Usual care patients were placed on a waiting list for face-to-face care. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Primary clinical outcome: physical component summary from the SF-36v2 at 6 months. Also included in the cost-consequences: Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile; a Global Improvement Score; response to treatment; patient satisfaction; waiting time. Outcome for the cost-utility analysis: QALYs. RESULTS: 2249 patients took part (1506 PhysioDirect; 743 usual care). (1) Cost-consequences: there was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in the cost of physiotherapy, other NHS services, personal costs or value of time off work. Outcomes were also similar. (2) Cost-utility analysis based on complete cases (n=1272). Total NHS costs, including the cost of physiotherapy were higher in the PhysioDirect group by pound19.30 (95% CI - pound37.60 to pound76.19) and there was a QALY gain of 0.007 (95% CI -0.003 to 0.016). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound2889 and the net monetary benefit at lambda= pound20 000 was pound117 (95% CI - pound86 to pound310). CONCLUSIONS: PhysioDirect may be a cost-effective alternative to usual physiotherapy care, though only with careful management of staff time.

11999,Incremental cost effectiveness of pharmacist-managed erythropoiesis-stimulating agent clinics for non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists successfully manage patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the cost effectiveness of these programs is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of pharmacist-managed erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) clinics with that of usual care in patients with non-dialysis-dependent (NDD)-CKD. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of pharmacist-managed ESA clinics compared with usual care in outpatient veterans receiving ESAs for NDD-CKD in 2009. The analysis was conducted from a US Veterans Health Administration perspective with a 5-year time horizon, and the year of valuation for cost results was 2012. The effect of parameter uncertainty was explored in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the deterministic base case analysis, costs and effectiveness per patient over 5 years were US$13,412 and 2.096 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the pharmacist-managed ESA clinics and US$16,173 and 2.093 QALYs in usual care; ESA clinics dominated usual care. In one-way sensitivity analyses, ESA clinics no longer dominated if their patients'' probability of being in the target hemoglobin range fell to 52 % (base case 71 %) or if the mean cost/patient/month of epoetin or darbepoetin in ESA clinics increased to approximately US$382 (base case US$226) or US$477 (base case US$268), respectively. When all parameters were varied simultaneously in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ESA clinics were favored >/=80 % of the time at willingness-to-pay thresholds of US$0-$100,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-managed ESA clinics were less costly and more effective than usual care in patients receiving ESAs for anemia and NDD-CKD.

12000,Long term evaluation of the impact of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: High-dose therapy with autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation represents today the standard approach for younger multiple myeloma patients. This study aimed to evaluate the long term economic impact of autologous transplantation with respect to conventional therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of multiple myeloma patients diagnosed at our department between 1986 and 2003 and treated according to the therapy considered standard at the time of diagnosis. Analysis of costs was done by assessing resource utilization and direct costs were measured and monetized before proceeding with the analysis, based on public health service tariffs. RESULTS: Group A including 78 patients treated with Melphalan and Prednisone was compared with Group B including 74 patients who received an autologous transplant. The median overall survival was 3.2 and 5.4 years respectively (p = 0.0002). Mean cost per patient was significantly higher in group B with respect to group A (102373euro vs 23825euro; p<0.001). The final quality-adjusted-life-year gain in group B patients as compared to group A was 1.73 QALY, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 45460euro. With a threshold of 75000euro per QALY gained, the cost effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that the probability that autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma is a cost-effective intervention is 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of autologous transplantation remains high. The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, however, given the significant prolongation of overall survival obtained with autologous transplantation, is within an acceptable threshold.
