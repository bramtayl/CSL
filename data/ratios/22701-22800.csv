22701,Robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for patients with isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis is cost-effective: a markov decision analysis,"AIMS: The primary aim of the study was to perform an analysis to identify the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (rUKA) relative to manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for patients with isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Secondary aims were to assess how case volume and length of hospital stay influenced the relative cost per QALY. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov decision analysis was performed, using known parameters for costs, outcomes, implant survival, and mortality, to assess the cost-effectiveness of rUKA relative to manual TKA and UKA for patients with isolated medial compartment OA of the knee with a mean age of 65 years. The influence of case volume and shorter hospital stay were assessed. RESULTS: Using a model with an annual case volume of 100 patients, the cost per QALY of rUKA was pound1395 and pound1170 relative to TKA and UKA, respectively. The cost per QALY was influenced by case volume: a low-volume centre performing ten cases per year would achieve a cost per QALY of pound7170 and pound8604 relative to TKA and UKA. For a high-volume centre performing 200 rUKAs per year with a mean two-day length of stay, the cost per QALY would be pound648; if performed as day-cases, the cost would be reduced to pound364 relative to TKA. For a high-volume centre performing 200 rUKAs per year with a shorter length of stay of one day relative to manual UKA, the cost per QALY would be pound574. CONCLUSION: rUKA is a cost-effective alternative to manual TKA and UKA for patients with isolated medial compartment OA of the knee. The cost per QALY of rUKA decreased with reducing length of hospital stay and with increasing case volume, compared with TKA and UKA.

22703,Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest: A Markov decision model,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for in-hospital cardiac arrest treatment. METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model were constructed based on current literature. The model was conditional on age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and sex. Three treatment strategies were considered: ECPR for patients with an Age-Combined Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) below different thresholds (2-4), ECPR for everyone (EALL), and ECPR for no one (NE). Cost-effectiveness was assessed with costs per quality-of-life adjusted life years (QALY). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 2 points costs 8394 (95% CI: 4922-14,911) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 3 costs 8825 (95% CI: 5192-15,777) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 4 costs 9311 (95% CI: 5478-16,690) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating every eligible patient with ECPR costs 10,818 (95% CI: 6357-19,400) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient. For WTP thresholds of 0-9500 euro, NE has the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. For WTP thresholds between 9500 and 12,500, treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 4 has the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. For WTP thresholds of 12,500 or higher, EALL was found to have the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Given that conventional WTP thresholds in Europe and North-America lie between 50,000-100,000 euro or U.S. dollars, ECPR can be considered a cost-effective treatment after in-hospital cardiac arrest from a healthcare perspective.

22707,Integrated Management Approach to Atrial Fibrillation Care: A Cost Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a substantial burden on health care. Combined specialist and nurse-based AF clinics are associated with improved outcomes. However, Canadian data on the cost-effectiveness of this integrated management approach to AF care are lacking. METHODS: We evaluated health care costs and outcomes of 413 patients with newly-diagnosed AF in 3 emergency departments in Nova Scotia between January 1, 2011 and January 31, 2014. Using a before-after study design, patients were divided into usual care (228 patients) and intervention (185 patients) groups. The intervention was a nurse-run, physician-supervised AF clinic. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared between usual care and intervention. Costs were those incurred because of the clinical outcome, bleeding events, medications, and cardiovascular-related procedures. Probabilistic analysis was conducted to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: The AF clinic was associated with an average cost reduction of CAD$210.83 and an average improvement in QALY of 0.0007 per patient. The AF clinic was dominant over usual care despite higher operational and medication costs over 1 year. It provided greater cost-saving in approximately 66% of probabilistic analysis simulations and generated more QALYs in approximately 92% of simulations. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio < $50,000 was found in 68% of simulations.

22709,Transient elastography for screening of liver fibrosis: Cost-effectiveness analysis from six prospective cohorts in Europe and Asia,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease pose an important challenge to current clinical healthcare pathways because of the large number of at-risk patients. Therefore, we aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of transient elastography (TE) as a screening method to detect liver fibrosis in a primary care pathway. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using real-life individual patient data from 6 independent prospective cohorts (5 from Europe and 1 from Asia). A diagnostic algorithm with conditional inference trees was developed to explore the relationships between liver stiffness, socio-demographics, comorbidities, and hepatic fibrosis, the latter assessed by fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) and liver biopsies in a subset of 352 patients. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy against standard of care alongside the numbers needed to screen to diagnose a patient with fibrosis stage >/=F2. RESULTS: The data set encompassed 6,295 participants (mean age 55+/-12years, BMI 27+/-5kg/m(2), liver stiffness 5.6+/-5.0kPa). A 9.1kPa TE cut-off provided the best accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (>/=F2) in general population settings, whereas a threshold of 9.5kPa was optimal for populations at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease. TE with the proposed cut-offs outperformed fibrosis scores in terms of accuracy. Screening with TE was cost-effective with mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from 2,570 euro/QALY (95% CI 2,456-2,683) for a population at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease (age >/=45years) to 6,217 euro/QALY (95% CI 5,832-6,601) in the general population. Overall, there was a 12% chance of TE screening being cost saving across countries and populations. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for liver fibrosis with TE in primary care is a cost-effective intervention for European and Asian populations and may even be cost saving. LAY SUMMARY: The lack of optimized public health screening strategies for the detection of liver fibrosis in adults without known liver disease presents a major healthcare challenge.

22711,Cost-effectiveness analysis of reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer in the UK setting,"BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by constitutional pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, leading to increased risk of colorectal, endometrial and other cancers. The study aimed to identify the incremental costs and consequences of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of reflex testing strategies for identifying Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer taking the NHS perspective and a lifetime horizon. Model input parameters were sourced from various published sources. Consequences were measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000/QALY was used. RESULTS: Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome using MMR immunohistochemistry and MLH1 methylation testing was cost-effective versus no testing, costing pound14 200 per QALY gained. There was uncertainty due to parameter imprecision, with an estimated 42% chance this strategy is not cost-effective compared with no testing.

22717,Real-world cost-effectiveness of pan-genotypic Sofosbuvir-Velpatasvir combination versus genotype dependent directly acting anti-viral drugs for treatment of hepatitis C patients in the universal coverage scheme of Punjab state in India,"BACKGROUND: We undertook this study to assess the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained with the use of pan-genotypic sofosbuvir (SOF) + velpatasvir (VEL) for HCV patients, as compared to the current treatment regimen under the universal free treatment scheme in Punjab state. METHODOLOGY: A Markov model depicting natural history of HCV was developed to simulate the progression of disease. Three scenarios were compared: I (Current Regimen)-use of SOF + daclatasvir (DCV) for non-cirrhotic patients and ledipasvir (LDV) or DCV with SOF +/- ribavirin (RBV) according to the genotype for cirrhotic patients; II-use of SOF + DCV for non-cirrhotic patients and use of SOF+VEL for compensated cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis patients) and III-use of SOF+VEL for both non-cirrhotic and compensated cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis patients). The lifetime costs, life-years and QALYs were assessed for each scenario, using a societal perspective. All the future costs and health outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Finally, the incremental cost per QALY gained was computed for each of scenario II and III, as compared to scenario I and for scenario III as compared to II. In addition, we evaluated the lifetime costs and QALYs among HCV patients for each of scenario I, II and III against the counterfactual of ''no universal free treatment scheme'' scenario which involves patients purchasing care in routine setting of from public and private sector. RESULTS: Each of the scenarios I, II and III dominate over the no universal free treatment scheme scenario, i.e. have greater QALYs and lesser costs. The use of SOF+VEL only for cirrhotic patients (scenario II) increases QALYs by 0.28 (0.03 to 0.71) per person, and decreases the cost by 5,946 ( 1,198 to 14,174) per patient, when compared to scenario I. Compared to scenario I, scenario III leads to an increase in QALYs by 0.44 (0.14 to 1.01) per person, and is cost-neutral. While the mean cost difference between scenario III and I is- 2,676 per patient, it ranges from a cost saving of 14,835 to incurring an extra cost of 3,456 per patient. For scenario III as compared II, QALYs increase by 0.16 (0.03 to 0.36) per person as well as costs by 3,086 per patient which ranges from a cost saving of 1,264 to incurring an extra cost of 6,344. Shift to scenario II and III increases the program budget by 5.5% and 60% respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, the use of SOF+VEL is highly recommended for the treatment of HCV infection. In comparison to the current practice (scenario I), scenario II is a dominant option. Scenario III is cost-effective as compared to scenario II at a threshold of one-time GDP per capita.

22722,Real-world cost-effectiveness of pan-genotypic Sofosbuvir-Velpatasvir combination versus genotype dependent directly acting anti-viral drugs for treatment of hepatitis C patients in the universal coverage scheme of Punjab state in India,"BACKGROUND: We undertook this study to assess the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained with the use of pan-genotypic sofosbuvir (SOF) + velpatasvir (VEL) for HCV patients, as compared to the current treatment regimen under the universal free treatment scheme in Punjab state. METHODOLOGY: A Markov model depicting natural history of HCV was developed to simulate the progression of disease. Three scenarios were compared: I (Current Regimen)-use of SOF + daclatasvir (DCV) for non-cirrhotic patients and ledipasvir (LDV) or DCV with SOF +/- ribavirin (RBV) according to the genotype for cirrhotic patients; II-use of SOF + DCV for non-cirrhotic patients and use of SOF+VEL for compensated cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis patients) and III-use of SOF+VEL for both non-cirrhotic and compensated cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis patients). The lifetime costs, life-years and QALYs were assessed for each scenario, using a societal perspective. All the future costs and health outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Finally, the incremental cost per QALY gained was computed for each of scenario II and III, as compared to scenario I and for scenario III as compared to II. In addition, we evaluated the lifetime costs and QALYs among HCV patients for each of scenario I, II and III against the counterfactual of ''no universal free treatment scheme'' scenario which involves patients purchasing care in routine setting of from public and private sector. RESULTS: Each of the scenarios I, II and III dominate over the no universal free treatment scheme scenario, i.e. have greater QALYs and lesser costs. The use of SOF+VEL only for cirrhotic patients (scenario II) increases QALYs by 0.28 (0.03 to 0.71) per person, and decreases the cost by 5,946 ( 1,198 to 14,174) per patient, when compared to scenario I. Compared to scenario I, scenario III leads to an increase in QALYs by 0.44 (0.14 to 1.01) per person, and is cost-neutral. While the mean cost difference between scenario III and I is- 2,676 per patient, it ranges from a cost saving of 14,835 to incurring an extra cost of 3,456 per patient. For scenario III as compared II, QALYs increase by 0.16 (0.03 to 0.36) per person as well as costs by 3,086 per patient which ranges from a cost saving of 1,264 to incurring an extra cost of 6,344. Shift to scenario II and III increases the program budget by 5.5% and 60% respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, the use of SOF+VEL is highly recommended for the treatment of HCV infection. In comparison to the current practice (scenario I), scenario II is a dominant option. Scenario III is cost-effective as compared to scenario II at a threshold of one-time GDP per capita. If budget is an important constraint, velpatasvir should be given to HCV infected cirrhotic patients.

22723,Stratified medicine in schizophrenia: how accurate would a test of drug response need to be to achieve cost-effective improvements in quality of life?,"OBJECTIVE: Stratified medicine refers to the use of tests that predict treatment response to drive treatment decisions for individual patient. The pharmacoeconomic implications of this approach in schizophrenia are unknown. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical stratified medicine algorithm (SMA) compared with treatment as usual (TAU), for patients with schizophrenia who failed a first-line antipsychotic. METHODS: A decision analytic model with embedded Markov process was constructed, which simulated the health and cost outcomes for patients followed SMA or TAU over a lifetime horizon, from healthcare and social care perspective. In the base-case analysis, sensitivity and specificity of the stratifier were both set as 60%. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of uncertainty around the value of important parameters. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: When both sensitivity and specificity of the stratified test were set at 60%, SMA appeared to be the optimal strategy as it produces more QALYs and incurs lower costs than TAU. This is robust to all scenarios tested. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY, the probability for SMA to be the optimal strategy is 82.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that use of any stratifier with a sensitivity and specificity over 60% is very likely to be cost-effective comparing to TAU, for psychotic patients who failed a first-line antipsychotic. This finding, however, should be interpreted with caution due to lack of evidence for clozapine as a second-line antipsychotic.",2019-01-32065,31463768,Eur J Health Econ,Huajie Jin,2019,20 / 9,1425-1435,Yes,31463768,"Huajie Jin; Deborah Kinnear; Ewelina Rydzewska; Kirsty Dunn; Laura Anne Hughes-McCormack; Craig Melville; Angela Henderson; Sally-Ann Cooper; Stratified medicine in schizophrenia: how accurate would a test of drug response need to be to achieve cost-effective improvements in quality of life?, Eur J Health Econ, 2019 Dec; 20(9):1618-7598; 1425-1435",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Care Delivery,stratified medicine algorithm vs. Standard/Usual Care- Treatment as usual,failed a first-line conventional (i.e. non-clozapine) antipsychotic,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-73630,United Kingdom,2017,-100212.27

However, given the same AR10, patients with higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) experience greater absolute risk reduction from statin therapy. Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of expanding preventive statin treatment eligibility from standard care to patients at borderline risk (AR10, 5.0%-7.4%) for ASCVD and with high levels of LDL-C and to estimate cost-effectiveness of statin treatment across ranges of age, sex, AR10, and LDL-C levels. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study evaluated 100 simulated cohorts, each including 1 million ASCVD-free survey respondents (50% men and 50% women) aged 40 years at baseline.

The CVD Policy Model microsimulation version projected lifetime health and cost outcomes. Probability of first-ever coronary heart disease or stroke event was estimated by analysis of 6 pooled US cohort studies and recalibrated to match contemporary event rates. Other model variables were derived from national surveys, meta-analyses, and published literature. Data were analyzed from May 15, 2018, through June 10, 2019. Exposures: Four statin treatment strategies were compared: (1) treat all patients with AR10 of at least 7.5%, diabetes, or LDL-C of at least 190 mg/dL (standard care); (2) add treatment for borderline risk and LDL-C levels of 160 to 189 mg/dL; (3) add treatment for borderline risk and LDL-C levels of 130 to 159 mg/dL; and (4) add treatment for remainder of patients with AR10 of at least 5.0%.

Within age, AR10, and sex categories, individuals with higher baseline LDL-C levels gained more QALYs from statin therapy. Cost-effectiveness increased with LDL-C level and AR10. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, lifetime statin treatment of patients in a hypothetical cohort with borderline ASCVD risk and LDL-C levels of 160 to 189 mg/dL was found to be cost-saving.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cost-utility, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of both iCBT formats compared to a waiting list control group from the Dutch healthcare perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed with a 5-year time horizon. Costs and health outcomes were measured alongside a randomized controlled clinical trial and included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), overall levels of menopausal symptoms, and perceived impact of HF/NS. Uncertainty was examined using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses, together with a scenario analysis incorporating a different perspective. RESULTS: iCBT was slightly more expensive than the waiting list control, but also more effective, resulting in incremental cost-utility ratios of euro23,331/QALY and euro11,277/QALY for the guided and self-managed formats, respectively. A significant reduction in overall levels of menopausal symptoms or perceived impact of HF/NS resulted in incremental costs between euro1460 and euro1525 for the guided and euro500-euro753 for the self-managed format. The estimated annual budget impact for the Netherlands was euro192,990 for the guided and euro74,592 for the self-managed format.

22735,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster in Canada: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Two vaccines against herpes zoster are currently authorized for use in Canada: the recombinant subunit zoster vaccine and live attenuated zoster vaccine. We compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these 2 vaccines. METHODS: We used a decision analytic static cohort model parametrized with Canadian epidemiologic and economic data. We performed the economic analysis from the health care system perspective, using a lifetime horizon and a 3% discount rate for costs and benefits. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, relative to no vaccination. We ran 30 000 simulations varying all model parameters, including vaccine costs, efficacy and waning. RESULTS: The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) was higher for the live attenuated zoster vaccine than for the recombinant subunit zoster vaccine for all herpes zoster-related events at all ages. For example, in persons exactly 65 years old, for herpes zoster, median NNV was 21 (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 13-31) versus 8 (90% UI 6-18), and for postherpetic neuralgia, NNV was 64 (90% UI 33-93) versus 31 (90% UI 23-73). For the recombinant vaccine, the median cost-effectiveness ratios varied between cost-saving and $25 881 per QALY gained for adults aged 50 years or older. For the live vaccine, the cost-effectiveness ratios varied between cost-saving and $130 587 per QALY gained and were less than $45 000 per QALY gained only for those 65 to 75 years old. Given its higher efficacy, we estimated that the cost for the complete series of the recombinant vaccine could be $150 to $200 more than the cost of the live vaccine and still be considered cost-effective.

We compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these 2 vaccines. METHODS: We used a decision analytic static cohort model parametrized with Canadian epidemiologic and economic data. We performed the economic analysis from the health care system perspective, using a lifetime horizon and a 3% discount rate for costs and benefits. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, relative to no vaccination. We ran 30 000 simulations varying all model parameters, including vaccine costs, efficacy and waning. RESULTS: The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) was higher for the live attenuated zoster vaccine than for the recombinant subunit zoster vaccine for all herpes zoster-related events at all ages. For example, in persons exactly 65 years old, for herpes zoster, median NNV was 21 (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 13-31) versus 8 (90% UI 6-18), and for postherpetic neuralgia, NNV was 64 (90% UI 33-93) versus 31 (90% UI 23-73). For the recombinant vaccine, the median cost-effectiveness ratios varied between cost-saving and $25 881 per QALY gained for adults aged 50 years or older.

22749,Setting ambitious targets for surveillance and treatment rates among patients with hepatitis C related cirrhosis impacts the cost-effectiveness of hepatocellular cancer surveillance and substantially increases life expectancy: A modeling study,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocelluar cancer (HCC) is the leading cause of death among people with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis. Our aim was to determine the optimal surveillance frequency for patients with HCV-related compensated cirrhosis. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic Markov model and validated it against data from the Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated with Liver Disease (VOCAL) study group and published epidemiologic studies. Four strategies of different surveillance intervals were compared: no surveillance and ultrasound surveillance every 12, 6, and 3 months. We estimated lifetime survival, life expectancy, quality adjusted life years (QALY), total costs associated with each strategy, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. We applied a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000. Analysis was conducted for two scenarios: a scenario reflecting current HCV and HCC surveillance compliance rates and treatment use and an aspirational scenario. RESULTS: In the current scenario the preferred strategy was 3-month surveillance with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $7,159/QALY. In the aspirational scenario, 6-month surveillance was preferred with an ICER of $82,807/QALY because treating more people with HCV led to a lower incidence of HCC.

22755,Immediate Reconstruction of Oncologic Spinal Wounds Is Cost-Effective Compared with Conventional Primary Wound Closure,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated a reduced wound complication rate when immediate soft-tissue reconstruction is performed after complex spine instrumentations in high-risk patients; however, the cost-effectiveness of this technique is not known. The authors hypothesized that immediate soft-tissue reconstruction of oncologic spine wounds would be a cost-effective strategy compared with the standard of care (i.e., oncologic spine surgery with conventional primary wound closure). METHODS: The authors used a decision tree model to evaluate the cost-utility, from the perspective of a hospital/insurer, of immediate reconstruction relative to the standard of care after oncologic spine surgery. A systematic review of the literature on oncologic spine surgery and immediate and delayed spinal wound reconstruction was performed to estimate health state probabilities. Overall expected cost and quality-adjusted life-years were assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Immediate soft-tissue reconstruction after oncologic spine surgery had an expected cost of $81,458.90 and an expected average of 24.19 quality-adjusted life-years, whereas primary wound closure (no reconstruction) had an expected cost of $83,434.34 and an expected average of 24.17 quality-adjusted life-years, making immediate reconstruction the dominant, most cost-effective strategy. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis demonstrated that immediate reconstruction was the preferred and most cost-effective option in the majority of simulations. Even when the willingness-to-pay threshold varied from $0 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, immediate reconstruction remained the dominant strategy across all iterations. CONCLUSION: This cost-utility analysis suggests that immediate soft-tissue reconstruction after oncologic spine surgery is more cost-effective than primary closure alone.",2019-01-32105,31441805,Plast Reconstr Surg,Alexander F Mericli,2019,144 / 5,1182-1195,No,31441805,"Alexander F Mericli; Qinglan Ding; Marjorie Funk; Erica S Spatz; Robin Whittemore; Haiqun Lin; Kasia J Lipska; Rachel P Dreyer; John A Spertus; Harlan M Krumholz; Immediate Reconstruction of Oncologic Spinal Wounds Is Cost-Effective Compared with Conventional Primary Wound Closure, Plast Reconstr Surg, 2019 Nov; 144(5):0032-1052; 1182-1195",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Surgical,immediate reconstruction of oncologic spinal wounds vs. Standard/Usual Care- primary wound closure (no reconstruction),Not Stated,52.5 Years,52.5 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-98772,United States,2014,-107982.23
22756,Cost-effectiveness analysis of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma based on the NEOCRTEC5010 trial,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The phase 3 NEOCRTEC5010 trial demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) plus surgery for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) had significantly greater efficacy than surgery alone did, but at the same time, the addition of NCRT places an economic burden on patients. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of NCRT followed by surgery based on the NEOCRTEC5010 trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-state Markov model (disease-free survival, relapse and death) based on data from the NEOCRTEC5010 trial was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NCRT plus surgery versus surgery alone for ESCC. The model evaluates the outcomes from the perspective of Chinese society. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the ICER in terms of 2019 US$ per QALY gained, were calculated. Model robustness was evaluated with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with surgery alone, NCRT plus surgery increased costs by $14933.57, while gaining 3.08 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $4848.56 per QALY. The ICER was far below the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold ($26,157 per QALY). The duration of disease-free survival (DFS) for the group that received NCRT was the crucial factor in determining the ICER.

22757,Cost-Effectiveness of Cryoballoon Ablation Versus Radiofrequency Ablation for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation in China: Results Based on Real-World Data,"BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) presents a significant economic burden to the healthcare system. Catheter ablations is a commonly adopted treatment for paroxysmal AF. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of cryoballoon ablation versus radiofrequency ablation in patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF in a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to study the effects and costs. Cost and probability input data were obtained mainly from a retrospective real-world study conducted in a tertiary hospital. Propensity score matching was used to overcome retrospective bias. Input data gaps were remedied by means of literature review and advice from experts. A simulation was performed for the post-procedure lifetime years. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis of a lifetime time horizon, a patient treated with cryoballoon ablation was associated with 7.85 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and yen132 222 ($19 913) total costs, whereas a radiofrequency ablation treated patient was associated with 7.71 QALYs and yen147 304 ($22 184) total costs. The cryoballoon group had slightly better health outcomes (with a difference of 0.14 QALY) and lower total costs (with a difference of yen15 082) (USD $2 271), and it may be considered as cost-effective or cost-saving strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio - yen110 158 [$16 590] per QALY) for the management of paroxysmal AF. Different scenarios were tested with sensitivity analyses, but still, the outcomes remained cost-effective or cost-saving for cryoballoon ablation. CONCLUSIONS: An economic evaluation based on real-world data suggests that, relative to radiofrequency ablation, cryoballoon ablation may be considered as a more cost-effective or cost-saving long-term strategy for drug-refractory paroxysmal AF in this tertiary hospital in China.

22758,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Peripheral Nerve Field Stimulation as Add-On Therapy to Spinal Cord Stimulation in the Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain in Failed Back Surgery Syndrome Patients,"OBJECTIVE: Presently, there is only limited evidence about the cost-effectiveness of peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS) and no evidence to date on the cost-effectiveness of PNFS as an add-on therapy to spinal cord stimulation (SCS). In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, PNFS as add-on therapy to SCS demonstrated clinical effectiveness in treating chronic low back pain in failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients. We report here the cost-effectiveness of PNFS as additional therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a health-care perspective using the general principles of cost-utility analysis, using empirical data from our multicenter randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of hybrid SCS + PNFS on low back pain in FBSS patients, who were back pain non-responders to initial SCS-therapy, over a time-horizon of three months. Outcome measures were costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost and QALYs were integrated using the net monetary benefit (NMB). Differences in costs, effects, and NMB were analyzed using multilevel regression. Uncertainty surrounding the NMB was presented by cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients implanted with both SCS and PNFS, randomly assigned to a group with PNFS either activated or inactive, completed the controlled part of the study. With mean total costs for the SCS + active PNFS group of euro1813.86 (SD euro109.78) versus euro1103.64 (SD euro123.43) for the SCS + inactive PNFS group at three months, we found an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro25.311 per QALY gained and a probability being cost-effective of more than 80% given a willingness to pay for a QALY of about euro40.000. CONCLUSIONS: From a Dutch national health-care context, when the willingness to pay threshold is up to 60.000 Euros per QALY, PNFS as an add-on therapy to SCS for the treatment of low back pain in FBSS patients has a high probability of being cost-effective.",2019-01-32137,31423686,Neuromodulation,Eric-Jan J A A van Gorp,2019,/,,No,31423686,"Eric-Jan J A A van Gorp; Benjamin P Geisler; Troels H Jorgensen; Hans Gustav H Thyregod; Jan Benjamin Pietzsch; Lars Sondergaard; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Peripheral Nerve Field Stimulation as Add-On Therapy to Spinal Cord Stimulation in the Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain in Failed Back Surgery Syndrome Patients, Neuromodulation, 2019 Aug 18; ():1525-1403",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,peripheral nerve field stimulation + spinal cord stimulation vs. Spinal cord stimulation alone,Failed back surgery syndrome patients,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,25311,Euro,2012,36688.5
22759,Cost-effectiveness of transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients at lower surgical risk: results from the NOTION trial,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients at lower surgical risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Discounted costs from a societal perspective and effectiveness as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were projected to lifetime via a decision-analytic model calibrated to 60-month data from the NOTION trial. The base case assumed a scenario in which any mortality benefit would gradually fade out over time, with other scenarios explored in sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was compared to the country-specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 1.13 million Danish kroner (DKK). The base case ICER was DKK 696,264/QALY (around euro72,100/QALY via purchasing parity adjustment). Variation in long-term mortality beyond five years led to limited variation of incremental costs (DKK 64,200 to 64,600), but a more pronounced variation in incremental QALYs (0.07 to 0.19 QALYs for most conservative and optimistic assumptions, compared to base case of 0.09 QALYs). All resulting ICERs (range DKK 334,200 to DKK 904,100 per QALY gained) were below the WTP threshold. CONCLUSIONS: TAVI in a cohort of primarily low surgical risk patients was found to be a cost-effective treatment strategy in the Danish healthcare system.

22760,Cost-utility analysis of genetic polymorphism universal screening in colorectal cancer prevention by detection of high-risk individuals,"BACKGROUND: In the past 15 years numerous studies have been published on the involvement of low-penetrance susceptibility genes on the risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). AIM: To perform an economic analysis of blood genetic testing in CRC screening in a population-based nationwide setting using polymorphisms in prostaglandin E2 pathway genes as proof of concept. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from a societal perspective in Portugal comparing two strategies: blood genetic testing by the age of 40 versus no genetic screening under different assumptions of the cost of genetic testing (euro10 and euro30) and expected risk (1.5 to 5-fold). The adopted threshold was set at euro44,870 (USD 50,000). The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a base case scenario.

22768,Second-line treatment with lesinurad and allopurinol versus febuxostat for management of hyperuricemia: a cost-effectiveness analysis for Spanish patients,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Lesinurad, in combination with allopurinol, has been approved for treatment of patients with gout which do not reach therapeutic serum urate target with xanthine oxidase inhibitors monotherapy. The study aimed to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding lesinurad to allopurinol as second-line therapy, compared to febuxostat for patients with gout in Spain. METHOD: A Markov model representing disease evolution was used to estimate the lifetime accumulated cost and benefits in terms of quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY). Patients could either continue with second-line treatment with lesinurad (200 mg/daily) plus allopurinol (400 mg/daily) or febuxostat (80 mg/daily) switch to allopurinol monotherapy (271 mg/daily) in case of intolerance or discontinue treatment. The treatment''s efficacy captured in the transition probabilities between health states were derived from CLEAR and EXCEL trials. Quality of life related to gout severity and flare frequency was considered by means of utilities. The total cost estimation (euro, 2019) included drug acquisition cost, disease monitoring, and flare management cost. Unitary local costs derived from databases and literature. A 3% annual discount rate was applied for cost and outcomes. RESULTS: Lesinurad plus allopurinol provided higher QALYs (14.79) than febuxostat (14.69). Total accrued cost/patient was lower with lesinurad and allopurinol (euro50,631.51) versus febuxostat (euro56,698.64). Lesinurad plus allopurinol resulted more effective and less costly (dominant option) versus febuxostat. CONCLUSIONS: Lesinurad plus allopurinol therapy compared with febuxostat seems an effective option for the management of hyperuricemia in patients who did not reach serum urate target to previous allopurinol monotherapy, associated to cost-savings for the Spanish Health System.Key Points* Lesinurad, in combination with allopurinol, has been recently authorized as second-line treatment of hyperuricemia in gout patients.* Lesinurad plus allopurinol provided higher effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted-life-years (14.79) than febuxostat (14.69).* Lesinurad plus allopurinol resulted less costly (total cost/per patient) compared with febuxostat.* Lesinurad plus allopurinol resulted a dominant option compared with febuxostat.",2019-01-32142,31420811,Clin Rheumatol,Maria Presa,2019,38 / 12,3521-3528,No,31420811,"Maria Presa; Lashaunta M Glover; Loretta R Cain-Shields; Sharon B Wyatt; Samson Y Gebreab; Ana V Diez-Roux; Mario Sims; Second-line treatment with lesinurad and allopurinol versus febuxostat for management of hyperuricemia: a cost-effectiveness analysis for Spanish patients, Clin Rheumatol, 2019 Dec; 38(12):0770-3198; 3521-3528",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,lesinurad + allopurinol vs. febuxostat 80 mg once daily,previously treated with allopurinol monotherapy,Not Stated,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-60671.3,Euro,2019,-68798.09

DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Intervention effectiveness was estimated in a randomised controlled trial as numbers of abstinent participants after 1 and 5-8 years of follow-up. The economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective using a Markov model by estimating future disease-related costs (in Euro (euro) 2018) and health effects (in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)). Programmes were explicitly compared in an incremental analysis, and the results were presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. SETTING: The study was conducted in dental clinics in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 294 smokers aged 19-71 years were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Behaviour therapy, coaching and pharmacological advice (HIT) was compared with one counselling session introducing a conventional self-help programme (LIT). RESULTS: The more costly HIT led to higher number of 6-month continuous abstinent participants after 1 year and higher number of sustained abstinent participants after 5-8 years, which translates into larger societal costs avoided and health gains than LIT. The incremental cost/QALY of HIT compared with LIT amounted to euro918 and euro3786 using short-term and long-term effectiveness, respectively, which is considered very cost-effective in Sweden.

22771,Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD using minimal resources: An economic analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of home and centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Prospective economic analyses were undertaken from a health system perspective alongside a randomized controlled equivalence trial in which participants referred to pulmonary rehabilitation undertook a standard 8-week outpatient centre-based or a new home-based programme. Participants underwent clinical assessment prior to programme commencement, immediately following completion and 12 months following programme completion. They provided data for utility (quality-adjusted life years (QALY) determined using SF6D (utility scores for health states) calculated from 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2) and effectiveness (change in distance walked on 6-min walk test (Delta6MWD) following pulmonary rehabilitation ). Individual-level cost data for the 12 months following programme completion was sourced from healthcare administration and government databases. RESULTS: Between-group mean difference point estimates for cost (-$4497 (95% CI: -$12 250 to $3257), utility (0.025 (-0.038 to 0.086) QALY) and effectiveness (14 m (-11 to 39) Delta6MWD) favoured the home-based group. Cost-utility analyses demonstrated 63% of estimates falling in the dominant southeast quadrant and the probability that the new home-based model was cost-effective at a $0 threshold for willingness to pay was 78%. Results were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. Programme completion was associated with significantly lower healthcare costs in the following 12 months. CONCLUSION: Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation provides a cost-effective alternative model for people with COPD who cannot access traditional centre-based programmes.",2019-01-32156,31418515,Respirology,Angela T Burge,2019,/,,No,31418515,"Angela T Burge; Nilay Danis; Huseyin Toz; Nalan Unal; Mumtaz Yilmaz; Ilker Turan; Fulya Gunsar; Zeki Karasu; Galip Ersoz; Mehmet Ozkahya; Ulus Salih Akarca; Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD using minimal resources: An economic analysis, Respirology, 2019 Jun 23; ():1440-1843",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Care Delivery,home-based pulmonary rehabilitation vs. Standard/Usual Care- center-based pulmonary rehabilitation,Not Stated,80 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-187375,Australia,2017,-151710.18
22772,Cost-effectiveness analysis of bilateral cochlear implants for children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears in Singapore,"A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that provides a sense of sound for the user, which can be used unilaterally or bilaterally. Although there is advocacy for the benefits of binaural hearing, the high cost of cochlear implant raises the question of whether its additional benefits over the use of an acoustic hearing aid in the contralateral ear outweigh its costs. This cost-effectiveness analysis aimed to separately assess the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous and sequential bilateral cochlear implantations compared to bimodal hearing (use of unilateral cochlear implant combined with an acoustic hearing aid in the contralateral ear) in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) gained and costs associated with bilateral cochlear implants over the lifetime horizon were estimated based on a four-state Markov model. The analysis results showed that, at the 2017 mean cost, compared to bimodal hearing, patients receiving bilateral cochlear implants experienced more QALYs but incurred higher costs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD$60,607 per QALY gained for simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation, and USD$81,782 per QALY gained for sequential bilateral cochlear implantation. The cost-effectiveness of bilateral cochlear implants is most sensitive to utility gain associated with second cochlear implant, and cost of bilateral cochlear implants. ICERs increased when the utility gain from bilateral cochlear implants decreased; ICERs exceeded USD$120,000 per QALY gained when the utility gain was halved from 0.03 to 0.015 in both simultaneous and sequential bilateral cochlear implantations.

The analysis results showed that, at the 2017 mean cost, compared to bimodal hearing, patients receiving bilateral cochlear implants experienced more QALYs but incurred higher costs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD$60,607 per QALY gained for simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation, and USD$81,782 per QALY gained for sequential bilateral cochlear implantation. The cost-effectiveness of bilateral cochlear implants is most sensitive to utility gain associated with second cochlear implant, and cost of bilateral cochlear implants. ICERs increased when the utility gain from bilateral cochlear implants decreased; ICERs exceeded USD$120,000 per QALY gained when the utility gain was halved from 0.03 to 0.015 in both simultaneous and sequential bilateral cochlear implantations. The choice of incremental utility gain associated with the second cochlear implant is an area of considerable uncertainty.",2019-01-32164,31415595,PLoS One,Li-Jen Cheng,2019,14 / 8,e0220439,No,31415595,"Li-Jen Cheng; Irene Guat Sim Cheah; Cost-effectiveness analysis of bilateral cochlear implants for children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears in Singapore, PLoS One , 2019; 14(8):1932-6203; e0220439",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Surgical",sequential bilateral cochlear implantation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Bimodal hearing,Not Stated,17 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,81782,United States,2017,86349.87

22777,Primary immunodeficiency disease: a cost-utility analysis comparing intravenous vs subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy in Australia,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-based intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment has been the standard treatment mode for patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID). With the newer home-based subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) becoming approved for use in most countries, the question arises as to whether SCIg is a cost-effective treatment mode compared to IVIg in Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort simulation model with six health states: PID without infection, PID with infection treated at home or hospital, bronchiectasis without infection, bronchiectasis with infection treated at home or hospital, bronchiectasis with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and death, from an Australian healthcare system perspective. A 10-year time horizon with weekly cycles was chosen, and the expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of the two treatment options estimated. RESULTS: The cumulative 10-year cost per patient was 297,547 Australian dollars (A$) with IVIg and A$ 251,713 for SCIg. IVIg resulted in 5.55 QALYs and SCIg 5.57 QALYs. Thus, SCIg appears to be a cost-saving option and possibly improves QALY from the Australian healthcare system perspective (i.e., the dominant treatment option). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the SCIg option is preferred in 93.2% of simulations given willingness to pay of A$ 50,000 per QALY gained. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that home-based SCIg is a cost-effective treatment option for patients with PID in Queensland, Australia.",2019-01-32184,31403930,Blood Transfus,Tanja M Windegger,2019,/,1-10,No,31403930,"Tanja M Windegger; Bernadette Li; John A Cairns; Rachel J Johnson; Christopher J E Watson; Paul Roderick; Gabriel C Oniscu; Wendy Metcalfe; J Andrew Bradley; Charles R Tomson; Heather Draper; John L Forsythe; Christopher Dudley; Rommel Ravanan; Primary immunodeficiency disease: a cost-utility analysis comparing intravenous vs subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy in Australia, Blood Transfus, 2019 Aug 5; ():1723-2007; 1-10",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,home-based subcutaneous immunoglobulin vs. Standard/Usual Care- hospital-based intravenous immunoglobulin,Not Stated,71 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,-2291750,Australia,2018,-1765560.46
22778,Equity-efficiency trade-offs associated with alternative approaches to deceased donor kidney allocation: a patient-level simulation,"BACKGROUND: The number of patients waiting to receive a kidney transplant outstrips the supply of donor organs. We sought to quantify trade-offs associated with different approaches to deceased donor kidney allocation in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and access to transplantation. METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was developed to compare five different approaches to kidney allocation, including the 2006 UK National Kidney Allocation Scheme (NKAS) and a QALY-maximisation approach designed to maximise health gains from a limited supply of donor organs. We used various sources of patient-level data to develop multivariable regression models to predict survival, health-state utilities and costs. We simulated the allocation of kidneys from 2200 deceased donors to a waiting list of 5500 patients and produced estimates of total lifetime costs and QALYs for each allocation scheme. RESULTS: Among patients who received a transplant, the QALY-maximisation approach generated 48,045 QALYs and cost pound681 million while the 2006 NKAS generated 44,040 QALYs and cost pound625 million. When also taking into consideration outcomes for patients who were not prioritised to receive a transplant, the 2006 NKAS produced higher total QALYs and costs and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound110,741/QALY compared to the QALY-maximisation approach.

22782,"Competing biomedical HIV prevention strategies: potential cost-effectiveness of HIV vaccines and PrEP in Seattle, WA","INTRODUCTION: Promising HIV vaccine candidates are steadily progressing through the clinical trial pipeline. Once available, HIV vaccines will be an important complement but also potential competitor to other biomedical prevention tools such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Accordingly, the value of HIV vaccines and the policies for rollout may depend on that interplay and tradeoffs with utilization of existing products. In this economic modelling analysis, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of HIV vaccines considering their potential interaction with PrEP and condom use. METHODS: We developed a dynamic model of HIV transmission among the men who have sex with men population (MSM), aged 15-64 years, in Seattle, WA offered PrEP and HIV vaccine over a time horizon of 2025-2045. A healthcare sector perspective with annual discount rate of 3% for costs (2017 USD) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was used. The primary economic endpoint is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) when compared to no HIV vaccine availability. RESULTS: HIV vaccines improved population health and increased healthcare costs. Vaccination campaigns achieving 90% coverage of high-risk men and 60% coverage of other men within five years of introduction are projected to avoid 40% of new HIV infections between 2025 and 2045. This increased total healthcare costs by $30 million, with some PrEP costs shifted to HIV vaccine spending. HIV vaccines are estimated to have an ICER of $42,473/QALY, considered cost-effective using a threshold of $150,000/QALY. Results were most sensitive to HIV vaccine efficacy and future changes in the cost of PrEP drugs. Sensitivity analysis found ranges of 30-70% HIV vaccine efficacy remained cost-effective. Results were also sensitive to reductions in condom use among PrEP and vaccine users. CONCLUSIONS: Access to an HIV vaccine is desirable as it could increase the overall effectiveness of combination HIV prevention efforts and improve population health. Planning for the rollout and scale-up of HIV vaccines should carefully consider the design of policies that guide interactions between vaccine and PrEP utilization and potential competition.",2019-01-32187,31402591,J Int AIDS Soc,Blythe Adamson,2019,22 / 8,e25373,No,31402591,"Blythe Adamson; Michael W Long; Michele Polacsek; Pamela Bruno; Catherine M Giles; Zachary J Ward; Angie L Cradock; Steven L Gortmaker; Competing biomedical HIV prevention strategies: potential cost-effectiveness of HIV vaccines and PrEP in Seattle, WA, J Int AIDS Soc, 2019 Aug; 22(8):1758-2652; e25373",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Immunization,hiv vaccine 50% efficacy offered alongside pre-exposure prophylaxis in 2025 vs. Standard/Usual Care- Pre-exposure prophylaxis,"Men that have sex with men, Seattle",64 Years,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,42473,United States,2017,44845.3

Therefore, we used computer simulation to project the health and economic impact of alternative combination intervention scenarios for people who inject drugs (PWID), focusing on direct anti-viral agents (DAA) and medication-assisted treatment combined with syringe access programs (MAT+). METHODS: We performed an allocative efficiency study using a mathematical model simulating the progression of HCV in PWID and its related consequences. Two previously validated simulations were combined to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intervention strategies that included a range of coverage levels. Analyses were performed from a health sector and societal perspective with a 15-year time horizon and a discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: From a health-sector perspective (excluding criminal justice system-related costs), four potential strategies fell on the cost-efficiency frontier. DAA at 20% coverage had an ICER of $27,251/QALY. Combinations of DAA 20% with MAT+ at 20%, 40%, and 80% coverage had ICERs of $165,985/QALY, $325,860/QALY, and $399,189/QALY, respectively. When analyzed from a societal perspective (including criminal justice system-related costs), DAA 20% with MAT+ 80% was most effective and was cost saving. While DAA 20% with MAT+ 80% was more expensive (e.g., less cost-saving) than MAT+ 80% alone without DAA, it offered favorable value compared to MAT+ 80% alone ($23,932/QALY).

Two previously validated simulations were combined to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intervention strategies that included a range of coverage levels. Analyses were performed from a health sector and societal perspective with a 15-year time horizon and a discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: From a health-sector perspective (excluding criminal justice system-related costs), four potential strategies fell on the cost-efficiency frontier.

While DAA 20% with MAT+ 80% was more expensive (e.g., less cost-saving) than MAT+ 80% alone without DAA, it offered favorable value compared to MAT+ 80% alone ($23,932/QALY).

Therefore, we used computer simulation to project the health and economic impact of alternative combination intervention scenarios for people who inject drugs (PWID), focusing on direct anti-viral agents (DAA) and medication-assisted treatment combined with syringe access programs (MAT+). METHODS: We performed an allocative efficiency study using a mathematical model simulating the progression of HCV in PWID and its related consequences. Two previously validated simulations were combined to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intervention strategies that included a range of coverage levels. Analyses were performed from a health sector and societal perspective with a 15-year time horizon and a discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: From a health-sector perspective (excluding criminal justice system-related costs), four potential strategies fell on the cost-efficiency frontier.
