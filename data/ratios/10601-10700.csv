10601,Cost-effectiveness of alendronate for the treatment of osteopenic postmenopausal women in Japan,"Many postmenopausal women have osteopenia, a condition characterized by loss of bone mineral density (BMD) that is not as severe as in osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of alendronate to prevent fractures in osteopenic postmenopausal women without a history of fracture in Japan. An individual simulation model was developed to predict lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 5 years of preventive alendronate therapy versus no preventive therapy. The risk of hip and vertebral fracture associated with age and BMD was derived from epidemiologic studies in Japan. We ran the model with different combinations of age (65, 70, and 75 years), BMD (70%, 75%, and 80% of young adult mean [YAM]), and additional clinical risk factors. For 70-year-old women with a BMD of 70% of the YAM having one of the following risk factors: a family history of hip fracture, high alcohol intake, or current smoking, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of alendronate was $92,937, $126,251, and $129,067 per QALY, respectively. These results were sensitive to age, BMD, and number of clinical risk factors. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis for the base case showed that in the presence of one, two, and three risk factors, alendronate was cost-effective in 0.2% to 2.6%, 13.1% to 56.1%, and 99.1% of the simulations, respectively, if society is willing to pay $50,000 per QALY. Additional analysis indicated that alendronate can be a good value in osteopenic women if the 10-year probability for a osteoporotic hip or vertebral fracture is more than 26.2%. Our results indicate that whether to treat osteopenia with alendronate should be determined on the basis of age, BMD, and number of clinical risk factors in terms of cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-09777,22991163,J Bone Miner Res,Kensuke Moriwaki,2013,28 / 2,,No,22991163,"Kensuke Moriwaki; Hirotaka Komaba; Shinichi Noto; Shinichiro Yanagisawa; Toru Takiguchi; Hiroki Inoue; Takeshi Toujo; Masafumi Fukagawa; Hideaki E Takahashi; Cost-effectiveness of alendronate for the treatment of osteopenic postmenopausal women in Japan, J Bone Miner Res, 2013 Feb; 28(2):1523-4681",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,5 years of preventive alendronate therapy vs. None,"Postmenopausal women aged 70 years with no history of clinical fracture, alcohol intake (>2 unit per day) and bone mineral density (BMD) of 70% of young adult mean (YAM)",Not Stated,65 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,126251,United States,2012,142317.08

10603,An economic evaluation: Simulation of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of universal prevention strategies against osteoporosis-related fractures,"A patient-level Markov decision model was used to simulate a virtual cohort of 500,000 women 40 years old and over, in relation to osteoporosis-related hip, clinical vertebral, and wrist bone fractures events. Sixteen different screening options of three main scenario groups were compared: (1) the status quo (no specific national prevention program); (2) a universal primary prevention program; and (3) a universal screening and treatment program based on the 10-year absolute risk of fracture. The outcomes measured were total directs costs from the perspective of the public health care system, number of fractures, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results show that an option consisting of a program promoting physical activity and treatment if a fracture occurs is the most cost-effective (CE) (cost/fracture averted) alternative and also the only cost saving one, especially for women 40 to 64 years old. In women who are 65 years and over, bone mineral density (BMD)-based screening and treatment based on the 10-year absolute fracture risk calculated using a Canadian Association of Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada (CAROC) tool is the best next alternative. In terms of cost-utility (CU), results were similar. For women less than 65 years old, a program promoting physical activity emerged as cost-saving but BMD-based screening with pharmacological treatment also emerged as an interesting alternative. In conclusion, a program promoting physical activity is the most CE and CU option for women 40 to 64 years old. BMD screening and pharmacological treatment might be considered a reasonable alternative for women 65 years old and over because at a healthcare capacity of $50,000 Canadian dollars ($CAD) for each additional fracture averted or for one QALY gained its probabilities of cost-effectiveness compared to the program promoting physical activity are 63% and 75%, respectively, which could be considered socially acceptable.

10605,Treating alcoholism reduces financial burden on care-givers and increases quality-adjusted life years,"AIMS: The study assessed the alcoholism-related financial burden borne by informal care-givers and relatives of German alcoholic patients. DESIGN: By using an exploratory approach, care-giver burden was assessed both prior to and 12 months after detoxification and withdrawal. Quality-of-life data for care-givers collected during follow-up were used to calculate the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by alcoholics'' family members while their relatives are undergoing treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight informal care-givers and relatives of alcoholic patients. SETTING: In-patient and out-patient departments of three psychiatric university hospitals in Germany. MEASUREMENTS: Expenditures of families related directly to the addiction disorder of alcoholic patients, quality of life of care-givers, relapses of patients. FINDINGS: Families'' expenditures related directly to their addicted member''s alcoholism decreased from an average of euro676.44 per month (or 20.2% of the total pre-tax family income) at baseline to an average of euro145.40 per month at 12 months after the beginning of treatment. The average time spent caring for the affected family member was reduced from 32.3 hours per month to 8.2 hours per month (P = 0.0109), and quality-of-life total scores increased from 60.6 to 68.0. The total gain in QALYs for family members was 0.108. When weighed against the average cost of the alcoholism treatment, the cost of one QALY for care-giving family members was euro20,398 on average. CONCLUSIONS: Among the families of German alcoholics who receive detoxification, there is a substantial reduction in family expenditures, time spent caring and an increase in quality of life at 1 year. These are important but often neglected additional measures of the burden on family members and also treatment benefits.",2013-01-09799,23005574,Addiction,Hans Joachim Salize,2013,108 / 1,,No,23005574,"Hans Joachim Salize; Christian Jacke; Sven Kief; Michael Franz; Karl Mann; Treating alcoholism reduces financial burden on care-givers and increases quality-adjusted life years, Addiction, ; 108(1):0965-2140",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Detoxification treatment for alcoholism vs. Prior to treatment for alcoholism,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,20398,Euro,2007,34909.24
10606,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of alcohol screening and brief interventions in primary care in England,"AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and resourcing implications of universal alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) programmes in primary care in England. METHODS: This was a health economic model, combining evidence of the effectiveness and health care resource requirements of SBI activities with existing epidemiological modelling of the relationship between alcohol consumption and health harms. RESULTS: Screening patients on registration with a family doctor would steadily capture ~40% of the population over a 10-year programme; screening patients at next primary care consultation would capture 96% of the population over the same period, but with high resourcing needs in the first year. The registration approach, delivered by a practice nurse, provides modest cost savings to the health care system of pound120 m over 30 years. Health gains over the same period amount to 32,000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This SBI programme still appears cost-effective (at pound6900 per QALY gained) compared with no programme, under pessimistic effectiveness assumptions. Switching to a consultation approach, delivered by a doctor, would incur an incremental net cost of pound108 m, with incremental health gains equivalent to 92,000 QALYs, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound1175 per QALY gained compared with current practice.

10621,Mortality and treatment costs have a great impact on the cost-effectiveness of disease modifying treatment in Alzheimer's disease--a simulation study,"BACKGROUND: The societal costs of Alzheimer''s Disease (AD) are enormous and pose a great challenge for the health and social care in any society. It is of vital importance to develop and identify cost effective treatment. The aim of the study was to present a hypothetical economic model of Disease Modifying Treatment (DMT) in AD. METHODS: A 20 year Markov cohort model of DMT was constructed, based on Swedish care conditions. States and progression were defined according to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Epidemiological studies of incidence of dementia, prevalence and costs of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD as well as conversion studies of MCI and demographic statistics were used as inputs in the model. RESULTS: Total costs were 113,797 million SEK for patients treated with DMT vs 88,562 million SEK for untreated patients. The corresponding gained QALYs were 529,945 and 450,307 respectively, giving an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 293,002 SEK/QALY in the base option. Survival in the model was 8.72 years with DMT and 7.77 years for untreated. With an assumed Willingness to pay (WTP) of 600,000 SEK (about 86,200 US$ and 62,000 ) per gained QALY, the model indicated cost effectiveness with DMT. The sensitivity analysis implied no cost savings with DMT, but most options indicated cost effectiveness vs. the chosen WTP. CONCLUSION: The main reasons for the higher costs with DMT were the costs of DMT itself and the prolonged survival with DMT.

10622,The price of emergency contraception in the United States: what is the cost-effectiveness of ulipristal acetate versus single-dose levonorgestrel?,"BACKGROUND: Ulipristal acetate (UPA) is a novel form of emergency contraception (EC) that appears to be more effective than the prevailing method, single-dose levonorgestrel (LNG). This study examines the cost-efficacy of UPA compared with LNG. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of UPA versus LNG in preventing unintended pregnancy when taken within 120 h of unprotected intercourse. Univariate and bivariate sensitivity analyses, as well as Monte Carlo simulation and threshold analyses, were performed. RESULTS: Utilizing UPA instead of LNG would result in 37,589 fewer unintended pregnancies per 4,176,572 estimated US annual EC uses (UPA 54,295 pregnancies; LNG 91,884 pregnancies) and a societal savings of $116.3 million annually. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analyses suggest a 96% probability that UPA is more cost-effective at a willingness to pay $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year.

10623,Health benefits and cost effectiveness of endoscopic and nonendoscopic cytosponge screening for Barrett's esophagus,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed a model to compare the health benefits and cost effectiveness of screening for Barrett''s esophagus by either Cytosponge or by conventional endoscopy vs no screening, and to estimate their abilities to reduce mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling of a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old men in the United Kingdom with histories of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, assuming the prevalence of Barrett''s esophagus to be 8%. Participants were invited to undergo screening by endoscopy or Cytosponge (invitation acceptance rates of 23% and 45%, respectively), and outcomes were compared with those from men who underwent no screening. We estimated the number of incident esophageal adenocarcinoma cases prevented and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the different strategies. Patients found to have high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer received endotherapy. Model inputs included data on disease progression, test accuracy, post-treatment status, and surveillance protocols. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year. Supplementary and sensitivity analyses comprised esophagectomy management of high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer, screening by ultrathin nasal endoscopy, and different assumptions of uptake of screening invitations for either strategy. RESULTS: We estimated that compared with no screening, Cytosponge screening followed by treatment of patients with dysplasia or intramucosal cancer costs an additional $240 (95% credible interval, $196-$320) per screening participant and results in a mean gain of 0.015 (95% credible interval, -0.001 to 0.029) QALYs and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15.7 thousand (K) per QALY. The respective values for endoscopy were $299 ($261-$367), 0.013 (0.003-0.023) QALYs, and $22.2K. Screening by the Cytosponge followed by treatment of patients with dysplasia or intramucosal cancer would reduce the number of cases of incident symptomatic esophageal adenocarcinoma by 19%, compared with 17% for screening by endoscopy, although this greater benefit for Cytosponge depends on more patients accepting screening by Cytosponge compared with screening by endoscopy.

METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling of a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old men in the United Kingdom with histories of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, assuming the prevalence of Barrett''s esophagus to be 8%. Participants were invited to undergo screening by endoscopy or Cytosponge (invitation acceptance rates of 23% and 45%, respectively), and outcomes were compared with those from men who underwent no screening. We estimated the number of incident esophageal adenocarcinoma cases prevented and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the different strategies. Patients found to have high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer received endotherapy. Model inputs included data on disease progression, test accuracy, post-treatment status, and surveillance protocols. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year. Supplementary and sensitivity analyses comprised esophagectomy management of high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer, screening by ultrathin nasal endoscopy, and different assumptions of uptake of screening invitations for either strategy. RESULTS: We estimated that compared with no screening, Cytosponge screening followed by treatment of patients with dysplasia or intramucosal cancer costs an additional $240 (95% credible interval, $196-$320) per screening participant and results in a mean gain of 0.015 (95% credible interval, -0.001 to 0.029) QALYs and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15.7 thousand (K) per QALY. The respective values for endoscopy were $299 ($261-$367), 0.013 (0.003-0.023) QALYs, and $22.2K. Screening by the Cytosponge followed by treatment of patients with dysplasia or intramucosal cancer would reduce the number of cases of incident symptomatic esophageal adenocarcinoma by 19%, compared with 17% for screening by endoscopy, although this greater benefit for Cytosponge depends on more patients accepting screening by Cytosponge compared with screening by endoscopy.

10626,Blood salvage produces higher total blood product costs in single-level lumbar spine surgery,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of cell saver for single-level posterior lumbar decompression and fusion (PLDF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Intraoperative cell salvage is used during surgery to reduce the need for perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion. Although the use of cell saver may be beneficial in certain circumstances, its utility has not been clearly established for the common procedure of an adult single-level PLDF. METHODS: Randomly selected adult patients treated with a single-level PLDF between July 2010 and June 2011 at a single institution were identified. Patients who had a combined anterior and posterior approach were excluded. The final study sample for analysis consisted of 180 patients. Hospital records were reviewed to determine whether: (1) cell saver was available during surgery, (2) recovered autologous blood was infused, and (3) the patient received intra- or postoperative allogeneic transfusions. Estimated blood loss, levels fused, volume(s) transfused, and all related complications were recorded. Costs included the cost of allogeneic blood transfusion, setting up the cell saver recovery system, and infusing autologous blood from cell saver, whereas effectiveness measures were allogeneic blood transfusions averted and quality adjusted life years. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $55,538 per allogeneic transfusion averted, with a decrease in the transfusion rate from 40.0% to 38.7% associated with the cell saver approach. This translated into an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5,555,380 per quality adjusted life years gained, which is well above the threshold for an intervention to be considered cost-effective ($100,000 per quality adjusted life years gained). CONCLUSION: The use of cell saver during a single-level PLDF does not significantly reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion and is not cost-effective. The high cost of cell saver in combination with the low complication rate of allogeneic blood transfusion, suggest that cell saver should not be used for single-level PLDF. Further studies are needed to evaluate the necessity for cell saver among other types of spinal surgery.",2013-01-09917,23044618,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Chelsea E Canan,2013,38 / 8,,No,23044618,"Chelsea E Canan; John A Myers; Roger Kirk Owens; Charles H 3rd Crawford; Mladen Djurasovic; Lauren O Burke; Kelly R Bratcher; Kathryn J McCarthy; Leah Y Carreon; Blood salvage produces higher total blood product costs in single-level lumbar spine surgery, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , ; 38(8):1528-1159",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cell saver available during surgery (intraoperative cell salvage for autologous cell saver transfusion) vs. No cell saver available for surgery,treated with a single-level posterior lumbar decompression and fusion (PLDF),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,5553846,United States,2011,6390161.05
10627,Ipilimumab in 2nd line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) compared with best supportive care (BSC) in pre-treated advanced melanoma patients. METHODS: The analysis was based on a US payer perspective and lifetime time horizon. A three-state Markov model was developed representing clinical outcomes, quality-of-life, and healthcare resource use of patients treated with ipilimumab and BSC. Transitions between states were modeled using overall and progression-free survival data from the MDX010-20 trial. Utility data were from a melanoma-specific study of the health state preferences of the general population. Disease management costs expressed in 2011 US Dollars were based on healthcare resource use observed in a US retrospective medical chart study. Uncertainty was analyzed using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The gain in life years and QALYs from introducing ipilimumab over BSC were 1.88 years (95% CI = 1.62-2.20) and 1.14 (95% CI = 1.01-1.34) QALYs, respectively, over the lifetime time horizon. The estimated incremental cost of treating with ipilimumab vs BSC was $146,716 (95% CI = $130,992-$164,025). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $78,218 per life year gained and $128,656 per QALY gained. Ipilimumab was 95% likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $146,000/QALY. LIMITATIONS: Ipilimumab''s method of action causes a tumor response pattern that differs from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors upon which the model is based, leading to a potential under-estimate of quality-of-life of ipilimumab patients. Survival and QALY gains were related to the time horizon of the analysis. Sensitivity analyses indicated that qualitative conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of ipilimumab were unchanged when the method of quality adjustment and the time horizon were varied. CONCLUSION: The analysis shows that the estimated cost-effectiveness of ipilimumab is within what has been shown to be acceptable to payers for oncology products in the US.",2013-01-09929,23057750,J Med Econ,Victor Barzey,2013,16 / 2,202-12,Yes,23057750,"Victor Barzey; Michael B Atkins; Louis P Garrison; Yumi Asukai; Srividya Kotapati; John R Penrod; Ipilimumab in 2nd line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis, J Med Econ, ; 16(2):1369-6998; 202-12",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ipilimumab (3mg/kg) vs. Standard/Usual care- best supportive care (BSC),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,128656,United States,2011,148029.41
10628,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin versus usual care in daily practice in the treatment of refractory generalised anxiety disorder in Spain,"PURPOSE: To model the cost-effectiveness (CEA) of the use of pregabalin versus usual care (UC) in outpatients with refractory generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) treated in daily practice in mental health settings in Spain. METHODS: This CEA model used data extracted from a 6-month prospective non-interventional trial: the Amplification of Definition of ANxiety (ADAN) study, which was conducted to determine the cost-of-illness in GAD subjects. Refractory subjects were those who reported persistent symptoms of anxiety and showed suboptimal response in the Hamilton-anxiety scale (HAM-A >/= 16) after a standard dose regimen of anxiolytics other than pregabalin, alone or in combination, over 6 months. The pregabalin arm was documented with data extracted from patients who received pregabalin in the study for the first time, added or replacing the existing therapy. In the UC arm, treatment might include one or more of the following: a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, other anti-depressants, a benzodiazepine or an anti-epileptic drug other than pregabalin. The time horizon of the modelling was 6 months in the base-case scenario, and the National Health System perspective was chosen to calculate costs. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, which were derived using the EQ-5D questionnaire, at baseline and end-of-trial visits. Results of the CEA model was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping techniques was also carried out to obtain the cost-effectiveness plane and the corresponding acceptability curve. RESULTS: Data from a total of 429 subjects per arm (mean HAM-A score 25.7) meeting eligible criteria for inclusion in CEA modelling were extracted from the original trial. Compared with UC, pregabalin (average dose 218 mg/day) was associated with significantly higher QALY gain; 0.1209 +/- 0.1030 versus 0.0994 +/- 0.0979 (P = 0.003), but increased healthcare costs as well; <euro>1,272 +/- 1,240 versus <euro>1,070 +/- 1,177 (P < 0.069) and drug costs <euro>525 +/- 252 versus 219 +/- 211 (P < 0.001), resulting in an ICER of <euro>15,804/QALY (95 % CI 6,661; 37,186) for healthcare costs and <euro>15,165/QALY (7,947; 31,754) when drug costs were considered alone. A total of 94 % of re-samples fell below the threshold of <euro>30,000 per QALY.

10629,Potential lifetime cost-effectiveness of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation in patients with resistant hypertension,"AIMS: Recent studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) for the treatment of resistant hypertension. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of this approach separately for men and women of different ages. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov state-transition model accounting for costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness was developed to compare RDN with best medical therapy (BMT) in patients with resistant hypertension. The model ran from age 30 to 100 years or death, with a cycle length of 1 year. The efficacy of RDN was modelled as a reduction in the risk of hypertension-related disease events and death. Analyses were conducted from a payer''s perspective. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. When compared with BMT, RDN gained 0.98 QALYs in men and 0.88 QALYs in women 60 years of age at an additional cost of euro2589 and euro2044, respectively. As the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios increased with patient age, RDN consistently yielded more QALYs at lower costs in lower age groups. Considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro35 000/QALY, there was a 95% probability that RDN would remain cost-effective up to an age of 78 and 76 years in men and women, respectively. Cost-effectiveness was influenced mostly by the magnitude of effect of RDN on systolic blood pressure, the rate of RDN non-responders, and the procedure costs of RDN.

Here we analyze the health related quality of life, direct and indirect costs of surgeries with and without intraoperative electrical stimulation (IES) mapping for resection of GIIG within eloquent areas. METHODS: A cohort of 11 subjects with GIIG within eloquent areas who had IES while awake (group A) was matched by tumor side and location to a cohort of 11 subjects who had general anesthesia without IES (group B). Direct and indirect costs (measured as loss of labor productivity) and utility (measured in quality adjusted life years, QALYs), were compared between groups. RESULTS: Total mean direct costs per patient were $38,662.70 (range $19,950.70 to $61,626.40) in group A, and $32,116.10 (range $22,764.50 to $46,222.50) in group B (p = 0.279). Total mean indirect costs per patient were $10,640.10 (range $3,010.10 to $86,940.70) in group A, and $48,804.70 (range $3,340.10 to $98,400.60) in group B (p = 0.035).

CONCLUSIONS: Asleep-awake-asleep craniotomies with IES are associated with an increase in direct costs.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a CYP2C19*2 genotype-guided strategy of antiplatelet therapy in ACS patients undergoing PCI, compared with two ''no testing'' strategies (empiric clopidogrel or prasugrel). METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare three strategies. The model captured adverse cardiovascular events and antiplatelet-related complications. Costs were expressed in 2010 US dollars and estimated using diagnosis-related group codes and Medicare reimbursement rates. The net wholesale price for prasugrel was estimated as $5.45 per day. A generic estimate for clopidogrel of $1.00 per day was used and genetic testing was assumed to cost $500. RESULTS: Base case analyses demonstrated little difference between treatment strategies. The genetic testing-guided strategy yielded the most QALYs and was the least costly. Over 15 months, total costs were $18 lower with a gain of 0.004 QALY in the genotype-guided strategy compared with empiric clopidogrel, and $899 lower with a gain of 0.0005 QALY compared with empiric prasugrel. The strongest predictor of the preferred strategy was the relative risk of thrombotic events in carriers compared with wild-type individuals treated with clopidogrel. Above a 47% increased risk, a genotype-guided strategy was the dominant strategy. Above a clopidogrel cost of $3.96 per day, genetic testing was no longer dominant but remained cost-effective.

10645,A cost effectiveness study of eribulin versus standard single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy for women with previously treated metastatic breast cancer,"Eribulin was FDA approved in 2012 as a treatment for patients with MBC who have previously received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost effectiveness of eribulin versus the three most commonly utilized drugs (TPC) in the EMBRACE trial: vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and capecitabine (X); and to other branded FDA approved drugs: ixabepilone (I), liposomal-doxorubicin (D), and nab-paclitaxel. We created a decision-analytical and a Markov model using clinical data from the EMBRACE trial. Health utilities were derived from the published literature. Costs for drug acquisition, physician visits, and laboratory tests were obtained from Medicare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule and are represented in 2012 USD. Life-years saved (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. Eribulin added 0.208 LY and 0.119 QALY with an incremental cost over TPC of $25,458, and therefore an ICER of $213,742 per QALY.

10650,Cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women,"Bazedoxifene is a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In addition to the therapeutic value of a new agent, evaluation of the cost-effectiveness compared with relevant alternative treatment(s) is an important consideration to facilitate healthcare decision making. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The cost-effectiveness of treatment for 3 years with bazedoxifene was compared with raloxifene using an updated version of a previously validated Markov microsimulation model. Analyses were conducted from a Belgian healthcare payer perspective and, the base-case population was women (aged 70 years) with bone mineral density T-score </= -2.5. The effects of bazedoxifene and raloxifene on fracture risk were derived from the 3-year results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled study, including postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The cost-effectiveness analysis based on efficacy data from the overall clinical trial indicated that bazedoxifene and raloxifene were equally cost-effective. When the results were examined based on the subgroup analysis of women at higher risk of fractures, bazedoxifene was dominant (lower cost for higher effectiveness) compared with raloxifene in most of the simulations. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results, which were largely independent of starting age of treatment, fracture risk, cost, and disutility. In addition, when the cost of raloxifene was reduced by one-half or when incorporating the raloxifene effects on reducing breast cancer, bazedoxifene remained cost-effective, at a threshold of euro35,000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained, in 85% and 68% of the simulations, respectively. Under the assumption of improved antifracture efficacy of bazedoxifene over raloxifene in women with high risk of fractures, this study suggests that bazedoxifene can be considered cost-effective, and even dominant, when compared with raloxifene in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women.",2013-01-10053,23165656,J Bone Miner Res,Mickael Hiligsmann,2013,28 / 4,,No,23165656,"Mickael Hiligsmann; Wafa Ben Sedrine; Jean-Yves Reginster; Cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women, J Bone Miner Res, 2013 Apr; 28(4):1523-4681",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bazedoxifene vs. Raloxifene,bone mineral density (BMD) T-score <= -2.5,Not Stated,65 Years,Female,Full,3 Years,3.00,1.50,Not Stated,Euro,2010,Not Stated
10651,The cost-effectiveness of expanded HIV screening in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: The current Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines from 2006 recommend a one-time test for low-risk individuals and annual testing for those at high risk. These guidelines may not be aggressive enough, even for those at low risk of infection, due to the earlier initiation of HAART and a movement towards a test-and-treat environment. We evaluated the optimal testing frequencies for various risk groups in comparison to the CDC recommendations. METHODS: We build a deterministic mathematical model optimizing the tradeoff between the societal cost of testing and the benefits over a patient''s lifetime of earlier diagnosis. RESULTS: Under a test-and-treat scenario with immediate initiation of HAART, the optimal testing frequency is every 2.4 years for low-risk (0.01% annual incidence) individuals; every 9 months for moderate risk (0.1% incidence) individuals; and every 3 months for high-risk (1.0% incidence) individuals. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the optimal policy is $ 36 ,342/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for low-risk individuals and $ 45 ,074/QALY for high-risk individuals compared with 20-year and annual testing, respectively.

We evaluated the optimal testing frequencies for various risk groups in comparison to the CDC recommendations. METHODS: We build a deterministic mathematical model optimizing the tradeoff between the societal cost of testing and the benefits over a patient''s lifetime of earlier diagnosis. RESULTS: Under a test-and-treat scenario with immediate initiation of HAART, the optimal testing frequency is every 2.4 years for low-risk (0.01% annual incidence) individuals; every 9 months for moderate risk (0.1% incidence) individuals; and every 3 months for high-risk (1.0% incidence) individuals. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the optimal policy is $ 36 ,342/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for low-risk individuals and $ 45 ,074/QALY for high-risk individuals compared with 20-year and annual testing, respectively.

10665,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of treating chronic hepatitis C virus in people who inject drugs in Australia,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C virus treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in current and former people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: A decision analytic model simulated the lifetime costs and outcomes of four treatment options: early treatment with mild fibrosis, standard treatment with moderate fibrosis, late treatment with compensated cirrhosis, and no treatment. Treatment modalities were simulated across current, former, and never-injector cohorts of 1000 hypothetical patients with chronic hepatitis C virus. The main outcome measures were incremental costs ($AUD) per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each cohort. RESULTS: Treatment of current PWID during mild fibrosis resulted in a discounted average gain of 1.60 QALYs (95% confidence interval 0.93-2.26) for an added cost of $12,723 ($11,153-$14,396) compared with no treatment, yielding an ICER of $7941 per QALY gained ($6347-$12,017). Former PWID gained 1.80 QALYs (1.29-2.33) for $10,441 ($8843-$12,074) for early treatment compared with no treatment, resulting in an ICER of $5808 per QALY gained ($5189-$6849). Never-injectors gained 2.33 QALYs (1.87-2.80) for $9290 ($7642-$10,912) compared with no treatment-an ICER of $3985 per QALY gained ($3896-$4080). Early treatment was more cost-effective than late treatment in all cohorts.

METHODS: A decision analytic model simulated the lifetime costs and outcomes of four treatment options: early treatment with mild fibrosis, standard treatment with moderate fibrosis, late treatment with compensated cirrhosis, and no treatment. Treatment modalities were simulated across current, former, and never-injector cohorts of 1000 hypothetical patients with chronic hepatitis C virus. The main outcome measures were incremental costs ($AUD) per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each cohort. RESULTS: Treatment of current PWID during mild fibrosis resulted in a discounted average gain of 1.60 QALYs (95% confidence interval 0.93-2.26) for an added cost of $12,723 ($11,153-$14,396) compared with no treatment, yielding an ICER of $7941 per QALY gained ($6347-$12,017). Former PWID gained 1.80 QALYs (1.29-2.33) for $10,441 ($8843-$12,074) for early treatment compared with no treatment, resulting in an ICER of $5808 per QALY gained ($5189-$6849).

An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine whether the benefits of DSEK are worth the additional costs. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients at the Singapore National Eye Center, a tertiary eye center in Singapore, with Fuchs'' dystrophy or bullous keratopathy who underwent either PK or DSEK. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent either PK (n = 171) or DSEK (n = 93) from January 2001 through December 2007. Data were collected from inpatient and outpatient notes corresponding to the time immediately before the procedure to up to 3 years after. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvements in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity were used to calculate the increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 3 years after the procedure. This was combined with hospital charges (a proxy for costs) to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing PK with no intervention and DSEK with PK. RESULTS: Three-year charges for DSEK and PK were $7476 and $7236, respectively. The regression-adjusted improvement in visual acuity for PK relative to no intervention was -0.613 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units (P<0.001), and for DSEK relative to PK, it was -0.199 logMAR units (P = 0.045). The regression-adjusted marginal gain in utility for PK relative to no intervention was 0.128 QALYs (P<0.001) and for DSEK relative to PK was 0.046 QALYs (P = 0.031). This resulted in ICERs of $56 409 per QALY for PK relative to no intervention and $5209 per QALY for the more expensive DSEK relative to PK. CONCLUSIONS: If the goal is to maximize societal health gains given fixed resources, DSEK should be the preferred strategy.

10682,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to model the cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis versus medical therapy based on 10-year data from the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST). METHODS: This was a cost-utility analysis based on clinical effectiveness data from the ACST with UK-specific costs and stroke outcomes. A Markov model was used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, or cost per additional quality-of-life year) for a strategy of early endarterectomy versus medical therapy for the average patient and published subgroups. An exploratory analysis considered contemporary event rates. RESULTS: The ICER was pound7584 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for the average patient in the ACST. At thresholds of pound20,000 and pound30,000 there was a 74 and 84 per cent chance respectively of early endarterectomy being cost-effective.

METHODS: This was a cost-utility analysis based on clinical effectiveness data from the ACST with UK-specific costs and stroke outcomes. A Markov model was used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, or cost per additional quality-of-life year) for a strategy of early endarterectomy versus medical therapy for the average patient and published subgroups.

10687,An economic evaluation of intravenous versus oral iron supplementation in people on haemodialysis,"BACKGROUND: Iron supplementation can be administered either intravenously or orally in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and iron deficiency anaemia, but practice varies widely. The aim of this study was to estimate the health care costs and benefits of parenteral iron compared with oral iron in haemodialysis patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). METHODS: Using broad health care funder perspective, a probabilistic Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of parenteral iron therapy versus oral iron for the management of haemodialysis patients with relative iron deficiency. A series of one-way, multi-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model structure and the extent in which the model''s assumptions were sensitive to the uncertainties within the input variables. RESULTS: Compared with oral iron, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for parenteral iron were $74,760 per life year saved and $34,660 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses show that the ICER is most sensitive to the probability of achieving haemoglobin (Hb) targets using supplemental iron with a consequential decrease in the standard ESA doses and the relative increased risk in all-cause mortality associated with low Hb levels (Hb < 9.0 g/dL). If the willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $50,000/QALY, the proportions of simulations that showed parenteral iron was cost-effective compared with oral iron were over 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that there is an overall increased mortality risk associated with very low Hb level (<9.0 g/dL), using parenteral iron to achieve an Hb target between 9.5 and 12 g/L is cost-effective compared with oral iron therapy among haemodialysis patients with relative iron deficiency.",2013-01-10082,23182811,Nephrol Dial Transplant,Germaine Wong,2013,28 / 2,,No,23182811,"Germaine Wong; Kirsten Howard; Elisabeth Hodson; Michelle Irving; Jonathan C Craig; An economic evaluation of intravenous versus oral iron supplementation in people on haemodialysis, Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2013 Feb; 28(2):0931-0509",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Parenteral iron (intravenous) vs. Oral iron therapy,18-25 years,40 Years,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,34660,Australia,2009,33143.52

10691,Health benefits and costs of screening for colorectal cancer in people on dialysis or who have received a kidney transplant,"BACKGROUND: Despite the higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in people with chronic kidney disease, it remains uncertain whether early detection through screening is cost-effective in this setting. We aimed to determine the costs and health benefits of CRC screening in people on dialysis or who have received a kidney transplant. METHODS: Using a government health perspective, three probabilistic Markov models were constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of annual immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) screening against no-screening in a cohort of 1000 patients (age 50-70 years) on dialysis and with kidney transplants. A series of one-way, multi-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model structure and the extent in which the model''s assumptions were sensitive to the uncertainties within the input variables. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of CRC screening compared with no-screening were $138 828 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY; $122 977 per life year saved (LYS)], $121 973 per QALY ($ 85 095 per LYS) and $44 790 per QALY ($25 036 per LYS) for dialysis patients not listed on the transplant waiting list, patients on the transplant waiting list and patients with kidney transplants, respectively. The test specificity of iFOBT, the starting age of screening and cancer prevalence were influential factors that determined the overall cost-effectiveness of screening in this setting.

10694,Five-year cost-utility analysis of acute renal replacement therapy: a societal perspective,"PURPOSE: Assessment of the cost utility (CU) of acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) from a societal perspective during a 5-year follow-up. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional cohort study in a medical-surgical intensive care unit and an acute RRT unit of 410 consecutive patients treated with acute RRT in Helsinki University Hospital in 2000-2002. Five-year survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed and used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in two ways. They were first calculated for the 5-year follow-up period and, second, estimated for the expected lifetime. HRQoL was assessed by the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in 2003. The cost analysis included hospital costs during index hospitalization along with hospital and societal costs for the following 5 years. The CU ratio was determined as total costs divided by gained QALYs. RESULTS: Median survival time for all patients was 0.20 years and the EQ-5D index score was 0.68, 0.18 lower than that of the age- and gender-matched general population. All RRT-treated patients gained 0.10 QALYs/patient and hospital survivors 2.54 QALYs in 5 years. Overall the CU ratio was poor [5 year median 271,116 (29,782-2,177,581) euro/QALY].

10695,Five-year cost-utility analysis of acute renal replacement therapy: a societal perspective,"PURPOSE: Assessment of the cost utility (CU) of acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) from a societal perspective during a 5-year follow-up. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional cohort study in a medical-surgical intensive care unit and an acute RRT unit of 410 consecutive patients treated with acute RRT in Helsinki University Hospital in 2000-2002. Five-year survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed and used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in two ways. They were first calculated for the 5-year follow-up period and, second, estimated for the expected lifetime. HRQoL was assessed by the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in 2003. The cost analysis included hospital costs during index hospitalization along with hospital and societal costs for the following 5 years. The CU ratio was determined as total costs divided by gained QALYs. RESULTS: Median survival time for all patients was 0.20 years and the EQ-5D index score was 0.68, 0.18 lower than that of the age- and gender-matched general population. All RRT-treated patients gained 0.10 QALYs/patient and hospital survivors 2.54 QALYs in 5 years. Overall the CU ratio was poor [5 year median 271,116 (29,782-2,177,581) euro/QALY].

10700,Cost-effectiveness of alternating magnetic resonance imaging and digital mammography screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation carriers,"BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines recommend earlier, more intensive breast cancer screening with both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography for women with breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations. Unspecified details of screening schedules are a challenge for implementing guidelines. METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo computer model was used to simulate screening in asymptomatic women who were BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Three dual-modality strategies were compared with digital mammography (DM) alone: 1) DM and MRI alternating at 6-month intervals beginning at age 25 years (Alt25), 2) annual MRI beginning at age 25 years with alternating DM added at age 30 years (MRI25/Alt30), and 3) DM and MRI alternating at 6-month intervals beginning at age 30 years (Alt30). Primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (in 2010 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness (dollars per QALY gained). Additional outcomes included potential harms of screening, and lifetime costs stratified into component categories (screening and diagnosis, treatment, mortality, and patient time costs). RESULTS: All 3 dual-modality screening strategies increased QALYs and costs. Alt30 screening had the lowest incremental costs per additional QALY gained (BRCA1, $74,200 per QALY; BRCA2, $215,700 per QALY). False-positive test results increased substantially with dual-modality screening and occurred more frequently in BRCA2 carriers. Downstream savings in both breast cancer treatment and mortality costs were outweighed by increases in up-front screening and diagnosis costs. The results were influenced most by estimates of breast cancer risk and MRI costs. CONCLUSIONS: Alternating MRI and DM screening at 6-month intervals beginning at age 30 years was identified as a clinically effective approach to applying current guidelines, and was more cost-effective in BRCA1 gene mutation carriers compared with BRCA2 gene mutation carriers.",2013-01-10085,23184400,Cancer,Jessica E Cott Chubiz,2013,119 / 6,,No,23184400,"Jessica E Cott Chubiz; Janie M Lee; Michael E Gilmore; Chung Y Kong; Kathryn P Lowry; Elkan F Halpern; Pamela M McMahon; Paula D Ryan; G Scott Gazelle; Cost-effectiveness of alternating magnetic resonance imaging and digital mammography screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation carriers, Cancer, 2013 Mar 15; 119(6):0008-543X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Digital mammography beginning at age 30 years (DM30) vs. Clinical surveillance,BRCA1 carriers,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15300,United States,2010,18159.59
