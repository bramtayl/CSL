27101,Screening for refractive error and fitting with spectacles in rural and urban India: cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for refractive error and fitting with glasses in India. METHODS: We populated a decision tree with the costs of screening and spectacles, prevalence of varying levels of presenting and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from two studies, and sensitivity and specificity of screening. We calculated dollars spent per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted separately in urban and rural areas for school-based screening (SBS) and primary eye care (PEC) programs that fit spectacles to individuals presenting for care. We conducted a series of univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. An intervention was inferred to be highly cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was less than the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and moderately cost-effective if the ICER was less than three times this level. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, urban SBS was highly cost-effective; rural SBS was moderately cost-effective for ages 5-15 and highly cost-effective for ages 7-15. Both urban and rural PEC were moderately cost-effective in comparison to SBS. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that SBS is likely the most cost-effective solution for refractive error in India if the 5-15 year old age group is targeted; primary eye care is the best choice if a high value is placed on DALYs and the 7-15 year old age group is targeted. CONCLUSION: Both SBS and PEC Interventions for refractive error can be considered cost-effective in India. Which is the more cost-effective depends on the choice of targeted age group and area of the intervention.",2009-XX-05704,19995203,Ophthalmic Epidemiol,Kevin D Frick,2009,16 / 6,378-87,No,19995203,"Kevin D Frick; Liliana Riva-Clement; Manjunath B Shankar; Screening for refractive error and fitting with spectacles in rural and urban India: cost-effectiveness, Ophthalmic Epidemiol, 2009 Nov-Dec; 16(6):0928-6586; 378-87",DALY,India,Not Stated,Screening,"Primary eye care (PEC) would involve a comprehensive eye examination by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, with appropriate referrals for problems other than refractive error. vs. School based screening (SBS): children were screened by a teacher or a health care provider and referred to a qualified optometrist for refraction and provision of eye glasses",Rural area,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,5050,United States,2007,6303.57
27102,Economic evaluation of a routine rotavirus vaccination programme in Indonesia,"An economic evaluation was undertaken to assess the potential for introducing rotavirus vaccine into Indonesia's National Immunization Program. For a projected birth cohort of 4.2 million children was followed until 5 years of age, a routine rotavirus vaccination programme could potentially avert 488,547 cases of diarrhoea treated in outpatient hospital facilities, 176,375 hospitalizations, and 8148 deaths. Assuming a cost of US$ 14 per vaccine course, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would equal US$ 120.46 per disability adjusted life years averted, making routine vaccination highly cost-effective given Indonesia's Gross National Income per capita of US$ 1560. At a cost per vaccine course of US$ 3.79 (societal perspective) or US$ 2.70 (health-care system perspective), routine rotavirus vaccination could be potentially cost-saving in Indonesia.",2009-XX-05753,19931723,Vaccine,Siswanto Agus Wilopo,2009,27 Suppl 5 /,F67-74,Yes,19931723,"Siswanto Agus Wilopo; Paul Kilgore; Soewarta Kosen; Yati Soenarto; Sri Aminah; Anton Cahyono; Maria Ulfa; Abu Tholib; Economic evaluation of a routine rotavirus vaccination programme in Indonesia, Vaccine, 2009-Nov-20; 27 Suppl 5():1873-2518; F67-74",DALY,Indonesia,Not Stated,Immunization,Routine rotavirus vaccination programme: uses two orally administered rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix® and RotaTeq®) vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,120.46,United States,2007,150.36
27103,The cost effectiveness of home-based provision of antiretroviral therapy in rural Uganda,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) provides dramatic health benefits for HIV-infected individuals in Africa, and widespread implementation of HAART is proceeding rapidly. Little is known about the cost and cost effectiveness of HAART programmes.To determine the incremental cost effectiveness of a home-based HAART programme in rural Uganda.A computer-based, deterministic cost-effectiveness model was used to assess a broad range of economic inputs and health outcomes. From the societal perspective, the cost effectiveness of HAART and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was compared with cotrimoxazole alone, and with the period before either intervention. Data for 24 months were derived from a trial of home-based HAART in 1045 patients in the Tororo District in eastern Uganda. Costs and outcomes were projected out to 15 years. All costs are in year 2004 values. The main outcome measures were HAART programme costs, health benefits accruing to HAART recipients, averted HIV infections in adults and children and the resulting effects on medical care costs. The first-line HAART regimen consisted of standard doses of stavudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or, for patients with active tuberculosis, efavirenz. Second-line therapy consisted of tenofovir, didanosine and lopinavir/ritonavir. For children, first-line HAART consisted of zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine syrup; second-line therapy was stavudine, didanosine and lopinavir/ritonavir.The HAART programme, standardized for 1000 patients, cost an incremental $US1.39 million in its first 2 years. Compared with cotrimoxazole prophylaxis alone, the programme reduced mortality by 87%, and averted 6861 incremental disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Benefits were accrued from reduced mortality in HIV-infected adults (67.5% of all benefits), prevention of death in HIV-negative children (20.7%), averted HIV infections in adults (9.1%) and children (1.0%), and improved health status (1.7%). The net programme cost, including the medical cost implications of these health benefits, was $US4.10 million. The net cost per DALY averted was $US597 compared with cotrimoxazole alone. Many HIV interventions have a cost-effectiveness ratio in the range of $US1-150 per DALY averted.This study suggests that a home-based HAART programme in rural Africa may be more cost effective than most previous estimates for facility-based HAART programmes, but remains less cost effective than many HIV prevention and care interventions, including cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.",2009-99-13526,19905037,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Elliot Marseille,2009,7 / 4,229-43,Yes,19905037,"Elliot Marseille; James G Kahn; Christian Pitter; Rebecca Bunnell; William Epalatai; Emmanuel Jawe; Willy Were; Jonathan Mermin; The cost effectiveness of home-based provision of antiretroviral therapy in rural Uganda, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 7(4):1179-1896; 229-43",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical",Home based highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) added to a package of home based care (HBAC) and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis vs. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,597,United States,2004,817.95
27104,Cost-effectiveness of new-generation oral cholera vaccines: a multisite analysis,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a low-cost cholera vaccine licensed and used in Vietnam, using recently collected data from four developing countries where cholera is endemic. Our analysis incorporated new findings on vaccine herd protective effects. METHODS: Using data from Matlab, Bangladesh, Kolkata, India, North Jakarta, Indonesia, and Beira, Mozambique, we calculated the net public cost per disability-adjusted life year avoided for three immunization strategies: 1) school-based vaccination of children 5 to 14 years of age; 2) school-based vaccination of school children plus use of the schools to vaccinate children aged 1 to 4 years; and 3) community-based vaccination of persons aged 1 year and older. RESULTS: We determined cost-effectiveness when vaccine herd protection was or was not considered, and compared this with commonly accepted cutoffs of gross domestic product (GDP) per person to classify interventions as cost-effective or very-cost effective. Without including herd protective effects, deployment of this vaccine would be cost-effective only in school-based programs in Kolkata and Beira. In contrast, after considering vaccine herd protection, all three programs were judged very cost-effective in Kolkata and Beira. Because these cost-effectiveness calculations include herd protection, the results are dependent on assumed vaccination coverage rates.

Our analysis incorporated new findings on vaccine herd protective effects. METHODS: Using data from Matlab, Bangladesh, Kolkata, India, North Jakarta, Indonesia, and Beira, Mozambique, we calculated the net public cost per disability-adjusted life year avoided for three immunization strategies: 1) school-based vaccination of children 5 to 14 years of age; 2) school-based vaccination of school children plus use of the schools to vaccinate children aged 1 to 4 years; and 3) community-based vaccination of persons aged 1 year and older. RESULTS: We determined cost-effectiveness when vaccine herd protection was or was not considered, and compared this with commonly accepted cutoffs of gross domestic product (GDP) per person to classify interventions as cost-effective or very-cost effective. Without including herd protective effects, deployment of this vaccine would be cost-effective only in school-based programs in Kolkata and Beira. In contrast, after considering vaccine herd protection, all three programs were judged very cost-effective in Kolkata and Beira. Because these cost-effectiveness calculations include herd protection, the results are dependent on assumed vaccination coverage rates.

Our analysis incorporated new findings on vaccine herd protective effects. METHODS: Using data from Matlab, Bangladesh, Kolkata, India, North Jakarta, Indonesia, and Beira, Mozambique, we calculated the net public cost per disability-adjusted life year avoided for three immunization strategies: 1) school-based vaccination of children 5 to 14 years of age; 2) school-based vaccination of school children plus use of the schools to vaccinate children aged 1 to 4 years; and 3) community-based vaccination of persons aged 1 year and older. RESULTS: We determined cost-effectiveness when vaccine herd protection was or was not considered, and compared this with commonly accepted cutoffs of gross domestic product (GDP) per person to classify interventions as cost-effective or very-cost effective. Without including herd protective effects, deployment of this vaccine would be cost-effective only in school-based programs in Kolkata and Beira. In contrast, after considering vaccine herd protection, all three programs were judged very cost-effective in Kolkata and Beira. Because these cost-effectiveness calculations include herd protection, the results are dependent on assumed vaccination coverage rates. CONCLUSIONS: Ignoring the indirect effects of cholera vaccination has led to underestimation of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination programs with oral cholera vaccines. Once these effects are included, use of the oral killed whole cell vaccine in programs to control endemic cholera meets the per capita GDP criterion in several developing country settings.",2009-XX-05376,19824189,Value Health,Marc Jeuland,2009,12 / 6,899-908,Yes,19824189,"Marc Jeuland; Joseph Cook; Christine Poulos; John Clemens; Dale Whittington; Cost-effectiveness of new-generation oral cholera vaccines: a multisite analysis, Value Health, 2009-Sep; 12(6):1098-3015; 899-908",DALY,Mozambique,Not Stated,Immunization,Oral cholera WC vaccination without herd protection effects vs. None,"Beira, Mozambique; community-based vaccination programs for all age groups held in clinics or other outposts",40 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,1353,United States,2007,1688.86
27128,Cost-benefit analysis of a rotavirus immunization program in the Arab Republic of Egypt,"BACKGROUND: The availability of rotavirus vaccines makes the implementation of a national immunization program an important decision requiring economic considerations. METHODS: A cost-benefit analysis of a national rotavirus immunization program in Egypt, from the perspective of the Ministry of Health and Population, and a cost-effectiveness analysis, from a societal perspective, were conducted. RESULTS: For a birth cohort of 1.9 million children, a vaccination program was estimated to prevent 1,140,496 episodes of diarrhea, 438,395 outpatient visits, and 47,508 hospitalizations and to save 2873 lives, resulting in direct Ministry of Health and Population medical savings of $2,481,792 (14,369,578 Egyptian pounds [LE]). On the basis of a $9.18 (53 LE) single-dose cost, rotavirus vaccine introduction would cost the Ministry of Health and Population $34,203,445.87 (198,037,951.56 LE) in health expenditures. This equates to an incremental cost of $30.22 (174.95 LE) per infection prevented. Vaccination would prevent the loss of 94,993 disability-adjusted life-years, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $363 per disability-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of rotavirus vaccine to the national immunization program was not found to be cost saving based strictly from the Ministry of Health and Population perspective; however, the potential benefits of long-term health and economic gains from reduced mortality and morbidity, decreased direct costs of care for families, and indirect societal costs should be considered in such decisions.",2009-XX-05891,19817621,J Infect Dis,Omayra Ortega,2009,200 Suppl 1 /,S92-8,No,19817621,"Omayra Ortega; Cost-benefit analysis of a rotavirus immunization program in the Arab Republic of Egypt, J Infect Dis, 2009-Nov-01; 200 Suppl 1():0022-1899; S92-8",DALY,Egypt,Not Stated,Immunization,National Immunization Program: 2 does of rotavirus vaccine during the first 6 months of life vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,363,United States,2005,481.05
27129,Rotavirus disease burden and impact and cost-effectiveness of a rotavirus vaccination program in kenya,"BACKGROUND: The projected impact and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination are important for supporting rotavirus vaccine introduction in Africa, where limited health intervention funds are available. METHODS: Hospital records, health utilization surveys, verbal autopsy data, and surveillance data on diarrheal disease were used to determine rotavirus-specific rates of hospitalization, clinic visits, and deaths due to diarrhea among children <5 years of age in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Rates were extrapolated nationally with use of province-specific data on diarrheal illness. Direct medical costs were estimated using record review and World Health Organization estimates. Household costs were collected through parental interviews. The impact of vaccination on health burden and on the cost-effectiveness per disability-adjusted life-year and lives saved were calculated. RESULTS: Annually in Kenya, rotavirus infection causes 19% of hospitalizations and 16% of clinic visits for diarrhea among children <5 years of age and causes 4471 deaths, 8781 hospitalizations, and 1,443,883 clinic visits. Nationally, rotavirus disease costs the health care system $10.8 million annually. Routine vaccination with a 2-dose rotavirus vaccination series would avert 2467 deaths (55%), 5724 hospitalizations (65%), and 852,589 clinic visits (59%) and would save 58 disability-adjusted life-years per 1000 children annually. At $3 per series, a program would cost $2.1 million in medical costs annually; the break-even price is $2.07 per series.

27137,Economic costs of rotavirus gastroenteritis and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in developing countries,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children worldwide. We evaluated the economic burden of rotavirus and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination from the health care perspective. METHODS: Estimates were based on existing epidemiological data, cost estimates, vaccine coverage, and efficacy data, as well as hypothetical vaccine prices. Outcome measures included health care and societal costs of rotavirus and benefits and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of estimate uncertainty. RESULTS: Treatment costs increased with income level, and health burden decreased; however, burden varied across regions. On the basis of current vaccination coverage and timing, rotavirus vaccination would annually prevent 228,000 deaths, 13.7 million hospital visits, and 8.7 million disability-adjusted life-years, saving $188 million in treatment costs and $243 million in societal costs. At $5 per dose, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income countries was $88, $291, and $329 per disability-adjusted life-year averted, respectively, and $3,015, $9,951 and $11,296 per life saved, respectively.

27162,Economic costs of rotavirus gastroenteritis and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in developing countries,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children worldwide. We evaluated the economic burden of rotavirus and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination from the health care perspective. METHODS: Estimates were based on existing epidemiological data, cost estimates, vaccine coverage, and efficacy data, as well as hypothetical vaccine prices. Outcome measures included health care and societal costs of rotavirus and benefits and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of estimate uncertainty. RESULTS: Treatment costs increased with income level, and health burden decreased; however, burden varied across regions. On the basis of current vaccination coverage and timing, rotavirus vaccination would annually prevent 228,000 deaths, 13.7 million hospital visits, and 8.7 million disability-adjusted life-years, saving $188 million in treatment costs and $243 million in societal costs. At $5 per dose, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income countries was $88, $291, and $329 per disability-adjusted life-year averted, respectively, and $3,015, $9,951 and $11,296 per life saved, respectively.

27164,Cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in peru,"BACKGROUND: There are plans to introduce the oral rotavirus vaccine Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline), 1 of 2 recently developed vaccines against rotavirus, in Peru. METHODS: We modeled the cost-effectiveness of adding a rotavirus vaccine to the Peruvian immunization program under 3 scenarios for the timing of vaccination: (1) strictly according to schedule, at 2 and 4 months of age (on time); (2) distributed around the target ages in the same way as the actual timings in the program (flexible); and (3) flexible but assuming vaccination is not initiated for infants >12 weeks of age (restricted). We assumed an introductory price of US $7.50 per dose, and varied the annual rate of price decrease in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The discounted cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted for restricted, flexible, and on-time schedules was $621, $615, and $581, respectively. For each of the 3 scenarios, the percentage reduction in deaths due to rotavirus infection was 53%, 66%, and 69%, respectively. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted for alternative ""what-if"" scenarios ranged from $229 (assuming a 1-dose schedule, administered on time) to $1491 (assuming a 2-dose schedule, with half the baseline vaccine efficacy rates and a restricted timing policy). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of current World Health Organization guidelines, rotavirus vaccination represents a highly cost-effective intervention in Peru.

27186,Economic evaluation of skin cancer prevention in Australia,"OBJECTIVES: Australia has the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world, despite prevention campaigns being implemented since the early 1980s. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of a skin cancer prevention program (named SunSmart) since it was introduced, together with its potential cost-effectiveness as an upgraded and ongoing national program. METHODS: The reduction in melanoma incidence attributable to SunSmart was modelled as the primary end-point. Historical expenditures on SunSmart were obtained from representative Australian states in three latitude zones. Melanoma incidence rates from these states were used to model key health outcomes. Non-melanoma skin cancer was modelled separately based on national survey results. RESULTS: We estimate that SunSmart has averted 28,000 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), equivalent to 22,000 life-years saved, in the state of Victoria since its introduction in 1988, as well as saving money from cost offset in skin cancer management (dominant). An upgraded national program for the next 20 years is estimated to avert 120,000 DALYs, with associated reductions in the use of health care resources. It remains a dominant intervention in which every dollar invested in SunSmart will return an estimated AU$2.30.

27187,Cost-effectiveness of active transport for primary school children - Walking School Bus program,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: To assess from a societal perspective the incremental cost-effectiveness of the Walking School Bus (WSB) program for Australian primary school children as an obesity prevention measure. The intervention was modelled as part of the ACE-Obesity study, which evaluated, using consistent methods, thirteen interventions targeting unhealthy weight gain in Australian children and adolescents. METHODS: A logic pathway was used to model the effects on body mass index [BMI] and disability-adjusted life years [DALYs] of the Victorian WSB program if applied throughout Australia. Cost offsets and DALY benefits were modelled until the eligible cohort reached 100 years of age or death. The reference year was 2001. Second stage filter criteria ('equity', 'strength of evidence', 'acceptability', feasibility', sustainability' and 'side-effects') were assessed to incorporate additional factors that impact on resource allocation decisions. RESULTS: The modelled intervention reached 7,840 children aged 5 to 7 years and cost $AUD22.8M ($16.6M; $30.9M). This resulted in an incremental saving of 30 DALYs (7:104) and a net cost per DALY saved of $AUD0.76M ($0.23M; $3.32M). The evidence base was judged as 'weak' as there are no data available documenting the increase in the number of children walking due to the intervention. The high costs of the current approach may limit sustainability. CONCLUSION: Under current modelling assumptions, the WSB program is not an effective or cost-effective measure to reduce childhood obesity. The attribution of some costs to non-obesity objectives (reduced traffic congestion and air pollution etc.) is justified to emphasise the other possible benefits. The program's cost-effectiveness would be improved by more comprehensive implementation within current infrastructure arrangements.

Potential cost-savings for the public health sector of interventions aimed at animal-host reservoirs should be assessed. Available deterministic models of rabies transmission between dogs were extended to include dog-to-human rabies transmission. Model parameters were fitted to routine weekly rabid-dog and exposed-human cases reported in N'Djaména, the capital of Chad.

27193,Economic impact of a rotavirus vaccination program in Mexico,"To evaluate the cost and benefits of a national rotavirus childhood vaccination program in Mexico.A decision-analysis model was designed to take the Mexican health care system's perspective on a comparison of two alternatives: to vaccinate against rotavirus or not. Using published, national data, estimations were calculated for the rotavirus illnesses, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) that would be averted and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (US$/DALY) of a hypothetical annual birth cohort of 2 285 000 children, with certain assumptions made for cost, coverage, and efficacy rates.With 93% coverage and a vaccine price of US$ 16 per course (2 doses), a rotavirus vaccination program in Mexico would prevent an estimated 651 deaths (or 0.28 deaths per 1 000 children); 13 833 hospitalizations (6.05 hospitalizations per 1 000 children); and 414 927 outpatient visits (182 outpatient visits per 1 000 children) for rotavirus-related acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Vaccination is likely to reduce the economic burden of rotavirus AGE in Mexico by averting US$ 14 million (71% of the overall health care burden). At a vaccine price of US$ 16 per course, the cost-effectiveness ratio would be US$ 1 139 per DALY averted. A reduction in the price of the rotavirus vaccination program (US$ 8 per course) would yield a lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 303 per DALY averted.A national rotavirus vaccination program in Mexico is projected to reduce childhood incidence and mortality and to be highly cost-effective based on the World Health Organization's thresholds for cost-effective interventions.",2009-99-13456,19695142,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Dagna Constenla,2009,25 / 6,481-90,No,19695142,"Dagna Constenla; F Ra?l Vel?zquez; Richard D Rheingans; Lynn Antil; Yolanda Cervantes; Economic impact of a rotavirus vaccination program in Mexico, Rev Panam Salud Publica, ; 25(6):1020-4989; 481-90",DALY,Mexico,Not Stated,Immunization,Rotavirus vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,1139,United States,2007,1421.74
27194,The cost-effectiveness of removing television advertising of high-fat and/or high-sugar food and beverages to Australian children,"OBJECTIVE: To model the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of banning television (TV) advertisements in Australia for energy-dense, nutrient-poor food and beverages during children's peak viewing times. METHODS: Benefits were modelled as changes in body mass index (BMI) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved. Intervention costs (AUD$) were compared with future health-care cost offsets from reduced prevalence of obesity-related health conditions. Changes in BMI were assumed to be maintained through to adulthood. The comparator was current practice, the reference year was 2001, and the discount rate for costs and benefits was 3%. The impact of the withdrawal of non-core food and beverage advertisements on children's actual food consumption was drawn from the best available evidence (a randomized controlled trial of advertisement exposure and food consumption). Supporting evidence was found in ecological relationships between TV advertising and childhood obesity, and from the effects of marketing bans on other products. A Working Group of stakeholders provided input into decisions surrounding the modelling assumptions and second-stage filters of 'strength of evidence', 'equity', 'acceptability to stakeholders', 'feasibility of implementation', 'sustainability' and 'side-effects'. RESULTS: The intervention had a gross incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD$ 3.70 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) $2.40, $7.70) per DALY. Total DALYs saved were 37 000 (95% UI 16,000, 59,000). When the present value of potential savings in future health-care costs was considered (AUD$ 300m (95% UI $130m, $480m), the intervention was 'dominant', because it resulted in both a health gain and a cost offset compared with current practice. CONCLUSIONS: Although recognizing the limitations of the available evidence, restricting TV food advertising to children would be one of the most cost-effective population-based interventions available to governments today. Despite its economic credentials from a public health perspective, the initiative is strongly opposed by food and advertising industries and is under review by the current Australian government.",2009-99-05554,19652656,Int J Obes (Lond),A Magnus,2009,33 / 10,1094-102,No,19652656,"A Magnus; M M Haby; R Carter; B Swinburn; The cost-effectiveness of removing television advertising of high-fat and/or high-sugar food and beverages to Australian children, Int J Obes (Lond), 2009-Oct; 33(10):0307-0565; 1094-102",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Legislation / Regulation,"Banning television advertisements for energy-dense, nutrient-poor food and beverages during children's peak viewing times vs. Standard/Usual Care- Advertisements limited to 5 min every 30 min for 5 hours per week of designated children's timeslots; prohibit advertisements for 2.5 hours/week of designated preschool children's timeslots; some limitations on content",Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Australia,2001,Not Stated

There are many options for intervention, from individually tailored advice, such as counselling from a general practitioner, to population-wide approaches, such as mass media campaigns, but the most cost-effective mix of interventions is unknown. In this study we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity.From evidence of intervention efficacy in the physical activity literature and evaluation of the health sector costs of intervention and disease treatment, we model the cost impacts and health outcomes of six physical activity interventions, over the lifetime of the Australian population. We then determine cost-effectiveness of each intervention against current practice for physical activity intervention in Australia and derive the optimal pathway for implementation. Based on current evidence of intervention effectiveness, the intervention programs that encourage use of pedometers (Dominant) and mass media-based community campaigns (Dominant) are the most cost-effective strategies to implement and are very likely to be cost-saving. The internet-based intervention program (AUS$3,000/DALY), the GP physical activity prescription program (AUS$12,000/DALY), and the program to encourage more active transport (AUS$20,000/DALY), although less likely to be cost-saving, have a high probability of being under a AUS$50,000 per DALY threshold.

27199,Cost-effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity: a modelling study,"Physical inactivity is a key risk factor for chronic disease, but a growing number of people are not achieving the recommended levels of physical activity necessary for good health. Australians are no exception; despite Australia's image as a sporting nation, with success at the elite level, the majority of Australians do not get enough physical activity. There are many options for intervention, from individually tailored advice, such as counselling from a general practitioner, to population-wide approaches, such as mass media campaigns, but the most cost-effective mix of interventions is unknown. In this study we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity.From evidence of intervention efficacy in the physical activity literature and evaluation of the health sector costs of intervention and disease treatment, we model the cost impacts and health outcomes of six physical activity interventions, over the lifetime of the Australian population. We then determine cost-effectiveness of each intervention against current practice for physical activity intervention in Australia and derive the optimal pathway for implementation. Based on current evidence of intervention effectiveness, the intervention programs that encourage use of pedometers (Dominant) and mass media-based community campaigns (Dominant) are the most cost-effective strategies to implement and are very likely to be cost-saving. The internet-based intervention program (AUS$3,000/DALY), the GP physical activity prescription program (AUS$12,000/DALY), and the program to encourage more active transport (AUS$20,000/DALY), although less likely to be cost-saving, have a high probability of being under a AUS$50,000 per DALY threshold. GP referral to an exercise physiologist (AUS$79,000/DALY) is the least cost-effective option if high time and travel costs for patients in screening and consulting an exercise physiologist are considered.Intervention to promote physical activity is recommended as a public health measure. Despite substantial variability in the quantity and quality of evidence on intervention effectiveness, and uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of behavioural changes, it is highly likely that as a package, all six interventions could lead to substantial improvement in population health at a cost saving to the health sector.
