32801,Cost-Effectiveness of Mechanical Thrombectomy for Treatment of Nonminor Ischemic Stroke Across Europe,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been recommended for the treatment of nonminor ischemic stroke by national and international guidelines, but cost-effectiveness evidence has been generated for only a few countries using heterogeneous evaluation methods. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT across 32 European countries. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT compared with standard care over a 5-year time horizon. Patients with ischemic stroke eligible for MT were identified from 2017 country-specific incidence data. A societal perspective was adopted, including health, social, and informal care costs, and productivity losses. Model outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings. RESULTS: We identified 267 514 ischemic stroke cases that were eligible for MT treatment across 32 European countries. MT was found to be more effective and cheaper than standard care in two-thirds of the countries (21/32) and cost-effective in all but one country (Bulgaria). Across Europe, the intervention was estimated to produce over 101 327 additional quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval, 65 180-149 085) and cost savings of $981 million (€868 million, 95% uncertainty interval, -1544 to 2564) and of $1.7 billion (€1.5 billion, 95% uncertainty interval, -1.2 to 3.6) in health and social care and societal costs, respectively.

Advanced WBRT techniques may provide similar tumor control and better normal tissue sparing, but it is controversial whether the medical benefits of an advanced technology are significant enough to justify its higher cost. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of six advanced WBRT techniques compared with SOC. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate health states for one cohort of women (65-year-old) with early-stage breast cancer over 15 years after WBRT. The cost effectiveness analyses of field-in-field (FIF), hybrid intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), full IMRT, standard volumetric modulated arc therapy (STD-VMAT), multiple arc VMAT (MA-VMAT), non-coplanar VMAT (NC-VMAT) compared with SOC were performed with both tumor control and radiogenic side effects considered. Transition probabilities and utilities for each health state were obtained from literature. Costs incurred by payers were adopted from literature and Medicare data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties on the final results. RESULTS: FIF has the lowest ICER value of 1,511 $/QALY.

32837,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Atezolizumab Plus Nab-Paclitaxel for Advanced PD-L1 Positive Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in Japan,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atezolizumab is an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that shows good safety and efficacy for patients with PD-L1-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The cost of atezolizumab therapy is expensive, and its economic burden is an important problem. In this study, we evaluated the cost effectiveness of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel therapy (AnP) compared with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (nP) for PD-L1-positive TNBC under Japanese medical conditions and environments using a Markov model. METHODS: The medical information was collected from data published by the IMpassion130 trial. A Markov model was established to simulate the number of patients in each disease state after AnP or nP therapy during each time period. As indices for cost effectiveness, total cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to assess the uncertainty of the model using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with difference parameters. RESULTS: The QALYs for AnP treatment were longer than for nP treatment (1.12 vs 0.82 QALYs), but the total cost of AnP treatment was more expensive than that of nP treatment (¥11,070,143 vs ¥2,056,164). The ICER values comparing AnP treatment with nP treatment were ¥30,208,143/QALY. The ICER/QALY was more expensive than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of ¥15,000,000 per QALY. To achieve a 50% cost-effective probability with a WTP threshold, the price of the atezolizumab should be reduced by 55.1%.

32838,Economic Evaluation of Andexanet Versus Prothrombin Complex Concentrate for Reversal of Factor Xa-Associated Intracranial Hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Andexanet was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for reversal of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding associated with factor Xa anticoagulation; however, the cost-effectiveness of Andexanet compared with standard of care (ie, prothrombin complex concentrate, PCC) in patients with factor Xa-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH) is unknown. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov cohort decision analytic model with a lifetime horizon was completed to determine the costs and benefits of Andexanet compared with PCC for reversal of factor Xa-associated ICrH. The population of interest was patients living in Canada on chronic factor Xa inhibitors for prevention of ischemic stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or the prevention/treatment of venous thromboembolism, presenting with an ICrH. Outcomes of interest were life expectancy (measured in years), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), costs (reported in 2020 Canadian dollars), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: An overall reduction in fatal ICrH and increase in thromboembolic events was associated with Andexanet compared with PCC. Andexanet had the highest discounted life expectancy of 2.53 years and a discounted QALY of 1.55. PCC had a discounted life expectancy of 2.09 years and a discounted QALY of 1.28. The average discounted lifetime costs were $237 177 Canadian dollars for Andexanet and $177 871 Canadian dollars for PCC. The strategy of Andexanet had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $219 652 per QALY gained compared with the comparator of PCC. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that Andexanet (at its current cost) was cost-effective in 19% of simulations using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY and 33% of simulations at $150 000/QALY. A 1-way sensitivity analysis found that for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to be <$150 000/QALY gained, Andexanet high or standard dosing would require a price reduction to <$24 000 Canadian (at current baseline efficacy). CONCLUSIONS: Based on available evidence, Andexanet represents low value for reversal of factor Xa-associated ICrH; however, there is substantial uncertainty reflecting the currently available data.

32839,Cost-Utility Analysis of a Dolutegravir-Based Versus Low-Dose Efavirenz-Based Regimen for the Initial Treatment of HIV-Infected Patients in Cameroon (NAMSAL ANRS 12313 Trial),"OBJECTIVES: Evidence comparing the economic and patient values of the World Health Organization''s preferred (dolutegravir 50 mg [DTG]-based) and alternative (low-dose [400 mg] efavirenz [EFV400]-based) first-line antiretroviral regimens is limited. We compared patient-reported outcomes (PROs), costs, and the cost-utility of DTG- versus EFV400-based regimens in treatment-naive HIV-1 adults in the randomised NAMSAL ANRS 12313 trial in Yaoundé, Cameroon. METHODS: We used clinical data, PROs, and health resource use data collected in the trial''s first 96 weeks (2016-2019). Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were computed using utility scores obtained from the 12-item Short Form (SF-12) generic health scale. Other PROs included perceived symptoms, depression, anxiety, and stress. In the 96-week base-case analysis, we estimated the unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted (1) mean costs (in US$, 2016 values) and QALYs/patient, (2) incremental costs and QALYs/patient, and (3) net health benefit (NHB). Outcomes were extrapolated over 5 and 10 years. Uncertainty was assessed using the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and scenario and cost-effective price threshold analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the NHB (95% confidence interval) for the DTG-based regimen relative to the EFV400-based regimen was 0.056 (-?0.037 to 0.153), corresponding to an 88% probability of DTG being cost-effective. A 10% decrease in this regimen''s price (from $5.2 to $4.7/month) would increase its cost-effectiveness probability to 95%. When extrapolating outcomes over 5 and 10 years, the DTG-based regimen had a 100% probability of being cost-effective for a large range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: At 2020 antiretroviral drug prices, a DTG-based first-line regimen should be preferred over an EFV400-based regimen in sub-Saharan Africa.

32840,Long-term cost-effectiveness of a disease management program for patients with atrial fibrillation compared to standard care - a multi-state survival model based on a randomized controlled trial,"AIM: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of an atrial fibrillation disease management program (i.e. the SAFETY program) from the Australian healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A multistate Markov model was developed based on patient-level data from the SAFETY randomized controlled trial. Predicted long-term survival, dependent on hospital admission history, was estimated by extrapolating parametric survival models. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and life years (LY) were the primary and secondary outcome measures used to estimate the incremental cost-utility/effectiveness ratio (ICUR/ICER). Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were undertaken. RESULTS: The SAFETY program was associated with both higher costs ($94,953 vs. $78,433) and benefits [QALY (3.99 vs 3.60); LY (5.86 vs 5.24)], with an ICUR of $42,513/QALY or ICER of $26,356/LY, compared to standard care. Due to the extended survival, the SAFETY was associated with a greater number of hospitalizations (14.85 vs 11.65) and higher costs for medications ($25,084 vs $22,402) and outpatient care ($12,904 vs $11,524). The cost per hospitalization for an average length of stay, analytical time horizon, and cost of medication are key determinants of ICUR. The PSA showed that the intervention has a 70.4% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The SAFETY program has a high probability of being cost-effective for patients with atrial fibrillation.

32841,Cost-effectiveness of pediatric norovirus vaccination in daycare settings,"OBJECTIVE: Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States and outbreaks frequently occur in daycare settings. Results of norovirus vaccine trials have been promising, however there are open questions as to whether vaccination of daycare children would be cost-effective. We investigated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical norovirus vaccination for children in daycare settings compared to no vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis using a disease transmission model of children attending daycare. Vaccination with a 90% coverage rate in addition to the observed standard of care (exclusion of symptomatic children from daycare) was compared to the observed standard of care. The main outcomes measures were infections and deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective, including medical costs to children as well as productivity losses of parents, over a two-year time horizon. Data sources included outbreak surveillance data and published literature. RESULTS: A 50% efficacious norovirus vaccine averts 571.83 norovirus cases and 0.003 norovirus-related deaths per 10,000 children compared to the observed standard of care. A $200 norovirus vaccine that is 50% efficacious has a net cost increase of $178.10 per child and 0.025 more QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $7,028/QALY. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we estimated that a $200 vaccination with 50% efficacy was 94.0% likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY threshold and 95.3% likely at a $150,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSION: Due to the large disease burden associated with norovirus, it is likely that vaccinating children in daycares could be cost-effective, even with modest vaccine efficacy and a high per-child cost of vaccination. Norovirus vaccination of children in daycare has a cost-effectiveness ratio similar to other commonly recommended childhood vaccines.",2021-01-34408,33741192,Vaccine,Lauren N Steimle,2021,/,,Yes,33741192,"Lauren N Steimle; Joshua Havumaki; Marisa C Eisenberg; Joseph N S Eisenberg; Lisa A Prosser; Jamison Pike; Ismael R Ortega-Sanchez; Claire P Mattison; Aron J Hall; Molly K Steele; Benjamin A Lopman; David W Hutton; Brett Doble; Eric Andrew Finkelstein; Yubing Tian; Nakul Saxena; Shiva Patil; Tien Yin Wong; Chui Ming Gemmy Cheung; Cost-effectiveness of pediatric norovirus vaccination in daycare settings, Vaccine, 2021 Mar 16; ():1873-2518",QALY,United States of America,Intestinal infectious diseases,Immunization,50% efficacy norovirus vaccination vs. no norovirus vaccination,Not Stated,60 Months,18 Months,"Male, Female",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,7028,United States,2019,7448.95
32842,The cost-effectiveness of TheraSphere in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are eligible for transarterial embolization,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TheraSphere against other embolic treatments in a population with early to intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are unresectable at presentation and are eligible for transarterial embolization (TAE), conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) or drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective, a 20-year time horizon, and four-week cycles. The eight health states included ''watch and wait'', ''transplantation'' (pre-, post and post (No HCC)), ''resection'', ''no HCC other'', ''pharmacological management'' and ''death''. Clinical data were sourced from literature and expert opinion. Resource use and costs were reflective of the NHS, and benefits were quantified using Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), with utility weights sourced from literature. Comparators were TAE, cTACE and DEB-TACE. The primary output was the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) expressed as cost per QALY gained. An ICER of under £20,000/QALY gained for an intervention is cost-effective and represents efficient use of healthcare resources. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: TheraSphere patients were predicted to gain 0.7 additional QALYs compared to all other treatments. The base case ICERs for TheraSphere were £17,300, £17,279 and £23,020 per QALY gained compared to TAE, cTACE and DEB-TACE, respectively.

32851,Cost-Effectiveness of 5-Aminosalicylate Therapy in Combination With Biologics or Tofacitinib in the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis,"INTRODUCTION: Medications are major cost drivers in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Recent analyses suggest that there is no added efficacy in continuing nor harm in stopping 5-aminosalicylate (ASA) therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease escalated to biological therapies or tofacitinib. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of discontinuing 5-ASA therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis on biological therapies or tofacitinib, compared with continuing 5-ASA therapy. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-ASA with biologic therapy and tofacitinib compared with the same treatment without 5-ASA. Our primary outcome was to determine whether biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy was cost-effective compared with biologic/tofacitinib and 5-ASA combination therapy using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at a willingness to pay of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year. Owing to the uncertainty surrounding outcome probabilities, probabilistic sensitivity analyses with 10,000 simulations were also performed. We conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing biologic/tofacitinib and 5-ASA therapy compared with biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy, whereby vedolizumab was the first biologic used, followed by infliximab and finally tofacitinib. RESULTS: Our model shows that biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy dominates (cheaper and more effective) combination therapy of biologics/tofacitinib with 5-ASA. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses simulations resulted in biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy dominating 100% of the scenarios, with mean cost savings of $24,483.01 over 2 years. When vedolizumab was the first-line therapy in the sensitivity analysis, biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy continued to dominate the combination of 5-ASA and biologic/tofacitinib therapy. DISCUSSION: This analysis in patients with ulcerative colitis who require treatment with biologics or tofacitinib demonstrates that continuing 5-ASA therapy is not a cost-effective strategy. Discontinuation of 5-ASA therapy in these patients is safe and less expensive and should be recommended.",2021-01-34413,32947317,Am J Gastroenterol,Seth R Shaffer,2021,116 / 1,125-133,No,32947317,"Seth R Shaffer; Elbert Huang; Shivani Patel; David T Rubin; Cost-Effectiveness of 5-Aminosalicylate Therapy in Combination With Biologics or Tofacitinib in the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis, Am J Gastroenterol, 2021 Jan 1; 116(1):0002-9270; 125-133",QALY,United States of America,Noninfective enteritis and colitis,Pharmaceutical,mesalamine vs. mesalamine,"previously treated with 5-ASA, now being escalated to infliximab, 70kg weight",75 Years,75 Years,Male,Full,2 Years,3.50,3.50,-1222010,United States,2019,-1295204.32
32852,Cost-Effectiveness of Erenumab for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine in Patients with Prior Treatment Failures in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common neurological disease that disproportionately affects females and has a peak incidence during productive years, resulting in significant burden. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the cost effectiveness of erenumab for the preventive treatment of migraine. METHODS: A hybrid decision-tree plus Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of erenumab as a migraine treatment compared with best supportive care only for patients experiencing at least 4 monthly migraine days for whom at least two prior preventive treatments had failed. Clinical efficacy data were based on results from four randomized controlled trials of erenumab against placebo. The primary outcomes were costs, migraine days, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as the cost per QALY gained. The cost per migraine day avoided was also estimated, as were disaggregated direct and indirect costs. The analysis was conducted from Swedish societal and healthcare system perspectives based on total migraine, chronic migraine and episodic migraine populations, using a discount rate of 3% applied to both costs and health benefits and using year 2019 values. RESULTS: In the base-case deterministic analyses, erenumab treatment resulted in ICERs of Swedish krona (SEK) 34,696 (€3310) and SEK301,565 (€28,769) per QALY gained in the total migraine and episodic migraine populations, respectively.

METHODS: A hybrid decision-tree plus Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of erenumab as a migraine treatment compared with best supportive care only for patients experiencing at least 4 monthly migraine days for whom at least two prior preventive treatments had failed. Clinical efficacy data were based on results from four randomized controlled trials of erenumab against placebo. The primary outcomes were costs, migraine days, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as the cost per QALY gained. The cost per migraine day avoided was also estimated, as were disaggregated direct and indirect costs. The analysis was conducted from Swedish societal and healthcare system perspectives based on total migraine, chronic migraine and episodic migraine populations, using a discount rate of 3% applied to both costs and health benefits and using year 2019 values. RESULTS: In the base-case deterministic analyses, erenumab treatment resulted in ICERs of Swedish krona (SEK) 34,696 (€3310) and SEK301,565 (€28,769) per QALY gained in the total migraine and episodic migraine populations, respectively. Erenumab was dominant in the chronic migraine population. In the total migraine population, the use of erenumab resulted in a net benefit to society of SEK81,739 (€7773) per patient, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of SEK300,000 (€28,528) per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that erenumab is a cost-effective treatment for migraine with a willingness-to-pay threshold of SEK300,000 per QALY.",2021-01-34422,33491167,Pharmacoeconomics,Ronan Mahon,2021,39 / 3,357-372,Yes,33491167,"Ronan Mahon; Andrea Lang; Pamela Vo; Jasper Huels; Philip Cooney; Andriy Danyliv; Umakanth Vudumula; Sreelatha Vadapalle; Farooq Maniyar; Peter J Goadsby; Cost-Effectiveness of Erenumab for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine in Patients with Prior Treatment Failures in Sweden, Pharmacoeconomics, 2021 Mar; 39(3):1179-2027; 357-372",QALY,Sweden,Episodic and paroxysmal disorders,Pharmaceutical,erenumab vs. sumatriptan,"=>4 monthly migraine days, =>2 preventative treatments failed",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,301565,Sweden,2019,33816.29
32855,Cost-effectiveness analysis of empagliflozin versus sitagliptin as second-line therapy for treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States,"AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequential addition of empagliflozin versus sitagliptin after metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with or without cardiovascular disease (CVD) from the perspective of the US healthcare payer. METHODS: An individual simulation model predicted lifetime diabetes-related complications, using UKPDS-OM2 equations in patients without CVD, and EMPA-REG OUTCOME equations in patients with CVD. Additional US-based sources informed inputs for population characteristics, adverse events, non-CV death, treatment escalation, quality of life and costs. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted 3.0% annually. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for second-line empagliflozin versus sitagliptin in the overall T2D population was $6967/QALY. Empagliflozin led to longer CVD-free survival (0.07?years) and an 11% reduction in CV death in patients with CVD compared with sitagliptin. Empagliflozin resulted in greater benefits with greater costs in patients with versus without baseline CVD, yielding ICERs of $3589/QALY versus $12?577/QALY, respectively. Results were consistent across a range of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenarios. CONCLUSION: Compared with sitagliptin, empagliflozin was cost-effective (at $50?000/QALY US threshold) as a second-line treatment to metformin for T2D patients with or without CVD in the United States.

32856,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Antiviral Therapy for Untreated Minimally Active Chronic Hepatitis B to Prevent Liver Disease Progression,"INTRODUCTION: Antiviral therapy (AVT) for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can prevent liver disease progression. Because of its stringent reimbursement criteria, significant numbers of patients with untreated minimally active (UMA)-CHB exist, although they are still subject to disease progression. We thus performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the rationale for AVT for UMA-CHB. METHODS: We compared cost and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) in virtual UMA-CHB cohorts of 10,000 50-year-olds receiving AVT (scenario 1) vs no treatment (scenario 2) for 10 years. A Markov model, including 7 health states of CHB-related disease progression, was used. Values for transition probabilities and costs were mostly obtained from recent South Korean data. RESULTS: The simulation of AVT vs no treatment predicted $2,201 incremental costs and 0.175 incremental QALYs per patient for 10 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $12,607/QALY, suggesting cost-effectiveness of AVT. In sum, if 10,000 patients received AVT, 720 incident hepatocellular carcinoma and 465 CHB-related more deaths could be averted in 10 years relative to no treatment. When the simulated analysis period was extended to 20 years, AVT was also highly cost-effective with an ICER of $2,036/QALY. Although hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality was a major factor influencing ICER, its fluctuation can be accepted within willingness to pay of $33,000 in South Korea. According to probabilistic sensitivity analysis with the threshold of willingness to pay, the probability of AVT cost-effectiveness was 83.3%.

32857,First-line Treatment with Ribociclib plus Endocrine Therapy for Premenopausal Women with Hormone-receptor-positive Advanced Breast Cancer: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating recent phase III clinical trial (MONALEESA-7) data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ribociclib (RIB) as a first-line treatment for premenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC) from the United States healthcare payer perspective. In addition, because RIB has not been marketed in China, we identified the range of drug costs for which RIB could be considered cost effective from a Chinese healthcare system perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding RIB to endocrine therapy over a lifetime. The clinical outcomes and utility data were obtained from published literature. Costs data were obtained from United States and Chinese official websites, and we determined the potential price for RIB in China based on its price in the United States. The main outcomes of this study were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The model projected that mean outcome was better with RIB and endocrine combined (3.83366 QALYs) than with endocrine therapy alone (2.71203 QALYs). In the United States, RIB and endocrine therapy cost an additional $604,960.06, resulting in an ICER of $539,357.95/QALY compared with endocrine monotherapy. Subgroup analyses indicated that, in China, the projected mean outcomes were better for RIB and endocrine therapy (6.37 QALYs) than for endocrine monotherapy (2.71 QALYs). The corresponding incremental costs were $224,731.88943. Thus, the ICER comparing RIB and endocrine therapy with endocrine therapy alone represented a $61,454.96/QALY gain. CONCLUSION: Additional use of RIB is estimated to not be cost effective as a first-line treatment for premenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative ABC in the United States.

32859,Individualized quality of life benefit and cost-effectiveness estimates of proton therapy for patients with oropharyngeal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Proton therapy is a promising advancement in radiation oncology especially in terms of reducing normal tissue toxicity, although it is currently expensive and of limited availability. Here we estimated the individual quality of life benefit and cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT), as a decision-making tool for treatment individualization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Normal tissue complication probability models were used to estimate the risk of dysphagia, esophagitis, hypothyroidism, xerostomia and oral mucositis for 33 patients, comparing delivered photon intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) plans to intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost were calculated for each complication while accounting for patient-specific conditional survival probability and assigning quality-adjustment factors based on complication severity. Cost-effectiveness was modeled based on upfront costs of IMPT and IMRT, and the cost of acute and/or long-term management of treatment complications. Uncertainties in all model parameters and sensitivity analyses were included through Monte Carlo sampling. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) showed considerable variability in the cost of QALYs spared between patients, with median $361,405/QALY for all patients, varying from $54,477/QALY to $1,508,845/QALY between individual patients. Proton therapy was more likely to be cost-effective for patients with p16-positive tumors ($234,201/QALY), compared to p16-negative tumors ($516,297/QALY). For patients with p16-positive tumors treated with comprehensive nodal irradiation, proton therapy is estimated to be cost-effective in?=?50% of sampled cases for 8/9 patients at $500,000/QALY, compared to 6/24 patients who either have p16-negative tumors or receive unilateral neck irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy cost-effectiveness varies greatly among oropharyngeal cancer patients, and highlights the importance of individualized decision-making. Although the upfront cost, societal willingness to pay and healthcare administration can vary greatly among different countries, identifying patients for whom proton therapy will have the greatest benefit can optimize resource allocation and inform prospective clinical trial design.",2021-01-34433,33478544,Radiat Oncol,N Patrik Brodin,2021,16 / 1,19,No,33478544,"N Patrik Brodin; Rafi Kabarriti; Clyde B Schechter; Mark Pankuch; Vinai Gondi; Shalom Kalnicki; Madhur K Garg; Wolfgang A Tomé; Individualized quality of life benefit and cost-effectiveness estimates of proton therapy for patients with oropharyngeal cancer, Radiat Oncol, 2021 Jan 21; 16(1):1748-717X; 19",QALY,United States of America,"Malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity and pharynx",Medical Procedure,"intensity-modulated proton therapy vs. intensity-modulated radiation therapy, 33 fractions",treated with definitive radiation therapy,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,361405,United States,2018,389992.76
32860,Cost-effectiveness of sustained-release morphine for refractory breathlessness in COPD: A randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Chronic breathlessness is a frequent symptom in advanced Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and has major impact on quality of life, daily activities and healthcare utilization. Morphine is used as palliative treatment of chronic breathlessness. The aim is to analyze cost-effectiveness of regular, low-dose morphine in patients with advanced COPD from a healthcare and societal perspective. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, participants with advanced COPD were assigned to 10 mg regular, oral sustained-release morphine or placebo twice daily for four weeks. Quality of life (COPD Assessment Test; CAT), quality-adjusted life years (QALY''s; EQ-5D-5L), healthcare costs, productivity, and patient and family costs were collected. Incremental cost-effectivity ratio''s (ICERs) using healthcare costs and CAT scores, and incremental cost-utility ratio''s (ICURs) using societal costs and QALY''s were calculated. RESULTS: Data of 106 of 124 participants were analyzed, of which 50 were in the morphine group (mean [SD] age 65.4 [8.0] years; 58 [55%] male). Both ICER and ICUR indicated dominance for morphine treatment. Sensitivity analyses substantiated these results. From a healthcare perspective, the probability that morphine is cost-effective at a willingness to pay €8000 for an minimal clinically important difference of 2 points increase in CAT score is 63%. From a societal perspective, the probability that morphine is cost-effective at a willingness to pay €20,000 per QALY is 78%. CONCLUSION: Morphine for four weeks is cost-effective regarding the healthcare and the societal perspective. To estimate the long-term costs and effects of morphine treatment, a study of longer follow-up should be performed.

METHODS: To conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis, a Markov decision model was established. Three health states (progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death) were included, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was regarded as the primary endpoint. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $100,000.00/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and discounted rates were set at 3% annually. Efficacy data were derived from the CARD trial and Weibull distribution curves were modeled to fit the survival curves. The robustness of the analysis was tested with a series of one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Overall, the incremental effectiveness and cost of cabazitaxel versus androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitors (ASTIs) were 0.16 QALYs and $49,487.03, respectively, which yielded an ICER of $309,293.94/QALY. Our model was mostly sensitive to the duration of PFS in the cabazitaxel group, cost of cabazitaxel and utility of the PFS state. At a WTP threshold of $100,000.00/QALY, cabazitaxel was the dominant strategy in 0% of the simulations.

32864,Optimizing the risk threshold of lymph node involvement for performing extended pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer patients: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) may be omitted in prostate cancer (CaP) patients with a low predicted risk of lymph node involvement (LNI). The aim of the current study was to quantify the cost-effectiveness of using different risk thresholds for predicted LNI in CaP patients to inform decision making on omitting ePLND. METHODS: Five different thresholds (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) used in practice for performing ePLND were compared using a decision analytic cohort model with the 100% threshold (i.e., no ePLND) as reference. Compared outcomes consisted of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. Baseline characteristics for the hypothetical cohort were based on an actual Dutch patient cohort containing 925 patients who underwent ePLND with risks of LNI predicted by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center web-calculator. The best strategy was selected based on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio when applying a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed with Monte Carlo simulation to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Costs and health outcomes were lowest (€4,858 and 6.04 QALYs) for the 100% threshold, and highest (€10,939 and 6.21 QALYs) for the 2% threshold, respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for the 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% threshold compared with the first threshold above (i.e., 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) were €189,222/QALY, €130,689/QALY, €51,920/QALY, and €23,187/QALY respectively.

32871,Cost effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel versus tisagenlecleucel for adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy in the United States,"AIMS: To assess from a US payer perspective the cost-effectiveness of the chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)-cell therapies axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) to treat relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) following =2 systemic therapy lines. METHODS: A 3-state (i.e., pre-progression, post-progression, death) partitioned survival model was used to estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs for patients on each treatment over a lifetime horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were based on a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) that accounted for differences in trial population baseline characteristics. Mixture-cure models (MCMs) were used to account for long-term survivors. Costs included drug acquisition and administration for the CAR T-cell therapies and conditioning chemotherapy, apheresis, CAR T-specific monitoring, transplant, hospitalization, adverse events, routine care, and terminal care. Health state utilities were derived from trial and published data. Sensitivity analyses included probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) and an analysis of extremes that assessed the results across a vast array of combinations of parametric OS and PFS curves across the 2 therapies. RESULTS: Compared to tisa-cel, axi-cel resulted in 2.31 QALYs gained and a cost reduction of $1,407 in the base case. In the PSA, the cost per QALY gained was =$31,500 in 95% of the 1,000 simulations. In the analysis of extremes, the cost per QALY gained was =$7,500 in 99% of the 1,296 combinations of MCMs and =$40,000 in 95% of the 1,296 combinations of standard models. LIMITATIONS: In absence of head-to-head comparative data, we relied on a MAIC, which cannot account for all possible confounders. Moreover, some outcomes (i.e., transplantations, hospitalizations, AEs) were not adjusted in the MAIC.

Ticagrelor is an effective antiplatelet that is unaffected by the CYP2C19 polymorphism. The main aim of the current research is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness among CYP2C19 genotype-guided therapy, universal ticagrelor, and universal clopidogrel after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: A two-part decision-analytic model, including a one-year model and a 20-year follow-up Markov model, was created to follow the use of (i) universal clopidogrel, (ii) universal ticagrelor, and (iii) genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy. Outcome measures were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, cost/success) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR, cost/quality-adjusted life years [QALY]). Therapy success was defined as survival without myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, stent thrombosis, and no therapy discontinuation because of adverse events, i.e. major bleeding and dyspnea. The model was based on a multivariate analysis, and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the model outcomes, including against variations in drug acquisition costs. RESULTS: Against universal clopidogrel, genotype-guided therapy was cost-effective over the one-year duration (ICER, USD 6102 /success), and dominant over the long-term.

Therapy success was defined as survival without myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, stent thrombosis, and no therapy discontinuation because of adverse events, i.e. major bleeding and dyspnea. The model was based on a multivariate analysis, and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the model outcomes, including against variations in drug acquisition costs. RESULTS: Against universal clopidogrel, genotype-guided therapy was cost-effective over the one-year duration (ICER, USD 6102 /success), and dominant over the long-term. Genotype-guided therapy was dominant against universal ticagrelor over the one-year duration, and cost-effective over the long term (ICUR, USD 1383 /QALY). Universal clopidogrel was dominant over ticagrelor for the short term, and cost-effective over the long-term (ICUR, USD 10,616 /QALY).

32877,A novel economic framework to assess the cost-effectiveness of bone-forming agents in the prevention of fractures in patients with osteoporosis,"A novel cost-effectiveness model framework was developed to incorporate the elevated fracture risk associated with a recent fracture and to allow sequential osteoporosis therapies to be evaluated. Treating patients with severe osteoporosis after a recent fracture with a bone-forming agent followed by antiresorptive therapy can be cost-effective compared with antiresorptive therapy alone. Incorporating these novel technical attributes in economic evaluations can support appropriate policy and reimbursement decision-making. PURPOSE: To develop a cost-effectiveness model accommodating increased fracture risk after a recent fracture and treatment sequencing. METHODS: A micro-simulation cost-utility model was developed to accommodate both treatment sequencing and increased risk with recent fracture. The risk of fracture was estimated and simulated using the FRAX® algorithms combined with Swedish registry data on imminent fracture relative risk. In the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, a sequential treatment starting with a bone-forming agent for 12 months followed by an antiresorptive agent for 48 months initiated immediately after a major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) in a 70-year-old woman with a T-score of 2.5 or less was compared to an antiresorptive treatment alone for 60 months. The model was populated with data relevant for a UK population reflecting a personal social service perspective. RESULTS: The cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the base-case setting was estimated at £34,584. Sensitivity analyses revealed the sequential treatment to be cost-saving compared with administering a bone-forming treatment alone. Without simulating an elevated fracture risk immediately after a recent fracture, the cost per QALY changed from £34,584 to £62,184. CONCLUSION: Incorporating imminent fracture risk in economic evaluations has a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness when evaluating fracture prevention treatments in patients with osteoporosis who sustained a recent fracture.

32883,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Selective Internal Radiotherapy With Yttrium-90 Versus Sorafenib in Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"PURPOSE: The recent sorafenib versus radioembolization in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (SARAH) and selective internal radiation therapy versus sorafenib in locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (SIRveNIB) trials showed no statistically significant difference in overall survival for randomization to selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) versus sorafenib for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, although SIRT was better tolerated. Given the high cost of both treatments, we investigated their comparative cost-effectiveness from a US healthcare sector perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed a state-transition microsimulation model to simulate patients allocated to SIRT versus sorafenib according to an intention-to-treat principle. Hazard rates of disease progression and death were based on pooled individual patient data generated from the SARAH and SIRveNIB trials'' Kaplan-Meier curves. Inputs for adverse events, treatment adherence, and quality of life utility weights were derived from trial data as well. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates and literature. We performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis and estimated costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 5-year time horizon. We evaluated sensitivity to uncertainty of key model parameters. RESULTS: Costs were $78,859 v $58,397 (difference $20,462; 95% uncertainty interval $14,444 to 27,205) and QALYs were 0.88 v 0.87 (difference 0.02, -0.02 to 0.05) for sorafenib versus SIRT, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of sorafenib was $1,280,224/QALY. The likelihood that sorafenib would be cost effective did not exceed 1%, assuming cost-effectiveness thresholds up to $200k/QALY. If the monthly price of sorafenib decreased from $16,390 to below $7,000, the ICER of sorafenib fell below $200k/QALY, and an ICER < $100k/QALY was reached if the monthly price fell below $6,600. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib is unlikely to provide a gain in quality-adjusted survival compared with SIRT at an acceptable cost for the US healthcare sector.

32884,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of universal hepatitis B virus vaccination in Iran: a Markov model analysis,"Vaccination is an essential way to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Various studies have been published on the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination, but since the results vary according to the target population and related health outcomes, this study examined the cost-effectiveness of the universal HBV vaccination in Iran. In this economic evaluation study, a decision tree with the Markov model was used to compare the universal HBV vaccination with a strategy of non-vaccination. Health states used in the model included healthy, chronic hepatitis B, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Analyses were performed from a payer''s perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per life-year gained, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were calculated at a 5% annual discount rate. The sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and TreeAge Pro 2011 software. In 2017, the estimated cost per dose for any HBV vaccine was $3.20 USD. The universal HBV vaccination was economically advantageous compared to non-vaccination, and the estimated cost of this program per life-year and QALY gained were $6,319 and negative (-) $1,183.85 USD, respectively. Given the uncertainty of all parameters, the model remained robust and reliable. In Iran, the universal HBV vaccination strategy for both health outcomes of QALY and life-years gained was cost-effective and advantageous.

32885,Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide 1 mg Versus Empagliflozin 25 mg for Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in the UK Setting,"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes represents a continuing healthcare challenge, and choosing cost-effective treatments is crucial to ensure that healthcare resources are used efficiently. The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK. METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of initiation of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on an indirect comparison conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently no head-to-head clinical trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients received treatments until glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at which point patients initiated basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy costs and costs of diabetes-related complications, expressed in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty around projected outcomes. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with increases in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and 0.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin 25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy costs, but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be a cost-effective treatment option from a healthcare payer perspective compared with empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting.",2021-01-34477,33423240,Diabetes Ther,Matthew Capehorn,2021,12 / 2,537-555,No,33423240,"Matthew Capehorn; Nino Hallén; James Baker-Knight; Divina Glah; Barnaby Hunt; Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide 1 mg Versus Empagliflozin 25 mg for Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in the UK Setting, Diabetes Ther, 2021 Feb; 12(2):1869-6953; 537-555",QALY,United Kingdom,Diabetes mellitus,Pharmaceutical,Semaglutide vs. Empafliflozin,Not Stated,56 Years,56 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, 20 Years",3.50,3.50,4439,United Kingdom,2019,6007.82
32886,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Lymph Node Transfer vs Lymphovenous Bypass for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema,"BACKGROUND: Lymph node transfer (LNT) and lymphovenous bypass (LVB) have been described as two major surgical options for patients with breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) who have failed conservative therapy. The objective of our study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing LNT and LVB for the treatment of BCRL. STUDY DESIGN: Rates of infection, lymph leak, and failure for LNT and LVB were obtained from a previously published meta-analysis. Failure of surgery was defined as the inability to cease compression therapy postoperatively. Procedural costs were calculated from Medicare reimbursement rates. Cost of conservative management of postoperative surgical site infection, lymph leak, and continued decongestive physiotherapy after failed surgery were obtained from literature review. Average utility scores for each health state were calculated using a visual analog scale survey, then converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A decision tree was constructed and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was assessed at $50,000/QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of our findings. RESULTS: LNT was less costly ($22,492 vs $31,927) and more effective (31.82 QALY vs 29.24 QALY) than LVB. One-way (deterministic) sensitivity analysis demonstrated that LNT became cost-ineffective when its failure rate was more than 43.8%. LVB became more cost-effective than LNT when its failure rate was less than 21.4%.

32887,Real-World Cost-Effectiveness of Palliative Care for Terminal Cancer Patients in a Japanese General Hospital,"Background: The concept of cost-effectiveness is necessary for optimal utilization of limited health care resources. However, few studies have assessed the cost-effectiveness of palliative care using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), considered common outcomes in health economics. Objective: We aimed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of palliative care for terminal cancer patients by using QALYs. Design: A retrospective cohort study was performed. Setting/Patients: We included 401 patients with stage IV cancer, who were hospitalized and died at a Japanese general hospital during the period April 2014 to March 2019. Methods: Using the hospital database, we compared the total admission costs and QALYs based on pain levels of patients admitted to the palliative care (PC) department with those of patients admitted to other usual care (UC) departments. Patients in each group were matched through propensity scores to reduce bias. Bootstrapping estimated the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and the probability that PC was more cost-effective than UC. Results: After matching, 128 patients in each group were selected. Converting 1 U.S. dollar (USD) to 100 Japanese yen, PC reduced mean total admission costs by 1732 USD (95% CI: 1584-1879) and improved mean health benefits by 0.0028 QALYs (95% CI: 0.0025-0.0032) compared with UC. Based on the Japanese cost-effectiveness threshold, there was an 82% probability that PC was more cost-effective than UC. Conclusions: Our results indicated that admission of terminal cancer patients to the PC department was associated with improvement in cost-effectiveness. This finding could support the introduction of palliative care for terminal cancer patients. Our study was approved at St. Luke''s International University (receipt number 18-R061 and at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Univesity of Tokyo (receipt number 31-29).",2021-01-34486,33470878,J Palliat Med,Yuki Hashimoto,2021,/,,No,33470878,"Yuki Hashimoto; Akitoshi Hayashi; Lida Teng; Ataru Igarashi; Real-World Cost-Effectiveness of Palliative Care for Terminal Cancer Patients in a Japanese General Hospital, J Palliat Med, 2021 Jan 19; ():1096-6218",QALY,Japan,,Care Delivery,Palliative care vs. Usual care department,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-618214.29,United States,2019,-655243.26
32888,Cost-effectiveness of maintenance hormonal therapy in patients with advanced low grade serous ovarian cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of using maintenance hormonal therapy in patients with low grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSC). METHODS: A simulated decision analysis with a Markov decision model over a lifetime horizon was performed using the base case of a 47-year old patient with stage IIIC, LGSC following first-line treatment with primary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Two treatment strategies were analyzed - maintenance daily letrozole until disease progression and routine observation. The analysis was from the perspective of the healthcare payer. Direct medical costs were estimated using public data sources and previous literature and were reported in adjusted 2018 Canadian dollars. The model estimated lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), life years (LY), median overall survival (OS), and number of recurrences with each strategy. Cost-effectiveness was compared using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A strategy was considered cost-effective when the ICER was less than the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 CAD per QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of changing key clinical and cost variables. RESULTS: Maintenance letrozole was the preferred strategy with an associated lifetime cost of $69,985 CAD ($52,620 USD) and an observed improvement of 0.91 QALYs and 1.55 LYs. The ICER for letrozole maintenance therapy was an additional $11,037 CAD ($8298 USD) per QALY. The modeled median OS was 150 months with maintenance letrozole and 126 months in the observation strategy. The maintenance letrozole strategy resulted in 34% and 17% fewer first recurrences at 5-year and 10-year follow-up, respectively. CONCLUSION: Maintenance letrozole is a cost-effective treatment strategy in patients with advanced LGSC resulting in clinically-relevant improvement in QALYs, LYs, and fewer disease recurrences.",2021-01-34498,33032821,Gynecol Oncol,Andra Nica,2021,160 / 1,206-213,No,33032821,"Andra Nica; Ji Young Jennifer Lee; Nicole Look Hong; Taymaa May; Cost-effectiveness of maintenance hormonal therapy in patients with advanced low grade serous ovarian cancer, Gynecol Oncol, 2021 Jan; 160(1):0090-8258; 206-213",QALY,Canada,"Malignant neoplasms, breast and female genital organs",Surgical,letrozole vs. routine observation,patients in remission after completion of primary therapy,47 Years,47 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,11027,Canada,2019,8807.66
32889,Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness the Dexcom G6 Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Compared with Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in People with Type 1 Diabetes in France,"INTRODUCTION: The aim was to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of the Dexcom G6 real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) system versus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in France. METHODS: The analysis was performed using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model and utilized clinical input data from the DIAMOND clinical trial in adults with T1D. Simulated patients were assumed to have a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%, and those in the RT-CGM arm were assumed to have a HbA1c reduction of 1.0% compared with 0.4% in the SMBG arm. A quality of life (QoL) benefit associated with a reduced fear of hypoglycemia (FoH) and elimination of the requirement for fingerstick testing in the RT-CGM arm was also applied. RESULTS: The G6 RT-CGM system was associated with an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.38 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SMBG (10.64 QALYs versus 9.23 QALYs). Total mean lifetime costs were 21,087 euros higher with RT-CGM (148,077 euros versus 126,990 euros), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 15,285 euros per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: In France, based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 euros per QALY gained, the use of the G6 RT-CGM system is cost-effective relative to SMBG for adults with long-standing T1D, driven primarily by improved glycemic control and the QoL benefit associated with reduced FoH and elimination of the requirement for fingerstick testing.",2021-01-34503,33165838,Diabetes Ther,Stéphane Roze,2021,12 / 1,235-246,No,33165838,"Stéphane Roze; John J Isitt; Jayne Smith-Palmer; Peter Lynch; Brigitte Klinkenbijl; Gerald Zammit; Pierre-Yves Benhamou; Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness the Dexcom G6 Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Compared with Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in People with Type 1 Diabetes in France, Diabetes Ther, 2021 Jan; 12(1):1869-6953; 235-246",QALY,French Republic,Diabetes mellitus,Medical Device,real time continuous glucose monitoring vs. self monitoring of blood glucose,"HbA1c of 7.5–10.0% (58–86 mmol/mol), treated with multiple daily injections of insulin for at least 1 year previously, previous personal continuous glucose monitoring use",Not Stated,25 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,15285,Euro,2020,18278.78
32890,Cost-effectiveness of stress CTP versus CTA in detecting obstructive CAD or in-stent restenosis in stented patients,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine cost-effectiveness of stress myocardial CT perfusion (CTP), coronary CT angiography (CTA), and the combination of both in suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or in-stent restenosis (ISR) in patients with previous coronary stent implantation. METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with CTA, CTP, and CTA + CTP. Model input parameters were obtained from published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate overall model uncertainty. A single-variable deterministic sensitivity analysis evaluated the sensitivity of the results to plausible variations in model inputs. Cost-effectiveness was assessed based on a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per QALY. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario with willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY, CTA resulted in total costs of $47,013.87 and an expected effectiveness of 6.84 QALYs, whereas CTP resulted in total costs of $46,758.83 with 6.93 QALYs. CTA + CTP reached costs of $47,455.63 with 6.85 QALYs. Therefore, strategies CTA and CTA + CTP were dominated by CTP in the base-case scenario. Deterministic sensitivity analysis demonstrated robustness of the model to variations of diagnostic efficacy parameters and costs in a broad range. CTP was cost-effective in the majority of iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis as compared with CTA. CONCLUSIONS: CTP is cost-effective for the detection of obstructive CAD or ISR in patients with previous stenting and therefore should be considered a feasible approach in daily clinical practice.

32892,Assessing the Value of Cemiplimab for Adults With Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cemiplimab in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) from a payer perspective in the United States. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of cemiplimab versus historical standard of care (SOC). All inputs were identified based on a systematic literature review, supplemented by expert opinion where necessary. Clinical inputs for cemiplimab were based on individual patient data from a cemiplimab phase 2 single-arm trial (NCT27060498). For SOC, analysis was based on a pooled analysis of single-arm clinical trials and retrospective studies evaluating chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib, and gefitinib) identified via a systematic literature review (6 of the 27 included studies). Overall survival and progression-free survival were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon. Costs were included for drug acquisition, drug administration, management of adverse events, subsequent therapy, disease management, and terminal care. Unit costs were based on published 2019 US list prices. RESULTS: In the base case, cemiplimab versus SOC resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $99?447 per quality adjusted-life year (QALY), where incremental costs and QALYs were $372?108 and 3.74, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150?000/QALY, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests a 90% probability that cemiplimab is cost-effective compared to SOC. Scenario analyses resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $90?590 to $148?738.

32893,Elective neck dissection versus positron emission tomography-computed tomography-guided management of the neck in clinically node-negative early oral cavity cancer: A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: In early oral cavity cancer, elective neck dissection (END) for the clinically node-negative (cN0) neck improves survival compared with observation. This paradigm has been challenged recently by the use of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging in the cN0 neck. To inform this debate, we performed an economic evaluation comparing PET-CT-guided therapy with routine END in the cN0 neck. METHODS: Patients with T1-2N0 lateralized oral tongue cancer were analyzed. A Markov model over a 40-year time horizon simulated treatment, disease recurrence, and survival from a US health care payer perspective. Model parameters were derived from a review of the literature. RESULTS: The END strategy was dominant, with a cost savings of $1576.30 USD, an increase of 0.055 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), a net monetary benefit of $4303 USD, and a 0.22 life-year advantage. END was sensitive to variation in cost and utilities in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. PET-CT became the preferred strategy when decreasing occult nodal disease to 18% and increasing the negative predictive value (NPV) of PET-CT to 89% in 1-way sensitivity analyses. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, assuming a cost effectiveness threshold of $50,000 USD/QALY, END was dominant in 64% of simulations and cost effective in 69.8%. CONCLUSION: END is a cost-effective strategy compared with PET-CT in patients who have node-negative oral cancer. Although lower PET standardized uptake value thresholds would result in fewer false negatives and improved NPV, it is still uncertain that PET-CT would be cost effective, as this would likely result in more false positive tests.",2021-01-34512,33635537,Cancer,Christopher W Noel,2021,/,,No,33635537,"Christopher W Noel; David Forner; David P Goldstein; Ur Metser; Robert L Ferris; John Waldron; John R de Almeida; Elective neck dissection versus positron emission tomography-computed tomography-guided management of the neck in clinically node-negative early oral cavity cancer: A cost-utility analysis, Cancer, 2021 Feb 26; ():0008-543X",QALY,United States of America,"Malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity and pharynx","Medical Procedure, Surgical",partial glossectomy + simultaneous ipsilateral selective neck dissection vs. positron emission tomography–computed tomography --> simultaneous ipsilateral selective neck dissection,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,"Male, Female",Full,40 Years,1.50,1.50,-31520,United States,2019,-33407.94
32894,Cost-Effectiveness of Quadrivalent Versus Trivalent Influenza Vaccination in the Dutch National Influenza Prevention Program,"OBJECTIVES: As of 2019, quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) has replaced trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in the national immunization program in The Netherlands. Target groups are individuals of 60+ years of age and those with chronic diseases. The objective was to estimate the incremental break-even price of QIV over TIV at a threshold of €20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). METHODS: An age-structured compartmental dynamic model was adapted for The Netherlands to assess health outcomes and associated costs of vaccinating all individuals at higher risk for influenza with QIV instead of TIV over the seasons 2010 to 2018. Influenza incidence rates were derived from a global database. Other parameters (probabilities, QALYs and costs) were extracted from the literature and applied according to Dutch guidelines. A threshold of €20 000 per QALY was applied to estimate the incremental break-even prices of QIV versus TIV. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model outcomes. RESULTS: Retrospectively, vaccination with QIV instead of TIV could have prevented on average 9500 symptomatic influenza cases, 2130 outpatient visits, 84 hospitalizations, and 38 deaths per year over the seasons 2010 to 2018. This translates into 385 QALYs and 398 life-years potentially gained. On average, totals of €431 527 direct and €2 388 810 indirect costs could have been saved each year. CONCLUSION: Using QIV over TIV during the influenza seasons 2010 to 2018 would have been cost-effective at an incremental price of maximally €3.81 (95% confidence interval, €3.26-4.31).

We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of carboplatin/paclitaxel alone versus carboplatin/paclitaxel with trastuzumab among patients with Her2/neu-positive advanced or recurrent UPSC. METHODS: We designed a Markov model in TreeAge Pro 2019 software to simulate management of a theoretical cohort of 4000 patients with Her2/neu-positive advanced or recurrent uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) followed for four years. In the carboplatin/paclitaxel with trastuzumab strategy, we included the cost of testing for Her2/neu status. We obtained all model inputs from the literature and a societal perspective was assumed. Outcomes included progression-free survival, progression, UPSC-specific mortality, cost, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The intervention was considered cost effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort of 4000 women, treatment with the addition of trastuzumab resulted in 637 fewer deaths and 627 fewer cases of progression compared with treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel alone. Treatment with trastuzumab was associated with an additional cost of $144,335,895, but was associated with an increase of 2065 QALYs. The ICER was $69,903 per QALY, which was below our willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this treatment strategy was cost-effective until the cost of 6 months of treatment surpassed $38,505 (baseline input: $27,562).

There is no current standard protocol for assessing ototoxicity in CF centers in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-implemented routine hearing screening for ototoxicity among pediatric patients using a clinically validated tablet audiometer to allow for earlier detection of hearing loss in an exploratory analysis. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing routine screening with monthly cycles over a 3-year time horizon. The model measured the difference in promptly detected hearing loss, delayed detected hearing loss, and undetected hearing loss, compared with current screening practices. Model inputs were obtained through a comprehensive literature review. Primary model outcomes included total health care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with a 3% yearly discount. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: In a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients, routine screening using a tablet audiometer increased promptly detected hearing loss by 8 patients. There was an incremental gain of 3.2 QALYs at an increased cost of $333,826 compared with current screening practices. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $103,771 per QALY. In the 1-way sensitivity analysis, the ICER ranged between $64,345 and $258,830 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Using a tablet audiometer for routine hearing screening appears to be a cost-effective option at a $150,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold when only considering the immediate benefits gained. This analysis did not examine the long-term effects of early detection in language development for pediatric patients.

32899,Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Changes to the Surveillance Intervals in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and cost-effectiveness of lengthening the time between surveillance ultrasound scans in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Screening Programme. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening for men aged 65, comparing current surveillance intervals to 6 alternative surveillance interval strategies that lengthened the time between surveillance scans for 1 or more AAA size categories. The model considered clinical events and costs incurred over a 30-year time horizon and the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The model adopted the National Health Service perspective and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5%. RESULTS: Compared with current practice, alternative surveillance strategies resulted in up to a 4% reduction in the number of elective AAA repairs but with an increase of up to 1.6% in the number of AAA ruptures and AAA-related deaths. Alternative strategies resulted in a small reduction in QALYs compared to current practice but with reduced costs. Two strategies that lengthened surveillance intervals in only very small AAAs (3.0-3.9 cm) provided, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20?000 per QALY, the highest positive incremental net benefit. There was negligible chance that current practice is the most cost-effective strategy at any threshold below £40?000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Lengthening surveillance intervals in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme, especially for small AAA, can marginally reduce the incremental cost per QALY of the program. Nevertheless, whether the cost savings from refining surveillance strategies justifies a change in clinical practice is unclear.",2021-01-34526,33641771,Value Health,Michael J Sweeting,2021,24 / 3,369-376,Yes,33641771,"Michael J Sweeting; John Marshall; Matthew Glover; Akhtar Nasim; Matthew J Bown; Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Changes to the Surveillance Intervals in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme, Value Health, 2021 Mar; 24(3):1098-3015; 369-376",QALY,United Kingdom,"Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries","Screening, Other","abdominal aortic aneurysm screening (1 year interval, 3.0-4.4 cm; 3 months for 4.5-5.4 cm) vs. do nothing",,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,8509,United Kingdom,2018,12269.57
