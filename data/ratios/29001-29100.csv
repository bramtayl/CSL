29001,Cost-effectiveness analysis of infant feeding strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in South Africa,"Despite increasing availability of perinatal interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in South Africa, MTCT remains high due to breastfeeding. To inform policy decisions in the country, cost-effectiveness of alternative infant-feeding interventions was conducted. Mathematical modelling was used to simulate post-natal transmission and mortality due to infant feeding in a hypothetical cohort of 1 000 HIV-exposed infants. Lifetime costs to the health system were calculated for each strategy. Interventions compared with current practice were: increasing coverage of extended nevirapine prophylaxis (ENP) to infants from 30% (base case) to 60% without changing current feeding practices; actively supporting breastfeeding with ENP to infants for 12 months; and actively supporting exclusive formula (replacement) feeding for 6 months. HIV-free survival at 24 months and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were estimated for typical rural and certain urban settings. Base-case analysis revealed that expanding coverage of nevirapine prophylaxis with breastfeeding is cost-saving and improves HIV-free survival. Changing feeding practices is beneficial, depending on context. Breastfeeding is dominant (less costly, more effective) in rural settings, whilst formula feeding is a dominant strategy in urban settings. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to proportion of women on lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) and infant mortality rate (IMR). When >55% of women are on ART, breastfeeding dominates in the urban settings modelled, whilst formula feeding is cost-effective in rural settings when IMR </= 45/1000. The study concludes that strategies to support breastfeeding are essential. Strengthening health systems is critical to ensure optimal nevirapine delivery during breastfeeding.

29006,The cost effectiveness of reconstructive surgery in Cambodia,"Background: Surgical care is often regarded as too expensive and complex for people in poor countries and so has long been neglected. Objective: We demonstrated that the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) saved of reconstructive surgery in Cambodia is competitive with many basic public health interventions. Methods: The Children''s Surgical Centre (CSC) in Phnom Penh provides orthopedic, plastic, ophthalmological, and general reconstructive surgical services free to disabled people in Cambodia. Following standard guidelines for calculating operation costs and assigning disability weights we calculated the cost effectiveness of surgical treatment for 343 patients treated at CSC in January and March, 2012. Results: Our data for these two months yielded 1785 DALYs averted and operating costs totaling $164,543; resulting in $99 per DALY averted. Conclusion: Reconstructive surgery is cost effective compared to other basic public health interventions and should not be neglected when designing integrated health care services in a developing country.",2013-01-04052,0,Asian Biomed.,K.,2013,7 /,319-324,No,Not Stated,"K.; Martijn D.

29007,Newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry for glutaric aciduria type 1: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background: Glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by inherited deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Despite high prognostic relevance of early diagnosis and start of metabolic treatment as well as an additional cost saving potential later in life, only a limited number of countries recommend newborn screening for GA-I. So far only limited data is available enabling health care decision makers to evaluate whether investing into GA-I screening represents value for money. The aim of our study was therefore to assess the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for GA-I by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) compared to a scenario where GA-I is not included in the MS/MS screening panel. Methods. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for GA-I against the alternative of not including GA-I in MS/MS screening. A Markov model was developed simulating the clinical course of screened and unscreened newborns within different time horizons of 20 and 70 years. Monte Carlo simulation based probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to determine the probability of GA-I screening representing a cost-effective therapeutic strategy. Results: Within a 20 year time horizon, GA-I screening averts approximately 3.7 DALYs (95% CI 2.9 - 4.5) and about one life year is gained (95% CI 0.7 - 1.4) per 100,000 neonates screened initially. Moreover, the screening programme saves a total of around 30,682 Euro (95% CI 14,343 to 49,176 Euro) per 100,000 screened neonates over a 20 year time horizon. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present study, extending pre-existing MS/MS newborn screening programmes by GA-I represents a highly cost-effective diagnostic strategy when assessed under conditions comparable to the German health care system. © 2013 Pfeil et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2013-01-04276,24135440,Orphanet J Rare Dis,,2013,8 /,,No,24135440,"Nina A.

29018,An analysis of the costs of Uganda's Child Days Plus: do low costs reveal an efficient program or an underfinanced one?,"BACKGROUND: Twice annually, Uganda implements Child Days Plus (CDP), a month-long outreach activity that distributes vitamin A capsules to preschool children and deworms children 6 months to 14 years old. Introduced initially as a temporary, interim strategy, CDP is now a decade old. OBJECTIVE: To assess how well CDP is implemented using an activity-based cost analysis. METHODS: In the absence of a cost-accounting system for CDP, we defined the six major CDP activities as cost centers and identified five important subactivities required to implement a round of CDP. Based on a purposive sample, we conducted a structured interview survey of 59 Ministry of Health facilities, 9 district offices, and national-level CDP staff. RESULTS: Only one-third of the facilities implemented all 11 CDP core activities. The survey revealed that Ministry of Health staff and volunteers are frequently paid substantially less in allowances than they are entitled to for their CDP outreach activities. Viewing these two practices--nonimplementation and less-than-full-reimbursement--as indicators of CDP's underfinancing, we estimate the program is underfinanced by the equivalent of 37% of its 'full implementation"" costs. Two-thirds of underfinancing is manifested in nonimplementation and one-third as less-than full-reimbursement. CDP exploits economies of scale and scope and has an average cost per child served of US$0.22. We estimate that it annually saves 367,000 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) at an average cost of US$12.5, making it--despite its underfinancing--highly cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Increased CDP funding would enable its vitamin A coverage rate of 58% and its deworming coverage rate of 62% to be increased, thereby increasing its effectiveness and efficiency. CDP should be ""relaunched,"" as part of an effort to improve the structure of the program, set expectations about it, and earmark a minimum of resources for CDP. The Ministry of Health should demonstrate its new, greater commitment to CDP by introducing a program-specific budget line item, increasing CDP's budget allocation, and developing and implementing a training program that identifies the minimum uniform activities required to implement CDP.",2014-99-16642,24791583,Food Nutr Bull,John L Fiedler,2014,35 / 1,92-104,No,24791583,"John L Fiedler; Richard Semakula; An analysis of the costs of Uganda's Child Days Plus: do low costs reveal an efficient program or an underfinanced one?, Food Nutr Bull, ; 35(1):0379-5721; 92-104",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Other",Child Days Plus (CDP): month-long outreach activity distributing vitamin A capsules to preschool children and deworms children 6 months-14 years old vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,12.5,United States,2010,14.84
29019,Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer control strategies in Central America: the cases of Costa Rica and Mexico,"This paper reports the most cost-effective policy options to support and improve breast cancer control in Costa Rica and Mexico. Total costs and effects of breast cancer interventions were estimated using the health care perspective and WHO-CHOICE methodology. Effects were measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Costs were assessed in 2009 United States Dollars (US$). To the extent available, analyses were based on locally obtained data. In Costa Rica, the current strategy of treating breast cancer in stages I to IV at a 80% coverage level seems to be the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$4,739 per DALY averted. At a coverage level of 95%, biennial clinical breast examination (CBE) screening could improve Costa Rica's population health twofold, and can still be considered very cost-effective (ICER US$5,964/DALY). For Mexico, our results indicate that at 95% coverage a mass-media awareness raising program (MAR) could be the most cost-effective (ICER US$5,021/DALY). If more resources are available in Mexico, biennial mammography screening for women 50-70 yrs (ICER US$12,718/DALY), adding trastuzumab (ICER US$13,994/DALY) or screening women 40-70 yrs biennially plus trastuzumab (ICER US$17,115/DALY) are less cost-effective options. We recommend both Costa Rica and Mexico to engage in MAR, CBE or mammography screening programs, depending on their budget. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution however, as the evidence on the intervention effectiveness is uncertain. Also, these programs require several organizational, budgetary and human resources, and the accessibility of breast cancer diagnostic, referral, treatment and palliative care facilities should be improved simultaneously.

29057,Cost-effectiveness of rabies post exposure prophylaxis in iran,"BACKGROUND: The rabies is one of the most important officially-known viral zoonotic diseases for its global distribution, outbreak, high human and veterinary costs, and high death rate and causes high economic costs in different countries of the world every year. The rabies is the deadliest disease and if the symptoms break out in a person, one will certainly die. However, the deaths resulting from rabies can be prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis. To do so, in Iran and most of the countries in the world, all the people who are exposed to animal bite receive Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) treatment. The present survey aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of PEP in southern Iran. METHODS: The present study estimated the PEP costs from the government`s Perspective with step-down method for the people exposed to animal bite, estimated the number of DALYs prevented by PEP in the individuals using decision Tree model, and computed the Incremental cost-effectiveness Ratio. The information collected of all reported animal bite cases (n=7111) in Fars Province, who referred rabies registries in urban and rural health centers to receive active care. Performing the PEP program cost estimated 1,052,756.1 USD for one year and the estimated cost for the treatment of each animal bite case and each prevented death was 148.04 and 5945.42 USD, respectively. Likewise 4,509.82 DALYs were prevented in southern Iran in 2011 by PEP program. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each DALY was estimated to be 233.43 USD. In addition to its full effectiveness in prophylaxis from rabies, PEP program saves the financial resources of the society, as well. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed performing PEP to be more cost-effective.",2014-XX-19191,24728746,J Res Health Sci,Nahid Hatam,2014,14 / 2,122-7,No,24728746,"Nahid Hatam; Firooz Esmaelzade; Alireza Mirahmadizadeh; Khosro Keshavarz; Abdolhalim Rajabi; Parvin Afsar Kazerooni; Marzieh Ataollahi; Cost-effectiveness of rabies post exposure prophylaxis in iran, J Res Health Sci, 2014 Spring; 14(2):2228-7795; 122-7",DALY,Iran,Not Stated,Immunization,"Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (intramuscular regimen, Essen) to prevent rabies vs. Standard/Usual Care",animal bite,Not Stated,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,", 1 year cost horizon",Not Stated,3.00,233.43,United States,2011,268.58
29058,Hypertension education and adherence in South Africa: a cost-effectiveness analysis of community health workers,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether training community health workers (CHWs) about hypertension in order to improve adherence to medications is a cost-effective intervention among community members in South Africa. METHODS: We used an established Markov model with age-varying probabilities of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events to assess the benefits and costs of using CHW home visits to increase hypertension adherence for individuals with hypertension and aged 25-74 in South Africa. Subjects considered for CHW intervention were those with a previous diagnosis of hypertension and on medications but who had not achieved control of their blood pressure. We report our results in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in US dollars per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: The annual cost of the CHW intervention is about $8 per patient. This would lead to over a 2% reduction in CVD events over a life-time and decrease DALY burden. Due to reductions in non-fatal CVD events, lifetime costs are only $6.56 per patient. The CHW intervention leads to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $320/DALY averted. At an annual cost of $6.50 or if the blood pressure reduction is 5 mmHg or greater per patient the intervention is cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: Additional training for CHWs on hypertension management could be a cost-effective strategy for CVD in South Africa and a very good purchase according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The intervention could also lead to reduced visits at the health centres freeing up more time for new patients or reducing the burden of an overworked staff at many facilities.",2014-99-16881,24606986,BMC Public Health,Thomas A Gaziano,2014,14 /,240,No,24606986,"Thomas A Gaziano; Melanie Bertram; Stephen M Tollman; Karen J Hofman; Hypertension education and adherence in South Africa: a cost-effectiveness analysis of community health workers, BMC Public Health, ; 14():1471-2458; 240",DALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,"Community health workers (CHW) visit patients twice yearly to increase hypertension adherence by monitoring blood pressure, teaching them about healthy lifestyle choices and encouraging follow-up visits vs. Standard/Usual Care",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,320,United States,2012,360.72

Before the widespread introduction of RTS,S vaccines, cost-effectiveness studies are needed to help inform governments in resource-poor settings about how best to prioritize between the new vaccine and existing malaria interventions. METHODS: A Markov model simulated malaria progression in a hypothetical Malawian birth cohort. Parameters were based on published data. Three strategies were compared: no intervention, vaccination at one year, and long-lasting, insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) at birth. Both health service and societal perspectives were explored. Health outcomes were measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted and costed in 2012 US$. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. Three times GDP per capita ($1,095) per DALY averted was used for a cost-effectiveness threshold, whilst one times GDP ($365) was considered ''very cost-effective''. RESULTS: From a societal perspective the vaccine strategy was dominant. It averted 0.11 more DALYs than LLINs and 0.372 more DALYs than the no intervention strategy per person, while costing $10.04 less than LLINs and $59.74 less than no intervention. From a health service perspective the vaccine''s ICER was $145.03 per DALY averted, and thus can be considered very cost-effective. The results were robust to changes in all variables except the vaccine and LLINs'' duration of efficacy. Vaccines remained cost-effective even at the lowest assumed efficacy levels of 49.6% (mild malaria) and 14.2% (severe malaria), and the highest price of $15. However, from a societal perspective, if the vaccine duration efficacy was set below 2.69 years or the LLIN duration of efficacy was greater than 4.24 years then LLINs became the more cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSION: The results showed that vaccinating Malawian children with RTS,S vaccines was very cost-effective from both a societal and a health service perspective. This result was robust to changes in most variables, including vaccine price and vaccine efficacy, but was sensitive to the duration of efficacy of the vaccine and LLINs.

29062,Cost-effectiveness of a potential group B streptococcal vaccine program for pregnant women in South Africa,"BACKGROUND: In low- and middle-income countries neonatal infections are important causes of infant mortality. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major pathogen. A GBS polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine, the only option that has the potential to prevent both early- and late-onset GBS disease, has completed Phase II trials. Screening-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for pregnant women, an effective strategy in high-income countries, is often not practical in these settings. Risk factor-based IAP (RFB-IAP) for women with risk factors at delivery has had limited success in preventing neonatal infection. We evaluated the cost and health impacts of maternal GBS vaccination in South Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a decision-analytic model for an annual cohort of pregnant women that simulates the natural history of GBS disease in their infants. We compared four strategies: doing nothing, maternal GBS vaccination, RFB-IAP, and vaccination plus RFB-IAP. Assuming vaccine efficacy varies from 50% to 90% against covered serotypes and 75% of pregnant women are vaccinated, GBS vaccination alone prevents 30-54% of infant GBS cases compared to doing nothing. For vaccine prices between $10 and $30, and mid-range efficacy, its cost ranges from $676 to $2390 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted ($US 2010), compared to doing nothing. RFB-IAP alone, compared to doing nothing, prevents 10% of infant GBS cases at a cost of $240/DALY. Vaccine plus RFB-IAP prevents 48% of cases at a cost of $664-2128/DALY. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination would substantially reduce the burden of infant GBS disease in South Africa and would be very cost-effective by WHO guidelines.

A GBS polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine, the only option that has the potential to prevent both early- and late-onset GBS disease, has completed Phase II trials. Screening-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for pregnant women, an effective strategy in high-income countries, is often not practical in these settings. Risk factor-based IAP (RFB-IAP) for women with risk factors at delivery has had limited success in preventing neonatal infection. We evaluated the cost and health impacts of maternal GBS vaccination in South Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a decision-analytic model for an annual cohort of pregnant women that simulates the natural history of GBS disease in their infants. We compared four strategies: doing nothing, maternal GBS vaccination, RFB-IAP, and vaccination plus RFB-IAP. Assuming vaccine efficacy varies from 50% to 90% against covered serotypes and 75% of pregnant women are vaccinated, GBS vaccination alone prevents 30-54% of infant GBS cases compared to doing nothing. For vaccine prices between $10 and $30, and mid-range efficacy, its cost ranges from $676 to $2390 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted ($US 2010), compared to doing nothing. RFB-IAP alone, compared to doing nothing, prevents 10% of infant GBS cases at a cost of $240/DALY. Vaccine plus RFB-IAP prevents 48% of cases at a cost of $664-2128/DALY. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination would substantially reduce the burden of infant GBS disease in South Africa and would be very cost-effective by WHO guidelines. RFB-IAP is also very cost-effective, but prevents only 10% of cases. Vaccination plus RFB-IAP is more effective and more costly than vaccination alone, and consistently very cost-effective.",2014-99-17027,24530145,Vaccine,Sun-Young Kim,2014,32 / 17,1954-63,Yes,24530145,"Sun-Young Kim; Louise B Russell; Jeehyun Park; Jennifer R Verani; Shabir A Madhi; Clare L Cutland; Stephanie J Schrag; Anushua Sinha; Cost-effectiveness of a potential group B streptococcal vaccine program for pregnant women in South Africa, Vaccine, ; 32(17):1873-2518; 1954-63",DALY,South Africa,Not Stated,"Immunization, Pharmaceutical",Maternal group B streptococcus (GBS) vaccination during routine antenatal clinic visits plus risk factor based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (RFB-IAP) during labor for women with risk factors for early-onset GBS disease (EOGBS) vs. Maternal group B streptococcus (GBS) vaccination administered during routine antenatal clinic visits,pregnant,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,596,United States,2010,707.39
29066,Cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in Denmark,"INTRODUCTION: Excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of many diseases and injuries, and the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study estimated that 6% of the burden of disease in Denmark is due to alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption thus places a considerable economic burden on society. METHODS: We analysed the cost-effectiveness of six interventions aimed at preventing alcohol abuse in the adult Danish population: 30% increased taxation, increased minimum legal drinking age, advertisement bans, limited hours of retail sales, and brief and longer individual interventions. Potential health effects were evaluated as changes in incidence, prevalence and mortality of alcohol-related diseases and injuries. Net costs were calculated as the sum of intervention costs and cost offsets related to treatment of alcohol-related outcomes, based on health care costs from Danish national registers. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each intervention. We also created an intervention pathway to determine the optimal sequence of interventions and their combined effects. RESULTS: Three of the analysed interventions (advertising bans, limited hours of retail sales and taxation) were cost-saving, and the remaining three interventions were all cost-effective. Net costs varied from euro -17 million per year for advertisement ban to euro 8 million for longer individual intervention. Effectiveness varied from 115 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) per year for minimum legal drinking age to 2,900 DALY for advertisement ban. The total annual effect if all interventions were implemented would be 7,300 DALY, with a net cost of euro -30 million. CONCLUSION: Our results show that interventions targeting the whole population were more effective than individual-focused interventions.

29072,The cost and cost-effectiveness of scaling up screening and treatment of syphilis in pregnancy: a model,"BACKGROUND: Syphilis in pregnancy imposes a significant global health and economic burden. More than half of cases result in serious adverse events, including infant mortality and infection. The annual global burden from mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis is estimated at 3.6 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and $309 million in medical costs. Syphilis screening and treatment is simple, effective, and affordable, yet, worldwide, most pregnant women do not receive these services. We assessed cost-effectiveness of scaling-up syphilis screening and treatment in existing antenatal care (ANC) programs in various programmatic, epidemiologic, and economic contexts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We modeled the cost, health impact, and cost-effectiveness of expanded syphilis screening and treatment in ANC, compared to current services, for 1,000,000 pregnancies per year over four years. We defined eight generic country scenarios by systematically varying three factors: current maternal syphilis testing and treatment coverage, syphilis prevalence in pregnant women, and the cost of healthcare. We calculated program and net costs, DALYs averted, and net costs per DALY averted over four years in each scenario. Program costs are estimated at $4,142,287 - $8,235,796 per million pregnant women (2010 USD). Net costs, adjusted for averted medical care and current services, range from net savings of $12,261,250 to net costs of $1,736,807. The program averts an estimated 5,754 - 93,484 DALYs, yielding net savings in four scenarios, and a cost per DALY averted of $24 - $111 in the four scenarios with net costs. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating MTCT of syphilis through expanded screening and treatment in ANC is likely to be highly cost-effective by WHO-defined thresholds in a wide range of settings. Countries with high prevalence, low current service coverage, and high healthcare cost would benefit most. Future analyses can be tailored to countries using local epidemiologic and programmatic data.",2014-99-15105,24489931,PLoS One,James G Kahn,2014,9 / 1,e87510,No,24489931,"James G Kahn; Aliya Jiwani; Gabriela B Gomez; Sarah J Hawkes; Harrell W Chesson; Nathalie Broutet; Mary L Kamb; Lori M Newman; The cost and cost-effectiveness of scaling up screening and treatment of syphilis in pregnancy: a model, PLoS One , ; 9(1):1932-6203; e87510",DALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Pharmaceutical, Screening",Expanded syphilis screening + treatment in existing antenatal care program vs. Standard/Usual Care,pregnant,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,111,United States,2010,131.75
29073,Reduced population burden of road transport-related major trauma after introduction of an inclusive trauma system,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the burden of road transport-related serious injury in Victoria, Australia, over a 10-year period, after the introduction of an integrated trauma system. BACKGROUND: Road traffic injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Efforts to improve care of the injured are important for reducing burden, but the impact of trauma care systems on burden and cost of road traffic injury has not been evaluated. METHODS: All road transport-related deaths and major trauma (injury severity score >12) cases were extracted from population-based coroner and trauma registry data sets for July 2001 to June 2011. Modeling was used to assess changes in population incidence rates and odds of in-hospital mortality. Disability-adjusted life years, combining years of life lost and years lived with disability, were calculated. Cost of health loss was calculated from estimates of the value of a disability-adjusted life year. RESULTS: Incidence of road transport-related deaths decreased (incidence rate ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-0.96), whereas the incidence of hospitalized major trauma increased (incidence rate ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.04). Years of life lost decreased by 43%, and years lived with disability increased by 32%, with an overall 28% reduction in disability-adjusted life years over the decade. There was a cost saving per case of A$633,446 in 2010-2011 compared with the 2001-2002 financial year. CONCLUSIONS: Since introduction of the trauma system in Victoria, Australia, the burden of road transport-related serious injury has decreased.

29074,Cost-effectiveness of integrated routine offering of prenatal HIV and syphilis screening in China,"BACKGROUND: In China, recent rises in syphilis and HIV cases have increased the focus on preventing mother-to-child transmission of these infections. We assess the health and economic outcomes of different strategies of prenatal HIV and syphilis screening from the local health department''s perspective. METHODS: A Markov cohort decision analysis model was used to estimate the health and economic outcomes of pregnancy using disease prevalence and cost data from local sources and, if unavailable, from published literature. Adverse pregnancy outcomes included induced abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight, neonatal death, congenital syphilis in live-born infants, and perinatal HIV infection. We examined 4 screening strategies: no screening, screening for HIV only, for syphilis only, and for both HIV and syphilis. We estimated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for each health outcome using life expectancies and infections for mothers and newborns. RESULTS: For a simulated cohort of 10,000 pregnant women (0.07% prevalence for HIV and 0.25% for syphilis; 10% of HIV-positives were coinfected with syphilis), the estimated costs per DALY prevented were as follows: syphilis-only, $168; HIV-and-syphilis, $359; and HIV-only, $5636. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio if an existing HIV-only strategy added syphilis screening (i.e., move from the HIV-only strategy to the HIV-and-syphilis strategy) was $140 per additional DALY prevented.

RESULTS: For a simulated cohort of 10,000 pregnant women (0.07% prevalence for HIV and 0.25% for syphilis; 10% of HIV-positives were coinfected with syphilis), the estimated costs per DALY prevented were as follows: syphilis-only, $168; HIV-and-syphilis, $359; and HIV-only, $5636. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio if an existing HIV-only strategy added syphilis screening (i.e., move from the HIV-only strategy to the HIV-and-syphilis strategy) was $140 per additional DALY prevented. CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing prevalence of syphilis and HIV among pregnant women in China, prenatal HIV screening programs that also include syphilis screening are likely to be substantially more cost-effective than HIV screening alone and prevent many more adverse pregnancy outcomes.",2014-99-17090,24413489,Sex Transm Dis,Kwame Jr Owusu-Edusei,2014,41 / 2,103-10,No,24413489,"Kwame Jr Owusu-Edusei; Guoyu Tao; Thomas L Gift; Ailing Wang; Linhong Wang; Ye Tun; Xiaoyu Wei; Liming Wang; Serena Fuller; Mary L Kamb; Marc Bulterys; Cost-effectiveness of integrated routine offering of prenatal HIV and syphilis screening in China, Sex Transm Dis, ; 41(2):0148-5717; 103-10",DALY,China,Not Stated,"Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Screening",Screening for syphilis vs. None,Pregnant,64 Years,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,168,United States,2010,199.4
29078,Cost-effectiveness of changes in alcohol taxation in Denmark: a modelling study,"INTRODUCTION: Excessive alcohol consumption is a public health problem in many countries including Denmark, where 6% of the burden of disease is due to alcohol consumption, according to the new estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study. Pricing policies, including tax increases, have been shown to effectively decrease the level of alcohol consumption. METHODS: We analysed the cost-effectiveness of three different scenarios of changed taxation of alcoholic beverages in Denmark (20% and 100% increase and 10% decrease). The lifetime health effects are estimated as the difference in disability-adjusted life years between a Danish population that continues to drink alcohol at current rates and an identical population that changes their alcohol consumption due to changes in taxation. Calculation of cost offsets related to treatment of alcohol-related diseases and injuries, was based on health care system costs from Danish national registers. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by calculating cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) compared to current practice. RESULTS: The two scenarios of 20% and 100% increased taxation could avert 20,000 DALY and 95,500 DALY respectively, and yield cost savings of -euro119 million and -euro575 million, over the life time of the Danish population. Both scenarios are thus cost saving. The tax decrease scenario would lead to 10,100 added DALY and an added cost of euro60 million. For all three interventions the health effects build up and reach their maximum around 15-20 years after implementation of the tax change. CONCLUSION: Our results show that decreased taxation will lead to an increased burden of disease and related increases in health care costs, whereas both a doubling of the current level of alcohol taxation and a scenario where taxation is only increased by 20% can be cost-saving ways to reduce alcohol related morbidity and mortality. Our results support the growing evidence that population strategies are cost-effective and should be considered for policy making and prevention of alcohol abuse.",2014-99-14987,24405884,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Astrid Ledgaard Holm,2014,12 / 1,1,Yes,24405884,"Astrid Ledgaard Holm; Lennert Veerman; Linda Cobiac; Ola Ekholm; Finn Diderichsen; Cost-effectiveness of changes in alcohol taxation in Denmark: a modelling study, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, ; 12(1):1478-7547; 1",DALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Legislation / Regulation,20% increase in taxation of alcoholic beverages vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,-5949.16,Euro,2009,-10001.33
29079,Cost-effectiveness of tenofovir gel in urban South Africa: model projections of HIV impact and threshold product prices,"BACKGROUND: There is urgent need for effective HIV prevention methods that women can initiate. The CAPRISA 004 trial showed that a tenofovir-based vaginal microbicide had significant impact on HIV incidence among women. This study uses the trial findings to estimate the population-level impact of the gel on HIV and HSV-2 transmission, and price thresholds at which widespread product introduction would be as cost-effective as male circumcision in urban South Africa. METHODS: The estimated 'per sex-act' HIV and HSV-2 efficacies were imputed from CAPRISA 004. A dynamic HIV/STI transmission model, parameterised and fitted to Gauteng (HIV prevalence of 16.9% in 2008), South Africa, was used to estimate the impact of gel use over 15 years. Uptake was assumed to increase linearly to 30% over 10 years, with gel use in 72% of sex-acts. Full economic programme and averted HIV treatment costs were modelled. Cost per DALY averted is estimated and a microbicide price that equalises its cost-effectiveness to that of male circumcision is estimated. RESULTS: Using plausible assumptions about product introduction, we predict that tenofovir gel use could lead to a 12.5% and 4.9% reduction in HIV and HSV-2 incidence respectively, by year 15. Microbicide introduction is predicted to be highly cost-effective (under $300 per DALY averted), though the dose price would need to be just $0.12 to be equally cost-effective as male circumcision. A single dose or highly effective (83% HIV efficacy per sex-act) regimen would allow for more realistic threshold prices ($0.25 and $0.33 per dose, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that an effective coitally-dependent microbicide could reduce HIV incidence by 12.5% in this setting, if current condom use is maintained. For microbicides to be in the range of the most cost-effective HIV prevention interventions, product costs will need to decrease substantially.",2014-01-00716,24405719,BMC Infect Dis,Fern Terris-Prestholt,2014,14 /,14,No,24405719,"Fern Terris-Prestholt; Anna M Foss; Andrew P Cox; Lori Heise; Gesine Meyer-Rath; Sinead Delany-Moretlwe; Thomas Mertenskoetter; Helen Rees; Peter Vickerman; Charlotte H Watts; Anna M.

29080,"Does a significant reduction in malaria risk make lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART cost-effective for children with HIV in co-endemic, low-resource settings?","BACKGROUND: HIV infection and malaria co-infection is not uncommon among children in co-endemic regions, and evidence suggests that HIV is a risk factor for severe malaria among children. HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are highly effective in pediatric HIV treatment regimens, however, their effectiveness against malaria has been mixed, with some PIs demonstrating in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum. Recent findings suggest lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based treatment regimens reduce the incidence of malaria infection by over 40% in pediatric HIV patients compared to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens. METHODS: We assessed whether a significant reduction in malaria risk makes LPV/r-based ART regimens cost-effective compared to NNRTI-based regimens in co-endemic, low-resource settings. We modeled the difference in unit cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) gained among two theoretical groups of HIV+ children under 5 years old receiving ART in a resource-limited setting co-endemic for malaria. The first group received standard NNRTI-based antiretrovirals, the second group received a standard regimen containing LPV/r. We used recent cohort data for the incidence reduction for malaria. Drug costs were taken from the 2011 Clinton Health Access Initiative Antiretroviral (ARV) ceiling price list. DALYs for HIV and malaria were derived from WHO estimates. RESULTS: Our model suggests a unit cost of US$147 per DALY gained for the LPV/r-based group compared to US$37 per DALY gained for the NNRTI-based group. CONCLUSION: In HIV and malaria co-endemic settings, considerations of PI cost effectiveness incorporating known reductions in malaria mortality suggest a nominal increase in DALYs gained for PIs over NNRTI-based regimens for HIV positive children under five on ART.

29090,Urban greenways have the potential to increase physical activity levels cost-effectively,"BACKGROUND: For many, physical activity has been engineered out of daily life, leading to high levels of sedentariness and obesity. Multi-faceted physical activity interventions, combining individual, community and environmental approaches, have the greatest potential to improve public health, but few have been evaluated. METHODS: Approximately 100,000 people may benefit from improved opportunities for physical activity through an urban regeneration project in Northern Ireland, the Connswater Community Greenway. Using the macro-simulation PREVENT model, we estimated its potential health impacts and cost-effectiveness. To do so, we modelled its potential impact on the burden from cardiovascular disease, namely, ischaemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and stroke, and colon and breast cancer, by the year 2050, if feasible increases in physical activity were to be achieved. RESULTS: If 10% of those classified as ''inactive'' (perform less than 150 minutes of moderate activity/week) became ''active'', 886 incident cases (1.2%) and 75 deaths (0.9%) could be prevented with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound4469/disability-adjusted life year. For effectiveness estimates as low as 2%, the intervention would remain cost-effective ( pound18 411/disability-adjusted life year). Small gains in average life expectancy and disability-adjusted life expectancy could be achieved, and the Greenway population would benefit from 46 less years lived with disability. CONCLUSION: The Greenway intervention could be cost-effective at improving physical activity levels. Although the direct health gains are predicted to be small for any individual, summed over an entire population, they are substantial.

Using data drawn from districts'' budget, expenditures and salary documents, UNICEF''s CHW planning and budgeting tool and a special purposive survey, an economic analysis of the June 2010 CHW''s provision of measles, vitamin A and deworming was conducted using activity-based costing combined with an ingredients approach. Total CHW costs were estimated to be US$5.7 million per round. Measles accounted for 57%, deworming 22% and vitamin A 21% of total costs. The cost per child was US$0.46. The additional supplies and personnel required to include measles increased total costs by 42%, but reduced the average costs of providing vitamin A and deworming alone, manifesting economies of scope. The average costs of covering larger, more urban populations was less than the cost of covering smaller, more dispersed populations. Provincial-level costs per child served were determined primarily by the number of service sites, not the number of children treated. Reliance on volunteers to provide 60% of CHW manpower enables expanding coverage, shortening the duration of CHWs and reduces costs by one-third. With costs of $1093 per life saved and $45 per disability-adjusted life-year saved, WHO criteria classify Zambia''s CHWs as ''very cost-effective''. The continued need for CHWs is discussed.",2012-99-10166,23242696,Health Policy Plan,John L Fiedler,2014,29 / 1,,No,23242696,"John L Fiedler; Freddie Mubanga; Ward Siamusantu; Mofu Musonda; Kabaso F Kabwe; Charles Zulu; Child Health Week in Zambia: costs, efficiency, coverage and a reassessment of need, Health Policy Plan, 2014 Jan; 29(1):0268-1080",DALY,Zambia,Not Stated,"Immunization, Pharmaceutical, Other","Child Health Weeks (CHWs)- semi annual, campaign-style, facility- and outreach-based events for provision of measles vaccination, vitamin A and deworming vs. None",Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,234,United States,2010,277.73
29092,Costs and Consequences of Using Interferon-gamma Release Assays for the Diagnosis of Active Tuberculosis in India,"BACKGROUND: There is growing concern that interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are being used off-label for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in many high-burden settings, including India, where the background prevalence of latent TB infection is high. We analyzed the costs and consequences of using IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India from the perspective of the Indian TB control sector. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed a decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost and effectiveness of IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India. We compared a reference scenario of clinical examination and non-microbiological tests against scenarios in which clinical diagnosis was augmented by the addition of either sputum smear microscopy, IGRA, or Xpert MTB/RIF. We examined costs (in 2013 US dollars) and consequences from the perspective of the Indian healthcare sector. Relative to sputum smear microscopy, use of IGRA for active TB resulted in 23,700 (95% uncertainty range, UR: 3,800 - 38,300) additional true-positive diagnoses, but at the expense of 315,700 (95% UR: 118,300 - 388,400) additional false-positive diagnoses and an incremental cost of US$49.3 million (95% UR: $34.9 - $58.0 million) (2.9 billion Indian Rupees). Relative to Xpert MTB/RIF (including the cost of treatment for drug resistant TB), use of IGRA led to 400 additional TB cases treated (95% UR: [-8,000] - 16,200), 370,600 (95% UR: 252,200 - 441,700) more false-positive diagnoses, 70,400 (95% UR: [-7,900] - 247,200) fewer disability-adjusted life years averted, and US$14.6 million (95%UR: [-$7.2] - $28.7 million) (854 million Indian Rupees) in additional costs. CONCLUSION: Using IGRAs for diagnosis of active TB in a setting like India results in tremendous overtreatment of people without TB, and substantial incremental cost with little gain in health. These results support the policies by WHO and Standards for TB Care in India, which discourage the use of IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India and similar settings.",2014-XX-18201,25918999,PLoS One,Kristen M Little,2014,10 / 4,e0124525,No,25918999,"Kristen M Little; Madhukar Pai; David W Dowdy; Costs and Consequences of Using Interferon-gamma Release Assays for the Diagnosis of Active Tuberculosis in India, PLoS One , 2014; 10(4):1932-6203; e0124525",DALY,India,Not Stated,Diagnostic,Clinical exam + sputum smear microscopy vs. Standard/Usual Care- clinical exam- chest x-ray & physical exam,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,22,United States,2013,24.44

29095,Cost-effectiveness of treatment and secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction in India: a modeling study,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the single largest cause of death in India, with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) accounting for one-third of all heart disease deaths. Although effective treatment is available for AMI, access to treatment is dictated by cost and ability to pay. With scarce treatment resources, healthcare decisions are guided by local cost-effectiveness, for which country-level data are lacking. OBJECTIVES: We calculate the cost-effectiveness of policies that expand the use of aspirin, injection streptokinase, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins for the treatment and secondary prevention of AMI in India. We also estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical polypill (combining aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins) for secondary prevention. METHODS: We conduct cost-effectiveness analyses of AMI treatment and secondary prevention for patients with previous coronary heart disease events in India. We estimate coronary heart disease events using Framingham risk scores and disease prevalence using a cohort ordinary differential model. Other parameter estimates are from the literature. Polypill treatment is assumed to cost less than the additive cost of all 4 oral medications, but it is not assumed to increase adherence. We conduct a Latin hypercube sampling sensitivity analysis on the model parameters. RESULTS: Increasing coverage of AMI treatment with aspirin and streptokinase would be cost-effective and could avert approximately 335,000 (191,000 to 503,000) disability-adjusted life years among 30- to 69-year-olds in India. Secondary prevention with aspirin and beta-blockers at 80% coverage (and at lower rates) would be highly cost-effective, and the addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors would also be cost-effective. Introducing the polypill dominates a strategy of a 4-drug regimen with the aforementioned drugs and statins. The cost-effectiveness ratio of 80% coverage with the polypill would be $1,690 ($1,220 to $2,410) per disability-adjusted life years averted. CONCLUSIONS: Policies expanding both treatment and preventive therapies are cost-effective, based on gross domestic product per capita comparison.
