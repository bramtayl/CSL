17801,Cost-Effectiveness of Thoracic Radiation Therapy for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Evidence From the Chest Radiotherapy Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Trial (CREST),"PURPOSE: The Chest Radiotherapy Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Trial (CREST) showed that adding thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) to the standard treatment (ST) paradigm of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation improves overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding TRT to ST in ES-SCLC patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing TRT plus ST versus ST alone. The base-case time horizon was 24 months, consistent with the maximum PFS reported in the CREST. Overall survival was partitioned into 2 health states: PFS and postprogression survival. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was estimated by fitting parametric probability distributions to the CREST survival data. Costs were from a US health care payer perspective, and utilities were derived from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty in key variables. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, adding TRT to ST was both cost saving and more effective, thereby strongly dominating ST alone. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000/QALY, $100,000/QALY, and $200,000/QALY, TRT was preferred 68%, 81%, and 96% of the time, respectively. In the lifetime scenario analysis, the TRT ICER increased to $194,726/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: By use of the actual follow-up interval reported in the CREST, adding TRT to ST strongly dominates a strategy of ST alone in ES-SCLC patients. Since the long-term survival benefit of TRT is small relative to ongoing costs of progressive metastatic disease, we estimate less favorable ICERs for TRT over a lifetime horizon.",2017-01-24444,29029885,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,Grace I Patrice,2017,/,,No,29029885,"Grace I Patrice; Nataniel H Lester-Coll; James B Yu; Jordan Amdahl; Thomas E Delea; Stephen J Patrice; Cost-Effectiveness of Thoracic Radiation Therapy for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Evidence From the Chest Radiotherapy Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Trial (CREST), Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2017 Jan 06; ():0360-3016",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thoracic radiation therapy plus Standard treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation,"WHO performance status of 0 to 2, and any response to 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"24 Months, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,-10979.6,United States,2016,-11839.83
17802,The Clinical and Economic Impact of Attaining National HIV/AIDS Strategy Treatment Targets in the United States,"Background: The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) aims for 72% (90% diagnosed times 80% of those virally suppressed) viral suppression among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 2020. We examined the clinical and economic impact of reaching this target, in the general US population and among black men who have sex with men (MSM), the group with the highest HIV prevalence. Methods: Using a mathematical simulation, we project the 5- and 20-year clinical outcomes, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for (1) Current Pace of detection, linkage, retention, and virologic suppression and (2) NHAS investments in expanded testing ($24-$74 per test) and adherence ($400 per person-year), calibrated to achieve 72% suppression by 2020. We examined alternative rates of testing, retention, and suppression and the efficacy and cost of adherence interventions. Results: Compared with Current Pace over 20 years, NHAS averted 280000 HIV transmissions (80000 in black MSM) and 199000 (45000) deaths and saved 2138000 (453000) years of life, while increasing costs by 23%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for NHAS compared with Current Pace was $68900 per quality-adjusted life-year ($38300 for black MSM) and was most sensitive to antiretroviral therapy costs.

17804,"The Cost-Effectiveness of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Testing and Treatment Engagement Initiatives in British Columbia, Canada: 2011-2013","Background: Recognition of the secondary preventive benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has mobilized global efforts to ''seek, test, treat and retain'' people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in HIV care. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of a set of HIV testing and treatment engagement interventions initiated in British Columbia (BC), Canada in 2011-2013. Methods: Using a previously-validated dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model, linked individual-level health administrative data for PLHIV and aggregate-level HIV testing data, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of primary care testing (hospital, emergency department, outpatient), ART initiation and ART retention initiatives, versus a counterfactual scenario approximating the status quo. HIV incidence, mortality, costs (in 2015$CDN), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. Analyses were executed over 5-25-year time horizons, from a government-payer perspective. Results: Emergency Department testing was the best value at $30,216 per QALY gained and had the greatest impact on incidence and mortality among PLHIV, while ART initiation provided the greatest QALY gains. The ART retention initiative was not cost-effective by international standards. Delivered in combination at the observed scale and sustained throughout the study period, we estimated a 12.8% reduction in cumulative HIV incidence and a 4.7% reduction in deaths among PLHIV at an incremental cost of $55,258 per QALY gained. Results were most sensitive to uncertainty in the number of undiagnosed PLHIV. Conclusions: HIV testing and ART initiation interventions were cost-effective, while the ART retention intervention was not.

17805,Cost-effectiveness of carfilzomib plus dexamethasone compared with bortezomib plus dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the United States,"BACKGROUND: We assessed the economic value of carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 and dexamethasone (Kd56) vs bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/RMM) using ENDEAVOR trial results. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of Kd56 vs Vd was assessed using a partitioned survival model by estimating progression-free survival, overall survival, and direct costs over a lifetime horizon. Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) survival data were extrapolated after matching registry and ENDEAVOR patients. Utilities were sourced from the literature and mapped from patient-reported quality of life in ENDEAVOR to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from life years (LYs). RESULTS: The model predicted an average gain of 1.66 LYs and 1.50 QALYs with Kd56 vs Vd, and lifetime additional costs of $182,699, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $121,828/QALY gained. The ICER was $114,793/QALY in patients with 1 prior treatment; $99,263/QALY in those not transplanted, and <$150,000/QALY up to an 85% discount in bortezomib price. CONCLUSIONS: Kd56 is cost-effective for patients with R/RMM at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY. Trial data in K-GEM may limit generalizability; however, SEER registry data mitigates this challenge.

17806,"Cost Effectiveness of Imatinib, Dasatinib, and Nilotinib as First-Line Treatment for Chronic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in China","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have obvious effects on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but they are expensive in China. Moreover, the overall cost of treatment of CML is high and the medical economic burden of patients with CML on the government is heavy. This study tested the cost effectiveness of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib as first-line treatment in Chinese patients who were first diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP). METHODS: A state-transition Markov model combining clinical effectiveness, utility, and cost data was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of the model outcomes. RESULTS: The imatinib-first, dasatinib-first, and nilotinib-first strategy offered patients 9.76, 9.87, and 9.72 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of US$303,502.42, US$381,681.03, and US$305,509.92 over 20 years, respectively. The nilotinib-first strategy exhibited the lowest utility and highest price and was thus eliminated. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of the imatinib-first strategy and the dasatinib-first strategy showed that the dasatinib-first strategy yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICER) of 710,714.64 $/QALY compared with the imatinib-first strategy, which exceeded the threshold; hence, the dasatinib-first strategy was not cost effective and was eliminated.

17808,A Tale of Two Health-Care Systems: Cost-Utility Analysis of Open Carpal Tunnel Release in Canada and the United States,"PURPOSE: Canadian health care is often criticized for extended wait times, whereas the United States suffers from increased costs. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the cost-utility of open carpal tunnel release in Canada versus the United States. METHODS: A prospective cohort study evaluated patients undergoing open carpal tunnel release at an institution in Canada and the United States. All costs from a societal perspective were captured. Utility was measured using validated health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scales-the EuroQol-5D and the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients at the Canadian site and 8 patients at the US site participated. Mean total costs were US $1581 +/- $1965 and $2179 (range: $1421-$2741) at the Canadian and US sites, respectively. Health-related quality of life demonstrated significant improvements following surgery (P < .05). Patient utilities preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively were 0.72 +/- 0.20, 0.86 +/- 0.11, and 0.83 +/- 0.16 at the Canadian site and 0.81 +/- 0.09, 0.86 +/- 0.10, and 0.86 +/- 0.12 at the US site. Improvements in HRQOL directly related to surgery were not significantly different between patients in Canada and the United States. American patients, however, attained improved HRQOL sooner due to shorter wait times (27 +/- 10 vs 214 +/- 119 days; P < .001). The incremental cost-utility of the US system was $7758/quality-adjusted life year gained compared to the Canadian system. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that these results were robust.

17809,A Markov Analysis of Screening for Late-Onset Cytomegalovirus Disease in Cytomegalovirus High-Risk Kidney Transplant Recipients,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Management strategies are unclear for late-onset cytomegalovirus infection occurring beyond 6 months of antiviral prophylaxis in cytomegalovirus high-risk (cytomegalovirus IgG positive to cytomegalovirus IgG negative) kidney transplant recipients. Hybrid strategies (prophylaxis followed by screening) have been investigated but with inconclusive results. There are clinical and potential cost benefits of preventing cytomegalovirus-related hospitalizations and associated increased risks of patient and graft failure. We used decision analysis to evaluate the utility of postprophylaxis screening for late-onset cytomegalovirus infection. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We used the Markov decision analysis model incorporating costs and utilities for various cytomegalovirus clinical states (asymptomatic cytomegalovirus, mild cytomegalovirus infection, and cytomegalovirus infection necessitating hospitalization) to estimate cost-effectiveness of postprophylaxis cytomegalovirus screening strategies. Five strategies were compared: no screening and screening at 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-week intervals. Progression to severe cytomegalovirus infection was modeled on cytomegalovirus replication kinetics. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as a ratio of cost difference between two strategies to difference in quality-adjusted life-years starting with the low-cost strategy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model''s robustness. RESULTS: There was an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years with increasing screening frequency. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $783 per quality-adjusted life-year (every 4 weeks over no screening), $1861 per quality-adjusted life-year (every 3 weeks over every 4 weeks), $10,947 per quality-adjusted life-year (every 2 weeks over every 3 weeks), and $197,086 per quality-adjusted life-year (weekly over every 2 weeks). Findings were sensitive to screening cost, cost of hospitalization, postprophylaxis cytomegalovirus incidence, and graft loss after cytomegalovirus infection. No screening was favored when willingness to pay threshold was <$14,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, whereas screening weekly was favored when willingness to pay threshold was >$185,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Screening every 2 weeks was the dominant strategy between willingness to pay range of $14,000-$185,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: In cytomegalovirus high-risk kidney transplant recipients, compared with no screening, screening for postprophylactic cytomegalovirus viremia is associated with gains in quality-adjusted life-years and seems to be cost effective.

17811,Cost-effectiveness of the pharmacist-assisted warfarin monitoring program at a Medical Center in Taiwan,"Objective: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of the first patient self-paying pharmacist-assisted warfarin monitoring (PAWM) program in Taiwan. Design: A Markov model with a 1-month cycle length and a 20-year time horizon was employed in this study. The model is composed of the following eight states: three no-event states (i.e. ''subtherapeutic,'' ''within therapeutic'' and ''supratherapeutic'' states), two serious adverse events (AEs) (i.e. bleeding and thromboembolism), two sequelae states and death. The likelihood of events, costs and utilities were derived from local databases and literature, if applicable. This study was conducted with a payer''s perspective and all costs were discounted with a rate of 3%. Setting: A pharmacist-led clinic. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of 10 000 participants. Intervention(s): PAWM versus usual care. Main outcome measure(s): Average quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and cost increments per patient, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: The PAWM program resulted in an average of 0.13 QALYs gained and a cost increment of NT$53 850 (US$1683) per patient. As the ICER (NT$410 749 [US$12 836]) was less than the gross domestic product per capita (NT$631 142 [US$19 723]), the PAWM was considered to be very cost-effective. The sensitivity analyses suggested that our result was robust and that the PAWM program had an 86% probability of being very cost-effective. Conclusions: Even if the costs saved from avoiding AEs were thought to be minimal due to the low-medical expenditures in Taiwan, the PAWM program was demonstrated to be economical.

17816,Cost-Effectiveness of Nivolumab in Recurrent Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent, metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (r/m HNSCC) are limited and prognosis is poor. The recent CheckMate 141 clinical trial demonstrated that nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody, was efficacious in extending the median overall survival (OS) in this patient population compared with standard therapies. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine whether nivolumab is a cost-effective treatment in this patient population and examined various subgroups to determine for which, if any, the treatment is more cost-effective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented a state transition model for HNSCC with a patient cohort who had tumor progression 6 months after the last dose of platinum-containing chemotherapy and compared the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab with docetaxel. Treatment effect estimates and adverse event rates were obtained from CheckMate 141. Costs, utilities, and other model inputs were gathered from published sources. We used a Canadian perspective, a 5-year time horizon, and a 1.5% discount rate for the analysis. RESULTS: Nivolumab extended mean OS by 4 months compared with docetaxel and resulted in fewer treatment-related adverse events, producing an incremental effectiveness of 0.13 quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The incremental cost of treatment with nivolumab was $18,823. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, nivolumab was not a cost-effective treatment option for r/m HNSCC, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $144,744/QALY. Nivolumab would be cost-effective if its price was reduced by 20%. Our subgroup analysis seemed to indicate that nivolumab might be cost-effective for tumors with expression of programmed death-ligand 1 >5%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that although nivolumab offers clinical benefit for the treatment of r/m HNSCC over current regimens, it is not cost-effective based on its list price. We have also established a value-based price estimate for nivolumab to be cost-effective in this patient population. Further study is required to draw a definitive conclusion on biomarkers for cost-effectiveness. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In health care settings in which cost considerations are a constraint on choice of therapy, patient selection should be carefully considered to maintain efficiency in the system. Until a biomarker for response to therapy is identified for nivolumab, this medication is unlikely to be cost-effective for most patients with recurrent, metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",2017-01-24468,29021380,Oncologist,Mahdi Zargar,2017,/,,No,29021380,"Mahdi Zargar; Thomas McFarlane; Kelvin K W Chan; William W L Wong; Cost-Effectiveness of Nivolumab in Recurrent Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Oncologist, 2017 May 09; ():1083-7159",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nivolumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Docetaxel,having tumor progression 6 months after last dose of platinum-containing chemotherapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,1.50,1.50,144744,Canada,2016,117969.95

We evaluated the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of testing among youth seen in communities with a high overall number of reported HCV cases. Methods: We developed a decision analytic model to project quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (2016 US $), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) associated with nine strategies for one-time testing among 15 to 30-year-olds seen at urban community health centers. Strategies differed in three ways: 1. Targeted vs. routine testing; 2. Rapid finger stick vs. standard venipuncture; 3. Ordered by physician vs. counselor/tester using standing orders. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) to evaluate uncertainty. Results: Compared to targeted risk-based testing (current standard of care), routine testing increased lifetime medical cost by $80 and discounted QALYs by 0.0013 per person. Across all strategies rapid testing provided higher QALYs at a lower cost per QALY gained, and was always preferred.

This study sought to assess whether the postoperative management should be based on biological therapy alone or combined with thiopurines and whether the therapy should be started immediately after surgery or guided by either endoscopic or clinical recurrence. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate expected health outcomes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in Canadian dollars (CAD$) accrued by hypothetical patients with high recurrence risk after ileocolic resection. Eight strategies of postoperative management were evaluated. A lifetime time horizon, an annual discount rate of 5%, a societal perspective, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 CAD$/QALY were assumed. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The model was validated against randomized trials and historical cohorts. RESULTS: Three strategies dominated the others: endoscopy-guided full step-up therapy (14.80 QALYs, CAD$ 462,180), thiopurines immediately post-surgery plus endoscopy-guided biological step-up therapy (14.89 QALYs, CAD$ 464,099) and combination therapy immediately post-surgery (14.94 QALYs, CAD$ 483,685). The second strategy was the most cost-effective, assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 CAD$/QALY.

This study sought to assess whether the postoperative management should be based on biological therapy alone or combined with thiopurines and whether the therapy should be started immediately after surgery or guided by either endoscopic or clinical recurrence. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate expected health outcomes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in Canadian dollars (CAD$) accrued by hypothetical patients with high recurrence risk after ileocolic resection. Eight strategies of postoperative management were evaluated. A lifetime time horizon, an annual discount rate of 5%, a societal perspective, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 CAD$/QALY were assumed. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The model was validated against randomized trials and historical cohorts. RESULTS: Three strategies dominated the others: endoscopy-guided full step-up therapy (14.80 QALYs, CAD$ 462,180), thiopurines immediately post-surgery plus endoscopy-guided biological step-up therapy (14.89 QALYs, CAD$ 464,099) and combination therapy immediately post-surgery (14.94 QALYs, CAD$ 483,685).

17827,Cost-effectiveness of nurse-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) compared to supportive listening (SL) for adjustment to multiple sclerosis,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) reduces distress in multiple sclerosis, and helps manage adjustment, but cost-effectiveness evidence is lacking. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted within a multi-centre trial. 94 patients were randomised to either eight sessions of nurse-led CBT or supportive listening (SL). Costs were calculated from the health, social and indirect care perspectives, and combined with additional quality-adjusted life years (QALY) or improvement on the GHQ-12 score, to explore cost-effectiveness at 12 months. RESULTS: CBT had higher mean health costs ( pound1610, 95% CI, - pound187 to 3771) and slightly better QALYs (0.0053, 95% CI, -0.059 to 0.103) compared to SL but these differences were not statistically significant. This yielded pound301,509 per QALY improvement, indicating that CBT is not cost-effective according to established UK NHS thresholds. The extra cost per patient improvement on the GHQ-12 scale was pound821 from the same perspective. Using a pound20,000, threshold, CBT in this format has a 9% probability of being cost effective. Although subgroup analysis of patients with clinical levels of distress at baseline showed an improvement in the position of CBT compared to SL, CBT was still not cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Nurse delivered CBT is more effective in reducing distress among MS patients compared to SL, but is highly unlikely to be cost-effective using a preference-based measure of health (EQ-5D). Results from a disease-specific measure (GHQ-12) produced comparatively lower Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios, but there is currently no acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold for this measure to guide decision-making.",2017-01-24475,29019158,Health Econ Rev,I Mosweu,2017,7 / 1,36,No,29019158,"I Mosweu; R Moss-Morris; L Dennison; T Chalder; P McCrone; Cost-effectiveness of nurse-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) compared to supportive listening (SL) for adjustment to multiple sclerosis, Health Econ Rev, 2017 Oct 10; 7(1):2191-1991; 36",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cognitive behavioral therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Supportive listening,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,301509,United Kingdom,2009,526656.75
17828,Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of Opportunistic Screening and Stepped-care Interventions for Older Alcohol Users in Primary Care,"Aims: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care intervention versus a minimal intervention for the treatment of older hazardous alcohol users in primary care. Method: Multi-centre, pragmatic RCT, set in Primary Care in UK. Patients aged >/= 55 years scoring >/= 8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test were allocated either to 5-min of brief advice or to ''Stepped Care'': an initial 20-min of behavioural change counselling, with Step 2 being three sessions of Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Step 3 referral to local alcohol services (progression between each Step being determined by outcomes 1 month after each Step). Outcome measures included average drinks per day, AUDIT-C, alcohol-related problems using the Drinking Problems Index, health-related quality of life using the Short Form 12, costs measured from a NHS/Personal Social Care perspective and estimated health gains in quality adjusted life-years measured assessed EQ-5D. Results: Both groups reduced alcohol consumption at 12 months but the difference between groups was small and not significant. No significant differences were observed between the groups on secondary outcomes. In economic terms stepped care was less costly and more effective than the minimal intervention. Conclusions: Stepped care does not confer an advantage over a minimal intervention in terms of reduction in alcohol use for older hazardous alcohol users in primary care. However, stepped care has a greater probability of being more cost-effective. Trial Registration: Current controlled trials ISRCTN52557360.

17830,Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with non-curative or palliative intent for hepatocellular carcinoma in the real-world setting,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presentation is heterogeneous necessitating a variety of therapeutic interventions with varying efficacies and associated prognoses. Poor prognostic patients often undergo non-curative palliative interventions including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), sorafenib, chemotherapy, or purely supportive care. The decision to pursue one of many palliative interventions for HCC is complex and an economic evaluation comparing these interventions has not been done. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of non-curative palliative treatment strategies such as TACE alone or TACE+sorafenib, sorafenib alone, and non-sorafenib chemotherapy compared with no treatment or best supportive care (BSC) among patients diagnosed with HCC between 2007 and 2010 in a Canadian setting. Using person-level data, we estimated effectiveness in life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) along with total health care costs (2013 US dollars) from the health care payer''s perspective (3% annual discount). A net benefit regression approach accounting for baseline covariates with propensity score adjustment was used to calculate incremental net benefit to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and uncertainty measures. Among 1,172 identified patients diagnosed with HCC, 4.5%, 7.9%, and 5.6%, received TACE alone or TACE+sorafenib, sorafenib, and non-sorafenib chemotherapy clone, respectively. Compared with no treatment or BSC (81.9%), ICER estimates for TACE alone or TACE+sorafenib was $6,665/QALY (additional QALY: 0.47, additional cost: $3,120; 95% CI: -$18,800-$34,500/QALY). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve demonstrated that if the relevant threshold was $50,000/QALY, TACE alone or TACE+sorafenib, non-sorafenib chemotherapy, and sorafenib alone, would have a cost-effectiveness probability of 99.7%, 46.6%, and 5.5%, respectively.

METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to compare TACE and TACE-sorafenib. Transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from systematic literature reviews, and costs were obtained from West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. Survival benefits were reported in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. Sensitive analysis was performed by varying potentially modifiable parameters of the model. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that TACE cost $26 951 and yielded survival of 0.71 QALYs, and TACE-sorafenib cost $44 542 and yielded survival of 1.02 QALYs in the entire treatment. The ICER of TACE-sorafenib versus TACE was $56 745 per QALY gained, which was above threshold for cost-effectiveness in China. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the major driver of ICER was the cost post TACE-sorafenib therapy with stable state. CONCLUSION: TACE is a more cost-effective strategy than TACE-sorafenib for the treatment of unresectable HCC.",2017-01-24487,28992881,Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int,Rong-Ce Zhao,2017,16 / 5,493-498,No,28992881,"Rong-Ce Zhao; Jing Zhou; Yong-Gang Wei; Fei Liu; Ke-Fei Chen; Qiu Li; Bo Li; Cost-effectiveness analysis of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with or without sorafenib for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int, 2017 Oct 15; 16(5):1499-3872; 493-498",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization-sorafenib vs. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,56745,United States,2015,61962.77
17834,Surgery and Radiotherapy for Symptomatic Spinal Metastases Is More Cost Effective Than Radiotherapy Alone: A Cost Utility Analysis in a U.K. Spinal Center,"BACKGROUND: Surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases is effective at prolonging ambulation and life, but it can appear costly at first glance. We have studied the difference between the cost of surgery and reimbursement received, and the cost-effectiveness of surgery in a U.K. tertiary referral spinal center. METHODS: A cost-versus-reimbursement and cost-utility analysis was performed in a prospective cohort of patients admitted for surgical treatment of spinal metastases. Outcome measures were health-related quality of life using the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L, Frankel score, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and treatment and reimbursement costs. RESULTS: One hundred thirty consecutive patients were prospectively recruited, of whom 92 had information available for cost and reimbursement comparison, and 100 had information to complete cost-utility analysis. Median cost of hospital treatment per patient was pound20,752; median reimbursement received was pound18,291, with a median shortfall of pound1,967. Surgery in addition to radiotherapy over a lifetime horizon was both more effective and less costly than radiotherapy alone, and therefore was found to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that reimbursement to hospitals for surgical management of symptomatic spinal metastases in the United Kingdom is broadly in line with costs, and that there was an overall saving as a result of community care costs being mitigated by patients walking for longer, which is within the expected National Health Service threshold.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of decolonization strategies to prevent SSIs. METHODS: We compared three decolonization strategies: universal decolonization (UD), all subjects treated; targeted decolonization (TD), only S aureus carriers treated; and no decolonization (ND). Decolonization included mupirocin, chlorhexidine, and vancomycin. We implemented a decision tree comparing the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of these strategies on SSI over a 1-year period for subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery from a US health sector perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to address the uncertainty in the variables. RESULTS: Universal decolonization was the dominant strategy because it resulted in reduced costs at near-equal QALYs compared with TD and ND. Compared with ND, UD decreased costs by $462 and increased QALYs by 0.002 per subject, whereas TD decreased costs by $205 and increased QALYs by 0.001 per subject. For 1,000 subjects, UD prevented 19 SSI and TD prevented 10 SSI compared with ND. Sensitivity analysis showed UD to be the most cost-effective strategy in more than 91% of simulations. For the 220,000 coronary artery bypass graft procedures performed yearly in the United States, UD would save $102 million whereas TD would save $45 million compared with ND.

17837,Cost-effectiveness of two-dose human papillomavirus vaccination in Singapore,"INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the tenth most common cancer and the eighth most frequent cause of death among women in Singapore. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the necessary cause of cervical cancer and therefore the risk of cervical cancer can be substantially reduced through vaccination. This study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two-dose HPV vaccination, as part of a national vaccination programme for 12-year-old girls in Singapore, from the perspective of the healthcare payer. METHODS: A lifetime Markov cohort model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine (AS04-HPV-16/18v) to the current cervical screening programme in Singapore. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of the AS04-HPV-16/18v was compared with the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (4vHPV). Model inputs were derived from local data, where possible, and validated by clinical experts in Singapore. RESULTS: Introduction of the AS04-HPV-16/18v in Singapore was shown to prevent 137 cervical cancer cases and 48 cervical cancer deaths when compared with screening alone. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SGD 12,645 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, which is cost-effective according to the World Health Organization threshold for Singapore. When discounted at 3%, AS04-HPV-16/18v was dominant over 4vHPV, with cost savings of SGD 80,559 and 28 additional QALYs gained. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, AS04-HPV-16/18v remained cost-effective compared with screening alone and dominant compared with 4vHPV.

17839,Cost-effective imaging for resectability of liver lesions in colorectal cancer: an economic decision model,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) compared with multiphase CE computed tomography (CE-CT) scan to characterize suspected liver lesions in patients with known colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: A decision analytic model linking diagnostic accuracy to health outcomes in patients with colorectal carcinoma was constructed. The model assumed that CE-MRI has superior sensitivity and equivalent specificity to CE-CT, and patients with a colorectal liver metastasis could be eligible for curative surgery or chemotherapy and palliation. Delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis was associated with worse health outcomes (disutility). Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost relative to the incremental benefit, the benefit was estimated using quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The clinical evidence supports increased sensitivity of CE-MRI compared with CE-CT (0.943 versus 0.768). CE-MRI was more effective and more costly than CE-CT. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be $40 548 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The model is most sensitive to the cost of MRI, cost of palliative treatment and the disutility associated with delayed palliative care. The results were also sensitive to the assumptions made about the clinical algorithm. CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence of the potential cost-effectiveness associated with CE-MRI for the diagnosis of liver metastases in patients with identified colorectal carcinoma. CE-MRI can be recommended as cost-effective provided it replaces CE-CT and that improved diagnostic accuracy results in earlier, curative, disease management.",2017-01-24511,28982209,ANZ J Surg,Sopany Saing,2017,/,,No,28982209,"Sopany Saing; Phil Haywood; Joanna K Duncan; Ning Ma; Alun L Cameron; Stephen Goodall; Cost-effective imaging for resectability of liver lesions in colorectal cancer: an economic decision model, ANZ J Surg, 2017 Oct 05; ():1445-1433",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE MRI) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CE CT),Patients with a suspicion of liver metastasis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,40548,Australia,2015,33303.87

METHODS: A mathematical model was developed to simulate the onset and progression of diabetic foot disease in patients with type 2 diabetes managed with optimal care and usual care. Clinical and utility data were obtained from the published literature. Direct medical costs and resource utilization in the Chinese healthcare setting were considered. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the effects of a range of variables and assumptions on the results. Heath benefits and costs were the outcome measures assessed. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, optimal care was a cost-saving option that exhibited lower costs with improved health benefits, including greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and reduced incidence of foot complications. The lifetime saving costs per additional QALY gained by optimal care were US$2015.

17841,Modeled Health Economic Impact of a Hypothetical Certolizumab Pegol Risk-Sharing Scheme for Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis in Finland,"PURPOSE: To model the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of certolizumab pegol (CZP) (with and without a hypothetical risk-sharing scheme at treatment initiation for biologic-naive patients) versus the current mix of reimbursed biologics for treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Finland. METHODS: A probabilistic model with 12-week cycles and a societal approach was developed for the years 2015-2019, accounting for differences in ACR responses (meta-analysis), mortality, and persistence. The risk-sharing scheme included a treatment switch and refund of the costs associated with CZP acquisition if patients failed to achieve ACR20 response at week 12. For the current treatment mix, ACR20 at week 24 determined treatment continuation. Quality-adjusted life years were derived on the basis of the Health Utilities Index. RESULTS: In the Finnish target population, CZP treatment with a risk-sharing scheme led to a estimated annual net expenditure decrease ranging from 1.7% in 2015 to 5.6% in 2019 compared with the current treatment mix. Per patient over the 5 years, CZP risk sharing was estimated to decrease the time without ACR response by 5%-units, decrease work absenteeism by 24 days, and increase the time with ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses by 5%-, 6%-, and 1%-units, respectively, with a gain of 0.03 quality-adjusted life years. The modeled risk-sharing scheme showed reduced costs of euro7866 per patient, with a more than 95% probability of cost-effectiveness when compared with the current treatment mix. CONCLUSION: The present analysis estimated that CZP, with or without the risk-sharing scheme, is a cost-effective alternative treatment for RA patients in Finland. The surplus provided by the CZP risk-sharing scheme could fund treatment for 6% more Finnish RA patients.

17842,Costs and Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy versus Standard Breast Cancer Support Group for Women with Cancer,"BACKGROUND: The results of several studies have demonstrated that women and men with a cancer diagnosis benefit from interventions to reduce distress and improve quality of life (QOL). However, little is known about the costs and effectiveness of such interventions. Identifying a stress-reduction program that is low cost and effective is important for payers, employers, and healthcare professionals, as well as for patients with cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the direct costs and effectiveness of the mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) program compared with the cost and effectiveness of a breast cancer support group (BCSG). METHODS: This economic pilot study evaluated the direct costs and effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention for stress reduction in patients with breast cancer who are receiving care versus the cost of a usual care support group used as the comparator. The cost variables for each cohort included the cost of program delivery (ie, staff and supplies), mileage reimbursements, medication costs, and healthcare utilization costs. Effectiveness was measured by a change in quality-adjusted life-year derived from the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) QOL battery. RESULTS: Overall, the cost for 191 participants in the MBAT intervention group was $992.49 per participant compared with $562.71 per participant for the BCSG intervention. Both interventions achieved a similar change in healthcare utilization based on the SF-36 QOL battery. Although the MBAT intervention was more costly than a BCSG intervention, sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of the MBAT intervention could achieve parity with that of a BCSG if some intervention-related costs, such as staff time and supplies, were reduced. CONCLUSION: As psychosocial cancer care becomes more refined with time, it will be important to determine the best and most cost-effective interventions for patients with cancer, particularly in light of healthcare reform. Information from this study could help inform payers, employers, and other stakeholders regarding which interventions would be least costly and most effective for patients with cancer.",2017-01-24534,28975012,Am Health Drug Benefits,Katherine M Prioli,2017,10 / 6,288-295,No,28975012,"Katherine M Prioli; Laura T Pizzi; Kathryn M Kash; Andrew B Newberg; Anna Marie Morlino; Michael J Matthews; Daniel A Monti; Costs and Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy versus Standard Breast Cancer Support Group for Women with Cancer, Am Health Drug Benefits, 2017 Sep; 10(6):1942-2962; 288-295",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mindfulness-based Art Therapy (MBAT) vs. Breast Cancer Support Group,Not Stated,Not Stated,55 Years,Female,Full,9 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2011,Not Stated
17843,Cost-effectiveness of a risk-stratified approach to cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillators (high versus low) at the time of generator change,"OBJECTIVE: Responders to cardiac resynchronisation therapy whose device has a defibrillator component and who do not receive a therapy in the lifetime of the first generator have a very low incidence of appropriate therapy after box change. We investigated the cost implications of using a risk stratification tool at the time of generator change resulting in these patients being reimplanted with a resynchronisation pacemaker. METHODS: A decision tree was created using previously published data which had demonstrated an annualised appropriate defibrillator therapy risk of 2.33%. Costs were calculated at National Health Service (NHS) national tariff rates (2016-2017). EQ-5D utility values were applied to device reimplantations, admissions and mortality data, which were then used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 5 years. RESULTS: At 5 years, the incremental cost of replacing a resynchronisation defibrillator device with a second resynchronisation defibrillator versus resynchronisation pacemaker was pound5045 per patient. Incremental QALY gained was 0.0165 (defibrillator vs pacemaker), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound305 712 per QALYs gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in an ICER of pound313 612 (defibrillator vs pacemaker). For reimplantation of all patients with a defibrillator rather than a pacemaker to yield an ICER of less than pound30 000 per QALY gained (current NHS cut-off for approval of treatment), the annual arrhythmic event rate would need to be 9.3%. The budget impact of selective replacement was a saving of pound2 133 985 per year. CONCLUSIONS: Implanting low-risk patients with a resynchronisation defibrillator with the same device at the time of generator change is not cost-effective by current NHS criteria.

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of POM-d, DARA, and CAR in this patient population from a US payer''s perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate the cost and health outcomes over a 3-year time horizon in 3 health states: progression-free, post-progression, and death. The main efficacy data source was a matching-adjusted indirect comparison using data from the aforementioned studies. Direct medical costs were considered, including: treatment acquisition and administration (initial line and subsequent line), pre- and post-medication, prophylaxis treatment, adverse event management, and health care resource utilization. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. A scenario analysis that assumed equal efficacy across all 3 treatments was conducted. Costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated and discounted at 3% per annum. FINDINGS: Over 3 years, the use of POM-d was associated with similar life-years and quality-adjusted life-years gained compared with DARA and CAR (incremental: life-years, +0.02 and +0.07, respectively; quality-adjusted life-years, +0.01 and +0.05), and with a cost less than that of DARA (-$8,919) and similar to that of CAR (-$195). Sensitivity analyses illustrated that the results were sensitive to progression-free survival, treatment duration, and drug costs. An equal efficacy scenario resulted in cost-savings relative to those of both DARA and CAR (-$11,779 and -$12,595).

The main efficacy data source was a matching-adjusted indirect comparison using data from the aforementioned studies. Direct medical costs were considered, including: treatment acquisition and administration (initial line and subsequent line), pre- and post-medication, prophylaxis treatment, adverse event management, and health care resource utilization. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. A scenario analysis that assumed equal efficacy across all 3 treatments was conducted. Costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated and discounted at 3% per annum. FINDINGS: Over 3 years, the use of POM-d was associated with similar life-years and quality-adjusted life-years gained compared with DARA and CAR (incremental: life-years, +0.02 and +0.07, respectively; quality-adjusted life-years, +0.01 and +0.05), and with a cost less than that of DARA (-$8,919) and similar to that of CAR (-$195). Sensitivity analyses illustrated that the results were sensitive to progression-free survival, treatment duration, and drug costs. An equal efficacy scenario resulted in cost-savings relative to those of both DARA and CAR (-$11,779 and -$12,595). IMPLICATIONS: POM-d may be a cost-effective treatment option relative to DARA or CAR in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM in the US.",2017-01-24547,28967482,Clin Ther,Christopher G Pelligra,2017,39 / 10,1986-2005.e5,Yes,28967482,"Christopher G Pelligra; Kejal Parikh; Shien Guo; Conor Chandler; Jorge Mouro; Safiya Abouzaid; Sikander Ailawadhi; Cost-effectiveness of Pomalidomide, Carfilzomib, and Daratumumab for the Treatment of Patients with Heavily Pretreated Relapsed-refractory Multiple Myeloma in the United States, Clin Ther, 2017 Oct; 39(10):1879-114X; 1986-2005.e5",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pomalidomide pluslow-dosedexamethasone vs. Carfilzomib monotherapy,Heavily pre-treated patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,-3900,United States,2016,-4205.56
17846,Cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab and docetaxel as a first-line treatment for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To provide perspective for the National Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB), we determined the cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab and docetaxel (TDP) versus trastuzumab and docetaxel (TD) as a first-line treatment for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: We used a Markov model to simulate cost-effectiveness, disease progression, and survival, based on clinical data and transition probabilities extracted from the CLEOPATRA study. Direct medical costs were acquired from the NHIB claims database.The utilities in health state were based on a recent cost-effectiveness study on trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs in New Taiwan dollars (NT$), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We performed one-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of specific parameters on the model. RESULTS: Modeled median survival was 39.1 months for TD and 50.1 months for TDP. The ICER was NT$18,999,687 (US$593,741) per QALY gained. The sensitivity analyses indicated that TDP could be cost-effective under favorable assumptions; TDP had a 68% chance of being cost-effective, if TDP costs could be reduced with 10% in the stable disease state. CONCLUSION: Our model predicted that TDP would be cost-effective as a first-line treatment for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer, but only under favorable drug cost assumptions.",2017-01-24551,28965422,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,Henry W C Leung,2017,/,1-7,No,28965422,"Henry W C Leung; Agnes L F Chan; Chih-Hsin Muo; John Hang Leung; Cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab and docetaxel as a first-line treatment for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer, Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res, 2017 Apr 28; ():1744-8379; 1-7",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel vs. Trastuzumab and docetaxel (TD),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,18999686.6,Taiwan,2016,634726.56
17847,Cost Effectiveness of Age-Specific Screening Intervals for People With Family Histories of Colorectal Cancer,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) decreases with age among individuals with a family history of CRC. However, no screening recommendations specify less frequent screening with increasing age. We aimed to determine whether such a refinement would be cost effective. METHODS: We determined the relative risk for CRC for individuals based on age and number of affected first-degree relatives (FDRs) using data from publications. For each number of affected FDRs, we used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model to estimate costs and effects of colonoscopy screening strategies with different age ranges and intervals. Screening was then optimized sequentially, starting with the youngest age group, and allowing the interval of screening to change at certain ages. Strategies with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio below $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year were considered cost effective. RESULTS: For people with 1 affected FDR (92% of those with a family history), screening every 3 years beginning at an age of 40 years is most cost effective. If no adenomas are found, the screening interval can gradually be extended to 5 and 7 years, at ages 45 and 55 years, respectively. From a cost-effectiveness perspective, individuals with more affected FDRs should start screening earlier and at shorter intervals. However, frequency can be reduced if no abnormalities are found.

17852,Cost-Utility of Elbasvir/Grazoprevir in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1 Infection,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimens compared with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir +/- ribavirin (3D +/- RBV), and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype (GT) 1 infection. METHODS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was constructed to evaluate the cost-utility of EBR/GZR +/- RBV over a lifetime time horizon from the payer perspective. The target population was patients infected with chronic hepatitis C GT1 subtypes a or b (GT1a or GT1b), stratified by treatment history (treatment-naive [TN] or treatment-experienced), presence of cirrhosis, baseline hepatitis C virus RNA (< or >/=6 million IU/mL), and presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants. The primary outcome was incremental cost-utility ratio for EBR/GZR +/- RBV versus available oral direct-acting antiviral agents. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: EBR/GZR +/- RBV was economically dominant versus LDV/SOF in all patient populations. EBR/GZR +/- RBV was also less costly than SOF/VEL and 3D +/- RBV, but produced fewer quality-adjusted life-years in select populations. In the remaining populations, EBR/GZR +/- RBV was economically dominant. One-way sensitivity analyses showed varying sustained virologic response rates across EBR/GZR +/- RBV regimens, commonly impacted model conclusions when lower bound values were inserted, and at the upper bound resulted in dominance over SOF/VEL in GT1a cirrhotic and GT1b TN noncirrhotic patients. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that EBR/GZR +/- RBV was cost-effective in more than 99% of iterations in GT1a and GT1b noncirrhotic patients and more than 69% of iterations in GT1b cirrhotic patients.

METHODS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was constructed to evaluate the cost-utility of EBR/GZR +/- RBV over a lifetime time horizon from the payer perspective. The target population was patients infected with chronic hepatitis C GT1 subtypes a or b (GT1a or GT1b), stratified by treatment history (treatment-naive [TN] or treatment-experienced), presence of cirrhosis, baseline hepatitis C virus RNA (< or >/=6 million IU/mL), and presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants. The primary outcome was incremental cost-utility ratio for EBR/GZR +/- RBV versus available oral direct-acting antiviral agents. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: EBR/GZR +/- RBV was economically dominant versus LDV/SOF in all patient populations.

METHODS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was constructed to evaluate the cost-utility of EBR/GZR +/- RBV over a lifetime time horizon from the payer perspective. The target population was patients infected with chronic hepatitis C GT1 subtypes a or b (GT1a or GT1b), stratified by treatment history (treatment-naive [TN] or treatment-experienced), presence of cirrhosis, baseline hepatitis C virus RNA (< or >/=6 million IU/mL), and presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants. The primary outcome was incremental cost-utility ratio for EBR/GZR +/- RBV versus available oral direct-acting antiviral agents. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: EBR/GZR +/- RBV was economically dominant versus LDV/SOF in all patient populations.

17876,Evaluation of a Stratified National Breast Screening Program in the United Kingdom: An Early Model-Based Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the incremental costs and consequences of stratified national breast screening programs (stratified NBSPs) and drivers of relative cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A decision-analytic model (discrete event simulation) was conceptualized to represent four stratified NBSPs (risk 1, risk 2, masking [supplemental screening for women with higher breast density], and masking and risk 1) compared with the current UK NBSP and no screening. The model assumed a lifetime horizon, the health service perspective to identify costs ( pound, 2015), and measured consequences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Multiple data sources were used: systematic reviews of effectiveness and utility, published studies reporting costs, and cohort studies embedded in existing NBSPs. Model parameter uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The base-case analysis, supported by probabilistic sensitivity analysis, suggested that the risk stratified NBSPs (risk 1 and risk-2) were relatively cost-effective when compared with the current UK NBSP, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of pound16,689 per QALY and pound23,924 per QALY, respectively. Stratified NBSP including masking approaches (supplemental screening for women with higher breast density) was not a cost-effective alternative, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of pound212,947 per QALY (masking) and pound75,254 per QALY (risk 1 and masking). When compared with no screening, all stratified NBSPs could be considered cost-effective.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model (discrete event simulation) was conceptualized to represent four stratified NBSPs (risk 1, risk 2, masking [supplemental screening for women with higher breast density], and masking and risk 1) compared with the current UK NBSP and no screening. The model assumed a lifetime horizon, the health service perspective to identify costs ( pound, 2015), and measured consequences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Multiple data sources were used: systematic reviews of effectiveness and utility, published studies reporting costs, and cohort studies embedded in existing NBSPs.

17885,Cost-Utility of Partially Implantable Active Middle Ear Implants for Sensorineural Hearing Loss: A Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Partially implantable active middle ear implants (aMEIs) offer a solution for individuals who have mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss and an outer ear medical condition that precludes the use of hearing aids. When otherwise left untreated, individuals report a lower quality of life, which may further decrease with increasing disability. In the lack of cost-effectiveness studies and long-term data, there is a need for decision modeling. OBJECTIVE: To explore individual-level variance in resource utilization patterns following aMEI implantation. METHODS: A Markov model was developed and analyzed as microsimulation to estimate the incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) of partially implantable aMEIs compared with no (surgical) intervention in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss and an outer ear medical condition in Australia. Cost data were derived mostly from the Medicare Benefit Schedule and effectiveness data from published literature. A third-party payer perspective was adopted, and a 5% discount rate was applied over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Compared with baseline strategy, aMEIs yielded an incremental cost of Australian dollars (AUD) 13,339.18, incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 1.35, and an ICUR of AUD 9,913.72/QALY. Of the respective number of simulated patients who visited each health state, 75.73% never had a minor adverse event, 99.82% did not experience device failure, and 97.75% did not cease to use their aMEIs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed the ICUR to differ by only 0.95%.

17886,Cost Effectiveness of Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma Treatment in Portugal,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab in treating patients with ipilimumab-naive advanced melanoma in Portugal. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to analyze the costs and consequences of treatment with pembrolizumab compared to treatment with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma not previously treated with ipilimumab. The model was parameterized by using data from a head-to-head phase III randomized clinical trial, KEYNOTE-006. Extrapolation of long-term outcomes was based on approaches previously applied, combining ipilimumab data and melanoma patients'' registry data. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service, and a lifetime horizon (40 years) was used. Portugal-specific disease management costs were estimated by convening a panel of six clinical experts to derive health state resource use and multiplying the results by national unit costs. To test for the robustness of the conclusions, we conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Pembrolizumab increases life expectancy in 1.57 undiscounted life-years (LYs) and is associated with an increase in costs versus that of ipilimumab. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is euro47,221 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and euro42,956 per LY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to the change of most input values or assumptions and were sensitive to time on treatment scenarios. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis performed, pembrolizumab is associated with a cost per QALY gained inferior to euro50,000 in 75% of the cases.

17887,Cost-Utility Analysis of Extending Public Health Insurance Coverage to Include Diabetic Retinopathy Screening by Optometrists,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss and blindness in Canada. Eye examinations play an important role in early detection. However, DR screening by optometrists is not always universally covered by public or private health insurance plans. This study assessed whether expanding public health coverage to include diabetic eye examinations for retinopathy by optometrists is cost-effective from the perspective of the health care system. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis of extended coverage for diabetic eye examinations in Prince Edward Island to include examinations by optometrists, not currently publicly covered. We used a Markov chain to simulate disease burden based on eye examination rates and DR progression over a 30-year time horizon. Results were presented as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Extending public health coverage to eye examinations by optometrists was associated with higher costs ($9,908,543.32) and improved QALYs (156,862.44), over 30 years, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1668.43/QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential determinants of the results were the cost of optometric screening and selected utility scores. At the commonly used threshold of $50,000/QALY, the probability that the new policy was cost-effective was 99.99%. CONCLUSIONS: Extending public health coverage to eye examinations by optometrists is cost-effective based on a commonly used threshold of $50,000/QALY.

17888,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Natriuretic Peptide Testing and Specialist Management in Patients with Suspected Acute Heart Failure,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of natriuretic peptide (NP) testing and specialist outreach in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) residing off the cardiology ward. METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for patients presenting to hospital with suspected AHF. We examined diagnostic workup with and without the NP test in suspected new cases, and we examined the impact of specialist heart failure outreach in all suspected cases. Inputs for the model were derived from systematic reviews, the UK national heart failure audit, randomized controlled trials, expert consensus from a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline development group, and a national online survey. The main benefit from specialist care (cardiology ward and specialist outreach) was the increased likelihood of discharge on disease-modifying drugs for people with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which improve mortality and reduce re-admissions due to worsened heart failure (associated with lower utility).

17892,Cost-effectiveness analysis of telotristat ethyl for treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea inadequately controlled with somatostatin analogs,"AIMS: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telotristat ethyl (TE) added to somatostatin analog octreotide (SSA + TE) compared to octreotide alone (SSA) in patients with carcinoid syndrome diarrhea (CSD) whose symptoms remain uncontrolled with SSA alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deterministic Markov model evaluated the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained with SSA + TE vs SSA per a third-party US payer perspective. The model reflected clinical practice and resource use estimates based on current standards of care, with utility estimates based on similar symptoms from ulcerative colitis. Treatment efficacy was based on the phase III clinical trial of SSA + TE vs SSA alone [TELESTAR, NCT01677910]. According to TELESTAR, 44% of SSA + TE and 20% of SSA patients responded to therapy after 12 weeks. At each 4-week assessment period, SSA patients not adequately controlled received increasing doses of SSA and SSA + TE patients discontinued TE and moved to SSA only. Drug costs for adequately and not adequately controlled patients were $4,291.75 and $5,890.57 for SSA, respectively, and $9,456.07 and $5,890.57 for SSA + TE, respectively. RESULTS: The base-case analysis demonstrated lifetime QALYs of 1.67 at a cost of $495,125 for the SSA cohort and 2.33 ($590,087) for SSA + TE with an incremental QALY for SSA + TE of 0.66 for an additional $94,962. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $142,545. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated high probability (>99%) of SSA + TE being cost-effective at thresholds for rare diseases and orphan drugs of $300,000-$450,000. LIMITATIONS: The recent availability of TE precluded the incorporation of clinical and economic inputs based on real-world practice patterns. The scarcity of epidemiology and utility information for this rare condition required the use of some proxy estimates.

17893,Cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction,"BACKGROUND: Sacubitril/valsartan reduces cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF). However, decision-makers need to determine whether its benefits are worth the additional costs, given the low-cost generic status of traditional standard of care. AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project clinical and economic outcomes of sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril for 66-year-old patients with HF over 10 years. Key health states included New York Heart Association classes I-IV and deaths; patients in each state incurred a monthly risk of hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death. Sacubitril/valsartan benefits were modeled by applying the hazard ratios (HRs) in PARADIGM-HF trial to baseline probabilities. Primary model outcomes were total and incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for sacubitril/valsartan relative to enalapril Results: Compared to enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with an ICER of SGD 74,592 (USD 55,198) per QALY gained. A major driver of cost-effectiveness was the cardiovascular mortality benefit of sacubitril/valsartan. The uncertainty of this treatment benefit in the Asian sub-group was tested in sensitivity analyses using a HR of 1 as an upper limit, where the ICERs ranged from SGD 41,019 (USD 30,354) to SGD 1,447,103 (USD 1,070,856) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed the probability of sacubitril/valsartan being cost-effective was below 1%, 12%, and 71% at SGD 20,000, SGD 50,000, and SGD 100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: At the current daily price sacubitril/valsartan may not represent good value for limited healthcare dollars compared to enalapril in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in HF in the Singapore healthcare setting.

17894,Cost effectiveness analysis of HLA-B*58:01 genotyping prior to initiation of allopurinol for gout,"Objective: To determine whether prospective testing for HLA-B*58:01, as a strategy to prevent serious adverse reactions to allopurinol in patients with gout, is cost-effective from the perspective of the National Health Service in the UK. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association of HLA-B*58:01 with cutaneous and hypersensitivity adverse drug reactions informed a decision analytic and Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes associated with testing vs standard care (with febuxostat prescribed for patients who test positive). Scenario analyses assessed alternative treatment assumptions and patient populations. Results: The number of patients needed to test to prevent one case of adverse drug reaction was 11 286 (95% central range (CR): 2573, 53 594). Cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains were small, pound103 (95% CR: pound98, pound106) and 0.0023 (95% CR: -0.0006, 0.0055), respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound44 954 per QALY gained. The probability of testing being cost-effective at a threshold of pound30 000 per QALY was 0.25. Reduced costs of testing or febuxostat resulted in an ICER below pound30 000 per QALY gained. The ICER for patients with chronic renal insufficiency was pound38 478 per QALY gained. Conclusion: Routine testing for HLA-B*58:01 in order to reduce the incidence of adverse drug reactions in patients being prescribed allopurinol for gout is unlikely to be cost-effective in the UK; however testing is expected to become cost-effective with reductions in the cost of genotyping, and with the future availability of cheaper, generic febuxostat.",2017-01-24579,28957559,Rheumatology (Oxford),Catrin O Plumpton,2017,56 / 10,1729-1739,No,28957559,"Catrin O Plumpton; Ana Alfirevic; Munir Pirmohamed; Dyfrig A Hughes; Cost effectiveness analysis of HLA-B*58:01 genotyping prior to initiation of allopurinol for gout, Rheumatology (Oxford), 2017 Oct 01; 56(10):1462-0324; 1729-1739",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genotyping prior to initiation of urate lowering therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard care (Prescription of allopurinol),Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,44954,United Kingdom,2014,81013.73
17895,Cost-effectiveness of neighbourhood slow zones in New York City,"BACKGROUND: Neighbourhood slow zones (NSZs) are areas that attempt to slow traffic via speed limits coupled with other measures (eg, speed humps). They appear to reduce traffic crashes and encourage active transportation. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NSZs in New York City (NYC), which implemented them in 2011. METHODS: We examined the effectiveness of NSZs in NYC using data from the city''s Department of Transportation in an interrupted time series analysis. We then conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo analyses were conducted to test error in the model. RESULTS: After 2011, road casualties in NYC fell by 8.74% (95% CI 1.02% to 16.47%) in the NSZs but increased by 0.31% (95% CI -3.64% to 4.27%) in the control neighbourhoods. Because injury costs outweigh intervention costs, NSZs resulted in a net savings of US$15 (95% credible interval: US$2 to US$43) and a gain of 0.002 of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY, 95% credible interval: 0.001 to 0.006) over the lifetime of the average NSZ resident relative to no intervention. Based on the results of Monte Carlo analyses, there was a 97.7% chance that the NSZs fall under US$50 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: While additional causal models are needed, NSZs appeared to be an effective and cost-effective means of reducing road casualties.

17896,Cost-Effectiveness of Golimumab in Ankylosing Spondylitis from the UK Payer Perspective,"INTRODUCTION: Golimumab is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor for treatment of patients with severe, active ankylosing spondylitis. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of golimumab compared with conventional care and other TNF-alpha inhibitors in treatment of AS from the UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A long-term Markov model (with initial decision tree) was developed to simulate the progression of a hypothetical cohort of patients with active AS over a lifetime. The effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Utilities were estimated by mapping Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index scores, and the primary response measure was >/=50% improvement on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index at 12 weeks. Direct, medication, and AS management costs were included. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: All TNF-alpha inhibitors were comparable to each other and superior to conventional care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for TNF-alpha inhibitors were pound19,070-42,532 per QALY gained compared with conventional care. Analyses of the ICERs for each TNF-alpha inhibitor compared with conventional care demonstrated that golimumab was the most cost-effective treatment, and that adalimumab and etanercept were dominated by golimumab. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab may be considered a cost-effective treatment alternative for patients with active AS.

Utilities were estimated by mapping Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index scores, and the primary response measure was >/=50% improvement on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index at 12 weeks. Direct, medication, and AS management costs were included. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: All TNF-alpha inhibitors were comparable to each other and superior to conventional care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for TNF-alpha inhibitors were pound19,070-42,532 per QALY gained compared with conventional care. Analyses of the ICERs for each TNF-alpha inhibitor compared with conventional care demonstrated that golimumab was the most cost-effective treatment, and that adalimumab and etanercept were dominated by golimumab. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab may be considered a cost-effective treatment alternative for patients with active AS. With comparable costs and efficacy among TNF-alpha inhibitors, the choice of TNF-alpha inhibitor to treat AS is likely to be driven by patient and physician choice.
