14701,Cost-effectiveness of rapid hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and simultaneous rapid HCV and HIV testing in substance abuse treatment programs,"AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rapid hepatitis C virus (HCV) and simultaneous HCV/HIV antibody testing in substance abuse treatment programs. DESIGN: We used a decision analytic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of no HCV testing referral or offer, off-site HCV testing referral, on-site rapid HCV testing offer and on-site rapid HCV and HIV testing offer. Base case inputs included 11% undetected chronic HCV, 0.4% undetected HIV, 35% HCV co-infection among HIV-infected, 53% linked to HCV care after testing antibody-positive and 67% linked to HIV care. Disease outcomes were estimated from established computer simulation models of HCV [Hepatitis C Cost-Effectiveness (HEP-CE)] and HIV [Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)]. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data on test acceptance and costs were from a national randomized trial of HIV testing strategies conducted at 12 substance abuse treatment programs in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime costs (2011 US$) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 3% annually; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). FINDINGS: On-site rapid HCV testing had an ICER of $18,300/QALY compared with no testing, and was more efficient than (dominated) off-site HCV testing referral. On-site rapid HCV and HIV testing had an ICER of $64,500/QALY compared with on-site rapid HCV testing alone. In one- and two-way sensitivity analyses, the ICER of on-site rapid HCV and HIV testing remained <$100,000/QALY, except when undetected HIV prevalence was <0.1% or when we assumed frequent HIV testing elsewhere. The ICER remained <$100,000/QALY in 91% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

14705,Cost-effectiveness of nationwide opportunistic screening program for dementia in South Korea,"Although more demand for screening for dementia is envisaged, the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic population screening for dementia at a nationwide level has never been directly investigated. Since 2010, Korea has implemented ""the National Dementia Early Detection Program"" (NDEDP) for the aged. This study aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the NDEDP of Korea and to explore the requirements for enhancing its cost-effectiveness. A Markov model was developed to simulate the disease progression of dementia patients. Data sources for the model parameters included the NDEDP database for cohort characteristics and other national representative data. The model's estimates of the expected costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for each strategy were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening compared to no screening, and sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of key variables on the cost-effectiveness. Screening showed that the cost per QALY gained ranged from $24,150 to $35,661 depending on the age group. The probability of screening being cost-effective was highest in the group over 75 years old in a wide range of willingness to pay (WTP). The implementation of an opportunistic screening program for dementia can be cost-effective depending on disease severity, treatment effect, costs by disease stage, ages of the participants, and the societal WTP. Above all things, improving access to more effective therapies in slowing the course of the disease is essential since the main benefit of earlier diagnosis for dementia is starting early treatment and subsequent savings.

14709,Cost-effectiveness of modern mTOR inhibitor based immunosuppression compared to the standard of care after renal transplantation in Germany,"OBJECTIVES: Standards of immunosuppression in renal transplantation have changed dynamically in recent years. We here provide a refined advanced pharmacoeconomic model which uses state-of-the-art methods including a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) analysis. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of current immunosuppressive therapy regimens (TR): ""sirolimus + early withdrawal of cyclosporine + steroids"" (TR1), ""sirolimus-early transition"" (TR2), ""everolimus-early transition"" (TR3) and ""tacrolimus low dose + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + steroids"" (TR4). METHODS: An up-to-date Markov model with current source data was employed to assess the cost-effectiveness of modern immunosuppressive regimens over 12-month and 10-year time periods. Transition probabilities for the occurrence of events for the first year were based on an MTC analysis. The robustness of the model was tested in extensive sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Within the 12-month time period TR2 yields the highest life years (0.987 LY), generating costs of 17,500 <euro>. In terms of years with functioning graft (FG), TR4 yields the best efficacy over the 12-month model duration (0.970 years with FG). For the 10-year time period, TR2 yields the lowest costs (107,246 <euro>) and dominates both TR3 and TR1, as it is simultaneously more effective. Within the 10-year model duration, TR4 reaches slightly higher effects compared with TR2 (6.493 vs. 6.474 LY) resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 387,684 <euro> per LY gained.

14712,Cost-Utility Analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Spanish Hospital,"INTRODUCTION: Stroke has a high rate of long-term disability and mortality and therefore has a significant economic impact. The objective of this study was to determine from a social perspective, the cost-utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to computed tomography (CT) as the first imaging test in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of MRI compared to CT as the first imaging test in AIS was performed. Economic evaluation data were obtained from a prospective study of patients with AIS </=12 h from onset in one Spanish hospital. The measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated from utilities of the modified Rankin Scale. Both hospital and post-discharge expenses were included in the costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and sensitivity analysis was carried out. The costs were expressed in Euros at the 2004 exchange rate. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were analyzed. The first imaging test was CT in 87 patients and MRI in 43 patients. Baseline variables were similar in the two groups.

14713,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome in Colombia,"INTRODUCTION: Acute coronary syndrome is one of the most frequent medical emergencies in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To determine, from the perspective of the Colombian health system, the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the Colombian health system comparing ticagrelor and clopidogrel for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome. To estimate the expected costs and outcomes, a Markov model was constructed in which patients could remain stable without experiencing new cardiovascular events, suffer from a new event, or die. For the baseline case, a 10-year time horizon and a discount ratio of 3% for costs and benefits were adopted. The transition probabilities were extracted from the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) clinical trial. Vital statistics were drawn from the Departmento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE) and additional information from Colombian patients included in the Access registry. To identify and measure resource use, a standard case was built by consulting guidelines and protocols. Unit costs were obtained from Colombian rate lists. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted in which costs were represented by a triangular distribution, and the effectiveness through a beta distribution. RESULTS: In the base case, the additional cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained with ticagrelor was COP$ 28,411,503. The results were sensitive to changes in the time horizon and the unit cost of clopidogrel. For a willingness-to-pay equivalent to three times the Colombian per capita gross domestic product, the probability of ticagrelor being cost-effective was 75%.

14714,Cost-effectiveness of retreatment with varenicline after failure with or relapse after initial treatment for smoking cessation,"OBJECTIVES: A recent trial showed the clinical benefit of retreatment with varenicline in subjects failing on the initial treatment, or relapsing after initial success. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of retreatment with varenicline compared with other smoking cessation interventions. METHODS: A published Markov model was adapted to compare one quit attempt of varenicline followed by retreatment to treatment/retreatment with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion or placebo, and with only 1 quit attempt of varenicline. Efficacy was obtained from clinical trials. Incidence of smoking-related diseases was based on published data. Cost of therapies and complications was obtained from databases and literature. RESULTS: For 1000 smokers willing to quit, varenicline retreatment saves 275,000euro, 118,000euro, 316,000euro and 237,000euro compared to NRT, bupropion, placebo, or one single varenicline quit attempt respectively at lifetime and from the healthcare payer perspective. The number of quality adjusted life years gained is 74, 63, 193 and 111 respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of these findings.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of denosumab versus other osteoporotic treatments in older men with osteoporosis from a US payer perspective. Methods. A lifetime cohort Markov model previously developed for postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) was used. Men in the model were 78 years old, with a BMD T-score of -2.12 and a vertebral fracture prevalence of 23%. During each 6-month Markov cycle, patients could have experienced a hip, vertebral or nonhip, nonvertebral (NHNV) osteoporotic fracture, remained in a nonfracture state, remained in a postfracture state, or died. Background fracture risks, mortality rates, persistence rates, health utilities, and medical and drug costs were derived from published sources.

The relative cost-effectiveness of these agents are unknown. We conducted an economic analysis evaluating 12 months of treatment with clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor after ACS. METHODS: We developed a fully probabilistic Markov cohort decision-analytic model using a lifetime horizon, from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The model incorporated risks of death, recurrent ACS, heart failure, major bleeding and other adverse effects of treatment.

14729,"Cost-Utility of ""Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide"" versus ""Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel"" for Treatment of Patients with Breast Cancer in Iran","PURPOSE: A cost-utility analysis was performed to assess the cost-utility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens containing doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) versus paclitaxel and gemcitabine (PG) for locally advanced breast cancer patients in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study in Namazi hospital in Shiraz, in the south of Iran covered 64 breast cancer patients. According to the random numbers, the patients were divided into two groups, 32 receiving AC and 32 PG. Costs were identified and measured from a community perspective. These items included medical and non-medical direct and indirect costs. In this study, a data collection form was used. To assess the utility of the two regimens, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was applied. Using a decision tree, we calculated the expected costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for both methods; also, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was assessed. RESULTS: The results of the decision tree showed that in the AC arm, the expected cost was 39,170 US$ and the expected QALY was 3.39 and in the PG arm, the expected cost was 43,336 dollars and the expected QALY was 2.64. Sensitivity analysis showed the cost effectiveness of the AC and ICER=-5535 US$.

14730,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of OTC use of simvastatin 10 mg for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction in Iranian men,"BACKGROUND: Several clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown the advantageous effects of statins in populations with different levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Considering the increasing cardiovascular risk among the Iranian population, the cost-effectiveness of the use of simvastatin 10 mg, as an Over-The-Counter (OTC) drug, for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated in this modeling study, from the payer's perspective. The target population is a hypothetical cohort of 45-year CVD healthy men with an average (15%) 10-year CVD risk. METHODS: A semi-Markov model with a life-long time horizon was developed to evaluate the Cost-Utility-Analysis (CUA) and Cost-Effectiveness-Analysis (CEA) of the use of OTC simvastatin 10 mg compared to no-drug therapy. Two measures of benefits were used in the model; Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs) for the CUA and Life-Years-Gained (LYG) for the CEA. To examine the robustness of the results, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were applied to the model. RESULTS: For the base-case scenario with a discount rate of 0% the estimated ICERs were 1113 USD/QALY and 935USD/LYG per patient (using governmental tariffs). No threshold has been determined in Iran for the cost-effectiveness of health-related interventions. However, according to the recommendation of WHO, this intervention can be considered highly cost-effective as its ICER is far less than the reported GDP per capita for Iran by World bank in 2013 ($4763). CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study showed that the use of an OTC low dose statin (simvastatin 10 mg) for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in 45-year men with a 10-year CVD risk of 15% could be considered highly cost-effective in Iran, as it meets the WHO threshold of the annual GDP per capita ($4763).",2015-01-20402,26717884,Daru,Mohammadreza Amirsadri,2015,23 /,56,No,26717884,"Mohammadreza Amirsadri; Abbas Hassani; Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of OTC use of simvastatin 10 mg for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction in Iranian men, Daru, 2015; 23():1560-8115; 56",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Not Stated,Simvastatin 10 mg vs. None,15% 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease,45 Years,45 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,1113.4,United States,2014,1217.22
14731,Cost-effectiveness of fondaparinux versus enoxaparin in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in Canada (OASIS-5),"BACKGROUND: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to a spectrum of life-threatening cardiac diseases usually due to coronary artery plaque rupture, subsequent thrombin generation plaque activation and thrombus formation. To date, no economic analyses have been published about the use of fondaparinux in NSTE-ACS patients in Canada. The purpose of our study is to estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of fondaparinux compared to enoxaparin for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients in a Canadian hospital setting. METHODS: As an extension of a previous published economic analysis for US patients, an event-based decision analytic model was constructed using clinical and resource use data from OASIS-5, a randomized trial of 20,078 patients from 41 countries. A public payer perspective in the hospital setting was adopted. Resource use data from the trial were valued using Canadian costs. A cost regression model was developed to estimate the mean cost of managing the clinical events over the 180 day period. Annual costs of long-term care for ACS patients were added after 180 days until death. Long-term survival was incorporated using Canadian life tables with further adjustment for additional risks associated with NSTE-ACS. Quality-of-life (utility) decrements from published sources were applied to clinical events. Lifetime costs (2009 CAD$) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted annually at 5 %, were estimated for the typical patient in OASIS-5 (i.e., at mean covariate values). RESULTS: The trial data showed that fondaparinux is protective against all clinical events observed in the trial. The model showed that: over 180 days, fondaparinux dominates enoxaparin, producing similar estimates of QALYs gained and saving $439; over a patient's lifetime, fondaparinux yields an ICER of $4293/QALY. Based on PSA, the probabilities that fondaparinux dominates enoxaparin (less costly and more effective) and that is cost-effective at a $50,000 threshold were 42 % and 96 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the Canadian hospital setting, fondaparinux is cost-effective when compared to enoxaparin for the treatment of NSTE-ACS.

14732,An economic evaluation of an augmented cognitive behavioural intervention vs. computerized cognitive training for post-stroke depressive symptoms,"BACKGROUND: Stroke survivors encounter emotional problems in the chronic phase after stroke. Post-stroke depressive symptoms have major impact on health-related quality of life (HRQol) and lead to increased hospitalization and therefore substantial healthcare costs. We present a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility evaluation of a cognitive behavioural therapy augmented with occupational and movement therapy to support patients with a stroke with depressive symptoms in goal-setting and goal attainment (augmented CBT) in comparison with a computerized cognitive training program (CogniPlus) as a control intervention. METHODS: A trial-based economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 12 months. Stroke patients (aged 18+ years) with signs of depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - subscale depression > 7) were eligible to participate. Primary outcomes were the HADS and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) based on the three-level five-dimensional EuroQol (EQ-5D-3 L). Missing data were handled through mean imputation (costs) and multiple imputation (HADS and EuroQol), and costs were bootstrapped. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of baseline assumptions. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included. The average total societal costs were not significantly different between the control group (euro9,998.3) and the augmented CBT group (euro8,063.7), with a 95 % confidence interval (-5,284, 1,796). The augmented CBT intervention was less costly and less effective from a societal perspective on the HADS, and less costly and slightly more effective in QALYs, in comparison with the control treatment. The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses provided greater effects and fewer costs for the augmented CBT group, and fewer effects and costs for the HADS. Based on a willingness to pay (WTP) level of euro40,000 per QALY, the augmented CBT intervention had a 76 % chance of being cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of results. CONCLUSION: The stroke-specific augmented CBT intervention did not show convincing cost-effectiveness results. In addition to other literature, this study provided new insights into the potential cost-effectiveness of an adjusted cognitive behavioural therapy intervention. However, as our study showed a 76 % chance of being cost-effective for one outcome measure (QALY) and did not provide convincing cost-effectiveness results on the HADS we recommend further research in a larger population.",2015-01-20415,26715040,Surg Neurol Int,M van Eeden,2015,15 /,266,No,26715040,"M van Eeden; J A Kootker; S M A A Evers; C M van Heugten; A C H Geurts; G A P G van Mastrigt; An economic evaluation of an augmented cognitive behavioural intervention vs. computerized cognitive training for post-stroke depressive symptoms, Surg Neurol Int, 2015; 15():2229-5097; 266",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stroke-specific augmented Cognitive Behavioral Therapy intervention vs. Computerized cognitive training,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-193460,Euro,2012,-280421.84
14733,Cost-Effectiveness of Dolutegravir in HIV-1 Treatment-Experienced (TE) Patients in France,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new generation integrase inhibitor (INI), dolutegravir (DTG), in France, in treatment-experienced (TE) and INI-naive HIV-infected adults with at least two classes resistance compared to raltegravir (RAL), by adapting previously published Anti-Retroviral Analysis by Monte Carlo Individual Simulation (ARAMIS) model. METHODS: ARAMIS is a microsimulation Markov model with a lifetime time horizon and a monthly cycle length. Health states are defined as with or without opportunistic infection and death. In the initial cohort, efficacy and safety data were derived from a phase III study comparing DTG to RAL. Antiretroviral treatment algorithms, accounting for patient history, were based on French guidelines and experts opinion. Costs are mainly including treatment costs, routine HIV and opportunistic infection care, and death. Utilities depend on CD4+ cell count and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. RESULTS: The ARAMIS model indicates in the TE population that DTG compared to RAL over a life time is associated with 0.35 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALY; 10.75 versus 10.41) and additional costs of euro7,266 (euro390,001 versus euro382,735). DTG increased costs are mainly related to a 9.1-month increase in life expectancy for DTG compared with RAL, and consequently a longer time spent on ART. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for DTG compared with RAL is euro21,048 per QALY gained. About 83% and 14% of total lifetime costs are associated with antiretroviral therapy and routine HIV care respectively. Univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of the model. CONCLUSION: DTG is cost-effective in the management of TE INI naive patients in France, from a collective perspective. These results could be explained by the superior efficacy of DTG in this population and its higher genetic barrier to resistance compared to RAL. These data need to be confirmed with longer-term real life data.",2015-01-20418,26714188,PLoS One,Gilles Pialoux,2015,10 / 12,e0145885,No,26714188,"Gilles Pialoux; Anne-Genevieve Marcelin; Nicolas Despiegel; Caroline Espinas; Helene Cawston; Laurent Finkielsztejn; Audrey Laurisse; Celine Aubin; Cost-Effectiveness of Dolutegravir in HIV-1 Treatment-Experienced (TE) Patients in France, PLoS One , 2015; 10(12):1932-6203; e0145885",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Therapy with dolutegravir, a new generation integrase inhibitor vs. Therapy with raltegravir","treatment-experienced, integrase inhibitor (INI) naive with at least two classes resistance",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,21048,Euro,2014,30596.62
14734,Cost-Effectiveness of a Statewide Campaign to Promote Aspirin Use for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,"BACKGROUND: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended increased aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men ages 45 to 79 years and women ages 55 to 79 years for whom benefit outweighs risk. This study estimated the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a statewide public and health professional awareness campaign to increase regular aspirin use among the target population in Minnesota to reduce first CVD events. METHODS AND RESULTS: A state-transition Markov model was developed, adopting a payer perspective and lifetime time horizon. The main outcomes of interest were quality-adjusted life years, costs, and the number of CVD events averted among those without a prior CVD history. The model was based on real-world data about campaign effectiveness from representative state-specific aspirin use and event rates, and estimates from the scholarly literature. Implementation of a campaign was predicted to avert 9874 primary myocardial infarctions in men and 1223 primary ischemic strokes in women in the target population. Increased aspirin use was associated with as many as 7222 more major gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated cost-saving results for both the male and female target populations. CONCLUSIONS: Using current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, a state public and health professional awareness campaign would likely provide clinical benefit and be economically attractive.

14736,Cost effectiveness of personalized treatment in women with early breast cancer: the application of OncotypeDX and Adjuvant! Online to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in Austria,"A Breast Cancer Outcomes model was developed at the ONCOTYROL research center to evaluate personalized test-treatment strategies in Austria. The goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new 21-gene assay (ODX) when used in conjunction with the Adjuvant! Online (AO) decision aid to support personalized decisions about use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer patients in Austria. We applied a validated discrete-event-simulation model to a hypothetical cohort of 50 years old women over a lifetime horizon. The test-treatment strategies of interest were defined using three-letter acronyms. The first (second, third) letter indicates whether patients with a low (intermediate, high) risk according to AO were tested using ODX (Y yes, N no). The main outcomes were life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and cost effectiveness. Robustness of the results was tested in sensitivity analyses. Results were compared to a Canadian analysis conducted by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA). Five of eight strategies were dominated (i.e., more costly and less effective: NNY, NYN, YNN, YNY, YYN). The base-case analysis shows that YYY (ODX provided to all patients) is the most effective strategy and is cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 15,700 EUR per QALY gained.

14743,Cost-effectiveness of umeclidinium/vilanterol combination therapy compared to tiotropium monotherapy among symptomatic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the UK,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of umeclidinium bromide-vilanterol (UMEC/VI) versus tiotropium monotherapy in the UK was assessed using a UMEC/VI treatment-specific economic model based on a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease-progression model. METHODS: The model was implemented as a linked-equation model to estimate COPD progression and associated health service costs, and its impact on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and survival. Statistical risk equations for clinical endpoints and resource use were derived from the ECLIPSE and TORCH studies, respectively. For the selected timeframe (1-40 years) and probabilistic analysis, model outputs included disaggregated costs, total costs, exacerbations, life-years and QALYs gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Random-effects meta-analysis of tiotropium comparator trials estimated treatment effect of UMEC/VI as 92.17 mL (95 % confidence interval: 61.52, 122.82) in forced expiratory volume in 1 s. With this benefit, UMEC/VI resulted in an estimated annual exacerbation reduction of 0.04 exacerbations/patient and 0.36 life years gained compared to tiotropium over patient lifetime. With an additional 0.18 QALYs/patient and an additional lifetime cost of pound372/patient at price parity, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of UMEC/VI compared to tiotropium was pound2088/QALY. This ICER increased to pound17,541/QALY when price of UMEC/VI was increased to that of indacaterol plus tiotropium in separate inhalers. The ICER improved when model duration was reduced from patient lifetime to 1 or 5 years, or when treatment effect was assumed to last for 12 months following treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: UMEC/VI can be considered a cost-effective alternative to tiotropium at a certain price.",2015-01-20457,26692823,Int J Cardiol,Yogesh Suresh Punekar,2015,13 /,22,No,26692823,"Yogesh Suresh Punekar; Graeme Roberts; Afisi Ismaila; Martin O'Leary; Cost-effectiveness of umeclidinium/vilanterol combination therapy compared to tiotropium monotherapy among symptomatic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the UK, Int J Cardiol, 2015; 13():1874-1754; 22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Monotherapy bronchodilator maintenance treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- tiotropium monotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,2087.6,United Kingdom,2014,3762.16
14744,Economic Evaluation of Cinacalcet in the United States: The EVOLVE Trial,"BACKGROUND: Previous economic evaluations of cinacalcet in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) relied on the combination of surrogate end points in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to conduct an economic evaluation of cinacalcet on the basis of the EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (EVOLVE) trial from a US payer perspective. METHODS: We developed a semi-Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet in addition to conventional therapy, compared with conventional therapy alone, in patients with moderate-to-severe sHPT receiving hemodialysis. We used treatment effect estimates from the unadjusted intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and prespecified covariate-adjusted ITT analysis as our main analyses. We assessed model sensitivity to variations in individual inputs and overall decision uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cinacalcet was $61,705 per life-year and $79,562 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using the covariate-adjusted ITT analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a 73.2% chance of the ICER being below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000. Treatment effects from unadjusted ITT analysis yielded an ICER of $115,876 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the treatment effect on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In the unadjusted ITT analysis, cinacalcet does not represent a cost- effective use of health care resources when applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. When using the covariate-adjusted ITT treatment effect, which represents the least biased estimate, however, cinacalcet is a cost-effective therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe sHPT on hemodialysis.",2015-01-20471,26686794,Value Health,Vasily Belozeroff,2015,18 / 8,1079-87,Yes,26686794,"Vasily Belozeroff; Glenn M Chertow; Christopher N Graham; Bastian Dehmel; Patrick S Parfrey; Andrew H Briggs; Economic Evaluation of Cinacalcet in the United States: The EVOLVE Trial, Value Health, 2015 Dec; 18(8):1098-3015; 1079-87",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with cinacalcet vs. Standard/Usual Care,Patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving hemodialysis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,191072,United States,2013,212277.53

Cost-effectiveness of treatment groups (drug classes) using community-level effectiveness and cost data, however, has not been assessed for elderly patients with breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy regimens by age and disease stage under ""real-world"" conditions for patients with breast cancer. METHODS: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data were used to identify patients with breast cancer with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I/II/IIIa, hormone receptor-negative (estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone receptor-negative) patients from 1992 to 2009. Patients were categorized into three adjuvant treatment groups: 1) no chemotherapy, 2) anthracycline, and 3) non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Median life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were measured using Kaplan-Meier analysis and were evaluated against average total health care costs (2013 US dollars). RESULTS: A total of 4575 patients (propensity score-matched) were included for the primary analysis. The anthracycline group experienced 12.05 QALYs and mean total health care costs of $119,055, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $7,688 per QALY gained as compared with the no chemotherapy group (QALYs 7.81; average health care cost $86,383).

Base-case results were found to be consistent with the best-case and worst-case scenarios for utility assignments. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied by age group (range $3,790-$90,405 per QALY gained).

14747,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Universal Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Using a Dynamic Bayesian Methodology: The BEST II Study,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a role in the development of benign and malign neoplasms in both sexes. The Italian recommendations for HPV vaccines consider only females. The BEST II study (Bayesian modelling to assess the Effectiveness of a vaccination Strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases) evaluates 1) the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies targeting universal vaccination compared with cervical cancer screening and female-only vaccination and 2) the economic impact of immunization on various HPV-induced diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether female-only vaccination or universal vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention against HPV. METHODS: We present a dynamic Bayesian Markov model to investigate transmission dynamics in cohorts of females and males in a follow-up period of 55 years. We assumed that quadrivalent vaccination (against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11) is available for 12-year-old individuals. The model accounts for the progression of subjects across HPV-induced health states (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and head/neck cancer as well as anogenital warts). The sexual mixing is modeled on the basis of age-, sex-, and sexual behavioral-specific matrices to obtain the dynamic force of infection. RESULTS: In comparison to cervical cancer screening, universal vaccination results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro1,500. When universal immunization is compared with female-only vaccination, it is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro11,600.

14748,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Universal Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Using a Dynamic Bayesian Methodology: The BEST II Study,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a role in the development of benign and malign neoplasms in both sexes. The Italian recommendations for HPV vaccines consider only females. The BEST II study (Bayesian modelling to assess the Effectiveness of a vaccination Strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases) evaluates 1) the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies targeting universal vaccination compared with cervical cancer screening and female-only vaccination and 2) the economic impact of immunization on various HPV-induced diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether female-only vaccination or universal vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention against HPV. METHODS: We present a dynamic Bayesian Markov model to investigate transmission dynamics in cohorts of females and males in a follow-up period of 55 years. We assumed that quadrivalent vaccination (against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11) is available for 12-year-old individuals. The model accounts for the progression of subjects across HPV-induced health states (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and head/neck cancer as well as anogenital warts). The sexual mixing is modeled on the basis of age-, sex-, and sexual behavioral-specific matrices to obtain the dynamic force of infection. RESULTS: In comparison to cervical cancer screening, universal vaccination results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro1,500. When universal immunization is compared with female-only vaccination, it is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro11,600. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows a relatively large amount of parameter uncertainty, which interestingly has, however, no substantial impact on the decision-making process.

14749,Ranolazine for the symptomatic treatment of patients with chronic angina pectoris in Greece: a cost-utility study,"BACKGROUND: To conduct an economic evaluation comparing ranolazine as add-on therapy to standard-of-care (SoC) with SoC alone in patients with stable angina who did not respond adequately to first line therapy, in Greece. METHODS: A decision tree model was locally adapted in the Greek setting to evaluate the cost-utility of ranolazine during a 6-month period. The analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective. The clinical inputs were extracted from the published literature. The cost inputs considered in the model reflect drug acquisition, hospitalizations, vascular interventions and monitoring of patients. The resource utilization data were obtained from 3 local experts. All costs refer to the year 2014. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by means of the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained with the ranolazine as add-on therapy relative to SoC alone (ICER). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed. RESULTS: Ranolazine as add-on therapy was more costly compared to SoC alone, as the 6-month total cost per patient was euro1170 and euro 984, respectively. Patients received ranolazine plus SoC and SoC alone gained 0.3155 QALYs and 0.2752 QALYs, respectively. Ranolazine plus SoC resulted in an ICER equal to euro4620 per QALY gained, well below the threshold of euro34,000 per QALY gained. The PSA showed that the likelihood of ranolazine plus SoC being cost-effective at the threshold of euro34,000 per QALY gained was 100 %.

14750,Cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation based on results of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial,"BACKGROUND: In 21,105 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial demonstrated that both higher dose (60mg/30mg dose reduced) and lower dose (30mg/15mg dose reduced) once-daily regimens of edoxaban were non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SE), with significantly lower rates of bleeding and cardiovascular death. Higher dose edoxaban was associated with a greater reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke than lower dose edoxaban, and the FDA approved higher dose edoxaban in patients with creatinine clearance </=95mL/min. This study evaluated the economic value of higher dose edoxaban vs warfarin based on data from patients in ENGAGE within the FDA-approved population. METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs warfarin over a lifetime horizon from the US healthcare system perspective using a Markov model based on a combination of ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial data, US life tables, and published literature on the costs and long-term outcomes of non-fatal cardiovascular and bleeding events. Data from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial were used to calculate age-adjusted event rates for warfarin and hazard ratios (HRs) for the relative impact of edoxaban on embolic and bleeding complications. Based on the wholesale acquisition price, edoxaban and warfarin were assumed to cost $9.24 and $0.36/day, respectively. RESULTS: For edoxaban vs warfarin, lifetime incremental costs and QALYs were $16,384 and 0.444, respectively, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $36,862/QALY gained, using data from patients with creatinine clearance </=95mL/min in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. ICERs were more favorable for patients without compared to those with prior warfarin use; ICERs differed minimally by CHADS2 score. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its higher acquisition cost, edoxaban is an economically attractive alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and SE in patients with atrial fibrillation and creatinine clearance </=95mL/min. These results were robust to variation of key model parameters, including assumptions regarding the cost and quality-of-life impact of stroke and bleeding events, and were favorable across both CHADS2 score stroke-risk categories.",2015-01-20492,26678636,Am Heart J,Elizabeth A Magnuson,2015,170 / 6,1140-50,No,26678636,"Elizabeth A Magnuson; Katherine Vilain; Kaijun Wang; Haiyan Li; Winghan J Kwong; Elliott M Antman; Christian T Ruff; Robert P Giugliano; David J Cohen; ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 Trial Investig; Cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation based on results of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, Am Heart J, 2015 Dec; 170(6):1097-6744; 1140-50",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Edoxaban treatment vs. warfarin,Creatinine clearance =95 mL/min in ENGAGE AFTIMI 48 trial,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,36862,United States,2013,40953.01

14761,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of tenofovir/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine in combination with efavirenz or atazanavir/ritonavir for treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection in the UK, based on the AIDS Clinical Trials Group 5202 clinical trial","OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the four regimens studied in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 5202 clinical trial, tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) in combination with efavirenz (EFV) or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r), for treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection in the UK. METHODS: A Markov model with six health states based on CD4 cell count ranges was developed to predict long-term costs and health outcomes for individuals on first-line therapy. Head-to-head efficacy data comparing TDF/FTC + EFV, TDF/FTC + ATV/r, ABC/3TC + EFV, and ABC/3TC + ATV/r were obtained from ACTG 5202 for up to 192 weeks. Antiretroviral drug costs were based on current list prices. Other medical costs (2013 UK pounds sterling), utility values, and mortality rates were obtained from published sources. Base-case, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses (by baseline viral load) were conducted. RESULTS: Individuals using TDF/FTC-based regimens were predicted to remain on first-line therapy longer and accrue more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than individuals using ABC/3TC-based regimens. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30 000 per QALY gained, TDF/FTC-based regimens were predicted to be cost-effective compared with ABC/3TC-based regimens, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of pound23 355 for TDF/FTC + EFV vs. ABC/3TC + EFV and pound23 785 for TDF/FTC + ATV/r vs. ABC/3TC + ATV/r.

METHODS: A Markov model with six health states based on CD4 cell count ranges was developed to predict long-term costs and health outcomes for individuals on first-line therapy. Head-to-head efficacy data comparing TDF/FTC + EFV, TDF/FTC + ATV/r, ABC/3TC + EFV, and ABC/3TC + ATV/r were obtained from ACTG 5202 for up to 192 weeks. Antiretroviral drug costs were based on current list prices. Other medical costs (2013 UK pounds sterling), utility values, and mortality rates were obtained from published sources. Base-case, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses (by baseline viral load) were conducted. RESULTS: Individuals using TDF/FTC-based regimens were predicted to remain on first-line therapy longer and accrue more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than individuals using ABC/3TC-based regimens. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30 000 per QALY gained, TDF/FTC-based regimens were predicted to be cost-effective compared with ABC/3TC-based regimens, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of pound23 355 for TDF/FTC + EFV vs. ABC/3TC + EFV and pound23 785 for TDF/FTC + ATV/r vs. ABC/3TC + ATV/r.

14763,Cost-Effectiveness of a Chronic Care Model for Frail Older Adults in Primary Care: Economic Evaluation Alongside a Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized Trial,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Geriatric Care Model (GCM), an integrated care model for frail older adults based on the Chronic Care Model, with that of usual care. DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care (35 practices) in two regions in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults who were frail according to their primary care physicians and the Program on Research for Integrating Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy case-finding tool questionnaire (N = 1,147). INTERVENTION: The GCM consisted of the following components: a regularly scheduled in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment by a practice nurse followed by a customized care plan, management and training of practice nurses by a geriatric expert team, and coordination of care through community network meetings and multidisciplinary team consultations of individuals with complex care needs. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were measured every 6 months and included costs from a societal perspective, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Survey (SF-12) physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scales), functional limitations (Katz activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), and quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D. RESULTS: Multilevel regression models adjusted for time and baseline confounders showed no significant differences in costs ($356, 95% confidence interval = -$488-1,134) and outcomes between intervention and usual care phases. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that, for the SF-12 PCS and MCS, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.76 if decision-makers are willing to pay $30,000 per point improvement on the SF-12 scales (range 0-100). For all other outcomes the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was low. CONCLUSION: Because the GCM was not cost-effective compared to usual care after 24 months of follow-up, widespread implementation in its current form is not recommended.",2015-01-20515,26663424,J Am Geriatr Soc,Karen M van Leeuwen,2015,63 / 12,2494-2504,No,26663424,"Karen M van Leeuwen; Judith E Bosmans; Aaltje P D Jansen; Emiel O Hoogendijk; Maaike E Muntinga; Hein P J van Hout; Giel Nijpels; Henriette E van der Horst; Maurits W van Tulder; Cost-Effectiveness of a Chronic Care Model for Frail Older Adults in Primary Care: Economic Evaluation Alongside a Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized Trial, J Am Geriatr Soc, 2015 Dec; 63(12):0002-8614; 2494-2504",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Geriatric Care Model (GCM), an integrated care model vs. Standard/Usual Care",Community-dwelling older adults who were frail according to their primary care physicians,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,4.00,Not Stated,142333.33,United States,2011,163766.31

A cost-effectiveness perspective","OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficiency of alternative monitoring services for people with ocular hypertension (OHT), a glaucoma risk factor. DESIGN: Discrete event simulation model comparing five alternative care pathways: treatment at OHT diagnosis with minimal monitoring; biennial monitoring (primary and secondary care) with treatment if baseline predicted 5-year glaucoma risk is >/=6%; monitoring and treatment aligned to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) glaucoma guidance (conservative and intensive).

14768,Cost-Effectiveness of a Home Based Intervention for Secondary Prevention of Readmission with Chronic Heart Disease,"The aim of this study is to consider the cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led, home-based intervention (HBI) in cardiac patients with private health insurance compared to usual post-discharge care. A within trial analysis of the Young @ Heart multicentre, randomized controlled trial along with a micro-simulation decision analytical model was conducted to estimate the incremental costs and quality adjusted life years associated with the home based intervention compared to usual care. For the micro-simulation model, future costs, from the perspective of the funder, and effects are estimated over a twenty-year time horizon. An Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio, along with Incremental Net Monetary Benefit, is evaluated using a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per quality adjusted life year. Sub-group analyses are conducted for men and women across three age groups separately. Costs and benefits that arise in the future are discounted at five percent per annum. Overall, home based intervention for secondary prevention in patients with chronic heart disease identified in the Australian private health care sector is not cost-effective. The estimated within trial incremental net monetary benefit is -$3,116 [95% CI: -11,145, $4,914]; indicating that the costs outweigh the benefits. However, for males and in particular males aged 75 years and above, home based intervention indicated a potential to reduce health care costs when compared to usual care (within trial: -$10,416 [95% CI: -$26,745, $5,913]; modelled analysis: -$1,980 [95% CI: -$22,843, $14,863]).

14769,Cost-effectiveness of a European ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction network: results from the Catalan Codi Infart network,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) network of Catalonia (Codi Infart). DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. SETTING: The analysis was from the Catalonian Autonomous Community in Spain, with a population of about 7.5 million people. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with STEMI treated within the autonomous community of Catalonia (Spain) included in the IAM CAT II-IV and Codi Infart registries. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs included hospitalisation, procedures and additional personnel and were obtained according to the reperfusion strategy. Clinical outcomes were defined as 30-day avoided mortality and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), before (N=356) and after network implementation (N=2140). RESULTS: A substitution effect and a technology effect were observed; aggregate costs increased by 2.6%. The substitution effect resulted from increased use of primary coronary angioplasty, a relatively expensive procedure and a decrease in fibrinolysis. Primary coronary angioplasty increased from 31% to 89% with the network, and fibrinolysis decreased from 37% to 3%. Rescue coronary angioplasty declined from 11% to 4%, and no reperfusion from 21% to 4%. The technological effect was related to improvements in the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure that increased efficiency, reducing the average length of the hospital stay. Mean costs per patient decreased from euro8306 to euro7874 for patients with primary coronary angioplasty. Clinical outcomes in patients treated with primary coronary angioplasty did not change significantly, although 30-day mortality decreased from 7.5% to 5.6%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio resulted in an extra cost of euro4355 per life saved (30-day mortality) and euro495 per QALY. Below a cost threshold of euro30,000, results were sensitive to variations in costs and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The Catalan STEMI network (Codi Infart) is cost-efficient.

14770,"DOES ONE SIZE FIT ALL? COST UTILITY ANALYSES OF ALTERNATIVE MAMMOGRAPHIC FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULES, BY RISK OF RECURRENCE","OBJECTIVES: International guidelines recommend annual mammography after early breast cancer, but there is no randomized controlled trial evidence to support this schedule over any other. Given that not all women have the same risk of recurrence, it is possible that, by defining different risk profiles, we could tailor mammographic schedules that are more effective and efficient. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to describe the progression of early breast cancer after completion of primary treatment. Retrospective data for 1,100 postmenopausal women diagnosed with early breast cancer in South Australia from 2000 to 2008 were used to calibrate the model. Women were divided into four prognostic subgroups based on the Nottingham Prognostic Index of their primary tumor. For each subgroup, we compared the cost-effectiveness of three different mammographic schedules for two different age groups. RESULTS: Annual mammographic follow-up was not cost-effective for most postmenopausal women. Two yearly mammography was cost-effective for all women with excellent prognosis tumors; and for women with good prognosis tumors if high compliance rates can be achieved. Annual mammography for 5 years and 2 yearly surveillance thereafter (a mixed schedule) may be cost-effective for 50- to 69-year-old women with moderate prognosis tumors, and for women aged 70-79 years with poor prognosis tumors. For younger women with poor prognosis tumors, annual mammography is potentially cost-effective.

14786,Cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination in South Africa accounting for human immunodeficiency virus prevalence,"BACKGROUND: This study aims at evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a 2-dose schedule human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme of HPV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) naive 12-year-old girls, in addition to cervical cancer (CC) screening alone, in South Africa. The study aims to account for both the impact of the vaccine among girls who are HIV-positive (HIV+) as well as HIV-negative (HIV-) population. METHODS: A previously published Markov cohort model was adapted to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of a HPV vaccination programme in girls aged 12 years (N = 527 900) using the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine from a public payer perspective. Two subpopulations were considered: HIV- and HIV+ women. Each population followed the HPV natural history with different transition probabilities. Model input data were obtained from the literature, local databases and Delphi panel. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 5 %. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the evaluation. RESULTS: Implementation of the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine in combination with current cytological screening in South African girls could prevent up to 8 869 CC cases and 5 436 CC deaths over the lifetime of a single cohort. Without discounting, this HPV vaccine is dominant over screening alone; with discounting, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is ZAR 81 978 (South African Rand) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. HPV vaccination can be considered cost-effective based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended threshold (3 x gross domestic product/capita = ZAR 200 293). In a scenario with a hypothetical targeted vaccination in a HIV+ subpopulation alone, the modelled outcomes suggest that HPV vaccination is still cost-effective, although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increases to ZAR 102 479. Results were sensitive to discount rate, vaccine efficacy, HIV incidence and mortality rates, and HPV-related disease transition probabilities. CONCLUSIONS: The AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine can be considered cost-effective in a South African context although the cost-effectiveness is expected to be lower in the HIV+ subpopulation than in the overall female population. With improved access to HIV treatment, the HIV mortality and incidence rates are likely to be reduced, which could improve cost-effectiveness of the vaccination programme in South Africa.",2015-01-20534,26652918,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,Xiao Li,2015,15 /,566,No,26652918,"Xiao Li; Martinus P Stander; Georges Van Kriekinge; Nadia Demarteau; Cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination in South Africa accounting for human immunodeficiency virus prevalence, J Manag Care Spec Pharm, 2015; 15():2376-1032; 566",QALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening + HPV Vaccination vs. Screening,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,81978,South Africa,2013,9474.71
14787,Cost-effectiveness of integrated collaborative care for comorbid major depression in patients with cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Comorbid major depression is associated with reduced quality of life and greater use of healthcare resources. A recent randomised trial (SMaRT, Symptom Management Research Trials, Oncology-2) found that a collaborative care treatment programme (Depression Care for People with Cancer, DCPC) was highly effective in treating depression in patients with cancer. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DCPC compared with usual care from a health service perspective. METHODS: Costs were estimated using UK national unit cost estimates and health outcomes measured using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness of DCPC compared with usual care was calculated and scenario analyses performed to test alternative assumptions on costs and missing data. Uncertainty was characterised using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The probability of DCPC being cost-effective was determined using the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold range of pound 20,000 to pound 30,000 per QALY gained. RESULTS: DCPC cost on average pound 631 more than usual care per patient, and resulted in a mean gain of 0.066 QALYs, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound 9549 per QALY. The probability of DCPC being cost-effective was 0.9 or greater at cost-effectiveness thresholds above pound 20,000 per QALY for the base case and scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, DCPC is likely to be cost-effective at the current thresholds used by NICE.

14788,Is exposure in vivo cost-effective for chronic low back pain? A trial-based economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Back pain is one of the most expensive health complaints. Comparing the economic aspects of back pain interventions may therefore contribute to a more efficient use of available resources. This study reports on a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) of two treatments as viewed from a societal perspective: 1) exposure in vivo treatment (EXP), a recently developed cognitive behavioral treatment for patients with chronic low back pain who have elevated pain-related fear and 2) the more commonly used graded activity (GA) treatment. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with non-specific chronic low back pain received either EXP or GA. Primary data were collected at four participating treatment centers in the Netherlands. Primary outcomes were self-reported disability (for the CEA) and quality-adjusted life years (for the CUA). Program costs, health care utilization, patient and family costs, and production losses were measured by analyzing therapy records and cost diaries. Data was gathered before, during, and after treatment, and at 6 and 12 months after treatment. Non-parametric bootstrap analyses were used to quantify the uncertainty concerning the cost-effectiveness ratio. In addition, cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were performed. RESULTS: EXP showed a tendency to reduce disability, increase quality adjusted life years and decrease costs compared to GA. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of both the CEA and CUA are in favor of EXP. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, implementing EXP for this group of patients seems to be the best decision.

14789,Cost-Utility Analysis of IEV Drug Regimen Versus ESHAP Drug Regimen for the Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Iran,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for lymph nodes cancer is often composed of several drugs that are used in a treatment program. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis of IEV regimen (ifosfamide, epirubicin and etoposide) versus ESHAP regimen (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin) in patients with lymphoma in the south of Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a cost-utility analysis done as a cross-sectional study in the south of Iran. Using decision tree, expected costs, quality -adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated. In addition, the robustness of results was examined by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The results of this study indicated that the total lymphoma patients were about 65 people that 27 patients received IEV regimen and 38 patients ESHAP (43 patients with Hodgkin's and 22 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The results of decision tree showed that in the IEV arm, the expected cost was $20952.93 and the expected QALYs was 3.89 and in the ESHAP arm, the expected cost was $31691.74 and the expected QALYs was 3.86. Based on the results of the study, IEV regimen was cost-effective alternative to the ESHAP regimen. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, it is recommended that oncologists use IEV instead of ESHAP in the treatment of patients with lymphoma and because of high costs of IEV drug costs, it is suggested that IEV drugs should be covered by insurance.",2015-01-20571,26634115,Iran J Cancer Prev,Nahid Hatam,2015,8 / 5,e4061,No,26634115,"Nahid Hatam; Mehdi Dehghani; Mostafa Habibian; Abdosaleh Jafari; Cost-Utility Analysis of IEV Drug Regimen Versus ESHAP Drug Regimen for the Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Iran, Iran J Cancer Prev, 2015 Oct; 8(5):2008-2398; e4061",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Ifosfamide, epirubicin and etoposide (IEV Treatment) vs. etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (ESHAP Treatment)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-357960.31,United States,2013,-397687.41
14790,Time to Cost-Effectiveness Following Stroke Reduction Strategies in AF: Warfarin Versus NOACs Versus LAA Closure,"BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) and nonwarfarin oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have emerged as safe and effective alternatives to warfarin for stroke prophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVES: This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of warfarin, NOACs, and LAAC with the Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) for stroke risk reduction in patients with nonvalvular AF at multiple time points over a lifetime horizon. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of LAAC, NOACs, and warfarin from the perspective of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services over a lifetime (20-year) horizon. Patients were 70 years of age and at moderate risk for stroke and bleeding. Clinical event rates, stroke outcomes, and quality of life information were drawn predominantly from PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) 4-year data and meta-analyses of warfarin and NOACs. Costs for stroke risk reduction therapies, treatment of associated acute events, and long-term care following disabling stroke were presented in 2015 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: Relative to warfarin, LAAC was cost-effective at 7 years ($42,994/quality-adjusted life-years [QALY]), and NOACs were cost-effective at 16 years ($48,446/QALY). LAAC was dominant over NOACs by year 5 and warfarin by year 10. At 10 years, LAAC provided more QALYs than warfarin and NOACs (5.855 vs. 5.601 vs. 5.751, respectively). In sensitivity analyses, LAAC remained cost-effective relative to warfarin ($41,470/QALY at 11 years) and NOACs ($21,964/QALY at 10 years), even if procedure costs were doubled. CONCLUSIONS: Both NOACs and LAAC with the Watchman device were cost-effective relative to warfarin, but LAAC was also found to be cost-effective and to offer better value relative to NOACs.

14793,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Apixaban against Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Japan,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared with to warfarin, current standard of care, for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in Japan. METHODS: A previously published lifetime Markov model was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with NVAF in Japan. In the same model, the costs associated with each clinical event and background mortality were replaced with Japanese data. Whenever available, some of the utility parameters were derived from Japanese published literature. Lifetime horizon was selected to evaluate the value of the treatment benefit (stroke prevention) against potential risks (such as major bleedings) among patients with NVAF. Direct medical cost, long-term care cost, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the payers' perspective. FINDINGS: Compared with warfarin, treatment with apixaban was estimated to increase life expectancy by 0.231 year or 0.240 QALYs while treatment cost increased by yen511,692 (US $5117 at an exchange rate of US $1 = yen100). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was yen2,135,743 per QALY (US $21,357 per QALY). On the basis of the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, when the willingness-to-pay threshold was set at approximately >/= yen2,250,000 (US $22,500) per QALY, the probability of apixaban being cost-effective was >/=50%. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of yen5,000,000 (US $50,000) and yen6,700,000 (US $67,000) in Japan, the probability of apixaban being cost-effective was 85% and 91%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although most participants in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial used for the efficacy data of apixaban in the model were non-Japanese patients, the impact of the limitations on our results was considered small, and our results were deemed robust because of the additional effect in Japanese patients compared with that in the global population according to the subanalysis of Japanese patients in the trial. Therefore, based on an adaptation of a published Markov model, apixaban is a cost-effective alternative to warfarin in Japan for stroke prevention among patients with NVAF.",2015-01-20620,26608819,Clin Ther,Isao Kamae,2015,37 / 12,2837-51,Yes,26608819,"Isao Kamae; Yoichiro Hashimoto; Yukihiro Koretsune; Norio Tanahashi; Tatsunori Murata; Hemant Phatak; Larry Z Liu; Ann C Tang; Peter Feng Wang; Ken Okumura; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Apixaban against Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Japan, Clin Ther, 2015 Dec 1; 37(12):1879-114X; 2837-51",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Warfarin,Nonvalvular,75 Years,75 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,2.00,2.00,21357,United States,2014,23348.48

We assumed that with genotyping 60% of patients would be eligible to receive lower doses. RESULTS: Current care without CYP2B6 genotyping has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >$100,000/QALY compared with genotype-guided dosing, even if lower dosing reduces efficacy. When we assumed generic efavirenz availability, conclusions were similar unless lower dosing reduces efficacy by 6% or more.

14795,Cost-Utility Analysis of Mycophenolate Mofetil versus Azathioprine Based Regimens for Maintenance Therapy of Proliferative Lupus Nephritis,"Background/Aims. We aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) as maintenance therapy for patients with Class III and Class IV lupus nephritis (LN), from a United States (US) perspective. Methods. Using a Markov model, we conducted a cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. The modeled population comprised patients with proliferative LN who received maintenance therapy with MMF (2 gm/day) versus AZA (150 mg/day) for 3 years. Risk estimates of clinical events were based on a Cochrane meta-analysis while costs and utilities were retrieved from other published sources. Outcome measures included costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), and net monetary benefit. Results. The base-case model showed that, compared with AZA strategy, the ICER for MMF was $2,630,592/QALY at 3 years. Over the patients' lifetime, however, the ICER of MMF compared to AZA was $6,454/QALY. Overall, the ICER results from various sensitivity and subgroup analyses did not alter the conclusions of the model simulation. Conclusions. In the short term, an AZA-based regimen confers greater value than MMF for the maintenance therapy of proliferative LN.

14796,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Insulin Detemir Compared to Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Spain,"INTRODUCTION: An Excel(R) (Microsoft Corporation) model was adapted to estimate the short-term (1-year) cost effectiveness of insulin detemir (IDet) versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in patients initiating insulin treatment with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Spain. METHODS: Clinical benefits included the non-severe hypoglycemia rate for T1DM and T2DM, and weight change for T2DM. Three scenarios were included with different hypoglycemia rates estimated on the basis of clinical trials and observational studies. Costs, estimated from perspective of the Spanish Public Healthcare System (Euros 2014), included insulin treatment and non-severe hypoglycemia management costs. Non-severe hypoglycemia, defined as a self-managed event, implied the use of extra glucose testing strips and a general practitioner visit during the week following the event for 25% of patients. An average disutility value was associated to non-severe hypoglycemia events and, for T2DM, to one body mass index unit gain to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: For the three scenarios a range of 0.025-0.076 QALYs for T1DM and 0.014-0.051 QALYs for T2DM were gained for IDet versus NPH due to non-severe hypoglycemia and weight gain avoidance, in return of an incremental cost of euro145-192 for T1DM and euro128-206 for T2DM. This resulted in the IDet versus NPH incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging between euro1910/QALY and euro7682/QALY for T1DM and euro2522/QALY and euro15,009/QALY for T2DM. CONCLUSION: IDet was a cost-effective alternative to NPH insulin in the first year of treatment of patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM in Spain, with ICERs under the threshold value commonly accepted in Spain (euro30,000/QALY).

RESULTS: For the three scenarios a range of 0.025-0.076 QALYs for T1DM and 0.014-0.051 QALYs for T2DM were gained for IDet versus NPH due to non-severe hypoglycemia and weight gain avoidance, in return of an incremental cost of euro145-192 for T1DM and euro128-206 for T2DM. This resulted in the IDet versus NPH incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging between euro1910/QALY and euro7682/QALY for T1DM and euro2522/QALY and euro15,009/QALY for T2DM. CONCLUSION: IDet was a cost-effective alternative to NPH insulin in the first year of treatment of patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM in Spain, with ICERs under the threshold value commonly accepted in Spain (euro30,000/QALY).

METHODS: Clinical benefits included the non-severe hypoglycemia rate for T1DM and T2DM, and weight change for T2DM. Three scenarios were included with different hypoglycemia rates estimated on the basis of clinical trials and observational studies.
