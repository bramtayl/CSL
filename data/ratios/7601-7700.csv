7601,Cost effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis screening of rheumatoid arthritis patients prior to initiation of tumor necrosis factor-a antagonist therapy,"The prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is higher than that in the general population, and RA patients are considered a high-risk group. Currently, TB screening of RA patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) antagonists is performed by the tuberculin skin test (TST) in Japan. Interferon-gamma release assays (QuantiFERON?-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT] and T-SPOT.TB?) are new alternatives to the TST to diagnose latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB, and offer higher specificity and no cross-reactivity with Bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin (BCG) vaccine. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of QFT versus TST in non-BCG-vaccinated and BCG-vaccinated RA patients.We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of QFT and TST. The target population is a hypothetical cohort of 1000 RA patients, using a societal perspective and the lifetime horizon. All costs and clinical benefits were discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3%.In base-case analysis, the QFT strategy was the most cost effective ($US1044.52; 23.03499 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) compared with the TST strategy for non-BCG-vaccinated RA patients ($US1824.61; 22.98153 QALYs) and for BCG-vaccinated RA patients ($US2096.34; 22.98153 QALYs) [year 2009 values]. The incidence of TB in RA patients with TNFa antagonist therapy influenced the cost effectiveness. When the incidence of TB in RA patients with TNFa antagonist therapy is under 0.00066, the TST strategy is more cost effective than the QFT strategy.QFT screening is more effective and less costly than the TST for both BCG-vaccinated and non-BCG-vaccinated RA patients prior to TNFa antagonist therapy in Japan. These findings may be applicable to other countries when choosing optimal LTBI screening of RA patients.",2010-01-12074,21275454,Mol Diagn Ther,Akiko Kowada,2010,14 / 6,367-73,No,21275454,"Akiko Kowada; Cost effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis screening of rheumatoid arthritis patients prior to initiation of tumor necrosis factor-a antagonist therapy, Mol Diagn Ther, ; 14(6):1177-1062; 367-73",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon-gamma release assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT)) prior to initiation of tumor necrosis factor-a antagonist therapy vs. Tuberculin skin test (TST),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-14592.03,United States,2009,-17603.39

7603,Cost-effectiveness of optimized background therapy plus maraviroc for previously treated patients with R5 HIV-1 infection from the perspective of the Spanish health care system,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of the Spanish health care system, of optimized background therapy (OBT) plus maraviroc 300 mg BID versus OBT plus placebo in previously treated patients with R5 HIV-1 infection.A lifetime cohort model was developed, based on 24- and 48-week pooled results from the Maraviroc Versus Optimized Therapy in Viremic Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Patients (MOTIVATE) studies 1 and 2, to reflect the Spanish health care system's perspective. Treatment duration was based on clinical trial follow-up from MOTIVATE 1 and 2. Clinical data, cohort characteristics, success probability, CD4 increase rate, CD4 cell status link to disease states, and adverse-event probability were taken from the MOTIVATE trials and other published literature. Other input parameters were taken from published sources. Antiretroviral (ARV) costs were derived from local sources. Non-ARV drug costs were obtained from published literature and a cost database. All costs were calculated as year-2009 euros. The annual discount rate was set at 3.0%. The main outcomes were cost per life-year gained (LYG) and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Uncertainty was assessed with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.In the model analysis, adding maraviroc to OBT was associated with an increase of 0.952 LYG and 0.909 QALY. Total costs were ?275,970 for maraviroc plus OBT and ?254,655 for placebo plus OBT (difference: ?21,315). The incremental cost per LYG was ?22,398 and the incremental cost per QALY gained was ?23,457. The model appeared to be robust for variations in key parameters. Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that the probability of the cost per QALY being below ?30,000 was 99%.Despite the limitations of the model, our analysis suggested that OBT plus maraviroc 300 mg BID is a clinically valuable option, and cost-effective from the perspective of the Spanish health care system, for previously treated patients with R5 HIV-1 infection.",2010-01-12079,21316539,Clin Ther,Santiago Moreno,2010,32 / 13,2232-45,Yes,21316539,"Santiago Moreno; Juan Gonz?lez; Ingrid Lekander; Bel?n Mart?; Itziar Oyag?ez; Rainel S?nchez-de la Rosa; Miguel Angel Casado; Cost-effectiveness of optimized background therapy plus maraviroc for previously treated patients with R5 HIV-1 infection from the perspective of the Spanish health care system, Clin Ther, ; 32(13):1879-114X; 2232-45",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Maraviroc plus optimized background therapy vs. Placebo plus optimized background therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,23457,Euro,2009,39434.35
7604,Economic analysis of decitabine versus best supportive care in the treatment of intermediate- and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes from a US payer perspective,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are blood and bone marrow disorders that occur primarily in the elderly population, with 30% of all cases progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Red blood cell transfusions--a conventional treatment of MDS--have been associated with high costs and decreased quality of life compared with transfusion independence. Phase III clinical trial data suggest that decitabine may offer an improved AML-free survival versus best supportive care (BSC), which consists of red blood cell transfusions, deferoxamine, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, platelet transfusions, and colony-stimulating factors. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a 5-day outpatient decitabine dosing regimen, which might reduce administration costs compared with the standard 3-day inpatient regimen.The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 5-day dosing of decitabine versus BSC in US patients with intermediate- and high-risk MDS from a US payer perspective.A Markov model with 3 health states (MDS, AML, and death) was constructed to simulate natural disease progression. The model followed patients in 4-week cycles for = 5 years. Clinical inputs and patient characteristics were based on decitabine Phase III clinical trial data. Costs of supportive care and adverse events were based on trial resource utilization data. Drug and AML costs were obtained from published sources. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of model parameters on results.In the base-case model, decitabine yielded 0.276 additional year of AML-free survival and 0.052 more quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with BSC. Total decitabine and administration costs over the 5-year time horizon were $28,933. Total direct medical costs were $122,940 in the decitabine arm and $122,666 in the BSC arm. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for decitabine versus BSC was $5277 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated that decitabine had a higher probability than BSC of being cost-effective despite the uncertainty around some model parameters, including survival.In this study, decitabine administered on a 5-day dosing schedule was likely a cost-effective treatment option in patients with intermediate- and high-risk MDS from a US payer perspective.",2010-01-12082,21353113,Clin Ther,Feng Pan,2010,32 / 14,2444-56,Yes,21353113,"Feng Pan; Siyang Peng; Rachael Fleurence; John E Linnehan; Kevin Knopf; Edward Kim; Economic analysis of decitabine versus best supportive care in the treatment of intermediate- and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes from a US payer perspective, Clin Ther, ; 32(14):1879-114X; 2444-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Decitabine (5-day dosing) vs. Best supportive care (RBC transfusions, deferoxamine, erythopoiesis-stimulating factors)",Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,5277,United States,2009,6366.01

This project came about when Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) asked MAS to provide evidence-based analyses on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three oncology pharmacogenomic tests currently in use in Ontario.Evidence-based analyses have been prepared for each of these technologies. These have been completed in conjunction with internal and external stakeholders, including a Provincial Expert Panel on Pharmacogenomics (PEPP). Within the PEPP, subgroup committees were developed for each disease area. For each technology, an economic analysis was also completed by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA) and is summarized within the reports.THE FOLLOWING REPORTS CAN BE PUBLICLY ACCESSED AT THE MAS WEBSITE AT: www.health.gov.on.ca/mas or at www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.htmlGENE EXPRESSION PROFILING FOR GUIDING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY DECISIONS IN WOMEN WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER: An Evidence-Based and Economic AnalysisEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation (EGFR) Testing for Prediction of Response to EGFR-Targeting Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Drugs in Patients with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: an Evidence-Based and Economic AnalysisK-RAS testing in Treatment Decisions for Advanced Colorectal Cancer: an Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis.The objective of this systematic review is to determine the predictive value of KRAS testing in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with two anti-EGFR agents, cetuximab and panitumumab. Economic analyses are also being conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of KRAS testing. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is usually defined as stage IV disease according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumour node metastasis (TNM) system or stage D in the Duke's classification system. Patients with advanced colorectal cancer (mCRC) either present with metastatic disease or develop it through disease progression. KRAS (Kristen-RAS, a member of the rat sarcoma virus (ras) gene family of oncogenes) is frequently mutated in epithelial cancers such as colorectal cancer, with mutations occurring in mutational hotspots (codons 12 and 13) of the KRAS protein. Involved in EGFR-mediated signalling of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, enhanced cell motility and neoangiogenesis, a mutation in the KRAS gene is believed to be involved in cancer pathogenesis. Such a mutation is also hypothesized to be involved in resistance to targeted anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase activity) treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab, hence, the important in evaluating the evidence on the predictive value of KRAS testing in this context. KRAS MUTATION TESTING IN ADVANCED COLORECTAL CANCER: Both cetuximab and panitumumab are indicated by Health Canada in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumours are WT for the KRAS gene. Cetuximab may be offered as monotherapy in patients intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy or in patients who have failed both irinotecan and oxaliplatin-based regimens and who received a fluoropyrimidine. It can also be administered in combination with irinotecan in patients refractory to other irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens. Panitumumab is only indicated as a single agent after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens. In Ontario, patients with advanced colorectal cancer who are refractory to chemotherapy may be offered the targeted anti-EGFR treatments cetuximab or panitumumab. Eligibility for these treatments is based on the KRAS status of their tumour, derived from tissue collected from surgical or biopsy specimens. It is believed that KRAS status is not affected by treatments, therefore, for patients for whom surgical tissue is available for KRAS testing, additional biopsies prior to treatment with these targeted agents is not necessary. For patients that have not undergone surgery or for whom surgical tissue is not available, a biopsy of either the primary or metastatic site is required to determine their KRAS status. This is possible as status at the metastatic and primary tumour sites is considered to be similar.To determine if there is predictive value of KRAS testing in guiding treatment decisions with anti-EGFR targeted therapies in advanced colorectal cancer patients refractory to chemotherapy.The Medical Advisory Secretariat followed its standard procedures and on May 18, 2010, searched the following electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and The International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment database. The subject headings and keywords searched included colorectal cancer, cetuximab, panitumumab, and KRAS testing. The search was further restricted to English-language articles published between January 1, 2009 and May 18, 2010 resulting in 1335 articles for review. Excluded were case reports, comments, editorials, nonsystematic reviews, and letters. Studies published from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2008 were identified in a health technology assessment conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), published in 2010. In total, 14 observational studies were identified for inclusion in this EBA: 4 for cetuximab monotherapy, 7 for the cetuximab-irinotecan combination therapy, and 3 to be included in the review for panitumumab monotherapyEnglish-language articles, and English or French-language HTAs published from January 2005 to May 2010, inclusive.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, including single arm treatment studies that include KRAS testing.Studies with data on main outcomes of interest, overall and progression-free survival.Studies of third line treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to chemotherapy.For the cetuximab-irinotecan evaluation, studies in which at least 70% of patients in the study received this combination therapy.Studies whose entire sample was included in subsequent publications which have been included in this EBA.Studies in pediatric populations.Case reports, comments, editorials, or letters. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Overall survival (OS), medianProgression-free-survival (PFS), median.Response rates.Adverse event rates.Quality of life (QOL). SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: CETUXIMAB OR PANITUMUMAB MONOTHERAPY: Based on moderate GRADE observational evidence, there is improvement in PFS and OS favouring patients without the KRAS mutation (KRAS wildtype, or KRAS WT) compared to those with the mutation. CETUXIMAB-IRINOTECAN COMBINATION THERAPY: There is low GRADE evidence that testing for KRAS may optimize survival benefits in patients without the KRAS mutation (KRAS wildtype, or KRAS WT) compared to those with the mutation. However, cetuximab-irinotecan combination treatments based on KRAS status discount any effect of cetuximab in possibly reversing resistance to irinotecan in patients with the mutation, as observed effects were lower than for patients without the mutation. Clinical experts have raised concerns about the biological plausibility of this observation and this conclusion would, therefore, be regarded as hypothesis generating. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were conducted incorporating estimates of effectiveness from this systematic review. Evaluation of relative cost-effectiveness, based on a decision-analytic cost-utility analysis, assessed testing for KRAS genetic mutations versus no testing in the context of treatment with cetuximab monotherapy, panitumumab monotherapy, cetuximab in combination with irinotecan, and best supportive care. Of importance to note is that the cost-effectiveness analysis focused on the impact of testing for KRAS mutations compared to no testing in the context of different treatment options, and does not assess the cost-effectiveness of the drug treatments alone.KRAS status is predictive of outcomes in cetuximab and panitumumab monotherapy, and in cetuximab-irinotecan combination therapy. While KRAS testing is cost-effective for all strategies considered, it is not equally cost-effective for all treatment options.",2010-01-12086,23074403,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,Health Quality Ontario,2010,10 / 25,1-49,No,23074403,"Health Quality Ontario; KRAS Testing for Anti-EGFR Therapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis, Ont Health Technol Assess Ser, ; 10(25):1915-7398; 1-49",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Performing KRAS testing for cetuximab with irinotecan combination therapy vs. Best supportive care (NoKRAS test, no treatment)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,42710,Canada,2009,45358.79

Panitumumab is only indicated as a single agent after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens. In Ontario, patients with advanced colorectal cancer who are refractory to chemotherapy may be offered the targeted anti-EGFR treatments cetuximab or panitumumab. Eligibility for these treatments is based on the KRAS status of their tumour, derived from tissue collected from surgical or biopsy specimens. It is believed that KRAS status is not affected by treatments, therefore, for patients for whom surgical tissue is available for KRAS testing, additional biopsies prior to treatment with these targeted agents is not necessary. For patients that have not undergone surgery or for whom surgical tissue is not available, a biopsy of either the primary or metastatic site is required to determine their KRAS status. This is possible as status at the metastatic and primary tumour sites is considered to be similar.To determine if there is predictive value of KRAS testing in guiding treatment decisions with anti-EGFR targeted therapies in advanced colorectal cancer patients refractory to chemotherapy.The Medical Advisory Secretariat followed its standard procedures and on May 18, 2010, searched the following electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and The International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment database. The subject headings and keywords searched included colorectal cancer, cetuximab, panitumumab, and KRAS testing. The search was further restricted to English-language articles published between January 1, 2009 and May 18, 2010 resulting in 1335 articles for review. Excluded were case reports, comments, editorials, nonsystematic reviews, and letters.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: CETUXIMAB OR PANITUMUMAB MONOTHERAPY: Based on moderate GRADE observational evidence, there is improvement in PFS and OS favouring patients without the KRAS mutation (KRAS wildtype, or KRAS WT) compared to those with the mutation. CETUXIMAB-IRINOTECAN COMBINATION THERAPY: There is low GRADE evidence that testing for KRAS may optimize survival benefits in patients without the KRAS mutation (KRAS wildtype, or KRAS WT) compared to those with the mutation. However, cetuximab-irinotecan combination treatments based on KRAS status discount any effect of cetuximab in possibly reversing resistance to irinotecan in patients with the mutation, as observed effects were lower than for patients without the mutation. Clinical experts have raised concerns about the biological plausibility of this observation and this conclusion would, therefore, be regarded as hypothesis generating. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were conducted incorporating estimates of effectiveness from this systematic review. Evaluation of relative cost-effectiveness, based on a decision-analytic cost-utility analysis, assessed testing for KRAS genetic mutations versus no testing in the context of treatment with cetuximab monotherapy, panitumumab monotherapy, cetuximab in combination with irinotecan, and best supportive care. Of importance to note is that the cost-effectiveness analysis focused on the impact of testing for KRAS mutations compared to no testing in the context of different treatment options, and does not assess the cost-effectiveness of the drug treatments alone.KRAS status is predictive of outcomes in cetuximab and panitumumab monotherapy, and in cetuximab-irinotecan combination therapy.

Economic analyses are also being conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of KRAS testing. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is usually defined as stage IV disease according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumour node metastasis (TNM) system or stage D in the Duke's classification system. Patients with advanced colorectal cancer (mCRC) either present with metastatic disease or develop it through disease progression. KRAS (Kristen-RAS, a member of the rat sarcoma virus (ras) gene family of oncogenes) is frequently mutated in epithelial cancers such as colorectal cancer, with mutations occurring in mutational hotspots (codons 12 and 13) of the KRAS protein. Involved in EGFR-mediated signalling of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, enhanced cell motility and neoangiogenesis, a mutation in the KRAS gene is believed to be involved in cancer pathogenesis. Such a mutation is also hypothesized to be involved in resistance to targeted anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase activity) treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab, hence, the important in evaluating the evidence on the predictive value of KRAS testing in this context. KRAS MUTATION TESTING IN ADVANCED COLORECTAL CANCER: Both cetuximab and panitumumab are indicated by Health Canada in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumours are WT for the KRAS gene.

Such a mutation is also hypothesized to be involved in resistance to targeted anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase activity) treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab, hence, the important in evaluating the evidence on the predictive value of KRAS testing in this context. KRAS MUTATION TESTING IN ADVANCED COLORECTAL CANCER: Both cetuximab and panitumumab are indicated by Health Canada in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumours are WT for the KRAS gene. Cetuximab may be offered as monotherapy in patients intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy or in patients who have failed both irinotecan and oxaliplatin-based regimens and who received a fluoropyrimidine. It can also be administered in combination with irinotecan in patients refractory to other irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens. Panitumumab is only indicated as a single agent after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens. In Ontario, patients with advanced colorectal cancer who are refractory to chemotherapy may be offered the targeted anti-EGFR treatments cetuximab or panitumumab. Eligibility for these treatments is based on the KRAS status of their tumour, derived from tissue collected from surgical or biopsy specimens. It is believed that KRAS status is not affected by treatments, therefore, for patients for whom surgical tissue is available for KRAS testing, additional biopsies prior to treatment with these targeted agents is not necessary. For patients that have not undergone surgery or for whom surgical tissue is not available, a biopsy of either the primary or metastatic site is required to determine their KRAS status. This is possible as status at the metastatic and primary tumour sites is considered to be similar.To determine if there is predictive value of KRAS testing in guiding treatment decisions with anti-EGFR targeted therapies in advanced colorectal cancer patients refractory to chemotherapy.The Medical Advisory Secretariat followed its standard procedures and on May 18, 2010, searched the following electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and The International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment database. The subject headings and keywords searched included colorectal cancer, cetuximab, panitumumab, and KRAS testing. The search was further restricted to English-language articles published between January 1, 2009 and May 18, 2010 resulting in 1335 articles for review. Excluded were case reports, comments, editorials, nonsystematic reviews, and letters. Studies published from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2008 were identified in a health technology assessment conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), published in 2010. In total, 14 observational studies were identified for inclusion in this EBA: 4 for cetuximab monotherapy, 7 for the cetuximab-irinotecan combination therapy, and 3 to be included in the review for panitumumab monotherapyEnglish-language articles, and English or French-language HTAs published from January 2005 to May 2010, inclusive.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, including single arm treatment studies that include KRAS testing.Studies with data on main outcomes of interest, overall and progression-free survival.Studies of third line treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to chemotherapy.For the cetuximab-irinotecan evaluation, studies in which at least 70% of patients in the study received this combination therapy.Studies whose entire sample was included in subsequent publications which have been included in this EBA.Studies in pediatric populations.Case reports, comments, editorials, or letters. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Overall survival (OS), medianProgression-free-survival (PFS), median.Response rates.Adverse event rates.Quality of life (QOL). SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: CETUXIMAB OR PANITUMUMAB MONOTHERAPY: Based on moderate GRADE observational evidence, there is improvement in PFS and OS favouring patients without the KRAS mutation (KRAS wildtype, or KRAS WT) compared to those with the mutation. CETUXIMAB-IRINOTECAN COMBINATION THERAPY: There is low GRADE evidence that testing for KRAS may optimize survival benefits in patients without the KRAS mutation (KRAS wildtype, or KRAS WT) compared to those with the mutation. However, cetuximab-irinotecan combination treatments based on KRAS status discount any effect of cetuximab in possibly reversing resistance to irinotecan in patients with the mutation, as observed effects were lower than for patients without the mutation. Clinical experts have raised concerns about the biological plausibility of this observation and this conclusion would, therefore, be regarded as hypothesis generating. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were conducted incorporating estimates of effectiveness from this systematic review. Evaluation of relative cost-effectiveness, based on a decision-analytic cost-utility analysis, assessed testing for KRAS genetic mutations versus no testing in the context of treatment with cetuximab monotherapy, panitumumab monotherapy, cetuximab in combination with irinotecan, and best supportive care. Of importance to note is that the cost-effectiveness analysis focused on the impact of testing for KRAS mutations compared to no testing in the context of different treatment options, and does not assess the cost-effectiveness of the drug treatments alone.KRAS status is predictive of outcomes in cetuximab and panitumumab monotherapy, and in cetuximab-irinotecan combination therapy. While KRAS testing is cost-effective for all strategies considered, it is not equally cost-effective for all treatment options.",2010-01-12086,23074403,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,Health Quality Ontario,2010,10 / 25,1-49,No,23074403,"Health Quality Ontario; KRAS Testing for Anti-EGFR Therapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis, Ont Health Technol Assess Ser, ; 10(25):1915-7398; 1-49",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Performing KRAS testing for panitumumab therapy vs. Best supportive care (No KRAS test, no treatment)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,47795,Canada,2009,50759.15

Research design and methods: Treatment pathways for scalp psoriasis patients in primary care were defined by Scottish prescribing statistics, an interview programme and published sources. The extensive 1-year Markov model included 12 different topical treatment pathways, each simulating three lines of therapy. Seven pathways contained the TCF gel in first-, second- or third-line. The remaining five pathways were included as comparators, reflecting the heterogeneity across clinical practice. The cost effectiveness of TCF gel was compared to the average of five non-TCF gel pathways. The clinical effectiveness measure was the ability of topical treatments to control disease at 4 weeks. Response rates were derived from indirect comparisons of ten randomised controlled trials. Utilities were elicited from SF-36 (v2) scores in one TCF gel trial. The main outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. Results: TCF gel used first-, second- or third-line was projected to increase QALYs (around 0.0025) with cost savings per patient (£20-30) over 1 year. The study analysis acknowledged a number of limitations including lack of quality comparator data, the need to make assumptions in the absence of evidence and lack of model validation. However the results showed that TCF gel was the dominant treatment strategy across a broad range of credible scenarios. Conclusions: Scalp psoriasis is difficult to treat.

Effectiveness outcomes were derived from a recent systematic review; patient utilities and resource use data were sourced from the literature. Results: Based on our analysis the baseline SLNB strategy is dominated by the strategies of replacing SLNB with either MRI or PET. The strategy of replacing SLNB with MRI has the highest total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lowest total costs. However, clinical evidence for MRI is based on a limited number of small studies and replacing SLNB with MRI or PET leads to more false-positive and false-negative cases. The strategy of adding MRI before SLNB is cost-effective, but subject to greater uncertainty. Conclusions: Based on this analysis the most cost-effective strategy is to replace SLNB with MRI.

7670,Health benefits and cost-effectiveness of primary genetic screening for lynch syndrome in the general population,"In current clinical practice, genetic testing to detect Lynch syndrome mutations ideally begins with diagnostic testing of an individual affected with cancer before offering predictive testing to at-risk relatives. An alternative strategy that warrants exploration involves screening unaffected individuals via demographic and family histories, and offering genetic testing to those individuals whose risks for carrying a mutation exceed a selected threshold. Whether this approach would improve health outcomes in a manner that is cost-effective relative to current standards of care has yet to be demonstrated. To do so, we developed a simulation framework that integrated models of colorectal and endometrial cancers with a 5-generation family history model to predict health and economic outcomes of 20 primary screening strategies (at a wide range of compliance levels) aimed at detecting individuals with mismatch repair gene mutations and their at-risk relatives. These strategies were characterized by (i) different screening ages for starting risk assessment and (ii) different risk thresholds above which to implement genetic testing. For each strategy, 100,000 simulated individuals, representative of the U.S. population, were followed from the age of 20, and the outcomes were compared with current practice. Findings indicated that risk assessment starting at ages 25, 30, or 35, followed by genetic testing of those with mutation risks exceeding 5%, reduced colorectal and endometrial cancer incidence in mutation carriers by approximately 12.4% and 8.8%, respectively. For a population of 100,000 individuals containing 392 mutation carriers, this strategy increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) by approximately 135 with an average cost-effectiveness ratio of $26,000 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of screening for mismatch repair gene mutations is comparable to that of accepted cancer screening activities in the general population such as colorectal cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, and breast cancer screening. These results suggest that primary screening of individuals for mismatch repair gene mutations, starting with risk assessment between the ages of 25 and 35, followed by genetic testing of those whose risk exceeds 5%, is a strategy that could improve health outcomes in a cost-effective manner relative to current practice.

7676,Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"Background: Warfarin reduces the risk for ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increases the risk for hemorrhage. Dabigatran is a fixed-dose, oral direct thrombin inhibitor with similar or reduced rates of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage in patients with AF compared with those of warfarin. Objective: To estimate the quality-adjusted survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness of dabigatran compared with adjusted-dose warfarin for preventing ischemic stroke in patients 65 years or older with nonvalvular AF. Design: Markov decision model. Data Sources: The RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial and other published studies of anticoagulation. The cost of dabigatran was estimated on the basis of pricing in the United Kingdom. Target Population: Patients aged 65 years or older with nonvalvular AF and risk factors for stroke (CHADS(2) score =1 or equivalent) and no contraindications to anticoagulation. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Warfarin anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0); dabigatran, 110 mg twice daily (low dose); and dabigatran, 150 mg twice daily (high dose). Outcome Measures: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2008 U.S. dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results of Base-Case Analysis: The quality-adjusted life expectancy was 10.28 QALYs with warfarin, 10.70 QALYs with low-dose dabigatran, and 10.84 QALYs with high-dose dabigatran. Total costs were $143 193 for warfarin, $164 576 for low-dose dabigatran, and $168 398 for high-dose dabigatran. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with warfarin were $51 229 per QALY for low-dose dabigatran and $45 372 per QALY for high-dose dabigatran. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: The model was sensitive to the cost of dabigatran but was relatively insensitive to other model inputs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased to $50 000 per QALY at a cost of $13.70 per day for high-dose dabigatran but remained less than $85 000 per QALY over the full range of model inputs evaluated. The cost-effectiveness of high-dose dabigatran improved with increasing risk for stroke and intracranial hemorrhage. Limitation: Event rates were largely derived from a single randomized clinical trial and extrapolated to a 35-year time frame from clinical trials with approximately 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: In patients aged 65 years or older with nonvalvular AF at increased risk for stroke (CHADS(2) score =1 or equivalent), dabigatran may be a cost-effective alternative to warfarin depending on pricing in the United States.

Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a once-daily GLP-1 analog Victoza [Novo Nordisk] versus a thiazolidinedione (TZD), rosiglitazone in patients with T2DM. Both treatment groups included background therapy with glimepiride. Research design and methods: The CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to project and compare 35-year clinical and economic outcomes associated with liraglutide 1.2?mg?+?glimepiride and liraglutide 1.8?mg?+?glimepiride versus rosiglitazone 4?mg?+?glimepiride. Baseline cohort characteristics (HbA(1c) (8.4%), age, duration of disease, sex, body-mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipids) were based on the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes-1 (LEAD-1) trial. Outcomes: Primary outcomes included life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: When compared to rosiglitazone, liraglutide 1.2?mg and 1.8?mg increased mean LE by 0.968 and 1.041 years, and QALYs by 0.764 and 0.837, respectively.

7682,Is behavioral graded activity cost-effective in comparison with manual therapy for patients with sub-acute neck pain? An economic evaluation alongside a randomized clinical trial,"ABSTRACT: Study design. An economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial comparing behavioural graded activity (BGA) with manual therapy (MT).Objective. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of BGA in comparison with MT for patients with sub-acute neck pain from a societal perspective.Summary of Background Data. Neck pain is common and poses an important socioeconomic burden to society. Data on the cost-effectiveness of treatments for neck pain are scarce.Methods. A randomized clinical trial was conducted, involving 146 patients with subacute nonspecific neck pain. The BGA program can be described as a time-contingent increase in activities from baseline toward predetermined goals. Manual therapy consists of specific spinal mobilization techniques and exercises. Clinical outcomes included recovery, pain, disability and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were measured from a societal perspective using cost diaries. The follow-up period was 52 weeks. Multiple imputation was used for missing cost and effect data. Uncertainty surrounding cost differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was estimated using bootstrapping. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated.Results. BGA had no significant effect on recovery or QALYs gained in comparison with MT, but pain and disability did improve significantly in the BGA group in comparison with MT. Total societal costs in the BGA group were non-significantly higher than in the MT group. Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that BGA is not cost-effective in comparison with MT for recovery and QALYs gained. Substantial investments are needed to reach a 0.95 probability that BGA is cost-effective in comparison with MT for pain and disability.Conclusion. Based on the data presented, we consider BGA not cost-effective in comparison with MT.",2011-01-07102,21343847,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Judith E Bosmans,2011,/,,No,21343847,"Judith E Bosmans; Jan J M Pool; Henrica C W de Vet; Maurits W van Tulder; Raymond W J G Ostelo; Is behavioral graded activity cost-effective in comparison with manual therapy for patients with sub-acute neck pain?

7683,Cost-effectiveness of an emergency department-based early sepsis resuscitation protocol,"OBJECTIVES:: Guidelines recommend that sepsis be treated with an early resuscitation protocol such as early goal-directed therapy. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing early goal-directed therapy as a routine protocol. DESIGN:: Prospective before and after study. SETTING:: Large urban hospital emergency department with >110,000 visits/yr. PATIENTS:: The target population was patients with consensus criteria for septic shock. We excluded those with age <18 yrs, no aggressive care desired, or need for immediate surgery. INTERVENTIONS:: Clinical and cost data were prospectively collected on two groups: 1) patients from 1 yr before; and 2) 2 yrs after implementing early goal-directed therapy as standard of care. Before phase, patients received nonprotocolized care at attending discretion. The primary outcomes were 1-yr mortality, discounted life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years. Using costs and quality-adjusted life-years, we constructed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and performed a net monetary benefit analysis, producing the probability that the intervention was cost-effective given different values for the willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS:: Two hundred eighty-five subjects, 79 in the before and 206 in the after phases, were enrolled. Treatment with early goal-directed therapy was associated with an increased hospital cost of $7028 and an increase in both discounted sepsis-adjusted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years of 1.5 and 1.3 yrs, respectively. Early goal-directed therapy use was associated with a cost of $5397 per quality-adjusted life-years gained and the net monetary benefit analysis indicates a 98% probability (p = .038) that early goal-directed therapy is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years.

7684,Economic evaluation of caspofungin versus liposomal amphotericin B for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia in Sweden,"Abstract Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of caspofungin versus liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia in Sweden. Methods: With a decision-analytic model, the expected direct costs, life-years lost and quality adjusted life-years lost were estimated for an average patient in Sweden. Efficacy/tolerability data were obtained from analysis of a randomized, double-blind multinational trial. Life expectancy, medical resource use and unit costs data were gathered from the literature and expert opinion. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the impact of uncertainty in data on outcomes. Results: The direct cost with caspofungin amounted to 233,851 SEK (95% uncertainty interval 225,091-242,210) and with L-AmB to 271,921 SEK (262,935-281,363), a difference of 38,070 SEK (31,745-44,811) favouring caspofungin. Treatment with caspofungin resulted in 0.25 (0.01-0.55) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved in comparison to L-AmB. Given the uncertainty in the estimates there is a >95% probability that caspofungin is economically dominant over L-AmB, i.e. cost-saving and QALY-saving. Conclusion: Given the underlying assumptions and data used, caspofungin is expected to be cost-effective with at least comparable outcomes compared to L-AmB for the empirical treatment of patients with suspected fungal infections in Sweden.",2011-01-07115,21332286,Scand J Infect Dis,Shalini Naik,2011,/,,No,21332286,"Shalini Naik; Johan Lundberg; Ritesh Kumar; Jan Sjolin; Jeroen P Jansen; Economic evaluation of caspofungin versus liposomal amphotericin B for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia in Sweden, Scand J Infect Dis, 2011-Feb-18; ():0036-5548",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Caspofungin 70 mg on day 1, followed by 50mg qid vs. Liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/kg qid",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-152280,Sweden,2009,-24155.41
7685,Cost-utility of aspirin and proton pump inhibitors for primary prevention,"BACKGROUND: Aspirin reduces myocardial infarction but increases gastrointestinal tract (GI) bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce upper GI bleeding. We estimate the cost-utility of aspirin treatment with or without a PPI for coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention among men at different risks for CHD and GI bleeding. METHODS: We updated a Markov model to compare costs and outcomes of low-dose aspirin plus PPI (omeprazole, 20 mg/d), low-dose aspirin alone, or no treatment for CHD prevention. We performed lifetime analyses in men with different risks for cardiovascular events and GI bleeding. Aspirin reduced nonfatal myocardial infarction by 30%, increased total stroke by 6%, and increased GI bleeding risk 2-fold. Adding a PPI reduced upper GI bleeding by 80%. Annual aspirin cost was $13.99; the generic PPI cost was $200.00. RESULTS: In 45-year-old men with a 10-year CHD risk of 10% and 0.8 per 1000 annual GI bleeding risk, aspirin ($17,571 and 18.67 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) was more effective and less costly than no treatment ($18,483 and 18.44 QALYs). Compared with aspirin alone, aspirin plus PPI ($21,037 and 18.68 QALYs) had an incremental cost per QALY of $447,077. Results were similar in 55- and 65-year-old men. The incremental cost per QALY of adding a PPI was less than $50,000 per QALY at annual GI bleeding probabilities greater than 4 to 6 per 1000. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with aspirin for CHD prevention is less costly and more effective than no treatment in men older than 45 years with greater than 10-year, 10% CHD risks.

Clin Transplant 2011 DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01411.x. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract: Islet cell transplantation is in clinical development for type 1 diabetes. There are no data on the cost in relationship to its benefits. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis and made a comparison with standard insulin therapy, using Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulations. The patient population was adults aged 20 yr suffering from hypoglycemia unawareness. Data were estimates from literature and clinical trials: costs were based on the situation in the United States. For insulin therapy, cumulative cost per patient during a 20-yr follow-up was $663 000, and cumulative effectiveness was 9.3 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), the average cost-effectiveness ratio being $71 000 per QALY. Islet transplantation had a cumulative cost of $519 000, a cumulative effectiveness of 10.9 QALY, and an average cost-effectiveness ratio of $47 800. During the first 10 yr, costs for transplantation were higher, but cumulative effectiveness was higher from the start onwards. In sensitivity analyses, the need for one instead of two transplants during the first year did not affect the conclusions, and islet transplantation remained cost-saving up to an initial cost of the procedure of $240 000. This exploratory evaluation shows that islet cell transplantation is more effective than standard insulin treatment, and becomes cost-saving at about 9-10 yr after transplantation.",2011-01-07130,21323736,Clin Transplant,Jessica Beckwith,2011,/,,No,21323736,"Jessica Beckwith; John A Nyman; Brian Flanagan; Rudolf Schrover; Henk-Jan Schuurman; A health economic analysis of clinical islet transplantation, Clin Transplant, 2011-Feb-16; ():0902-0063",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Islet transplantation vs. Insulin therapy,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-90000,United States,2007,-112340.92

Despite growing financial pressure in health care systems worldwide, cost-effectiveness studies of RRT modalities are scarce. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of costs, quality of life and survival to compare three different assignment strategies to chronic RRT in Europe. RESULTS: Mean annual treatment costs for haemodialysis were €43?600 during the first 12 months, €40?000 between 13 and 24 months and €40?600 beyond 25 months after initiation of treatment.

7690,The cost-effectiveness of C-reactive protein testing and rosuvastatin treatment for patients with normal cholesterol levels,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of applying the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial results into clinical practice. BACKGROUND: The JUPITER trial found that rosuvastatin reduces vascular events in apparently healthy subjects with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) but normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. The implications of expanding treatment recommendations based on these results have not been evaluated. METHODS: We constructed a cost-effectiveness model of men = 50 years and women = 60 years with LDL cholesterol levels of <130 mg/dl and no known cardiovascular disease. We compared: 1) hs-CRP testing followed by rosuvastatin treatment for patients with hs-CRP levels = 2.0 mg/l; and 2) usual care (i.e., no testing and no treatment). Estimates of treatment effectiveness were based on the JUPITER trial and were varied in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Among patients with LDL <130 mg/dl and hs-CRP levels = 2.0 mg/l, rosuvastatin had an incremental cost-effectiveness of $25,198 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to usual care. If the effectiveness of rosuvastatin were 50% of that observed in JUPITER, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would increase to $50,871 per QALY. Implementing this strategy only in patients with a Framingham risk score = 10% yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness of $14,205 per QALY. Among such intermediate-risk patients, a JUPITER-based strategy becomes cost-saving at a rosuvastatin price of < $0.86 per day.

7691,"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and Radiofrequency Ablation for Medically Inoperable, Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","PURPOSE: The standard management of medically inoperable Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) conventionally has been fractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). The relatively poor local control rate and inconvenience associated with this therapy have prompted the development of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), a technique that delivers very high doses of irradiation typically over 3 to 5 sessions. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has also been investigated as a less costly, single-day therapy that thermally ablates small, peripheral tumors. The cost-effectiveness of these three techniques has never been compared. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a Markov model to describe health states of 65-year-old men with medically inoperable NSCLC after treatment with 3D-CRT, SBRT, and RFA. Given their frail state, patients were assumed to receive supportive care after recurrence. Utility values, recurrence risks, and costs were adapted from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in these parameters. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for SBRT over 3D-CRT was $6,000/quality-adjusted life-year, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for SBRT over RFA was $14,100/quality-adjusted life-year. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust across a range of tumor sizes, patient utility values, and costs. This result was confirmed with probabilistic sensitivity analyses that varied local control rates and utilities.

7693,Short-course adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in early stage breast cancer in Finland: Cost-effectiveness and value of information analysis based on the 5-year follow-up results of the FinHer Trial,"Abstract Background. Trastuzumab is a standard treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer in many countries, and it is usually given as a one year adjuvant treatment. However, its cost-effectiveness has not been assessed in Finland. The Finland Herceptin (FinHer) trial has compared a shorter 9-week treatment protocol against no trastuzumab with promising results. The aim of this study was to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of the 9-week treatment based on the recently published five-year follow-up results of the FinHer trial. Methods. An evaluation model of breast cancer treatment was constructed using fitted survival estimates and a long-term Markov model. The cost-effectiveness of 9-week adjuvant treatment was assessed in a Finnish setting, compared to treatment without trastuzumab. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective, and a 3% discount rate was applied for future costs and outcomes. Value of information analysis was performed to estimate the potential value of further research. Results. According to the probabilistic analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €12 000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY), and €9300 per life year gained (LYG), when comparing adjuvant trastuzumab therapy to standard treatment without trastuzumab. The modelled incremental outcomes for trastuzumab treatment were 0.66 QALY and 0.85 LYG for a lifetime perspective. Value of information analysis showed that additional research on treatment effects would be most valuable for reducing uncertainty in the adoption decision. Conclusions. Adjuvant 9-week trastuzumab is likely to be a cost-effective treatment in the Finnish setting. Results from an ongoing trial comparing adjuvant 9-week treatment with the 12-month treatment will play a key role in addressing the uncertainty related to the treatment effect and potential cost-effectiveness of these two treatment protocols.",2011-01-07153,21299447,Acta Oncol,Timo T Purmonen,2011,50 / 3,344-52,No,21299447,"Timo T Purmonen; Emma P?nk?l?inen; Juha H O Turunen; Christian Asseburg; Janne A Martikainen; Short-course adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in early stage breast cancer in Finland: Cost-effectiveness and value of information analysis based on the 5-year follow-up results of the FinHer Trial, Acta Oncol, 2011-Apr; 50(3):0284-186X; 344-52",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,9 week trastuzumab treatment vs. Treatment without trastuzumab,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,12000,Euro,2008,21241.58

METHODS:: We designed a mathematical model to investigate the most cost-effective frequency with which an HIV-seronegative tester should re-test for HIV. Cost of HIV counseling and testing (HCT), linkage to care, treatment costs, disease progression and mortality, and HIV transmission are modeled for three hypothetical cohorts with annual HIV incidence of 0.8%, 1.3%, and 4.0%, respectively. The model compares costs, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and secondary infections averted from testing intervals ranging from 3 months to 30 years. Input parameters from sub-Saharan Africa were used and explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS:: Accounting for secondary infections averted, the most cost-effective testing frequency was every 7.5 years for 0.8% incidence ($701 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained), every 5 years for 1.3% incidence ($681/QALY), and every two years for 4.0% incidence ($635/QALY).

7697,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of a Randomized Study Comparing Radiosurgery With Radiosurgery and Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in Patients With 1 to 3 Brain Metastases,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we compare 2 treatment options and determine cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. METHODS: We carried out a decision analysis populated with data from patients with brain metastasis in a concurrent trial randomized to either stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and observation or SRS and whole brain radiation therapy. Outcomes included actual life years saved (LYS), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs used were from the healthcare perspective and utilities were captured through a time-trade-off method, using 10-year, 5-year, and 1-year time horizons. One-way sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine robustness of the decision analysis model. RESULTS: Compared with SRS and whole brain radiation therapy, SRS and observation not only had a higher average cost ($74,000 vs $119,000, respectively) but also a higher average effectiveness (0.60 LYS vs 1.64 LYS, respectively) with an ICER of $44,231/LYS or $41,783/QALY (with utilities captured using a 10-year horizon). Slightly higher ICER estimates were achieved with utilities captured using the other time horizons ($43,280/QALY and $44,064/QALY, respectively). Sensitivity analysis showed that the following variables had the highest impact on the ICER: probability of no recurrence in recursive-partitioning analysis class 2 after SRS and observation; probability of being alive after SRS and observation in recursive-partitioning analysis class 2 and being treated for recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other interventions in the $50,000 to $100,000/QALY cost-effectiveness range, the application of SRS and observation, with subsequent neurosurgical management of recurrences, is shown to be a reasonable treatment modality for brain metastases.",2011-01-07159,21293245,Am J Clin Oncol,Lincy S Lal,2011,/,,No,21293245,"Lincy S Lal; Stacey DaCosta Byfield; Eric L Chang; Luisa Franzini; Lesley-Ann Miller; Rebecca Arbuckle; Liezl Reasonda; Chun Feng; Andrea Adamus; John Michael Swint; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of a Randomized Study Comparing Radiosurgery With Radiosurgery and Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in Patients With 1 to 3 Brain Metastases, Am J Clin Oncol, 2011-Feb-02; ():1537-453X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and observation vs. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and brain radiation therapy (WBRT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,41783,United States,2007,52154.89

Trans-obturator tape compared with tension-free vaginal tape in the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence: a cost utility analysis. BJOG 2011;118:550-556. Objective To conduct an economic evaluation of the use of trans-obturator tape (TOT) compared with tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) in the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. Design Cost utility analysis from public-payer perspective, conducted alongside a randomised clinical trial (RCT). Setting Health services provided in Alberta, Canada. Population A total of 194 women who participated in the RCT, followed to 1 year from surgery. Methods Data collected on all women in the RCT, over 12 months following surgery. Comparisons undertaken between RCT groups for cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Multiple imputation used for the 10% missing data. Bootstrapping used to account for sampling uncertainty. One-way sensitivity analysis conducted for productivity loss due to time away from work. Main outcome measures Utility - 15D questionnaire was used to calculate QALYs. Costs over 12 months-from trial data, health provider and provincial ministry of health. Results The TOT group had a non-significant average saving of $1133 (95% CI -2793; 442), with no difference in average QALYs between groups (95% CI -0.02; 0.01). TOT was cost-saving in over 80% of bootstrapping replications, over a wide range of willingness-to-pay. Conclusion The bootstrapping replication results suggest that TOT could be cost-effective compared with TVT in the treatment of SUI. However, these results must be confirmed by longer-term assessment of clinical and economic outcomes, because of concern that surgical tape palpable at 12 months may lead to vaginal erosion and further treatment.",2011-01-07162,21291510,BJOG,D Lier,2011,118 / 5,550-556,No,21291510,"D Lier; S Ross; S Tang; M Robert; P Jacobs; Calgary Women's Pelvic Health Re; Trans-obturator tape compared with tension-free vaginal tape in the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence: a cost utility analysis, BJOG, 2011-Apr; 118(5):1470-0328; 550-556",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Trans-obturator tape (TOT) vs. Tension-free vaginal tape (TVT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-113300,Canada,2007,-132366.65

Methods: A Markov microsimulation model was developed to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on CD4 and HIV RNA levels, coronary heart disease (CHD), AIDS, opportunistic infections (OIs), diarrhea, and hyperbilirubinemia. A million-member cohort of HIV-1-infected, treatment-naïve adults progressed at 3-month intervals through eight health states. Baseline characteristics, virologic suppression, cholesterol changes, and diarrhea and hyperbilirubinemia rates were based on 96-week CASTLE trial results. HIV mortality, OI rates, adherence, costs, utilities, and CHD risk were from literature and experts. Limitations: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) may be overestimated because the ATV?+?r treatment effect was based on an intention-to-treat analysis. The QALY weights used for diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia, and CHD events are uncertain; however, the ICER remained <$50,000/QALY when these values were varied in sensitivity analyses. Results: ATV?+?r patients received first-line therapy longer than LPV/r patients (97.3 vs. 70.7 months), had longer quality-adjusted survival (11.02 vs. 10.76 years), similar overall survival (18.52 vs. 18.51 years), and higher costs ($275,986 vs. 269,160). ATR?+?r patients had lower rates of AIDS (19.08 vs. 20.05 cases/1,000 patient-years), OIs (0.44 vs. 0.52), diarrhea (1.27 vs. 6.26), and CHD events (5.44 vs. 5.51), but higher hyperbilirubinemia rates (6.99 vs. 0.25). ATV?+?r added 0.26 QALYs at a cost of $6826, for $26,421/QALY. Conclusions: By more effectively reducing viral load with less gastrointestinal toxicity and a better lipid profile, ATV?+?r lowered rates of AIDS and CHD, increased quality-adjusted survival, and was cost effective (<$50,000/QALY) compared with LPV/r.",2011-01-07165,21288058,J Med Econ,Michael S Broder,2011,/,,Yes,21288058,"Michael S Broder; Eunice Y Chang; Tanya G K Bentley; Timothy Juday; Jonathan Uy; Cost effectiveness of atazanavir-ritonavir versus lopinavir-ritonavir in treatment-naïve human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in the United States, J Med Econ, 2011-Feb-02; ():1369-6998",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) with tenofovir-emtricitabine vs. Atazanavir-ritonavir (ATV+r) with tenofovir-emtricitabine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,26421,United States,2008,31760.1
7700,"Comparative clinical- and cost-effectiveness of candesartan and losartan in the management of hypertension and heart failure: a systematic review, meta- and cost-utility analysis","The UK National Health Service (NHS) currently spends in excess of £250 million per annum on angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure; with candesartan currently dominating the market. With the recent introduction of generic losartan, we set out to directly compare the branded market leader to its now cheaper alternative. The primary objectives were to compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes of candesartan and losartan in the treatment of essential hypertension and chronic heart failure, respectively. The secondary objective was to model their comparative incremental cost-effectiveness in a UK NHS setting. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2), which contains the Hypertension and Heart Group's specialist register, Medline (1950-February 2010), and Embase (1980-February 2010) were included in the search strategy. Selection criteria were randomised studies of candesartan versus losartan in adults (> 18 years). The main outcome measures were as follows: Hypertension: mean change from baseline in trough (24 h postdose) systolic and diastolic BP. Heart failure: composite of cardiovascular death and hospital admission for management of heart failure. Two reviewers applied inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Eight (three of which met inclusion criteria) and zero trials compared candesartan directly with losartan in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, respectively. A between-treatment difference of -1.96 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.40 to -1.51] for trough diastolic BP and -3.00 mmHg (95% CI -3.79 to -2.22) for trough systolic BP in favour of candesartan was observed. Based on this differential, a 10-year Markov model estimates the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained to exceed £40,000 for using candesartan in place of generic losartan. Candesartan reduces BP to a slightly greater extent when compared with losartan, however, such difference is unlikely to be cost-effective based on current acquisition costs, perceived NHS affordability thresholds and use of combination regimens. We could find no robust evidence supporting the superiority of candesartan over losartan in the treatment of heart failure. We therefore recommend using generic losartan as the ARB of choice which could save the UK NHS approximately £200 million per annum in drug costs.",2011-01-07167,21284790,Int J Clin Pract,A M Grosso,2011,65 / 3,253-63,No,21284790,"A M Grosso; P N Bodalia; R J Macallister; A D Hingorani; J C Moon; M A Scott; Comparative clinical- and cost-effectiveness of candesartan and losartan in the management of hypertension and heart failure: a systematic review, meta- and cost-utility analysis, Int J Clin Pract, 2011-Mar; 65(3):1368-5031; 253-63",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Losartan treatment vs. Candesartan treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,44930,United Kingdom,2009,78480.87
