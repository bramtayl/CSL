9701,Do different methods of modeling statin treatment effectiveness influence the optimal decision?,"Modeling studies that evaluate statin treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) use different methods to model the effect of statins. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of using different modeling methods on the optimal decision found in such studies.We used a previously developed and validated Monte Carlo-Markov model based on the Rotterdam study (RISC model). The RISC model simulates coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular death, and death due to other causes. Transition probabilities were based on 5-year risks predicted by Cox regression equations, including (among others) total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as covariates. In a cost-effectiveness analysis of implementing the ATP-III guidelines, we evaluated the impact of using 3 different modeling methods of statin effectiveness: 1) through lipid level modification: statins lower total cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol, which through the covariates in the Cox regression equations leads to a lower incidence of CHD and stroke events; 2) fixed risk reduction of CVD events: statins decrease the odds of CHD and stroke with an associated odds ratio that is assumed to be the same for each individual; 3) risk reduction of CVD events proportional to individual change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: the relative risk reduction with statin therapy on the incidence of CHD and stroke was assumed to be proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol levels for each individual. The probability that the ATP-III strategy was cost-effective, compared to usual care as observed in the Rotterdam study, was calculated for each of the 3 modeling methods for varying willingness-to-pay thresholds.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the ATP-III strategy compared with the reference strategy were ?56,642/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), ?21,369/QALY, and ?22,131/QALY for modeling methods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?50,000/QALY, the probability that the ATP-III strategy was cost-effective was about 40% for modeling method 1 and more than 90% for both methods 2 and 3. Differences in results between the modeling methods were sensitive to both the time horizon modeled and age distribution of the targetModeling the effect of statins on CVD through the modification of lipid levels produced different results and associated uncertainty than modeling it directly through a risk reduction of events.

9704,Is Surgical Fixation for Stress-Positive Unstable Ankle Fractures Cost Effective? Results of a Multicenter Randomized Control Trial,"OBJECTIVES: A recent multicenter randomized control trial demonstrated similar quality of life at 1 year after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) compared with nonoperative treatment for stress-positive unstable isolated lateral malleolar fractures. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of ORIF compared with nonoperative management of these isolated lateral malleolar fractures. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using decision tree and Markov modeling based on data from a prospective randomized control trial and previously published literature. A single-payer perspective with 1-year and lifetime time horizons was adopted. SETTING: Clinical trial data from 6 Canadian level I trauma hospitals. INTERVENTION: Lateral malleolus ORIF versus nonoperative treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The base case 1-year ICER of the ORIF treatment was $205,090 per quality-adjusted life year gained, favoring nonoperative treatment. For the lifetime time horizon, ORIF becomes the preferred treatment with an ICER of $16,404 per quality-adjusted life year gained. This conclusion is stable provided ORIF lowers the lifetime incidence of ankle arthrosis by >3% compared with nonoperative treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 33% of model simulations favored ORIF in the 1-year time horizon and 65% of simulations in the lifetime time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: From a single-payer governmental perspective, ORIF does not seem to be cost effective in the 1-year time horizon; however, if operative fixation decreases the lifetime incidence of posttraumatic ankle arthrosis by >3%, then ORIF becomes the economically preferred treatment.",2012-01-08946,22473067,J Orthop Trauma,Gerard P Slobogean,2012,26 / 11,,No,22473067,"Gerard P Slobogean; Carlo A Marra; Mohsen Sadatsafavi; David W Sanders; Canadian Orthopedic Trauma Socie; Is Surgical Fixation for Stress-Positive Unstable Ankle Fractures Cost Effective?

9708,Is Reconstruction Nailing of All Femoral Shaft Fractures Cost Effective? A Decision Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Femoral shaft fractures are usually treated with anterograde or retrograde nails that typically do not provide femoral neck fixation. Ipsilateral femoral neck fractures occur with 2.5%-10% of femoral shaft fractures; 19%-55% of associated femoral neck fractures are missed with plain films and 5%-22% with computed tomography (CT). This study was performed to determine if routine reconstruction nailing of all femoral shaft fractures with or without occult femoral neck fractures is cost effective. METHODS: A decision tree model examined the cost effectiveness of reconstruction nailing over standard intramedullary nailing for all femoral shaft fractures in which an associated femoral neck fracture was not identified on plain radiographs. As a base model, we assumed that 5% of shaft fractures had an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture, and 37% were missed and required further surgery. We assigned a small morbidity and additional cost ($680) for the use of a reconstruction nail and 2 screws. Model inputs including costs, clinical outcome probabilities, and health utilities were derived from the literature, estimated from institutional data, or assumed by the authors. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effect of the rate of associated femoral neck fracture, the rate of missed femoral neck fracture, the complication rate of reconstruction screws, the cost of the extra reconstruction screws, and the utilities of each outcome on the incremental cost effectiveness (ICER) of both strategies. Current practice in cost-effectiveness analysis uses a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained as cost effective. A secondary analysis of the use CT scans to reduce missed femoral neck fractures was also performed. RESULTS: The base model showed that the placement of reconstruction nails in all isolated femur fractures was not cost effective. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ICER was most sensitive to the cost of the reconstruction nail, hemiarthroplasty, and a missed femoral neck fracture. The ICER was affected by the rate of femoral neck fracture and the rate of missed femoral neck fracture. If the rate of missed femoral neck fractures was >38%, then reconstruction nailing was a cost-effective strategy. If the probability of an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture was >7%, then reconstruction nailing was cost effective. Protocolized CT scans had an ICER >$100,000. If the additional cost of the reconstruction nails was <$650, then it was cost effective to perform reconstruction nailing for all femoral shaft fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction nailing of femoral shaft fractures can be a cost-effective method to reduce the risks and morbidity of missed femoral neck fractures if the incremental implant costs are <$650. Routine reconstruction nailing is cost effective if the rate of associated femoral neck fracture is >7% or the rate of missed femoral neck fracture is >38%. CT scans are not a cost-effective strategy to reduce the risk and morbidity of missed femoral neck fractures if the cost is >$243. Weaknesses of this study include the reliance on low-powered studies and on estimations of some utilities and costs. To prevent the morbidity of missed or occult femoral neck fractures, the use of reconstruction nails for femoral shaft fractures is cost effective when the incremental costs of implants are <$650.",2012-01-08956,22487902,J Orthop Trauma,Scott C Faucett,2012,26 / 11,,No,22487902,"Scott C Faucett; Cory A Collinge; Kenneth J Koval; Is Reconstruction Nailing of All Femoral Shaft Fractures Cost Effective?

9709,Cost-effectiveness of 12-month therapeutic assertive community treatment as part of integrated care versus standard care in patients with schizophrenia treated with quetiapine immediate release (ACCESS trial),"To compare the 1-year cost-effectiveness of therapeutic assertive community treatment (ACT) with standard care in schizophrenia. ACT was specifically developed for patients with schizophrenia, delivered by psychosis experts highly trained in respective psychotherapies, and embedded into an integrated care system.Two catchment areas in Hamburg, Germany, with similar population size and health care structures were assigned to offer 12-month ACT (n = 64) or standard care (n = 56) to 120 first- and multiple-episode patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (DSM-IV), the latter with a history of relapse due to medication nonadherence. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on mental health care costs from a payer perspective and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as a measure of health effects during the 12-month follow-up period (2006-2007).ACT was associated with significantly lower inpatient but higher outpatient costs than standard care, resulting in nonsignificantly lower total costs (P = .27). Incremental QALYs in the ACT group were 0.1 (P < .001). Thus, the point estimate for the ICER showed dominance of ACT. The probability of an ICER below ?50,000 per QALY gained was 99.5%.The implementation of a psychotherapeutically oriented schizophrenia-specific and -experienced ACT team led to an improved patient outcome with reduced need of inpatient care. Despite the introduction of such a rather ""costly"" ACT team, treatment in ACT was cost-effective with regard to improved quality of life at comparable yearly costs.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01081418.",2012-01-08958,22490266,J Clin Psychiatry,Anne Karow,2012,68Suppl14 /,e402-8,No,22490266,"Anne Karow; Jens Reimer; Hans Helmut K?nig; Dirk Heider; Thomas Bock; Christian Huber; Daniel Sch?ttle; Klara Meister; Liz Rietschel; Gunda Ohm; Holger Schulz; Dieter Naber; Benno G Schimmelmann; Martin Lambert; Cost-effectiveness of 12-month therapeutic assertive community treatment as part of integrated care versus standard care in patients with schizophrenia treated with quetiapine immediate release (ACCESS trial), J Clin Psychiatry, 2007; 68Suppl14():0160-6689; e402-8",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Assertive community treatment (ACT)- specialized psychosis inpatient unit, 2-day-clinics, a psychosis outpatient center, occupational therapy center and a network of 6 private psychiatrists vs. Standard of care- treatment network of open and closed inpatient wards, day clinics, an outpatient center, and 8 private psychiatrists",Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-25020,Euro,2007,-42819.36
9710,Cost-utility analysis of different treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder in sexually abused children,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is diagnosed in 20% to 53% of sexually abused children and adolescents. Living with PTSD is associated with a loss of health-related quality of life. Based on the best available evidence, the NICE Guideline for PTSD in children and adolescents recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) over non-directive counselling as a more efficacious treatment. METHODS: A modelled economic evaluation conducted from the Australian mental health care system perspective estimates incremental costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of TF-CBT, TF-CBT combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and non-directive counselling. The ""no treatment"" alternative is included as a comparator. The first part of the model consists of a decision tree corresponding to 12 month follow-up outcomes observed in clinical trials. The second part consists of a 30 year Markov model representing the slow process of recovery in non-respondents and the untreated population yielding estimates of long-term quality-adjusted survival and costs. Data from the 2007 Australian Mental Health Survey was used to populate the decision analytic model. RESULTS: In the base-case and sensitivity analyses, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for all three active treatment alternatives remained less than A$7,000 per QALY gained. The base-case results indicated that non-directive counselling is dominated by TF-CBT and TF-CBT + SSRI, and that efficiency gain can be achieved by allocating more resources toward these therapies. However, this result was sensitive to variation in the clinical effectiveness parameters with non-directive counselling dominating TF-CBT and TF-CBT + SSRI under certain assumptions. The base-case results also suggest that TF-CBT + SSRI is more cost-effective than TF-CBT. CONCLUSION: Even after accounting for uncertainty in parameter estimates, the results of the modelled economic evaluation demonstrated that all psychotherapy treatments for PTSD in sexually abused children have a favourable ICER relative to no treatment. The results also highlighted the loss of quality of life in children who do not receive any psychotherapy. Results of the base-case analysis suggest that TF-CBT + SSRI is more cost-effective than TF-CBT alone, however, considering the uncertainty associated with prescribing SSRIs to children and adolescents, clinicians and parents may exercise some caution in choosing this treatment alternative.",2012-01-08959,22490433,Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,Elena Gospodarevskaya,2012,6 /,15,No,22490433,"Elena Gospodarevskaya; Leonie Segal; Cost-utility analysis of different treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder in sexually abused children, Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health, ; 6():1753-2000; 15",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Non-directive counselling vs. None,Not Stated,21 Years,16 Years,"Female, Male",Full,31 Years,5.00,5.00,2081.57,Australia,2010,2272.97

9712,Cost-utility analysis of different treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder in sexually abused children,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is diagnosed in 20% to 53% of sexually abused children and adolescents. Living with PTSD is associated with a loss of health-related quality of life. Based on the best available evidence, the NICE Guideline for PTSD in children and adolescents recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) over non-directive counselling as a more efficacious treatment. METHODS: A modelled economic evaluation conducted from the Australian mental health care system perspective estimates incremental costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of TF-CBT, TF-CBT combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and non-directive counselling. The ""no treatment"" alternative is included as a comparator. The first part of the model consists of a decision tree corresponding to 12 month follow-up outcomes observed in clinical trials. The second part consists of a 30 year Markov model representing the slow process of recovery in non-respondents and the untreated population yielding estimates of long-term quality-adjusted survival and costs. Data from the 2007 Australian Mental Health Survey was used to populate the decision analytic model. RESULTS: In the base-case and sensitivity analyses, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for all three active treatment alternatives remained less than A$7,000 per QALY gained. The base-case results indicated that non-directive counselling is dominated by TF-CBT and TF-CBT + SSRI, and that efficiency gain can be achieved by allocating more resources toward these therapies. However, this result was sensitive to variation in the clinical effectiveness parameters with non-directive counselling dominating TF-CBT and TF-CBT + SSRI under certain assumptions.

9715,Cost-effective Screening for Acute Hepatitis C Virus Infection in HIV-Infected Men Who Have Sex With Men,"BackgroundWe used a Monte Carlo computer simulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men who have sex with men.MethodsOne-time screening for prevalent HCV infection was performed at the time of enrollment in care, followed by either symptom-based screening, screening with liver function tests (LFTs), HCV antibody (Ab) screening, or HCV RNA screening in various combinations and intervals. We considered both treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG/RBV) alone and with an HCV protease inhibitor. Outcome measures were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, direct medical costs, and cost-effectiveness, assuming a societal willingness to pay $100?000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.ResultsAll strategies increased life expectancy (from 0.49 to 0.94 life-months), quality-adjusted life expectancy (from 0.47 to 1.00 quality-adjusted life-months), and costs (from $1900 to $7600), compared with symptom-based screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening with 6-month LFTs and a 12-month HCV Ab test, compared with symptom-based screening, was $43?700/QALY (for PEG/RBV alone) and $57?800/QALY (for PEG/RBV plus HCV protease inhibitor).

9722,Cost-effective Screening for Acute Hepatitis C Virus Infection in HIV-Infected Men Who Have Sex With Men,"BackgroundWe used a Monte Carlo computer simulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men who have sex with men.MethodsOne-time screening for prevalent HCV infection was performed at the time of enrollment in care, followed by either symptom-based screening, screening with liver function tests (LFTs), HCV antibody (Ab) screening, or HCV RNA screening in various combinations and intervals. We considered both treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG/RBV) alone and with an HCV protease inhibitor. Outcome measures were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, direct medical costs, and cost-effectiveness, assuming a societal willingness to pay $100?000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.ResultsAll strategies increased life expectancy (from 0.49 to 0.94 life-months), quality-adjusted life expectancy (from 0.47 to 1.00 quality-adjusted life-months), and costs (from $1900 to $7600), compared with symptom-based screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening with 6-month LFTs and a 12-month HCV Ab test, compared with symptom-based screening, was $43?700/QALY (for PEG/RBV alone) and $57?800/QALY (for PEG/RBV plus HCV protease inhibitor).

9723,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation: A Comparison of Periosteal Patch Versus Type I/III Collagen Membrane,"Background: Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) involves the use of a periosteal patch (ACI-P) as a cover for transplanted chondrocytes. Theoretically, this periosteal patch provides mesenchymal stem cells and growth factors that encourage chondrocyte development/differentiation. However, there is a significant rate of graft hypertrophy with the use of periosteum compared with using a type I/III collagen patch (ACI-C). This type I/III collagen patch, although not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for ACI, has been used extensively in Europe and in an ""off-label"" nature in the United States as a cover during ACI. Purpose: To examine the cost effectiveness of ACI and determine whether ACI-C is more cost effective than ACI-P. Study Design: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Outcome data and complication rates from patients undergoing ACI (ACI-P and ACI-C) were derived from the best evidence in the literature. Costs were determined by examining the typical patient charges undergoing ACI at a local orthopaedic hospital. The costs, results, and complication rates were used to develop a decision analysis model comparing ACI-P to ACI-C. Results: The cost of ACI-P was $66,752 and for ACI-C was $66,939.50 ($187.50 difference). The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for ACI-P was $9466 compared with $9243 for ACI-C. Sensitivity analysis was performed regarding the additional cost of the type I/III collagen patch ($780) in ACI-C as well as the rate of graft hypertrophy after ACI-P (25%). This analysis revealed that the cost of the type I/III collagen patch would have to reach $1721, or the rate of graft hypertrophy after ACI-P reduced to almost 11%, before ACI-P became more cost effective than ACI-C. Conclusion: This cost-effectiveness analysis reveals that, while both ACI-P and ACI-C are cost effective, ACI-C is slightly more cost effective than ACI-P. This is likely secondary to the significant rate of patch-related complications associated with ACI-P, which is significantly reduced with ACI-C. Although the model is very sensitive to differences in outcomes between ACI-P and ACI-C, there is no high-quality evidence to suggest that there is a significant difference between the two.

9726,Exploring the cost-utility of stratified primary care management for low back pain compared with current best practice within risk-defined subgroups,"OBJECTIVES: Stratified management for low back pain according to patients' prognosis and matched care pathways has been shown to be an effective treatment approach in primary care. The aim of this within-trial study was to determine the economic implications of providing such an intervention, compared with non-stratified current best practice, within specific risk-defined subgroups (low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk).METHODS: Within a cost-utility framework, the base-case analysis estimated the incremental healthcare cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY), using the EQ-5D to generate QALYs, for each risk-defined subgroup. Uncertainty was explored with cost-utility planes and acceptability curves. Sensitivity analyses were performed to consider alternative costing methodologies, including the assessment of societal loss relating to work absence and the incorporation of generic (ie, non-back pain) healthcare utilisation.RESULTS: The stratified management approach was a cost-effective treatment strategy compared with current best practice within each risk-defined subgroup, exhibiting dominance (greater benefit and lower costs) for medium-risk patients and acceptable incremental cost to utility ratios for low-risk and high-risk patients. The likelihood that stratified care provides a cost-effective use of resources exceeds 90% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of ?4000 (? 4500; $6500) per additional QALY for the medium-risk and high-risk groups.

9729,Economic evaluation of anti-epileptic drug therapies with specific focus on teratogenic outcomes,"Abstract Background: Anti-epileptic drugs are known to be teratogenic, yet many women do need to continue the anti-epileptic drug use during pregnancy. Objectives: To perform an economic evaluation of the anti-epileptic drug choice in young women who potentially wish to become pregnant. In particular, to estimate the impact of teratogenicity on the costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Methods: A decision-tree model is used to calculate the costs per QALY, taking into account the malformation risk in offspring due to the exposure to carbamazepine, lamotrigine or valproic acid, based on the European birth cohort of 2007. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: Valproic acid is dominated by carbamazepine after rank ordering on costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine vs carbamazepine was estimated at &euro;175,534 per QALY. Although valproic acid was dominated by carbamazepine in terms of costs and related effects, it is clinically relevant to compare lamotrigine with valproic acid. In particular, treatment options are dependent on several individual and clinical characteristics and these agents are therefore not always considered as interchangeable for all specified populations. The incremental cost-effectiveness for lamotrigine vs valproic acid was estimated at &euro;13,370 per QALY.

9731,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban in the prevention of venous thromboembolism: A Canadian analysis using the Ontario Ministry of Health Perspective,"Abstract Objectives: A cost-effectiveness model for rivaroxaban evaluated the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with rivaroxaban (a once-daily, orally administered Factor Xa inhibitor) vs enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR). This Canadian analysis was conducted using the Ontario Ministry of Health perspective over a 5-year time horizon. The model combined clinical data and builds upon existing economic models. Methods: The model included both acute VTE (represented as a decision tree) and long-term complications (represented as a Markov process with 1-year cycles) phases. The model allowed VTE event rates, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs to be estimated over a 5-year time horizon, based on current approved practice patterns in Canada. A number of one-way sensitivity analyses were performed on the baseline assumptions, including a comparison of rivaroxaban with dalteparin, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address any uncertainty concerning model inputs. Results: When comparing equal durations of therapy, rivaroxaban dominated enoxaparin in the prevention of VTE events in patients undergoing THR and TKR, providing more benefit at a lower cost. Rivaroxaban was cost-effective when comparing 35 days' prophylaxis with 14 days' prophylaxis with enoxaparin following THR. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results of the economic analysis were robust to variations in key inputs. Rivaroxaban remained dominant during one-way sensitivity analyses comparing rivaroxaban with dalteparin after THR or TKR. Limitations: Although clinical trial data were used in the prophylaxis module, assumptions and values used in the post-prophylaxis and long-term complication (LTC) modules were based on several different literature sources; it was not always possible to source Canadian data.

9733,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban in the prevention of venous thromboembolism: A Canadian analysis using the Ontario Ministry of Health Perspective,"Abstract Objectives: A cost-effectiveness model for rivaroxaban evaluated the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with rivaroxaban (a once-daily, orally administered Factor Xa inhibitor) vs enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR). This Canadian analysis was conducted using the Ontario Ministry of Health perspective over a 5-year time horizon. The model combined clinical data and builds upon existing economic models. Methods: The model included both acute VTE (represented as a decision tree) and long-term complications (represented as a Markov process with 1-year cycles) phases. The model allowed VTE event rates, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs to be estimated over a 5-year time horizon, based on current approved practice patterns in Canada. A number of one-way sensitivity analyses were performed on the baseline assumptions, including a comparison of rivaroxaban with dalteparin, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address any uncertainty concerning model inputs. Results: When comparing equal durations of therapy, rivaroxaban dominated enoxaparin in the prevention of VTE events in patients undergoing THR and TKR, providing more benefit at a lower cost. Rivaroxaban was cost-effective when comparing 35 days' prophylaxis with 14 days' prophylaxis with enoxaparin following THR. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results of the economic analysis were robust to variations in key inputs. Rivaroxaban remained dominant during one-way sensitivity analyses comparing rivaroxaban with dalteparin after THR or TKR.

9734,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Early vs Late Reconstruction of Iatrogenic Bile Duct Injuries,"Controversy exists regarding the optimal timing of repair after iatrogenic bile duct injuries (BDI). Several studies advocate late repair (=6 weeks after injury) with mandatory drainage and resolution of inflammation. Others indicate that early repair (<6 weeks after injury) produces comparable or superior clinical outcomes. Additionally, although most studies have reported inferior outcomes with primary surgeon repair, this practice continues. With disparate published recommendations and rising health care costs, decision analysis was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of BDI repair.A Markov model was developed to evaluate primary surgeon repair (PSR), late repair by a hepatobiliary surgeon (LHBS), and early repair by a hepatobiliary surgeon (EHBS). Baseline values and ranges were collected from the literature. Sensitivity analsyses were conducted to test the strength of the model and variability of parameters.The model demonstrated that EHBS was associated with lower costs, earlier return to normal activity, and better quality of life. Specifically, 1 year after repair, PSR yielded 0.53 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) ($120,000/QALY) and LHBS yielded 0.74 QALYs ($74,000/QALY); EHBS yielded 0.82 QALYs ($48,000/QALY). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings at clinically meaningful probabilities.This cost-effectiveness model demonstrates that early repair by a hepatobiliary surgeon is the superior strategy for the treatment of BDI in properly selected patients.

This study aimed to assess the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with alternative treatment regimens for patients with severe COPD in the UK setting.A Markov cohort model was developed to predict lifetime costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of various combinations of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and roflumilast in a fully incremental analysis. Patients willing and able to take ICS, and those refusing or intolerant to ICS were analyzed separately. Efficacy was expressed as relative rate ratios of COPD exacerbation associated with alternative treatment regimens, taken from a mixed treatment comparison. The analysis was conducted from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Parameter uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Based on the results of the fully incremental analysis a cost-effectiveness frontier was determined, indicating those treatment regimens which represent the most cost-effective use of NHS resources.

9738,Is subtotal thyroidectomy a cost-effective treatment for Graves disease? A cost-effectiveness analysis of the medical and surgical treatment options,"BACKGROUND: The 3 treatment options for Graves disease (GD) are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine (RAI), and thyroid surgery. We hypothesized that thyroid surgery is cost-effective for Graves disease when compared to RAI or ATD. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare operative strategies to medical treatment strategies for GD. The decision model, based on a reference case, included treatment outcomes, probabilities, and costs derived from literature review. Outcomes were weighted using quality of life utility factors, yielding quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The uncertainty of costs, probabilities, and utility estimates in the model were examined by univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: The subtotal thyroidectomy strategy produced the greatest QALYs, 25.783, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $26,602 per QALY, reflecting a gain of 0.091 QALYs at an additional cost of $2416 compared to RAI. Surgery was cost-effective when the initial postoperative euthyroid rate was greater than 49.5% and the total cost was less than $7391. Monte Carlo simulation showed the subtotal thyroidectomy strategy to be optimal in 826 of 1000 cases.

9740,The combined use of surgery and radiotherapy to treat patients with epidural cord compression due to metastatic disease: a cost-utility analysis,"Neoplastic metastatic epidural spinal cord compression is a common complication of cancer that causes pain and progressive neurologic impairment. The previous standard treatment for this condition involved corticosteroids and radiotherapy (RT). Direct decompressive surgery with postoperative radiotherapy (S + RT) is now increasingly being chosen by clinicians to significantly improve patients' ability to walk and reduce their need for opioid analgesics and corticosteroids. A cost-utility analysis was conducted to compare S + RT with RT alone based on the landmark randomized clinical trial by Patchell et al. (2005). It was performed from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Ontario-based costs were adjusted to 2010 US dollars. S + RT is more costly but also more effective than corticosteroids and RT alone, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$250 307 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. First order probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of S + RT being cost-effective is 18.11%. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that there is a 91.11% probability of S + RT being cost-effective over RT alone at a willingness-to-pay of US$1 683 000 per QALY. In practice, the results of our study indicate that, by adopting the S + RT strategy, there would still be a chance of 18.11% of not paying extra at a willingness-to-pay of US$50 000 per QALY. Those results are sensitive to the costs of hospice palliative care. Our results suggest that adopting a standard S + RT approach for patients with MSCC is likely to increase health care costs but would result in improved outcomes.",2012-01-08984,22505658,Neuro-oncol,Julio C Furlan,2012,14 / 5,631-40,No,22505658,"Julio C Furlan; Kelvin K-W Chan; Guillermo A Sandoval; Kenneth C K Lam; Christopher A Klinger; Roy A Patchell; Audrey Laporte; Michael G Fehlings; The combined use of surgery and radiotherapy to treat patients with epidural cord compression due to metastatic disease: a cost-utility analysis, Neuro-oncol, ; 14(5):1522-8517; 631-40",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Direct decompressive surgery with postoperative radiotherapy (S+ RT) vs. Standard of care (corticosteroids and radiotherapy),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,8 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,250307,United States,2010,297089.76

Initiating PrEP in a larger proportion of MSM would prevent more infections but at an increasing cost per QALY gained (up to $216,480 if all MSM receive PrEP). Preexposure chemoprophylaxis in only high-risk MSM can improve cost-effectiveness. For MSM with an average of 5 partners per year, PrEP costs approximately $50,000 per QALY gained.

9743,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Pregabalin Versus Duloxetine for the Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy,"ABSTRACT The objective of the current study was to determine the cost-utility of pregabalin versus duloxetine for treating painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) using a decision tree analysis. Literature searches identified clinical trials and real-world studies reporting the efficacy, tolerability, safety, adherence, opioid usage, health care utilization, and costs of pregabalin and duloxetine. The proportions of patients reported in the included studies were used to determine probabilities in the decision tree model. The base-case model included the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved doses of pregabalin (300 mg/day) and duloxetine (60 mg/day), whereas ""real-world"" sensitivity analyses explored the effects over a range of doses (pregabalin 75-600 mg/day, duloxetine 20-120 mg/day). A 6-month time horizon and a US third-party payer perspective were chosen for the study. Outcomes from the model were expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In the base-case model, duloxetine cost less and was more effective than pregabalin (incremental cost -$187, incremental effectiveness 0.011 QALYs). Results from two real-world sensitivity analyses indicated that duloxetine cost $16,300 and $20,667 more per additional QALY than pregabalin. Using a decision tree model that incorporated both clinical trial and real-world data, duloxetine was a more cost-effective option than pregabalin in the treatment of PDN from the perspective of third-party payers.",2012-01-08987,22509775,J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother,Brandon K Bellows,2012,26 / 2,,No,22509775,"Brandon K Bellows; Arati Dahal; Tianze Jiao; Joseph Biskupiak; A Cost-Utility Analysis of Pregabalin Versus Duloxetine for the Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy, J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother, ; 26(2):1536-0288",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Duloxetine (DUL) (60 mg/day) vs. Pregabalin (PRE) (300 mg/day),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-17000,United States,2011,-19559.91
9744,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of prenatal surgery for myelomeningoceles: a decision analysis,"Objective: To determine whether prenatal myelomeningocele repair is a cost-effective strategy compared to postnatal repair. Methods: Decision-analysis modeling was used to calculate the cumulative costs, effects and incremental cost effectiveness ratio of prenatal myelomeningocele repair compared to postnatal repair in singleton gestations with a normal karotype who were identified with myelomeningocele between T1 and S1. The model accounted for costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in three populations 1) myelomeningocele patients 2) mothers carrying myelomeningocele patients, and 3) future siblings of these patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed using one-way, two-way and Monte-Carlo simulations. Results: Prenatal myelomeningocele repair saves $2,066,778 per 100 cases repaired. Additionally, prenatal surgery results in 97 QALYs gained per 100 repairs with 42 fewer neonates requiring shunts and 21 fewer neonates requiring long-term medical care per 100 repairs. However, these benefits are coupled with 26 additional cases of uterine rupture or dehiscence and 1 additional case of neurologic deficits in future offspring per 100 repairs. Results were robust in sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: Prenatal myelomeningocele repair is cost effective and frequently cost saving compared to postnatal myelomeningocele repair despite the increased likelihood of maternal and future pregnancy complications associated with prenatal surgery.

9745,Subgroup economic analysis for glioblastoma in a health resource-limited setting,"The aim of this research was to evaluate the economic outcomes of radiotherapy (RT), temozolomide (TMZ) and nitrosourea (NT) strategies for glioblastoma patients with different prognostic factors.A Markov model was developed to track monthly patient transitions. Transition probabilities and utilities were derived primarily from published reports. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. The survival data with different prognostic factors were simulated using Weibull survival models. Costs over a 5-year period and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated. Probabilistic sensitivity and one-way analyses were performed. The baseline analysis in the overall cohort showed that the TMZ strategy increased the cost and QALY relative to the RT strategy by $25,328.4 and 0.29, respectively; and the TMZ strategy increased the cost and QALY relative to the NT strategy by $23,906.5 and 0.25, respectively. Therefore, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per additional QALY of the TMZ strategy, relative to the RT strategy and the NT strategy, amounts to $87,940.6 and $94,968.3, respectively.

9748,A pilot randomised controlled trial of an Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy self-management programme (MS Invigor8) for multiple sclerosis fatigue,"The majority of people affected by Multiple Sclerosis (paMS) experience severe and disabling fatigue. A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that cognitive behaviour therapy with a clinical psychologist was an effective treatment for MS fatigue. An Internet-based version of this intervention, MS Invigor8, was developed for the current study using agile design and input from paMS. MS Invigor8 includes eight tailored, interactive sessions. The aim was to test the feasibility and potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the programme in a pilot RCT. 40 patients were randomised to MS Invigor8 (n=23) or standard care (n=17). The MS Invigor8 group accessed sessions over 8-10 weeks and received up to three 30-60min telephone support sessions. Participants completed online standardised questionnaires assessing fatigue, mood, quality of life and service use at baseline and 10 weeks follow-up. Large between group treatment effects were found for the primary outcomes of fatigue severity (d=1.19) and impact (d=1.02). The MS Invigor8 group also reported significantly greater improvements in anxiety, depression and quality-adjusted life years. These data suggest that Internet-based CBT may be a clinically and cost-effective treatment for MS fatigue.

METHODS: A decision analysis was performed based on a well-documented prospective cohort of 471 outpatients with stable chest pain with follow-up combined with best-available evidence from the literature. Outcomes were correct classification of patients as CAD- (no obstructive CAD), CAD+ (obstructive CAD without revascularization) and indication for Revascularization (using a combination reference standard), diagnostic costs, lifetime health care costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Parameter uncertainty was analyzed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: For men (and women), diagnostic cost savings were euro245 (euro252) for the CT-strategy as compared to the SOC-strategy. The CT-strategy classified 82% (88%) of simulated men (women) in the appropriate disease category, whereas 83% (85%) were correctly classified by the SOC-strategy. The long-term cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the SOC-strategy was dominated by the CT-strategy, which was less expensive (-euro229 in men, -euro444 in women) and more effective (+0.002 QALY in men, +0.005 in women).

9758,Cost-effectiveness of 2 + 1 dosing of 13-valent and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Canada,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) are two recently approved vaccines for the active immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae causing invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and children. PCV13 offers broader protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae; however, PCV10 offers potential protection against non-typeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi). We examined public health and economic impacts of a PCV10 and PCV13 pediatric national immunization programs (NIPs) in Canada. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to examine the costs and outcomes associated with PCV10 and PCV13 pediatric NIPs. The model followed individuals over the remainder of their lifetime. Recent disease incidence, serotype coverage, population data, percent vaccinated, costs, and utilities were obtained from the published literature. Direct and indirect effects were derived from 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Additional direct effect of 4% was attributed to PCV10 for moderate to severe acute otitis media to account for potential NTHi benefit. Annual number of disease cases and costs (2010 Canadian dollars) were presented. RESULTS: In Canada, PCV13 was estimated to prevent more cases of disease (44,504 when considering both direct and indirect effects and 6,629 when considering direct effects only) than PCV10. This translated to population gains of 258 to 13,828 more quality-adjusted life-years when vaccinating with PCV13 versus PCV10. Annual direct medical costs (including the cost of vaccination) were estimated to be reduced by $5.7 million to $132.8 million when vaccinating with PCV13. Thus, PCV13 dominated PCV10, and sensitivity analyses showed PCV13 to always be dominant or cost-effective versus PCV10. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease in Canada, PCV13 is shown to be a cost-saving immunization program because it provides substantial public health and economic benefits relative to PCV10.",2012-01-09009,22530841,BMC Infect Dis,Stephanie R Earnshaw,2012,12 /,101,No,22530841,"Stephanie R Earnshaw; Cheryl L McDade; Giovanni Zanotti; Raymond A Farkouh; David Strutton; Cost-effectiveness of 2 + 1 dosing of 13-valent and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Canada, BMC Infect Dis, ; 12():1471-2334; 101",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) vs. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2209.3,Canada,2010,-2547.22

(immunotherapy agents alongside symptomatic medication) and symptomatic treatment alone for grass pollen allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Methods: The costs and outcomes of 3-year treatment were assessed for a period of 9 years using a Markov model. Treatment efficacy was estimated using an indirect comparison of available clinical trials with placebo as a common comparator. Estimates for immunotherapy discontinuation, occurrence of asthma, health state utilities, drug costs, resource use, and healthcare costs were derived from published sources. The analysis was conducted from the insurant's perspective including public and private health insurance payments and co-payments by insurants. Outcomes were reported as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and symptom-free days. The uncertainty around incremental model results was tested by means of extensive deterministic univariate and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses. Results: In the base case analysis the model predicted a cost-utility ratio of OA vs symptomatic treatment of ?14,728 per QALY; incremental costs were ?1356 (95%CI: ?1230; ?1484) and incremental QALYs 0.092 (95%CI: 0.052; 0.140). OA was the dominant strategy compared to GRZ and ALD, with estimated incremental costs of -?1142 (95%CI: -?1255; -?1038) and -?54 (95%CI: -?188; ?85) and incremental QALYs of 0.015 (95%CI: -0.025; 0.056) and 0.027 (95%CI: -0.022; 0.075), respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?20,000, the probability of OA being the most cost-effective treatment was predicted to be 79%. Univariate sensitivity analyses show that incremental outcomes were moderately sensitive to changes in efficacy estimates.

9762,The cost-effectiveness of primary stroke centers for acute stroke care,"Primary stroke centers (PSC) have demonstrated improved survival in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating AIS patients in a PSC compared with a nonPSC hospital setting.We developed a decision analytic model to project the lifetime outcomes and costs of 2 hypothetical cohorts of 75 AIS patients. Clinical data were derived from a recent observational study comparing PSC- and nonPSC-admitted patients, clinical trials, longitudinal cohort studies, and health state preference studies. Cost data were based on Medicare reimbursement and other published sources. We used a healthcare payer perspective, and the primary outcomes were incremental life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years, and healthcare costs. We performed sensitivity and scenario analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results.Admission to a PSC resulted in a gain of 0.22 years of life (95% credible range [CR], 0.12-0.33) and 0.15 quality-adjusted life years (95% CR, 0.08-0.23) per patient, at a cost of $3600 (95% CR, $2400-$5000) per patient, compared with admission to a nonPSC hospital. The incremental cost/quality-adjusted life year gained was $24 000, and all probabilistic simulation results were below the $100 000/quality-adjusted life year threshold. In scenario analyses accounting for as few as 7 and as many as 500 AIS patients/year per PSC, cost-effectiveness improved as the number of AIS patients admitted per year increased.Our study indicates that care at a PSC for patients with AIS is cost-effective and improves outcomes across a wide range of possible scenarios.",2012-01-09018,22535277,Stroke,Gregory F Guzauskas,2012,43 / 6,1617-23,No,22535277,"Gregory F Guzauskas; Denise M Boudreau; Kathleen F Villa; Steven R Levine; David L Veenstra; The cost-effectiveness of primary stroke centers for acute stroke care, Stroke, ; 43(6):1524-4628; 1617-23",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Admission to primary stroke centers vs. Admission to non-primary stroke centers,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,23990,United States,2011,27602.49
9763,Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon Beta-1b for the treatment of patients with a first clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis,"To assess, from a Swedish societal perspective, the cost effectiveness of interferon ?-1b (IFNB-1b) after an initial clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) (ie, early treatment) compared with treatment after onset of clinically definite MS (CDMS) (ie, delayed treatment).A Markov model was developed, using patient level data from the BENEFIT trial and published literature, to estimate health outcomes and costs associated with IFNB-1b for hypothetical cohorts of patients after an initial clinical event suggestive of MS. Health states were defined by Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total costs (including both direct and indirect costs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key model parameters to assess the robustness of model results.In the base case scenario, early IFNB-1b treatment was economically dominant (ie, less costly and more effective) versus delayed IFNB-1b treatment when QALYs were used as the effectiveness metric. Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to model time horizon. Compared with the delayed treatment strategy, early treatment of MS was also associated with delayed EDSS progressions, prolonged time to CDMS diagnosis, and a reduction in frequency of relapse.Early treatment with IFNB-1b for a first clinical event suggestive of MS was found to improve patient outcomes while controlling costs.",2012-01-09027,22541587,Clin Ther,John P Caloyeras,2012,34 / 5,1132-44,Yes,22541587,"John P Caloyeras; Bin Zhang; Cheng Wang; Marianne Eriksson; Sten Fredrikson; Karola Beckmann; Volker Knappertz; Christoph Pohl; Hans-Peter Hartung; Dhvani Shah; Jeffrey D Miller; Rupert Sandbrink; Vivian Lanius; Kathleen Gondek; Mason W Russell; Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon Beta-1b for the treatment of patients with a first clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, Clin Ther, ; 34(5):1879-114X; 1132-44",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early interferon beta-1b treatment vs. Interferon beta-1b treatment after onset of clinically definite multiple sclerosis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-718.16,Sweden,2009,-113.92
9764,Cost effectiveness analysis of clinically driven versus routine laboratory monitoring of antiretroviral therapy in Uganda and Zimbabwe,"Despite funding constraints for treatment programmes in Africa, the costs and economic consequences of routine laboratory monitoring for efficacy and toxicity of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have rarely been evaluated.Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in the DART trial (ISRCTN13968779). Adults in Uganda/Zimbabwe starting ART were randomised to clinically-driven monitoring (CDM) or laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM); individual patient data on healthcare resource utilisation and outcomes were valued with primary economic costs and utilities. Total costs of first/second-line ART, routine 12-weekly CD4 and biochemistry/haematology tests, additional diagnostic investigations, clinic visits, concomitant medications and hospitalisations were considered from the public healthcare sector perspective. A Markov model was used to extrapolate costs and benefits 20 years beyond the trial.3316 (1660LCM;1656CDM) symptomatic, immunosuppressed ART-naive adults (median (IQR) age 37 (32,42); CD4 86 (31,139) cells/mm(3)) were followed for median 4.9 years. LCM had a mean 0.112 year (41 days) survival benefit at an additional mean cost of $765 [95%CI:685,845], translating into an adjusted incremental cost of $7386 [3277,dominated] per life-year gained and $7793 [4442,39179] per quality-adjusted life year gained. Routine toxicity tests were prominent cost-drivers and had no benefit. With 12-weekly CD4 monitoring from year 2 on ART, low-cost second-line ART, but without toxicity monitoring, CD4 test costs need to fall below $3.78 to become cost-effective (<3xper-capita GDP, following WHO benchmarks). CD4 monitoring at current costs as undertaken in DART was not cost-effective in the long-term.There is no rationale for routine toxicity monitoring, which did not affect outcomes and was costly. Even though beneficial, there is little justification for routine 12-weekly CD4 monitoring of ART at current test costs in low-income African countries. CD4 monitoring, restricted to the second year on ART onwards, could be cost-effective with lower cost second-line therapy and development of a cheaper, ideally point-of-care, CD4 test.",2012-01-09034,22545079,PLoS One,Antonieta Medina Lara,2012,2 / 1,e33672,No,22545079,"Antonieta Medina Lara; Jesse Kigozi; Jovita Amurwon; Lazarus Muchabaiwa; Barbara Nyanzi Wakaholi; Ruben E Mujica Mota; A Sarah Walker; Ronnie Kasirye; Francis Ssali; Andrew Reid; Heiner Grosskurth; Abdel G Babiker; Cissy Kityo; Elly Katabira; Paula Munderi; Peter Mugyenyi; James Hakim; Janet Darbyshire; Diana M Gibb; Charles F Gilks; DART Trial Team; Cost effectiveness analysis of clinically driven versus routine laboratory monitoring of antiretroviral therapy in Uganda and Zimbabwe, PLoS One , ; 2(1):1932-6203; e33672",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laboratory and clinical monitoring treatment of antiretroviral therapy vs. Clinically-driven monitoring treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,7793,United States,2008,9367.79

9777,Impact of screening and early detection of impaired fasting glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes in Canada: a Markov model simulation,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health problem. An estimated 20%-50% of diabetic subjects in Canada are currently undiagnosed, and around 20%-30% have already developed complications. Screening for high blood glucose levels can identify people with prediabetic conditions and permit introduction of timely and effective prevention. This study examines the benefit of screening for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and T2DM. If intervention is introduced at this prediabetic stage, it can be most effective in delaying the onset and complications of T2DM.Using a Markov model simulation, we compare the cost-effectiveness of screening for prediabetes (IFG) and T2DM with the strategy of no screening. An initial cohort of normoglycemic, prediabetic, or undiagnosed diabetic adults with one or more T2DM risk factors was used to model the strategies mentioned over a 10-year period. Subjects without known prediabetes or diabetes are screened every 3 years and persons with prediabetes were tested for diabetes on an annual basis. The model weighs the increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with early detection of prediabetes and earlier diagnosis of T2DM due to lifestyle intervention and early treatment in asymptomatic subjects.Costs for each QALY gained were $2281 for conventional screening compared with $2890 for no screening. Thus, in this base-case analysis, conventional screening with a frequency of once every 3 years was favored over no screening. Furthermore, conventional screening was more favorable compared with no screening over a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. Changing the frequency of screening did not affect the overall results. Screening persons without diabetes or prediabetes on an annual basis had small effects on the cost-effectiveness ratios. Screening with a frequency of once every 5 years resulted in the lowest cost per QALY ($2117). Lack of screening costs the health care system $4812 more than the cost of screening once every 5 years.The increased cost per QALY of not screening is due to the costs of complications caused downstream of T2DM. By ensuring that IFG screening occurs every 3 years for those without prediabetes and every year for those with prediabetes, the health and financial benefits related to T2DM are improved in Canada.",2012-01-09052,22553425,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Soroush Mortaz,2011,3 /,91-7,No,22553425,"Soroush Mortaz; Christine Wessman; Ross Duncan; Rachel Gray; Alaa Badawi; Impact of screening and early detection of impaired fasting glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes in Canada: a Markov model simulation, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 3 ():1178-6981; 91-7",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening and early detection of impaired fasting glucose tolerance once every 3 years vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-102777.78,Canada,2010,-118498.06

Health-related quality of life was assessed using questionnaire (QLQ-C30) from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). QLQ-C30 scale scores were mapped to 15D and EuroQol 5D utilities to measure the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).Third party payer point of view was applied to measure and value the cost of treatments. Cost data were extracted from hospital and health insurance organizations. Robustness of the results was checked through a two way sensitivity analysis.TAC was associated with higher deterioration in HRQoL during treatment and higher improvements over 4 months follow-up. On average, the cost of treatment per patient in TAC was 15 times higher than FAC (p < .001). In overall, TAC was resulted in lower QALYs and higher cost over study period.FAC was a dominant option versus TAC in short-term. The higher improvement in HRQoL over follow-up in TAC may not compensate the more intensive deterioration caused during treatment in short-term. The short time horizon of study may limit the generalizability of our findings and, hence, there is a need to conduct long-term economic evaluation studies whenever data is available to inform decision making.",2012-01-09061,22559752,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Peivand Bastani,2009,25 / 2,110-4,No,22559752,"Peivand Bastani; Aliasghar Ahmad Kiadaliri; Cost-utility analysis of adjuvant therapies for breast cancer in Iran, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2009-Apr; 25(2):0266-4623; 110-4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) with doxorubicin (50 mg/ m2) cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) (TAC) intravenously six times every 3 weeks vs. 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) (FAC)",Not Stated,74 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,8 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,3178800,Iran,2008,382.12
9781,Cost-effectiveness model of use of genetic testing as an aid in assessing the likely benefit of aspirin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease,"Aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is controversial because of the need to balance the risk of major bleeding events caused by aspirin with the benefit of CVD events prevented by aspirin. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) proposed guidelines that use CVD risk thresholds, based on the Framingham Risk Score, to identify patients likely to benefit from aspirin use. Genetic information could be used to modify this CVD risk assessment; for example, 2 variants of the LPA gene, which encodes apolipoprotein(a), are associated with increased risk of CVD.To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of using genetic test results for 2 LPA variants to derive modified Framingham Risk Score estimates and to use these estimates to identify patients likely to benefit from aspirin use according to USPSTF guidelines for aspirin use in the primary prevention of CVD.A cost-effectiveness model of 1 million patients representative of the US population was developed based on the association of 2 LPA variants (rs3798220 and rs10455872) with CVD.

9784,Cost-effectiveness of potential infant vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus infection in The Netherlands,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is one of the major causes of respiratory illness in infants, infecting virtually every child before the age of 2 years. Currently, several Phase 1 trials with RSV vaccines in infants are ongoing or have been completed. As yet, no efficacy estimates are available for these vaccine candidates. Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness estimates might be informative to enable preliminary positioning of an RSV vaccine.A decision analysis model was developed in which a Dutch birth cohort was followed for 12 months. A number of potential vaccination strategies were reviewed such as vaccination at specific ages, a two- or three-dosing scheme and seasonal vaccination versus year-round vaccination. The impact of the assumptions made was explored in various sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic analysis. Outcome measures included the number of GP visits, hospitalizations and deaths, costs, quality-adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).Currently, without vaccination, an annual number of 28,738 of RSV-related GP visits, 1623 hospitalizations, and 4.5 deaths are estimated in children in the age of 0-1 year. The total annual cost to society of RSV in the non-vaccination scenario is ?7.7 million (95%CI: 1.7-16.7) and the annual disease burden is estimated at 597 QALYs (95%CI: 133-1319). In case all infants would be offered a potentially safe and effective 3-dose RSV vaccination scheme at the age of 0, 1 and 3 months, the total annual net costs were estimated to increase to ?21.2 million, but 544 hospitalizations and 1.5 deaths would be averted. The ICER was estimated at ?34,142 (95%CI: ? 21,652-? 87,766) per QALY gained. A reduced dose schedule, seasonal vaccination, and consideration of out-of-pocket expenses all resulted in more favorable ICER values, whereas a reduced vaccine efficacy or a delay in the timing of vaccination resulted in less favorable ICERs.Our model used recently updated estimates on the burden of RSV disease in children and it included plausible utilities. However, due to the absence of clinical trial data, a number of crucial assumptions had to be made related to the characteristics of potential RSV vaccine. The outcomes of our modeling exercise show that vaccination of infants against RSV might be cost-effective.

The authors assessed the cost-effectiveness of TAVI in Belgium.A Markov model of incremental costs, effects (survival and quality of life) and incremental cost-effectiveness of TAVI was developed. The impact on survival, number of events and quality of life was based on the PARTNER trial. Costs per event were context specific.In high-risk operable patients, even if the minor differences in 30-day and 1-year mortality are taken into account, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) remains on average above ?750?000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (incremental cost: ?20?400; incremental effect: 0.03 QALYs). In inoperable patients, an ICER of ?44?900 per QALY (incremental cost: ?33?200; incremental effect: 0.74 QALYs) is calculated, including a life-long extrapolation of the mortality benefit.

9787,Long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir versus NPH insulin in type 2 diabetes in Sweden,"Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir vs. NPH insulin once daily, in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Swedish setting based on clinical data from a published randomized controlled trial. Methods: Projections of long-term outcomes were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM), based on clinical data from a 26-week randomized controlled trial that compared once daily insulin detemir and NPH insulin, when used to intensify insulin treatment in 271 patients with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) 25-40?kg/m(2). Trial results showed that insulin detemir was associated with a significantly lower incidence of hypoglycemic events and significantly less weight gain in comparison with NPH insulin. The analysis was conducted from a third party payer perspective and the base case analysis was performed over a time horizon of 40 years and future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Results: Insulin detemir was associated with higher mean (SD) quality-adjusted life expectancy (5.42 [0.10] vs. 5.31 [0.10] quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and lower overall costs (SEK 378,539 [10,372] vs. SEK 384,216 [11,230]; EUR 33,794 and EUR 34,300, respectively, where 1 EUR?=?11.2015 SEK) compared with NPH insulin. Sensitivity analysis showed that the principal driver of the benefits associated with insulin detemir was the lower rate of hypoglycemic events (major and minor events) vs. NPH insulin, suggesting that detemir might also be cost-saving over a shorter time horizon. Limitations of the analysis include the use of data from a trial outside Sweden in the Swedish setting. Conclusions: Based on clinical input data derived from a previously published randomized controlled trial, it is likely that in the Swedish setting insulin detemir would be cost-saving in comparison with NPH insulin for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.",2012-01-09072,22563742,J Med Econ,J Smith-Palmer,2012,15 / 5,,Yes,22563742,"J Smith-Palmer; C Fajardo-Monta?ana; R F Pollock; A Ericsson; W J Valentine; Long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir versus NPH insulin in type 2 diabetes in Sweden, J Med Econ, ; 15(5):1369-6998",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin detemir once daily vs. NPH insulin once daily,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,-51609.09,Sweden,2010,-8520.83
9788,Cost-effectiveness of a Multicondition Collaborative Care Intervention: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Patients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease (CHD), or both have higher medical complication rates and higher health care costs, suggesting that more effective care management of psychiatric and medical disease control might also reduce medical service use and enhance quality of life.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a multicondition collaborative treatment program (TEAMcare) compared with usual primary care (UC) in outpatients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes or CHD.Randomized controlled trial of a systematic care management program aimed at improving depression scores and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.Fourteen primary care clinics of an integrated health care system. Patients? Population-based screening identified 214 adults with depressive disorder and poorly controlled diabetes or CHD. Intervention? Physician-supervised nurses collaborated with primary care physicians to provide treatment of multiple disease risk factors.Blinded assessments evaluated depressive symptoms, SBP, and HbA(1c) at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Fasting LDL-C concentration was assessed at baseline and at 12 and 24 months. Health plan accounting records were used to assess medical service costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed using a previously developed regression model based on intervention vs UC differences in HbA(1c), LDL-C, and SBP levels over 24 months.Over 24 months, compared with UC controls, intervention patients had a mean of 114 (95% CI, 79 to 149) additional depression-free days and an estimated 0.335 (95% CI, -0.18 to 0.85) additional QALYs. Intervention patients also had lower mean outpatient health costs of $594 per patient (95% CI, -$3241 to $2053) relative to UC patients.For adults with depression and poorly controlled diabetes, CHD, or both, a systematic intervention program aimed at improving depression scores and HbA(1c), SBP, and LDL-C levels seemed to be a high-value program that for no or modest additional cost markedly improved QALYs.

The model is populated with the best available evidence. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) have been performed. Health effects are measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the model output is cost (2011 GBP) per QALY. The uncertainty in the primary outcome is explored by probabilistic analysis using 1000 iterations of a Monte Carlo simulation.Deterministic analysis results in a total incremental cost of -?379 in favor of racecadotril and a total incremental QALY gain in favor of racecadotril of +0.0008. The observed cost savings with racecadotril arise from the reduction in primary care reconsultation and secondary referral. The difference in QALYs is largely attributable to the timely resolution of symptoms in the racecadotril arm. Racecadotril remains dominant when base case parameters are varied. Monte Carlo simulation and PSA confirm that racecadotril is the dominant treatment strategy and is almost certainly cost effective, under the central assumptions of the model, at a commonly used willingness to pay proxy threshold range of ?20,000-?30,000 per QALY.Racecadotril as adjuvant therapy is more effective and less costly compared to ORS alone, from a UK payer perspective, for the treatment of children with acute diarrhea.",2012-01-09082,22570557,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Tamlyn Anne Rautenberg,2011,3 /,109-16,No,22570557,"Tamlyn Anne Rautenberg; Ute Zerwes; Douglas Foerster; Rick Aultman; Evaluating the cost utility of racecadotril for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea in children: the RAWD model, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 3 ():1178-6981; 109-16",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Racecadotril adjuvant with oral rehydration solution (ORS) vs. Oral rehydration solution (ORS),Not Stated,4 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Week,Not Stated,Not Stated,-473887.5,United Kingdom,2011,-874740.73
9793,Societal Value of Stem Cell Therapy in Stroke - A Modeling Study,"Background: Stroke is one of the major causes of disability in the adult population and represents a heavy social and economic burden. Currently available therapeutic tools to support the recovery of impaired brain functions are quite limited. Animal studies have demonstrated that neuronal replacement and partial reconstruction of neural circuitry or modulation of the recovery process is possible with cell transplantation in the damaged adult brain. Stem cell therapy (SCT) may promote functional recovery also in stroke patients, thereby improving quality of life and reducing costs. Our aim was to estimate the potential societal value of SCT in stroke patients. Methods: We created a decision-analytic model in Microsoft Excel 2010 to assess life-long costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of SCT versus standard care for stroke patients from a societal perspective. The model structure consisted of 7 health states in accordance with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We modeled for age (55, 65, and 75 years), functional status at discharge (mRS 2, 3, and 4), effectiveness of SCT (50 and 25% increase in the probability to improve 1 mRS grade), mode of stem cell administration, risk of recurrent stroke, complications of intervention, and use of immunosuppressive drugs. The difference between an assumed societal willingness to pay for a QALY gain in Sweden (110,400 USD) and the cost per QALY gain resulting from the model was interpreted as the value of SCT. Results: Increased survival (1.06 life years) and improved functional status gave rise to an estimated gain of 1.34 QALY in a cohort of patients aged 55 with mRS 2 at hospital discharge. Although the SCT intervention increased costs by 64,014 USD (excluding cost of stem cells), the costs of intervention were offset mainly by decreased productivity losses. In total, the intervention saved 19,055 USD, i.e., at a price of 19,055 USD for stem cells, the SCT would be cost neutral. The societal value of SCT was 166,500 USD. Conclusions: The application of the health-economic model to Sweden shows that in younger stroke patients with moderate disability, the societal value of SCT given a zero price of stem cells is 166,500 USD. Although the transplantation itself is more costly, SCT offers potential for cost offset and cost savings in a long-term perspective by reducing the disability after stroke. The therapy appeared cost effective under a wide range of assumptions. Hence, further research and development in stem cells suitable for stroke therapy could potentially produce great value to society.",2012-01-09086,22571941,Cerebrovasc Dis,Johanna Svensson,2012,33 / 6,532-539,No,22571941,"Johanna Svensson; Ola Ghatnekar; Arne Lindgren; Olle Lindvall; Bo Norrving; Ulf Persson; Zaal Kokaia; Societal Value of Stem Cell Therapy in Stroke - A Modeling Study, Cerebrovasc Dis, ; 33(6):1015-9770; 532-539",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Post-stroke stem cell therapy (SCT) vs. Standard care,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-14220.15,United States,2009,-17154.76
9794,Lenalidomide for multiple myeloma: cost-effectiveness in patients with one prior therapy in England and Wales,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost effectiveness of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (LEN/DEX) versus DEX alone in managing multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have failed one prior therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An individual simulation model was designed to capture the costs and outcomes of LEN/DEX versus DEX therapy in relapsed refractory MM patients. MM009/010 efficacy data were adjusted for treatment cross-over and extrapolated to patient lifetime. Resource use for MM disease progression and adverse events were obtained from expert physicians and costed from the perspective of the National Health Service (England and UK) and included a patient access scheme for LEN. Utility values were obtained from published literature. RESULTS: The simulation model estimated an incremental improvement in time to progression of 9.5 months, an additional 3.2 life-years, and 2.2 quality adjusted life years (QALY) for LEN/DEX compared to DEX alone. Including the costs of therapy with the patient access scheme, adverse events, and disease follow-up, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was pound30,153/QALY for LEN/DEX compared to DEX alone in MM patients who have failed one prior therapy.

Because guideline authorities base decisions on a national perspective, the economic model of palivizumab was adapted to include all infants, that is, public and privately insured patients (60% of palivizumab use is public, 40% is private). Methods: This study examined four groups of premature infants without chronic lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease: (1) <32 weeks gestational age (wGA) and =6 months chronologic age (CA); (2) 32-34 wGA, =3 months CA, with 2009 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) risk factors (RFs); (3) 32-35 wGA, =6 months CA, with 2006 AAP RFs; and (4) 32-35 wGA, =6 months CA, with =1 RF. An average estimate was used between public and private payors for (1) background rates of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization (RSV-H), (2) direct medical costs associated with RSV-H, and (3) cost of palivizumab. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are reported in cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Palivizumab saved costs and improved QALYs among infants <32 wGA. Palivizumab was cost-effective in infants 32-34 wGA with 2009 AAP RFs ($44,774 per QALY) and in infants 32-35 wGA with 2006 AAP RFs ($79,477 per QALY).

9799,"An evaluation of the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the National Exercise Referral Scheme in Wales, UK: a randomised controlled trial of a public health policy initiative","BackgroundThe Wales National Exercise Referral Scheme (NERS) is a 16-week programme including motivational interviewing, goal setting and relapse prevention.MethodA pragmatic randomised controlled trial with nested economic evaluation of 2160 inactive participants with coronary heart disease risk (CHD, 1559, 72%), mild to moderate depression, anxiety or stress (79, 4%) or both (522, 24%) randomised to receive (1) NERS or (2) normal care and brief written information. Outcome measures at 12 months included the 7-day physical activity recall, the hospital anxiety and depression scale.ResultsOrdinal regression identified increased physical activity among those randomised to NERS compared with those receiving normal care in all participants (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.43), and among those referred for CHD only (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.60). For those referred for mental health reason alone, or in combination with CHD, there were significantly lower levels of anxiety (OR -1.56, 95% CI -2.75 to -0.38) and depression (OR -1.39, 95% CI -2.60 to -0.18), but no effect on physical activity. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was ?12?111 per quality adjusted life year, falling to ?9741 if participants were to contribute ?2 per session.ConclusionsNERS was effective in increasing physical activity among those referred for CHD risk only. Among mental health referrals, NERS did not influence physical activity but was associated with reduced anxiety and depression. Effects were dependent on adherence.

9800,Cost-effectiveness of carotid artery stent placement versus endarterectomy in patients with carotid artery stenosis,"Object The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) demonstrated that the risk of the primary composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death did not differ significantly in patients with an average surgical risk undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) and those undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, the cost associated with CAS may limit its broad applicability. The authors' goal in this paper was to determine the cost-effectiveness of CAS with an embolic-protection device versus CEA in patients with moderate to severe carotid artery stenosis who are at average surgical risk. Methods The probability of the primary outcome was obtained from the results of the CREST trial. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with each treatment modality were estimated by adjusting for the incidence of each quality-adjusted outcome (QALY weights of ipsilateral stroke, MI, death, and postprocedure QALYs). The total cost associated with each intervention was derived from hospitalization cost and cost associated with primary outcomes including stroke, MI, and death in each group. Costs are expressed in US dollars accounting for inflation up to October 2010. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for the 4-year period after the procedure. All values are expressed as means and 95% confidence intervals. Results The estimated net costs for patients after treatment with CAS and CEA after consideration of the primary outcome were $18,335 and $13,276, respectively, from the definitive presimulation analysis. Postsimulation values were $19,210 (range $18,264-$20,156) and $14,080 (range $13,076-$15,084), respectively. Overall, QALYs for the CAS and CEA groups were 0.712 and 0.702, respectively (ranging from 0.0 [death] to 0.815 [no adverse events]). The estimated ICER for CAS versus CEA treatment was $229,429.
