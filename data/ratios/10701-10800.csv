10701,Cost-effectiveness of alternating magnetic resonance imaging and digital mammography screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation carriers,"BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines recommend earlier, more intensive breast cancer screening with both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography for women with breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations. Unspecified details of screening schedules are a challenge for implementing guidelines. METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo computer model was used to simulate screening in asymptomatic women who were BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Three dual-modality strategies were compared with digital mammography (DM) alone: 1) DM and MRI alternating at 6-month intervals beginning at age 25 years (Alt25), 2) annual MRI beginning at age 25 years with alternating DM added at age 30 years (MRI25/Alt30), and 3) DM and MRI alternating at 6-month intervals beginning at age 30 years (Alt30). Primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (in 2010 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness (dollars per QALY gained). Additional outcomes included potential harms of screening, and lifetime costs stratified into component categories (screening and diagnosis, treatment, mortality, and patient time costs). RESULTS: All 3 dual-modality screening strategies increased QALYs and costs. Alt30 screening had the lowest incremental costs per additional QALY gained (BRCA1, $74,200 per QALY; BRCA2, $215,700 per QALY). False-positive test results increased substantially with dual-modality screening and occurred more frequently in BRCA2 carriers. Downstream savings in both breast cancer treatment and mortality costs were outweighed by increases in up-front screening and diagnosis costs. The results were influenced most by estimates of breast cancer risk and MRI costs.

10710,Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Microalbuminuria among African Americans,"Compared with other racial groups, African Americans have a similar prevalence of CKD but are much more likely to progress to ESRD, suggesting that the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies requires dedicated study in this population. Here, we calibrated the CKD Health Policy Model so that it accurately forecasts the higher rates for ESRD observed for African Americans. We then used the calibrated model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for microalbuminuria followed by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor blockers. Incorporating racial differences in risk factors did not fully explain the much higher lifetime incidence of ESRD among African Americans. Thus, to calibrate the model, we applied a 20% increase in the rate of GFR decline at stage 3 and a 60% increase in the rate of GFR decline at stage 4, which resulted in a model that closely reflects lifetime ESRD incidence among African Americans. Compared with usual care, screening African Americans for microalbuminuria at 10-, 5-, 2-, and 1-year intervals had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $9000, $11,000, $19,000, and $35,000 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the same screening intervals were higher for non-African Americans: $17,000, $23,000, $44,000, and $81,000 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively.

10724,The cost-utility of telemedicine to screen for diabetic retinopathy in India,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a telemedicine diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program in rural Southern India that conducts 1-off screening camps (i.e., screening offered once) in villages and to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of different screening intervals. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 rural diabetic patients aged 40 years who had not been previously screened for DR and who were followed over a 25-year period in Chennai, India. METHODS: We interviewed 249 people with diabetes using the time trade-off method to estimate utility values associated with DR. Patient and provider costs of telemedicine screening and hospital-based DR treatment were estimated through interviews with 100 diabetic patients, sampled when attending screening in rural camps (n = 50) or treatment at the base hospital in Chennai (n = 50), and with program and hospital managers. The sensitivity and specificity of the DR screening test were assessed in comparison with diagnosis using a gold standard method for 346 diabetic patients. Other model parameters were derived from the literature. A Markov model was developed in TreeAge Pro 2009 (TreeAge Software Inc, Williamstown, MA) using these data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the current teleophthalmology program of 1-off screening in comparison with no screening program and the cost-utility of this program at different screening intervals. RESULTS: By using the World Health Organization threshold of cost-effectiveness, the current rural teleophthalmology program was cost-effective ($1320 per QALY) compared with no screening from a health provider perspective. Screening intervals of up to a frequency of screening every 2 years also were cost-effective, but annual screening was not (>$3183 per QALY). From a societal perspective, telescreening up to a frequency of once every 5 years was cost-effective, but not more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: From a health provider perspective, a 1-off DR telescreening program is cost-effective compared with no screening in this rural Indian setting.

10730,Clinical simulation model of long-acting opioids for treatment of chronic non-cancer pain in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate costs and outcomes associated with initial tapentadol ER vs oxycodone CR for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) in the US. METHODS: This study developed a Monte-Carlo simulation based on the scientific foundation established by published models of long-acting opioids (LAO) in patients having moderate-to-severe CNCP. It estimates costs and outcomes associated with the use of tapentadol ER vs oxycodone CR over a 1-year period from the perspective of a US payer. LAO effectiveness and treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates are derived from clinical trials of tapentadol ER vs oxycodone CR; other inputs are based on published literature supplemented sparingly with clinical opinion. Sensitivity analyses consider the impact of real-world dosing patterns for LAO on treatment costs. RESULTS: Initial tapentadol ER consistently demonstrates better outcomes than initial oxycodone CR (proportion of patients achieving adequate pain relief and no GI TEAE; acute TEAE-free days; days free of chronic constipation; quality-adjusted life days; productive working hours). While total costs with initial tapentadol ER are slightly (2.2%) higher than with initial oxycodone CR, nearly twice as many modeled patients in the initial tapentadol ER arm (29% vs 15%) achieve adequate pain relief and no GI TEAE compared to initial oxycodone CR. In sensitivity analyses, tapentadol ER becomes a dominant strategy when real-world dosing patterns are considered. CONCLUSION: The additional costs to produce better outcomes (pain relief and no GI TEAE) associated with tapentadol ER are small in the context of double the likelihood of a patient response with tapentadol ER. When daily average consumption (DACON) for oxycodone CR is factored into the analysis, initial tapentadol ER becomes a dominant strategy. Our findings are both strengthened, and limited by the use of randomized trial-centric input parameters. These results should be validated as inputs from clinical practice settings become available.",2013-01-10115,23216013,J Med Econ,Nancy Neil,2013,16 / 2,307-17,Yes,23216013,"Nancy Neil; Sanjay Merchant; David Provenzano; Kristine Ogden; Samir H Mody; Clinical simulation model of long-acting opioids for treatment of chronic non-cancer pain in the United States, J Med Econ, ; 16(2):1369-6998; 307-17",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tapentadol vs. Oxycodone,opioid-nai¨ve and opioid-experienced patients who are appropriate candidates for Long-acting opioid (LAO) therapy,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,16.36,United States,2012,18.45
10731,Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab for uncontrolled allergic asthma in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Omalizumab, licensed for patients with uncontrolled persistent allergic (IgE mediated) asthma, was found to be cost-effective based upon its clinical trial data. Observational studies have been undertaken to determine the real life outcomes of using omalizumab in the community. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab based upon observational data from the Netherlands and compare to its cost-effectiveness using clinical trial data. METHODS: An observational study (eXpeRience) recruited allergic asthma patients eligible for Omalizumab therapy and followed them while on treatment. At 1 year, data from the Dutch patients enrolled in eXpeRience were examined to estimate the number of exacerbations and resource use while on omalizumab therapy compared to the year prior to omalizumab use. Observational data were used in a Markov model to calculate the lifetime cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In the 1 year prior to omalizumab therapy the per-person rate of exacerbations was 3.39 compared to 1.07 in the year taking omalizumab. The discounted incremental lifetime additional costs for omalizumab were euro55,865 for 1.46 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALY), resulting in euro38,371/QALY. Using the INNOVATE clinical trial outcomes and current resource use, the prior ratio was euro34,911/QALY, similar to the observational ratio. As in all observational studies, the main limitation is obtaining complete and accurate data. Patients with missing exacerbation or response data were excluded from this analysis. CONCLUSION: Non-clinical trial experience with omalizumab supported the finding of fewer exacerbations in the allergic asthma population while treated with omalizumab, and therapy was found to continue to have an attractive cost-effectiveness ratio.",2013-01-10116,23216016,J Med Econ,Floortje van Nooten,2013,16 / 3,,Yes,23216016,"Floortje van Nooten; Sean Stern; Gert-Jan Braunstahl; Chris Thompson; Martijn Groot; Ruth E Brown; Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab for uncontrolled allergic asthma in the Netherlands, J Med Econ, ; 16(3):1369-6998",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Standard of care + omalizumab vs. Standard/Usual care,>12 years,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,38371,Euro,2010,60272.76
10732,Estimating and comparing the clinical and economic impact of paediatric rotavirus vaccination in Turkey using a simple versus an advanced model,"BACKGROUND: The burden of rotavirus disease is high in Turkey, reflecting the large birth cohort (>1.2 million) and the risk of disease. Modelling can help to assess the potential economic impact of vaccination. We compared the output of an advanced model with a simple model requiring fewer data inputs. If the results are similar, this could be helpful for countries that have few data available. METHODS: The advanced model was a previously published static Markov cohort model comparing costs and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) outcomes of vaccination versus no vaccination. In contrast, the simple model used only a decision tree. Both models included data on demography, epidemiology, vaccine efficacy, resource use, unit costs, and utility scores from national databases and published papers. Only the perspective of the health care payer was considered in the analysis. The simple model had 23 variables, compared with 103 in the advanced model to allow additional comparisons of different vaccine types, dose schemes and vaccine waning. RESULTS: With the same input data, both models showed that rotavirus vaccination in Turkey would improve health outcomes (fewer QALYs lost to rotavirus disease). The projected annual cost offsets were $29.9 million in the simple and $29.4 million in the advanced model. Sensitivity analysis indicated that in both models the main cost driver was disease incidence followed by cost for hospital care and medical visits. Vaccine efficacy had a smaller effect. CONCLUSION: Both models reached similar conclusions. Both projected that rotavirus vaccination in Turkey would improve health outcomes and may result in savings in direct healthcare costs to offset the cost of vaccination. The analysis indicated that the simple model can produce meaningful economic results in conditions where few data are available.",2013-01-10123,23219433,Vaccine,Mustafa Bakir,2013,31 / 6,,Yes,23219433,"Mustafa Bakir; Baudouin Standaert; Ozden Turel; Zeynep Ece Bilge; Maarten Postma; Estimating and comparing the clinical and economic impact of paediatric rotavirus vaccination in Turkey using a simple versus an advanced model, Vaccine, 2013 Jan 30; 31(6):1873-2518",QALY,Turkey,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rotavirus vaccination vs. None,1-year age groups (0-1 year; 1-2 years; 2-3 years; 3-4 years; 4-5 years),18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,5.00,-12192.84,United States,2010,-14471.69
10733,The cost-effectiveness of mandatory folic acid fortification in Australia,"The Australian government recently introduced mandatory folic acid fortification of bread to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs). The economic evaluation of this policy contained a number of limitations. This study aimed to address the limitations and to reconsider the findings. Cost-effectiveness analysis was used to assess the cost and benefits of mandatory versus voluntary folic acid fortification. Outcomes measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years gained (LYG), avoided NTD cases, and additional severe neuropathy cases. Costs considered included industry costs and regulatory costs to the government. It was estimated that mandatory fortification would prevent 31 NTDs, whereas an additional 14 cases of severe neuropathy would be incurred. Overall, 539 LYG and 503 QALYs would be gained per year of mandatory compared with voluntary fortification. Mandatory fortification was cost-effective at A$10,723 per LYG and at A$11,485 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at A$60,000 and A$151,000 per QALY, the probability that mandatory fortification was the most cost-effective strategy was 79% and 85%, respectively. Threshold analysis of loss of consumer choice indicated that with a compensation value above A$1.21 [assuming a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of A$60,000 per QALY] or A$3.19 (assuming a WTP threshold of A$151,000 per statistical life-year) per capita per year mandatory fortification would not be cost-effective. Mandatory fortification was found to be cost-effective; however, inclusion of the loss of consumer choice can change this result.

10734,Intervention thresholds for denosumab in the UK using a FRAX(R)-based cost-effectiveness analysis,"The objective was to undertake a health economic analysis of denosumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in women from the UK, using the FRAX(R) tool. Denosumab was cost-effective in women with a risk of major osteoporotic fracture meeting or exceeding approximately 20% who are unable to take, comply with or tolerate generic alendronate. INTRODUCTION: Denosumab is a novel biologic agent developed for the treatment of osteoporosis, which has been shown to reduce the risk of fractures in a phase-III trial. The objective of the present study was to undertake a health economic analysis of denosumab in women from the UK. Ten-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture at which denosumab is a cost-effective alternative to no treatment, generic alendronate, risedronate and strontium ranelate were estimated. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted to incorporate fracture and mortality risk assessments based on absolute fracture probability, as estimated by FRAX(R). The model included treatment persistence and residual effect after discontinuation. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life year and a 10-year fracture probability equivalent to a woman with a prior fragility fracture, denosumab was cost-effective compared to no treatment from the age of 70 years. At the same WTP, denosumab was-irrespective of age-cost-effective compared to no treatment at a major osteoporotic fracture probability of approximately 20%. Denosumab was estimated to cost-effectively replace strontium, risedronate and generic alendronate at 10-year probabilities exceeding 11, 19 and 32%, respectively. CONCLUSION: FRAX(R) facilitates the estimation of cost-effectiveness-based intervention thresholds applicable to patients with different combinations of clinical risk factors, which more closely matches the situation in clinical practice.

Denosumab was cost-effective in women with a risk of major osteoporotic fracture meeting or exceeding approximately 20% who are unable to take, comply with or tolerate generic alendronate. INTRODUCTION: Denosumab is a novel biologic agent developed for the treatment of osteoporosis, which has been shown to reduce the risk of fractures in a phase-III trial. The objective of the present study was to undertake a health economic analysis of denosumab in women from the UK. Ten-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture at which denosumab is a cost-effective alternative to no treatment, generic alendronate, risedronate and strontium ranelate were estimated. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted to incorporate fracture and mortality risk assessments based on absolute fracture probability, as estimated by FRAX(R). The model included treatment persistence and residual effect after discontinuation. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life year and a 10-year fracture probability equivalent to a woman with a prior fragility fracture, denosumab was cost-effective compared to no treatment from the age of 70 years.

METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted to incorporate fracture and mortality risk assessments based on absolute fracture probability, as estimated by FRAX(R). The model included treatment persistence and residual effect after discontinuation. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life year and a 10-year fracture probability equivalent to a woman with a prior fragility fracture, denosumab was cost-effective compared to no treatment from the age of 70 years. At the same WTP, denosumab was-irrespective of age-cost-effective compared to no treatment at a major osteoporotic fracture probability of approximately 20%. Denosumab was estimated to cost-effectively replace strontium, risedronate and generic alendronate at 10-year probabilities exceeding 11, 19 and 32%, respectively.

A cost-effectiveness analysis: clinical article","OBJECT: Despite advances in technology and understanding in spinal physiology, reoperation for symptomatic adjacent-segment disease (ASD), same-level recurrent stenosis, and pseudarthrosis in elderly patients continues to occur. While revision lumbar surgery is effective, attention has turned to questions on the utility and value of the revision decompression and fusion procedure. To date, an analysis of the cost and health state gain associated with revision lumbar surgery in elderly patients with symptomatic pseudarthrosis, ASD, or same-level recurrent lumbar stenosis has yet to be performed. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of revision surgery in elderly patients with recurrent or persistent back and leg pain. METHODS: After reviewing their institutional database, the authors found 69 patients 65 years of age and older who had undergone revision decompression and instrumented fusion for back and leg pain associated with pseudarthrosis (17 patients), same-level recurrent stenosis (24 patients), or ASD (28 patients) and included them in this study. Total 2-year back-related medical resource utilization and health state values (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], calculated from the EQ-5D, the EuroQol-5D health survey, with US valuation) were assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts. The mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after revision surgery was assessed. RESULTS: The mean (+/- standard deviation) time between the index surgery and revision surgery was 3.51 +/- 3.63 years. A mean cumulative 2-year gain of 0.35 QALY was observed after revision surgery. The mean total 2-year cost of revision surgery was $28,256 +/- $3000 (ASD: $28,829 +/- $3812, pseudarthrosis: $28,069 +/- $2508, same-level recurrent stenosis: $27,871 +/- $2375).

10779,Cost effectiveness of the interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis screening of hemodialysis patients,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection in hemodialysis patients is higher than that in the general population. Our aim was to assess the cost effectiveness of QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) compared with the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the chest x-ray examination (CXR) for tuberculosis screening of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Markov models were constructed using a societal perspective on the lifetime horizon. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old hemodialysis patients. All costs and clinical benefits were discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3%. Three strategies QFT, TST and CXR were modeled. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, QFT yielded the greatest benefits at the lowest cost [US$7694.43; 4.19 258 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] compared with the TST (US$9337.81; 4.18 543 QALYs) and CXR (US$12 951.36; 4.14 821 QALYs) (year 2012 values). The cost effectiveness was sensitive to the the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination rate. The TST strategy was more cost effective than the QFT strategy at the willingness-to-pay level of US$50 000/QALY gained when the rate of BCG vaccination was 0.18 or lower. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve of 40-year-old patients by Monte Carlo simulations for 10 000 trials demonstrated that the QFT was the most cost effective with a value of 100% at all willingness-to-pay levels compared with TST and CXR.

10781,Cost-effectiveness of childhood influenza vaccination in England and Wales: Results from a dynamic transmission model,"This study uses a dynamic influenza transmission model to directly compare the cost-effectiveness of various policies of annual paediatric influenza vaccination in England and Wales, varying the target age range and level of coverage. The model accounts for both the protection of those immunised and the indirect protection of the rest of the population via herd immunity. The impact of augmenting current practice with a policy to vaccinate pre-school age children, on their own or with school age children, was assessed in terms of quality adjusted life years and health service costs.

Sigmoidoscopy''s benefit is limited to the distal colon. Observational data are conflicting regarding the degree to which colonoscopy affords protection against proximal CRC. Our aim was to explore the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy and alternative CRC screening strategies in light of the latest published data. METHODS: We performed a contemporary cost-utility analysis using a Markov model validated against data from randomized controlled trials of FOBT and sigmoidoscopy. Persons at average CRC risk within the general US population were modeled. Screening strategies included those recommended by the United States (US) Preventive Services Task Force, including colonoscopy every 10 years (COLO), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years (FS), annual fecal occult blood testing, annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), and the combination FS/FIT. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. RESULTS: In the base case, FIT dominated other strategies. The advantage of FIT over FS and COLO was contingent on rates of uptake and adherence that are well above current US rates. Compared with FIT, FS and COLO both cost <$50,000/QALY gained when FIT per-cycle adherence was <50%. COLO cost $56,800/QALY gained vs. FS in the base case.

Compared with FIT, FS and COLO both cost <$50,000/QALY gained when FIT per-cycle adherence was <50%. COLO cost $56,800/QALY gained vs. FS in the base case. COLO cost <$100,000/QALY gained vs. FS when COLO yielded a relative risk of proximal CRC of <0.5 vs. no screening. In probabilistic analyses, COLO was cost-effective vs. FS at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained in 84% of iterations. CONCLUSIONS: Screening colonoscopy may be cost-effective compared with FIT and sigmoidoscopy, depending on the relative rates of screening uptake and adherence and the protective benefit of colonoscopy in the proximal colon.

Our aim was to explore the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy and alternative CRC screening strategies in light of the latest published data. METHODS: We performed a contemporary cost-utility analysis using a Markov model validated against data from randomized controlled trials of FOBT and sigmoidoscopy.
