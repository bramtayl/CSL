4201,Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in the elderly: an update for 10 Western European countries,"Pneumococcal vaccine is effective in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease in adults >or=65 years of age, but it is not widely used in Western Europe. In this study, data from an earlier (1995) cost-effectiveness study on Belgium, France, Scotland, Spain, and Sweden are updated, and data on five new countries--Denmark, the UK (specifically, England and Wales), Germany, Italy and The Netherlands--are added. Epidemiological and economic variables specific for each country were used, and it was assumed that pneumococcal and influenza vaccines would both be administered during the same physician visit. In the base-case analyses, the cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from euro 9239 to euro 23,657 per quality-adjusted life-year. Because the incidence and mortality of invasive pneumococcal disease were underestimated in most countries, a country-by-country analysis was performed, assuming an incidence of 50 cases per 100,000 population and mortality rates of 20, 30 and 40%. For a mortality of 20%, the cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from euro 4,778 to euro 17,093, and for a mortality of 30%, they ranged from euro 3,186 to euro 11,395.

With the use of outcome data and patient characteristics reported from an ongoing prospective observational trial, a validated computer simulation model of diabetes was used to project the clinical and cost outcomes associated with therapy conversion to insulin detemir over a 35-y period from (1) OHA only, (2) neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH)+/-OHA, and (3) insulin glargine+/-OHA. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from a third-party healthcare payer perspective for the year 2005. Costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3%. Treatment with insulin detemir+/-OHA was associated with increases in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.309, 0.350, and 0.333 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus treatment with OHA alone, NPH+/-OHA, and insulin glargine+/-OHA, respectively. Increases in pharmacy costs were partially offset by reduced complications, rticularly renal complications and neuropathy.

On the basis of preliminary evidence of short-term improvements in glycemic control and reduced hypoglycemia, therapy conversion to insulin detemir+/-OHA from OHA alone, NPH+/-OHA, or insulin glargine+/-OHA was projected to increase quality-adjusted life expectancy and to represent a cost-effective treatment option in the United States.",2007-01-03275,17565917,Adv Ther,William J Valentine,2007,24 / 2,273-90,No,17565917,"William J Valentine; K M Erny-Albrecht; J A Ray; S Roze; D Cobden; A J Palmer; Therapy conversion to insulin detemir among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral agents: a modeling study of cost-effectiveness in the United States, Adv Ther, 2007 Mar-Apr; 24(2):0741-238X; 273-90",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Conversion of patients from OHA to insulin detemir+OHA vs. Treatment with oral hypoglycemic agent alone (OHA),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,7412,United States,2005,9822.36

4206,Cost effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir compared with atazanavir plus ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced patients in the US,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness and long-term combined effects of HIV disease and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy-related risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) on quality-adjusted survival and healthcare costs for ARV-experienced patients. METHODS: A previously validated Markov model was updated and supplemented with the Framingham CHD risk equation. The representative patient in the model was male, aged 37 years and had a baseline 10-year CHD risk of 4.6%. Patients started with either lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV+RTV) as the protease inhibitor (PI). The proportions of patients with viral suppression below 400 and 50 copies/mL, respectively, at week 48 reported in clinical trials were used to estimate the differences between these two therapies. The daily ARV costs were $US 24.60 for LPV/r capsules (2005 costs) and $US 26.54 for LPV/r tablets (2006 costs), $US 29.76 for ATV and $US 8.57 for ritonavir (2005 costs). Costs of other ARV drugs were taken from average wholesale drug reports for 2005. The cost of AIDS events was estimated from Medicaid billing databases and reflected a medical care system perspective and 2005 treatment costs. Cost-effectiveness calculations assumed a lifetime time horizon. The effects of different model assumptions were tested in a multiway sensitivity analysis by combining extreme values of parameters. RESULTS: The model estimated a clinical and economic advantage to using LPV/r over ATV+RTV, which varied depending upon the use of LPV/r capsules or tablets. Using LPV/r capsules was comparatively beneficial for ARV-experienced patients in quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs) of 4.6 (corrected for differences in CHD risk) compared with ATV+RTV. In addition, there were 5- and 10-year overall per-patient cost savings of $US 17,995 and $US 21,298, respectively. Estimates for the LPV/r tablet formulation approved in 2005 (assuming similar efficacy) improved cost savings over 5- and 10-year periods to $US 19,598 and $US 23,126 per patient, respectively, because of a drug price differential. Sensitivity analysis tested numerous assumptions about the model cost and efficacy parameters and found that the results were robust to most changes. Model limitations were the uncertainty associated with the model parameters used. CONCLUSION: LPV/r appears to be a highly cost-effective regimen relative to ATV+RTV for the treatment of HIV. The long-term CHD risk associated with LPV/r was minimal compared with the increased risk of AIDS/death and costs projected for a less efficacious PI-based regimen.",2007-01-03278,17563124,Clin Drug Investig,Kit N Simpson,2007,27 / 7,443-52,Yes,17563124,"Kit N Simpson; Walter J Jones; Rukmini Rajagopalan; Birgitta Dietz; Cost effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir compared with atazanavir plus ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced patients in the US, Clin Drug Investig, 2007; 27(7):1173-2563; 443-52",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with Lopinavir/Ritonavir Capsules vs. Treatment with Atazanavir plus Ritonavir,Not Stated,37 Years,37 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-55608.36,United States,2005,-73692.03
4207,Modelling the cost effectiveness of TNF-alpha antagonists in the management of rheumatoid arthritis: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Registry,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of TNF-alpha antagonist therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United Kingdom using data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Registry (BSRBR). METHODS: A simulation model is constructed to quantify the cost effectiveness of the TNF-alpha antagonist therapies (infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab) as a group versus traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, with a time horizon over the full patient lifetime. Participants are UK NHS patients in the BSRBR with RA who have failed at least two traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The BSRBR aims to recruit all RA patients starting on a TNF-alpha antagonist agent and follows them 6 monthly via consultant and patient administered questionnaires. Data collected include disease activity scores (DAS28), the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the SF-36. Costs include drug, monitoring and hospitalisations. Benefits are measured in disability and quality of life improvements. The main outcome measure is the incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year gained (discounted). RESULTS: The basecase cost per quality adjusted life-year gained by using TNF-alpha antagonist therapies is estimated at pound23 882, with probabilistic uncertainty analysis suggesting that the probability that treatments are below 30,000 pounds per QALY is around 84%. The results are most sensitive to assumptions concerning long-term disability progression, discount rates and the validity or otherwise of SF6D derived utility measures. Subgroup analysis, monotherapy versus combination with methotrexate, and a limited analysis of sequential therapy with two TNF-alpha antagonist agents, suggest cost-effectiveness ratios around 20,000 pounds to 30,000 pounds. CONCLUSIONS: The BSRBR data provide valuable evidence for estimating cost-effectiveness. The analysis concludes that current policies and practice for the use of TNF-alpha antagonist therapies, after RA patients have failed at least two traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, appear cost-effective in the context of the NICE re-appraisal of 2006 for England and Wales, thus supporting their decision to continue their reimbursement. Decision-makers worldwide might adapt this analysis because differential costs, discount rates and other factors could affect results.

4210,The potential cost-effectiveness of prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccines in Canada,"AIM: Clinical trials have shown prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines to be effective against infection and disease. We examined whether HPV vaccination has the potential to be cost-effective. METHODS: A cohort model of the natural history of HPV was developed, which fits simultaneously Canadian age and type-specific data for infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer (CC) and genital warts (GW). Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) lost and costs were estimated using data from the literature. RESULTS: Vaccinating 12-year-old girls (efficacy=95%, no waning, cost/course=CAN$ 400) against HPV-16/18 and HPV-6/11/16/18 is estimated to cost the health provider CAN$ 31,000 (80%CrI: 15,000-55,000) and CAN$ 21,000 (80%CrI: 11,000-33,000) per QALY-gained, respectively. Results were most sensitive to age at vaccination, duration of vaccine protection, vaccine cost and QALY-lost due to GW, and were least sensitive to the medical costs. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating adolescent girls against HPV is likely to be cost-effective. The main benefit of vaccination will be in reducing CC mortality.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a booster dose at 12 years of age with either MCV-C or a quadrivalent ACYW135 meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV-4). METHODS: A simulation model for assessing both the direct and indirect effects of vaccination was developed. Age- and serogroup-specific incidence and fatality rates were derived from Canadian surveillance data. Vaccine efficacy was estimated from data from the U.K. and Spain, assuming an age-dependent decline of vaccine efficacy over time. Expected vaccine coverage rates were 90% at 12 months, and 70% at 12 years. Herd immunity was modeled using UK data. Vaccine purchase price per dose was $23 for MCV-C and $70 for MCV-4. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Results, expressed in 2004 Canadian $ and from a societal perspective, were presented for a steady state situation and a population of 1 million. RESULTS: Under the ""no vaccination"" base scenario, 5.7 cases of vaccine-preventable meningococcal disease would occur each year. Vaccination at 12 months using MCV-C would reduce the burden of disease by 32%. Adding MCV-C at 12 years of age would reduce the number of cases by 55% at no marginal cost, while using MCV-4 would result in a disease reduction of 78% for a marginal cost of $31000 per QALY gained. Comparing MCV-4 with MCV-C as a booster dose, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would be $113000 per QALY. The efficacy of C-MCV vaccination at 12 months and the differential price between the two vaccines were the parameters having the strongest impact on the cost/QALY ratios. Any increase in the incidence of serogroup Y will improve the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio associated with MCV-4. CONCLUSION: Adolescent revaccination would be beneficial.

METHODS: Clinical and utility data from a 5-year randomised controlled trial comparing LNG-IUS with hysterectomy were combined with further data from published studies to construct a state-transition (Markov) model. The model depicted the movement of patients between health states over 5 years following treatment for menorrhagia. The model was used to estimate the cost-utility of LNG-IUS followed by ablation (L-A); LNG-IUS followed by hysterectomy (L-H); immediate ablation (MEA or TBEA) and immediate hysterectomy in the UK at 2004/2005 prices, from the perspective of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The expected 5-yearly cost of treating menorrhagia with L-A, L-H, TBEA, MEA and hysterectomy was estimated to be 828 pounds sterling, 1355 pounds sterling, 1679 pounds sterling, 1812 pounds sterling and 2983 pounds sterling per patient respectively and the expected level of health gain to be 4.14, 4.12, 4.13, 4.13 and 4.01 QALYs per patient respectively.

METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was created with transition states: bleeding, no bleeding, no bleeding post transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, post-salvage surgery, and death. Efficacy data on survival, re-bleeding and control of bleeding were obtained from high quality studies reported in Cochrane meta-analyses. Baseline outcomes related to the course of disease and health-state utilities were derived from published sources. Vasoactive treatment costs and all related BOV costs were obtained from published UK sources. RESULTS: The average aggregated treatment cost per person for all medical interventions at 1 year was lower for terlipressin-treated patients (2623 pounds sterling) compared with those treated using octreotide (2758 pounds sterling) or placebo (2890 pounds sterling). The incremental analysis comparing terlipressin with octreotide and placebo using a cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and cost per life year gained (LYG) approach indicated that terlipressin was the dominant BOV treatment option (i.e. it cost less and it was more effective). Based on a maximum willingness to pay of 20,000 pounds sterling/QALY terlipressin was more effective and cost-saving compared to octreotide and placebo for simulations ranging from 42 days to 2 years. In point estimation analyses octreotide was dominant compared to placebo; however, probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that octreotide was unlikely to be cost-effective compared to placebo.

4221,Cost effectiveness of adjuvant interferon in node-positive melanoma,"PURPOSE: To assess the benefits of adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa (HDI) treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma. METHODS: We designed a decision-analytic probabilistic Markov model to simulate the natural history of patients with stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC melanoma and evaluate the outcomes with and without HDI treatment. Outcomes were in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probability estimates and costs were derived from primary patient level data, while the efficacy of HDI and associated utilities were determined from published reports. The base-case analysis was a cohort of 50-year-old patients. RESULTS: HDI increased the median life expectancy in patients with stage III melanoma from 3.75 years in the observation cohort to 4.42 years in the HDI cohort. The difference in QALYs ranged from 0.31 years for stage IIIA patients to 0.60 years for stage IIIC patients treated with HDI. HDI was cost effective in patients with stage IIIB and IIIC melanoma, with ICERs of $95,304 and $76,068 per QALY gained, respectively.

The base-case analysis was a cohort of 50-year-old patients. RESULTS: HDI increased the median life expectancy in patients with stage III melanoma from 3.75 years in the observation cohort to 4.42 years in the HDI cohort. The difference in QALYs ranged from 0.31 years for stage IIIA patients to 0.60 years for stage IIIC patients treated with HDI. HDI was cost effective in patients with stage IIIB and IIIC melanoma, with ICERs of $95,304 and $76,068 per QALY gained, respectively. Using a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained, HDI was cost effective for all stage III patients younger than 52 years. HDI was not cost effective for patients with stage IIIA disease and for subsets of patients older than 63 years with stage IIIB disease. CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates that the probability of HDI being cost effective varies substantially by melanoma substage.

4224,Cost effectiveness of adjuvant interferon in node-positive melanoma,"PURPOSE: To assess the benefits of adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa (HDI) treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma. METHODS: We designed a decision-analytic probabilistic Markov model to simulate the natural history of patients with stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC melanoma and evaluate the outcomes with and without HDI treatment.

4225,The cost-effectiveness of etanercept in patients with severe ankylosing spondylitis in the UK,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the costs and benefits associated with long-term etanercept (ETN) treatment in patients with severe ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the UK in accordance with the BSR guidelines. METHODS: A mathematical model was constructed to estimate the costs and benefits associated with ETN plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared with NSAIDs alone. Individual patient data from Phase III RCTs was used to inform the proportion and magnitude of initial response to treatment and changes in health-related quality of life. A retrospective costing exercise on patients attending a UK secondary care rheumatology unit was used to inform disease costs. Published evidence on long-term disease progression was extrapolated over a 25-yr horizon. Uncertainty was examined using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Over a 25-yr horizon, ETN plus NSAIDs gave 1.58 more QALYs at an additional cost of 35,978 pounds when compared with NSAID treatment alone. This equates to a central estimate of 22,700 pounds per QALY. The incremental cost per QALYs using shorter time periods were 27,600 pounds, 23,600 pounds and 22,600 pounds at 2, 5 and 15 yrs, respectively. Using a 25-yr horizon, 93% of results from the probabilistic analyses fall below a threshold of 25,000 pounds per QALY.

4226,The cost of urogynaecological treatments: which are more cost-effective?,"AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of four urogynaecological treatments. MATERIALS: Two prospective trials were performed in which 205 women with urinary incontinence underwent urogynaecological treatments. The cost incurred and the improvement in quality of life (QOL) as a result of treatment was calculated as cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and then ranked in order of cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The Nurse Continence Advisor (NCA) group (N = 73) and the Urogynaecologist (UG) group (N = 72) both had significant improvements in leaks per week and incontinence score. QOL improvement was also similar (1.5% vs 1.2%). The economic data found a similar improvement in pad usage costs ($A2.90 vs $A3.52). The clinician costs were significantly lower for the NCA group ($A60.00 vs $A105.00) (P < 0.0001). The cost per QALY was significantly lower for the NCA group ($A28,009 vs $A35,312) (P = 0.03). Both groups had significant improvements in pad testing and leaks per week. The cure/improvement rates were also similar at three months (100% vs 89%). There was no significant difference in the improvement in QOL between the laparoscopic colposuspension (LC) and open colposuspension (OC) groups (2.09% vs 1.54%).

OBJECTIVES: To compare costs and outcomes for 10 000 simulated HIV-infected patients followed every 6 months for 10 years in a limited-resource setting. METHOD: Five nested strategies, with and without the availability of a second-line treatment regimen, were simulated: (a) no ART (NO ART); (b) with ART but without any laboratory markers of HIV other than positive serology (ART ONLY); (c) ART plus total lymphocyte count (TLC); (d) ART plus CD4 cell counts (CD4); and (e) ART plus CD4 cell count plus viral load measurement (VL). Baseline prices of CD4 cell count and viral load measurements were $5.00 and $25.00 per test, respectively. RESULTS: With no second-line treatment available, treating 10 000 patients with ART ONLY compared with NO ART would cost $14.49 million [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.45-14.52] and would generate an additional 23 060 quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) (95% CI, 22 770-23 360) for a median incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $628/QALY.

OBJECTIVES: To compare costs and outcomes for 10 000 simulated HIV-infected patients followed every 6 months for 10 years in a limited-resource setting. METHOD: Five nested strategies, with and without the availability of a second-line treatment regimen, were simulated: (a) no ART (NO ART); (b) with ART but without any laboratory markers of HIV other than positive serology (ART ONLY); (c) ART plus total lymphocyte count (TLC); (d) ART plus CD4 cell counts (CD4); and (e) ART plus CD4 cell count plus viral load measurement (VL). Baseline prices of CD4 cell count and viral load measurements were $5.00 and $25.00 per test, respectively. RESULTS: With no second-line treatment available, treating 10 000 patients with ART ONLY compared with NO ART would cost $14.49 million [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.45-14.52] and would generate an additional 23 060 quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) (95% CI, 22 770-23 360) for a median incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $628/QALY.

4237,Cost effectiveness of adalimumab for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of adalimumab vs conventional therapy in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: The analysis was based on pooled data from two Phase III studies of adalimumab in active AS. Patients with an inadequate response to >/=1 NSAID received adalimumab 40 mg every other week (n = 246) or placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks. A microsimulation model was developed with patients being treated with adalimumab according to the International ASAS Consensus Statement and BSR guidelines. The pooled adalimumab data, as well as data from the Outcome Assessment in AS International Study (OASIS) database and the literature, were used to model patients' BASDAI and BASFI scores and costs and health-related quality of life associated with various degrees of disease activity. Costs (in 2004 British pound) of AS, drug, administration, monitoring, hospitalization and AEs were calculated from the perspective of the UK NHS. Discounting was applied at 3.5% per year for costs and benefits as per the NICE reference case for economic evaluations. Uncertainty was addressed via sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adalimumab vs conventional therapy was estimated to improve with longer time horizons (48 weeks to 5 and 30 yrs). The central estimate was that, over 30 yrs, adalimumab therapy yielded 1.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient initiating therapy. Some AS treatment-related costs were estimated to be offset by adalimumab (at 10,750 pounds/patient), leaving a total incremental cost (adalimumab vs conventional therapy) at 23,857 pounds per patient. The 30-yr ICER of adalimumab vs conventional therapy was estimated at 23 pounds 097/QALY. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of results. When indirect costs were also included (analysis from societal perspective), ICER improved to 5093 pounds/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that adalimumab, when used according to UK treatment guidelines, is cost-effective vs conventional therapy for treating AS patients.",2007-01-03292,17545684,Rheumatology (Oxford),M F Botteman,2007,46 / 8,1320-8,No,17545684,"M F Botteman; J W Hay; M P Luo; A S Curry; R L Wong; B A van Hout; Cost effectiveness of adalimumab for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in the United Kingdom, Rheumatology (Oxford), 2007-Aug; 46(8):1462-0324; 1320-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Adalimumab, tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist, TNF-a vs. Conventional therapy",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,23097,United Kingdom,2004,58005.43

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using a Markov model. SETTING: Veterans Affairs health care system. DATA SOURCE: Data for the model were obtained from clinical trials and published literature. Data from the VA health care system were used to define the patient cohorts. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A Markov model incorporating transition probabilities between disease health states that depend only on the current health state was developed to simulate the progression of HCV disease. The patient cohorts were a 45-year-old male cohort and a 55-year-old male cohort, each with liver fibrosis but no cirrhosis. The lifetime expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) with HCV treatments were determined for each cohort by genotype (genotype 1, and genotypes 2 and 3). Both peginterferon regimens were significantly more cost-effective than no treatment, although no significant differences in costs or QALYs were noted between peginterferon regimens. For the 45-year-old cohort with a genotype 1 infection, the INMB was $128,583 (95% confidence interval [CI] $79,279-$177,308) and $128,025 (95% CI $80,425-$173,448) versus no treatment for peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, respectively. Treatment with either peginterferon regimen produced significantly lower lifetime HCV-related medical costs for genotype 2 or 3 infections, but not genotype 1.

4245,Peginterferon alfa-2a versus peginterferon alfa-2b as initial treatment of hepatitis C virus infection: a cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the Veterans Affairs Health Care System,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, and no therapy for treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from the perspective of the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system by using patient-reported utility scores. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using a Markov model. SETTING: Veterans Affairs health care system. DATA SOURCE: Data for the model were obtained from clinical trials and published literature. Data from the VA health care system were used to define the patient cohorts. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A Markov model incorporating transition probabilities between disease health states that depend only on the current health state was developed to simulate the progression of HCV disease. The patient cohorts were a 45-year-old male cohort and a 55-year-old male cohort, each with liver fibrosis but no cirrhosis. The lifetime expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) with HCV treatments were determined for each cohort by genotype (genotype 1, and genotypes 2 and 3). Both peginterferon regimens were significantly more cost-effective than no treatment, although no significant differences in costs or QALYs were noted between peginterferon regimens. For the 45-year-old cohort with a genotype 1 infection, the INMB was $128,583 (95% confidence interval [CI] $79,279-$177,308) and $128,025 (95% CI $80,425-$173,448) versus no treatment for peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, respectively. Treatment with either peginterferon regimen produced significantly lower lifetime HCV-related medical costs for genotype 2 or 3 infections, but not genotype 1.

4246,Parathyroidectomy versus cinacalcet hydrochloride-based medical therapy in the management of hyperparathyroidism in ESRD: a cost utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Previously, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism had few options other than parathyroidectomy, which was reserved for patients refractory to medical therapy. Newer calcimimetic agents, such as cinacalcet, may be an alternative, but raise the possibility of indefinite medical treatment that also would increase costs. STUDY DESIGN: Cost utility analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: Base case consisted of prevalent adult US patients with ESRD refractory to management with standard medical therapy. Characteristics were obtained from patients who underwent parathyroidectomy in 2001, and, for purposes of comparison, patients in whom cinacalcet was used were assigned similar characteristics. All data came from preexisting literature and trials or from US Renal Data System analysis files. INTERVENTION: Use of cinacalcet hydrochloride versus parathyroidectomy. PERSPECTIVE & TIME FRAME: Medicare and societal costs and quality-adjusted life-years from the date of parathyroidectomy or use of cinacalcet followed up for 2 years, respectively. MODEL & OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were cost (measured in US dollars) and cost utility measured using cost per quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: At base-case surgical and drug costs, surgical and drug success rates, complication rates/costs, and benefit from correction of hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy was found to be both less expensive and more cost-effective at 7.25 +/- 0.25 months. Parathyroidectomy became more cost-effective at 15.28 to 16.32 months at the upper limit of sensitivity analysis, when drug/surgical costs and success/complication rates/costs were maximally weighted to favor cinacalcet-based medical therapy. LIMITATIONS: We assumed current costs of both cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy and assumed cinacalcet use would be indefinite. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ESRD with uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism who are good candidates for either drug therapy or surgery, cinacalcet hydrochloride is the most cost-effective modality if the patient is to remain on dialysis therapy for 7.25 +/- 0.25 months. Cinacalcet may be more optimal if used in patients who have high risk of mortality or who would expect to receive a kidney transplant quickly. For other subgroups, parathyroidectomy dominated.",2007-01-03300,17533023,Am J Kidney Dis,Rajeev Narayan,2007,49 / 6,801-13,No,17533023,"Rajeev Narayan; Robert M Perkins; Elizabeth P Berbano; Christina M Yuan; Robert T Neff; Eric S Sawyers; Fred E Yeo; Gwenaelle M Vidal-Trecan; Kevin C Abbott; Parathyroidectomy versus cinacalcet hydrochloride-based medical therapy in the management of hyperparathyroidism in ESRD: a cost utility analysis, Am J Kidney Dis, 2007-Jun; 49(6):1523-6838; 801-13",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Parathyroidectomy vs. Cinacalcet Hydrochloride-Based Medical Therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2005,Not Stated
4247,Cost-utility analysis of a multidisciplinary job retention vocational rehabilitation program in patients with chronic arthritis at risk of job loss,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate from a societal perspective the cost-utility of a multidisciplinary job retention vocational rehabilitation program compared with usual care in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases at risk of job loss. METHODS: Patients (n = 121) were randomly assigned to either the vocational rehabilitation program or usual outpatient care initiated by the treating rheumatologist. Followup lasted for 2 years. Program costs were estimated using time registrations and other societal costs using quarterly cost questionnaires filled out by the patients. To estimate quality-adjusted life years, utility was assessed using the EuroQol classification system, EuroQol rating scale, Short Form 6D, and Time Trade-Off. RESULTS: As part of the vocational rehabilitation program, patients on average had a total of 7.1 consultations and the total time spent by the multidisciplinary team was 12.7 hours per patient. Program costs were estimated at euro1,426, of which approximately 20% were time and travel costs incurred by the patients. No significant differences were found in other health care consumption, productivity, or quality-adjusted life years. Program costs were outweighed by total savings on other health care and nonhealth care costs, but not significantly. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, it remains unclear whether the program reduces or increases total costs. Further research on effective vocational rehabilitation is warranted, with special attention to early detection of work problems and the collaboration between health care and vocational rehabilitation services.",2007-01-03302,17530677,Arthritis Rheum,Wilbert B van den Hout,2007,57 / 5,778-86,No,17530677,"Wilbert B van den Hout; Petronella D M de Buck; Theodora P M Vliet Vlieland; Cost-utility analysis of a multidisciplinary job retention vocational rehabilitation program in patients with chronic arthritis at risk of job loss, Arthritis Rheum, 2007-Jun-15; 57(5):0004-3591; 778-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,A multidisciplinary job retention vocational rehabilitation program vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,2005,Not Stated

INTRODUCTION: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a population-based screen-and-treat strategy for osteoporosis (DXA followed by alendronate treatment if osteoporotic, or osteopenic in the presence of fracture), compared to no intervention, from the perspective of the Swiss health care system. METHODS: A published Markov model assessed by first-order Monte Carlo simulation was refined to reflect the diagnostic process and treatment effects. Women and men entered the model at age 50. Main screening ages were 65, 75, and 85 years. Age at bone densitometry was flexible for persons fracturing before the main screening age. Realistic assumptions were made with respect to persistence with intended 5 years of alendronate treatment. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In women, costs per QALY were Swiss francs (CHF) 71,000, CHF 35,000, and CHF 28,000 for the main screening ages of 65, 75, and 85 years. The threshold of CHF 50,000 per QALY was reached between main screening ages 65 and 75 years. Population-based screening was not cost-effective in men.

4254,Reducing uncertainty in health-care resource allocation,"A key task for health policymakers is to optimise the outcome of health care interventions. The pricing of a new generation of cancer drugs, in combination with limited health care resources, has highlighted the need for improved methodology to estimate outcomes of different treatment options. Here we introduce new general methodology, which for the first time employs continuous hazard functions for analysis of survival data. Access to continuous hazard functions allows more precise estimations of survival outcomes for different treatment options. We illustrate the methodology by calculating outcomes for adjuvant treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours with imatinib mesylate, which selectively inhibits the activity of a cancer-causing enzyme and is a hallmark representative for the new generation of cancer drugs. The calculations reveal that optimal drug pricing can generate all win situations that improve drug availability to patients, make the most of public expenditure on drugs and increase pharmaceutical company gross profits. The use of continuous hazard functions for analysis of survival data may reduce uncertainty in health care resource allocation, and the methodology can be used for drug price negotiations and to investigate health care intervention thresholds. Health policy makers, pharmaceutical industry, reimbursement authorities and insurance companies, as well as clinicians and patient organisations, should find the methodology useful.",2007-01-03304,17519908,Br J Cancer,T Simonsson,2007,96 / 12,1834-8,No,17519908,"T Simonsson; K Sjölund; P Bümming; H Ahlman; B Nilsson; A Odén; Reducing uncertainty in health-care resource allocation, Br J Cancer, 2007-Jun-18; 96(12):0007-0920; 1834-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjuvant treatment with imantinib mesylate vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2005,Not Stated
4255,Cost-effectiveness of memantine in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease patients receiving donepezil,"OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of memantine in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) receiving stable doses of donepezil were recently demonstrated in a phase III trial. The cost-effectiveness of such therapy is unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed to depict AD progression over time and associated clinical and economic outcomes. AD progression was measured in terms of decline in cognitive function, as assessed by the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). At model entry, patients were assumed to have moderate-to-severe AD, to be on stable doses of donepezil, and to begin combination therapy with memantine, or continue to receive donepezil alone; duration of therapy was assumed to be 1 year. Drug efficacy was based on data from a phase III trial. Key assumptions of the model included: (1) efficacy of study drugs would extend to 1 year; (2) measures of cognitive function could be mapped to one another, as well as to global measures of disease severity; and (3) following therapy discontinuation, cognitive function would revert immediately to natural history levels. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of cost (2005 US$) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a lifetime (3% discount rate). RESULTS: SIB scores were estimated to improve by 3.3 over 1 year from therapy with memantine plus donepezil (vs. donepezil alone). While pharmacotherapy costs were estimated to increase by $1250 during the year of memantine treatment, costs of formal and informal services were estimated to decrease by $1240 over this period and by $1493 (discounted present value) over a lifetime. Findings were sensitive to the assumed SIB score at therapy initiation; cost-effectiveness was better for patients with higher initial SIB scores (i.e., less severe disease). CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe AD already receiving donepezil, treatment with memantine results in improved clinical outcomes and reduced total costs of care.",2007-01-03305,17519086,Curr Med Res Opin,Derek Weycker,2007,23 / 5,1187-97,No,17519086,"Derek Weycker; Charu Taneja; John Edelsberg; M Haim Erder; Frederick A Schmitt; Juliana Setyawan; Gerry Oster; Cost-effectiveness of memantine in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease patients receiving donepezil, Curr Med Res Opin, 2007-May; 23(5):0300-7995; 1187-97",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,One year of therapy with memantine plus donepezil vs. One year of therapy with donepezil alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-8897.06,United States,2005,-11790.36
4256,Cost-effectiveness of salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate combination inhaler in chronic asthma,"OBJECTIVE: To determine where in the treatment steps recommended by the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (BTS/SIGN) Asthma Guideline it is cost-effective to use salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate combination inhaler (SFC) (Seretide) compared with other inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) containing regimens (with and without a long acting beta-2 agonist (LABA)) for chronic asthma in adults and children. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Meta-analyses of percentage symptom-free days (%SFD) were used within a cost-effectiveness model. Time spent in two asthma control health states, 'symptom-free' and 'with-symptoms' was used as the measure of differential treatment effectiveness. SFC was compared with varying doses of fluticasone propionate (FP) and beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) with or without a separate salmeterol inhaler, and with the budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler (BUD/FORM) (Symbicort). Drug costs, non-drug costs and quality adjusted life years (QALY) were incorporated into the analyses. Results are presented as cost per QALY ratios and uncertainty explored using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Compared with an increased dose of FP in adults, SFC either 'dominates' (i.e. cheaper and more effective) FP or the cost per QALY is 6852 pounds sterling. The cost per QALYs estimated in sensitivity analyses using BDP costs range from 5679 pounds sterling to 15,997 pounds sterling. For children the cost per QALY for SFC 50 Evohaler compared with an increased dose of FP is pound 15,739 pounds sterling. SFC is similarly clinically effective in improving %SFDs compared with FP plus salmeterol delivered in separate inhalers (mean differences for each dose comparison of -3.9 (low) (with a 95% confidence interval (CI): -12.96; 5.16); 4.10 (medium) (95% CI: -3.01; 11.21); -0.4 (high) (95% CI: -8.88; 8.08)) and BUD/FORM (mean difference of 0.40 (95% CI -3.69; 4.49)) in adults, and a cheaper SFC option is available at all doses (annual cost savings range from 18 pounds sterling-427 pounds sterling per patient). SFC was similarly effective compared with FP plus salmeterol in separate inhalers in children under 12 and also resulted in annual cost savings of between 47 pounds sterling and 77 pounds sterling. A number of other comparisons were also made and the results are available as electronic supplementary data. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of SFC in chronic asthma compared with multiple comparators and based on a systematic identification of relevant trials and data on %SFDs. The findings suggest that for adults and children uncontrolled on BDP 400 microg/day or equivalent it is a cost-effective option to switch to SFC (at an equivalent ICS dose) compared with increasing the dose of ICS. For adults and children aged 12 years and over who have passed this point and are uncontrolled on BDP 800 microg/day or equivalent, switching to SFC remains a cost-effective approach.

SFC is similarly clinically effective in improving %SFDs compared with FP plus salmeterol delivered in separate inhalers (mean differences for each dose comparison of -3.9 (low) (with a 95% confidence interval (CI): -12.96; 5.16); 4.10 (medium) (95% CI: -3.01; 11.21); -0.4 (high) (95% CI: -8.88; 8.08)) and BUD/FORM (mean difference of 0.40 (95% CI -3.69; 4.49)) in adults, and a cheaper SFC option is available at all doses (annual cost savings range from 18 pounds sterling-427 pounds sterling per patient). SFC was similarly effective compared with FP plus salmeterol in separate inhalers in children under 12 and also resulted in annual cost savings of between 47 pounds sterling and 77 pounds sterling.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of SFC in chronic asthma compared with multiple comparators and based on a systematic identification of relevant trials and data on %SFDs. The findings suggest that for adults and children uncontrolled on BDP 400 microg/day or equivalent it is a cost-effective option to switch to SFC (at an equivalent ICS dose) compared with increasing the dose of ICS. For adults and children aged 12 years and over who have passed this point and are uncontrolled on BDP 800 microg/day or equivalent, switching to SFC remains a cost-effective approach.

The cost per QALYs estimated in sensitivity analyses using BDP costs range from 5679 pounds sterling to 15,997 pounds sterling. For children the cost per QALY for SFC 50 Evohaler compared with an increased dose of FP is pound 15,739 pounds sterling. SFC is similarly clinically effective in improving %SFDs compared with FP plus salmeterol delivered in separate inhalers (mean differences for each dose comparison of -3.9 (low) (with a 95% confidence interval (CI): -12.96; 5.16); 4.10 (medium) (95% CI: -3.01; 11.21); -0.4 (high) (95% CI: -8.88; 8.08)) and BUD/FORM (mean difference of 0.40 (95% CI -3.69; 4.49)) in adults, and a cheaper SFC option is available at all doses (annual cost savings range from 18 pounds sterling-427 pounds sterling per patient). SFC was similarly effective compared with FP plus salmeterol in separate inhalers in children under 12 and also resulted in annual cost savings of between 47 pounds sterling and 77 pounds sterling. A number of other comparisons were also made and the results are available as electronic supplementary data. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of SFC in chronic asthma compared with multiple comparators and based on a systematic identification of relevant trials and data on %SFDs. The findings suggest that for adults and children uncontrolled on BDP 400 microg/day or equivalent it is a cost-effective option to switch to SFC (at an equivalent ICS dose) compared with increasing the dose of ICS. For adults and children aged 12 years and over who have passed this point and are uncontrolled on BDP 800 microg/day or equivalent, switching to SFC remains a cost-effective approach.

4279,Estimated benefits of transplantation of kidneys from donors at increased risk for HIV or hepatitis C infection,"Kidneys from organ donors who have behaviors that place them at increased risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are often discarded, even if viral screening tests are negative. This study compared policies that would either 'Discard' or 'Transplant' kidneys from Centers for Disease Control classified increased-risk donors (CDC-IRDs) using a decision analytic Markov model of renal failure treatment modalities. Base-case CDC-IRDs were current injection drug users (IDUs) with negative antibody and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV and HCV, comprising 5% of kidney donors. Compared to a CDC-IRD kidney 'Discard' policy, the 'Transplant' policy resulted in higher patient survival, a greater number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (5.6 vs. 5.1 years per patient), more kidney transplants (990 vs. 740 transplants per 1000 patients) and lower cost of care ($60 000 vs. $71 000 per QALY). The total number of viral infections was lower with the 'Transplant' policy (13.1 vs. 14.8 infections per 1000 patients over 20 years), because the 'Discard' policy led to more time on hemodialysis, with a higher HCV incidence.

4280,Cost effectiveness of adult intensive care in the UK,"We wished to investigate whether intensive care represents good value for money to the National Health Service in the UK using cost-effectiveness analysis. We developed a cost-effectiveness model using secondary data sources to estimate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained of treatment in intensive care vs non-intensive care treatment in adults. Estimates of hospital mortality with and without intensive care were obtained from seven published studies and from data published by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre. Quality of life estimates were obtained from a literature review and NHS reference costs were used. Relative to non-intensive care treatment, the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained of treatment in intensive care is 7010 pounds. This figure is sensitive to the mortality risk reduction associated with intensive care. Despite the high daily cost of intensive care, its cost-effectiveness is excellent and compares favourably with other commonly used health interventions. Our findings suggest that adult intensive care represents good value for money.",2007-01-03311,17506731,Anaesthesia,S Ridley,2007,62 / 6,547-54,No,17506731,"S Ridley; S Morris; Cost effectiveness of adult intensive care in the UK, Anaesthesia, 2007-Jun; 62(6):0003-2409; 547-54",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,ICU vs. Non-ICU,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,7010,United Kingdom,2004,17604.8
4281,The implications of using US-specific EQ-5D preference weights for cost-effectiveness evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of country-specific EQ-5D preference weights on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of initial pramipexole versus levodopa strategy in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: A total of 301 subjects with PD were randomized to initial pramipexole or levodopa and followed every 3 months over a 4-year period. Subjects' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured using EQ-5D, and their health preferences were calculated using both the UK and US sets of weights. The effectiveness of pramipexole was defined as the additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained compared to levodopa and was estimated as the area between the treatment-specific HRQOL profiles adjusted for baseline difference. RESULTS: Using the original UK weights, the incremental effectiveness was 0.155 QALYs, which resulted in the incremental CE ratio (ICER) of $42,989/QALY and a probability that pramipexole was cost-effective relative to levodopa of 0.57, 0.77, and 0.82 when a QALY was valued at $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000, respectively.

4282,The implications of using US-specific EQ-5D preference weights for cost-effectiveness evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of country-specific EQ-5D preference weights on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of initial pramipexole versus levodopa strategy in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: A total of 301 subjects with PD were randomized to initial pramipexole or levodopa and followed every 3 months over a 4-year period. Subjects' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured using EQ-5D, and their health preferences were calculated using both the UK and US sets of weights. The effectiveness of pramipexole was defined as the additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained compared to levodopa and was estimated as the area between the treatment-specific HRQOL profiles adjusted for baseline difference. RESULTS: Using the original UK weights, the incremental effectiveness was 0.155 QALYs, which resulted in the incremental CE ratio (ICER) of $42,989/QALY and a probability that pramipexole was cost-effective relative to levodopa of 0.57, 0.77, and 0.82 when a QALY was valued at $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000, respectively. Using the US-specific weights resulted in lower incremental effectiveness (0.062 QALYs), higher ICER ($108,498/QALY), and a lower probability that pramipexole was cost-effective compared to levodopa at any valuation of QALY (0.23 for $50,000, 0.48 for $100,000, and 0.58 for $150,000).

4283,Cost-utility analysis of emergency department thoracotomy for trauma victims,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) performed on both penetrating and blunt trauma victims, using both published survival and outcome data and previously unaccounted for data on the cost of occupational exposure. METHODS: Cost-utility analysis was performed using decision-analytic models constructed for both penetrating and blunt trauma scenarios. Survival and impairment data, the rates and costs of occupational exposure, and the utilities of neurologic impairment and provider seroconversion were all based on published literature. Costs of EDT were estimated using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from the Health Care Utilization Project database. One-way sensitivity analyses on input parameters and probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations were performed. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EDT for penetrating trauma was $16,125 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and less than $50,000 per QALY with a 93.4% probability. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for blunt trauma was $163,136 per QALY, and less than $50,000 per QALY with a 37% probability. Neither model was sensitive to provider exposure. The penetrating model was insensitive to the probability of neurologically intact survival, the utility adjustment, procedure costs, and long-term care. The blunt model was sensitive to the probabilities of survival and of neurologic impairment.

4285,Cost-effectiveness of long-acting bronchodilators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of long-acting bronchodilators by estimating incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: This cost-effective analysis was conducted from a third-party payer's perspective. The study was a retrospective pooled analysis, and the effectiveness evidence was derived from a systematic review of literature published from January 1, 1980, to April 14, 2006. Incremental QALYs were estimated by converting the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores into EuroQoL-5D scores and using these combined scores as the summary benefit measure. RESULTS: The incremental cost per additional QALY was $26,094 (range, $11,780-$77,214) for tiotropium and $41,000 (range, $23,650-$98,750) for salmeterol compared with placebo. The cost per QALY gained was lower with tiotropium compared with salmeterol or ipratropium based on either the pooled data of available trials or a head-to-head trial. Treatment with tiotropium could save $391 per year while gaining 13 quality-adjusted days compared with ipratropium. CONCLUSION: Tiotropium appears to be more cost-effective than the alternatives and may be the preferred agent for maintenance therapy in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

4289,Review of a decision by the Medical Services Advisory Committee based on health technology assessment of an emerging technology: the case for remotely assisted radical prostatectomy,"OBJECTIVES: In April 1998, the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) was established by the Australian federal government. Since that time, all new medical procedures must be evaluated for safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness as a condition of the surgeon receiving public funding by means of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). Over these first 8 years, a significant number of applications for the public funding of new procedures have been given negative recommendations by the MSAC based on insufficient clinical evidence or lack of cost-effectiveness. In August 2006, after almost 2 years of processing, the MSAC made the decision to fund the new procedure, laparoscopic remotely assisted radical prostatectomy (LRARP). However, they stated that there was still uncertainty about the comparative cost-effectiveness. METHODS: An observational study using provisional cost-utility data for LRARP based on a combination of costs taken from consecutive patients at the Epworth Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, and utilities from the prospectively collected data on all patients undergoing surgery for prostate cancer over a 4-year period at the Vattikuti Urology Institute, Michigan, United States. RESULTS: The incremental cost for LRARP compared with the open surgery alternative is A$2,264 or A$24,457 per quality-adjusted life-year, well below the range accepted by the Australian pharmaceutical equivalent of the MSAC (the PBAC) of A$42,000 and A$76,000. This figure does not take into account additional benefits such as reduced time away from employment, reduced blood loss, reduced possibility of infection, and reduced scarring. CONCLUSIONS: This case study of LRARP demonstrates that there is sufficient crude evidence to show that this new procedure is likely to be superior to the existing procedure in terms of safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. The decision to allow MBS funding was correct and will allow for the collection of additional evidence, on both economic and clinical outcomes.",2007-01-03320,17493316,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Sue P O'Malley,2007,23 / 2,286-91,No,17493316,"Sue P O'Malley; Ernest Jordan; Review of a decision by the Medical Services Advisory Committee based on health technology assessment of an emerging technology: the case for remotely assisted radical prostatectomy, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2007; 23(2):0266-4623; 286-91",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic remotely assisted radical prostatectomy (LRARP) vs. Open radical prostatectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,24457.43,Australia,2005,24719.1
4290,Modeling payback from research into the efficacy of left-ventricular assist devices as destination therapy,"OBJECTIVES: Ongoing developments in design have improved the outlook for left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation as a therapy in end-stage heart failure. Nevertheless, early cost-effectiveness assessments, based on first-generation devices, have not been encouraging. Against this background, we set out (i) to examine the survival benefit that LVADs would need to generate before they could be deemed cost-effective; (ii) to provide insight into the likelihood that this benefit will be achieved; and (iii) from the perspective of a healthcare provider, to assess the value of discovering the actual size of this benefit by means of a Bayesian value of information analysis. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness assessments are made from the perspective of the healthcare provider, using current UK norms for the value of a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The treatment model is grounded in published analyses of the Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial of first-generation LVADs, translated into a UK cost setting. The prospects for patient survival with second-generation devices is assessed using Bayesian prior distributions, elicited from a group of leading clinicians in the field. RESULTS: Using established thresholds, cost-effectiveness probabilities under these priors are found to be low (approximately .2 percent) for devices costing as much as 60,000 pounds. Sensitivity of the conclusions to both device cost and QALY valuation is examined. CONCLUSIONS: In the event that the price of the device in use would reduce to 40,000 pounds, the value of the survival information can readily justify investment in further trials.",2007-01-03321,17493314,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Alan J Girling,2007,23 / 2,269-77,No,17493314,"Alan J Girling; Guy Freeman; Jason P Gordon; Philip Poole-Wilson; David A Scott; Richard J Lilford; Modeling payback from research into the efficacy of left-ventricular assist devices as destination therapy, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2007; 23(2):0266-4623; 269-77",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation vs. Optimal medical management (OMM),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2005,Not Stated
4291,Clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy for people with end-stage heart failure: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVES: The clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy for people with end-stage heart failure is assessed through a systematic review and economic evaluation. METHODS: Systematic review was performed of randomized controlled trials, quasiexperimental studies, case series, and case studies identified through searching eighteen electronic databases, bibliographies, and consultation with experts and manufacturers. Studies assessed survival, functional capacity, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness was assessed through a 5-year decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for using left ventricular assist devices compared with usual care. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, showing that left ventricular assist devices appear beneficial, improving survival and quality of life. Adverse events are a serious concern. The economic evaluation showed that left ventricular assist devices had a cost per quality adjusted life year of 170,616 pounds. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to changes in costs or utility. CONCLUSIONS: Although left ventricular assist devices appear clinically effective as destination therapy, it is unlikely they will be cost-effective unless costs decrease or the benefits of their use increase.",2007-01-03322,17493313,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Andrew J Clegg,2007,23 / 2,261-8,No,17493313,"Andrew J Clegg; David A Scott; Emma Loveman; Jill Colquitt; Pam Royle; Jackie Bryant; Clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy for people with end-stage heart failure: a systematic review and economic evaluation, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2007; 23(2):0266-4623; 261-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,1.50,6.00,170616,United Kingdom,2003,392293.47
4292,Cost-utility of a disease management program for patients with asthma,"OBJECTIVES: The long-term cost-utility of a disease management program (DMP) for adults with asthma was assessed compared to usual care. METHODS: A DMP for patients with asthma has been developed and implemented in the region of Maastricht (The Netherlands). By integrating care, the program aims to continuously improve quality of care within existing budgets. A clinical trial was performed over a period of 15 months to collect data on costs and effects of the program and usual care. These data were used to inform a probabilistic decision-analytic model to estimate the 5-year impact of the program beyond follow-up. A societal perspective was adopted, with outcomes assessed in terms of costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: The DMP is associated with a gain in QALYs compared to usual care (2.7+/-.2 versus 3.4+/-.8), at lower costs (3,302+/-314 euro versus 2,973+/-304 euro), thus leading to dominance. The probability that disease management is the more cost-effective strategy is 76 percent at a societal willingness to pay (WTP) for an additional QALY of 0 euro, reaching 95 percent probability at a WTP of 1,000 euro per additional QALY.

4293,Lifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes in men and women with impaired glucose tolerance is cost-effective,"OBJECTIVES: The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) was a randomized intervention program that evaluated the effect of intensive lifestyle modification on the development of diabetes mellitus type 2 in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. As such, a program is demanding in terms of resources; it is necessary to assess whether it would be money well spent. This determination was the purpose of this study. METHODS: We developed a simulation model to assess the economic consequences of an intervention like the one studied in DPS in a Swedish setting. The model used data from the trial itself to assess the effect of intervention on the risk of diabetes and on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Results from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study were used to estimate the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Cost data were derived from Swedish studies. The intervention was assumed to be applied to eligible patients from a population-based screening program of 60-year-olds in the County of Stockholm from which the baseline characteristics of the patients was used. RESULTS: The model predicted that implementing the program would be cost-saving from the healthcare payers' perspective. Furthermore, it was associated with an increase in estimated survival of .18 years. Taking into consideration the increased consumption by patients due to their longer survival, the predicted cost-effectiveness ratio was 2,363 euro per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

4294,Cost effectiveness of trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer: a lifetime model,"BACKGROUND: Recent randomised trials have demonstrated a statistically significant effect of trastuzumab on disease-free survival when used as adjuvant therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2)-positive resectable early stage breast cancer, with a treatment course lasting either 9 or 52 weeks. However, the cost effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab with respect to mortality remains uncertain, especially in an Australian setting. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of trastuzumab in Australia, in a cohort of 50-year-old patients with HER2-positive breast cancer over a lifetime, using (i) disease-free survival and cardiotoxicity data from recent randomised trials; (ii) information on long-term survival of patients with treated primary breast cancer; and (iii) costs of treating local and distant relapses and disease from causes other than breast cancer. METHODS: A Markov model consisting of four health states (remission, loco-regional recurrence, metastatic disease and death) was developed. Transition probabilities corresponded to patterns of relapse and metastases seen in recent trials. The model was run until age 100 years to allow calculation of average survival. Outcome measures were life-years and QALYs (calculated using utility weights reported in the literature).The model was calibrated to reflect literature evidence that the risk of breast cancer recurrence following primary treatment diminishes progressively to zero after about 20 years. It was assumed that the morbidity benefit of trastuzumab observed in trials would be present for 5 years but would then diminish progressively to zero after 8 years. Costs (year 2005 values) and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: For every 1000 patients treated with a 52-week course of trastuzumab, there were 136 fewer breast cancer deaths (relative risk reduction 28%). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were Australian dollars ($ A)13 730 per year of life saved (YOLS) and $ A22 793 per QALY. The net incremental cost was $ A56.3 million ($ A414 012/cancer death avoided). Cost effectiveness declined (ICER = $ A27 734/QALY) in older patients (age 65 years at treatment initiation).The ICER was driven mainly by the drug acquisition costs, the assumption of the duration of benefit and the discount rate. Cost offsets from reduced costs of treating recurrent or metastatic breast cancer during follow-up were present but these factors were of less importance according to sensitivity analyses. The 9-week treatment schedule approached economic dominance (ICER = $ A1700/QALY) because of decreased costs, improved relative risk for prevention of metastases and more cancer deaths avoided (196). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer may be cost effective when given over either 52 or 9 weeks at current acquisition costs in Australia. However, the overall budget impact of the 52-week course is significant, and the 9-week course appears economically attractive.",2007-01-03325,17488140,Pharmacoeconomics,J Alasdair Millar,2007,25 / 5,429-42,Yes,17488140,"J Alasdair Millar; Michael J Millward; Cost effectiveness of trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer: a lifetime model, Pharmacoeconomics, 2007; 25(5):1179-2027; 429-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab, 52 week course vs. Usual care",Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,22793,Australia,2005,23036.86
4295,Cost effectiveness of trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer: a lifetime model,"BACKGROUND: Recent randomised trials have demonstrated a statistically significant effect of trastuzumab on disease-free survival when used as adjuvant therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2)-positive resectable early stage breast cancer, with a treatment course lasting either 9 or 52 weeks. However, the cost effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab with respect to mortality remains uncertain, especially in an Australian setting. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of trastuzumab in Australia, in a cohort of 50-year-old patients with HER2-positive breast cancer over a lifetime, using (i) disease-free survival and cardiotoxicity data from recent randomised trials; (ii) information on long-term survival of patients with treated primary breast cancer; and (iii) costs of treating local and distant relapses and disease from causes other than breast cancer. METHODS: A Markov model consisting of four health states (remission, loco-regional recurrence, metastatic disease and death) was developed. Transition probabilities corresponded to patterns of relapse and metastases seen in recent trials. The model was run until age 100 years to allow calculation of average survival. Outcome measures were life-years and QALYs (calculated using utility weights reported in the literature).The model was calibrated to reflect literature evidence that the risk of breast cancer recurrence following primary treatment diminishes progressively to zero after about 20 years. It was assumed that the morbidity benefit of trastuzumab observed in trials would be present for 5 years but would then diminish progressively to zero after 8 years. Costs (year 2005 values) and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: For every 1000 patients treated with a 52-week course of trastuzumab, there were 136 fewer breast cancer deaths (relative risk reduction 28%). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were Australian dollars ($ A)13 730 per year of life saved (YOLS) and $ A22 793 per QALY.

There are large variations in treating CMVR in clinical practice in Thailand. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of providing (i) IVT, (ii) IV/OR and (iii) IMP ganciclovir to patients with HIV/AIDS and CMVR versus providing no treatment. DESIGN: A simulation study for which the input parameters were derived from a systematic review of the literature, a hospital-based survey and patient interviews. SETTING: The analysis assumed a Thai healthcare system perspective. However, the model was run using both societal and healthcare provider perspectives. RESULTS: Our results suggest that IVT ganciclovir was cost effective and the best option for treating patients with CMVR irrespective of whether patients received antiretroviral treatment (ART). In patients receiving ART, moving from IVT to IV/OR ganciclovir was also likely to be a cost-effective option. Offering IMP ganciclovir was not likely to be cost effective. Providing treatments for patients with bilateral CMVR was more cost effective than providing treatments for those with unilateral CMVR, and offering treatments for patients receiving ART was better value for money than treating patients without ART.
