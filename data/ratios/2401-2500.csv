2401,Optimal follow-up strategies after aorto-iliac prosthetic reconstruction: a decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of ultrasound follow-up after aorto-iliac prosthetic reconstruction is to correct false aneurysms before rupture occurs. We investigated whether follow-up improves the life expectancy of patients and sought to identify the most cost-effective follow-up strategy. DESIGN OF THE STUDY: A Monte Carlo Markov decision model was constructed. The occurrence of false aneurysms was modelled as a time-dependent process for each anastomotic site, based on published series. Using this model, the impact of various follow-up strategies was investigated for three types of prostheses, aorto-distal tube, aorto-bi-iliac, and aorto-bi-femoral prostheses. Main outcome measures were discounted quality adjusted life years (dQALYs), discounted costs, and (discounted) cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios. RESULTS: Follow-up of patients with aorto-distal tube and aorto-bifemoral prostheses did not result in an improvement life expectancy and was not cost-effective, QALYs 7.53 and 7.62 years, respectively. The results for aorto-distal tube and aorto-bifemoral prostheses were not sensitive to any variation in the model parameters. In the base case analysis, the life expectancy of patients with aorto-bi-iliac prostheses was 7.50 QALYs (95% confidence interval 7.46-7.54) whether or not they underwent routine follow-up. However, patients aged 54 years or younger gained 0.11 QALYs with annual follow-up (p<0.05). The most cost-effective strategy was annual follow-up that starts 10 years after the initial operation, and continues up to 30 years after surgery (4600 Euro; CE ratio 21,000 Euro per QALY). When perioperative mortality of elective reconstruction of false aneurysms is 2% or lower (e.g. when endovascular treatment is used), a small improvement is observed (7.56 vs. 7.50 QALYs; p<0.05; CE ratio 35,000 Euro per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Annual follow-up of aorto-bi-iliac prostheses should be restricted to patients aged 54 or younger and not start before 10 years after surgery. The same strategy can only be considered for older patients if mortality for secondary intervention is lower than 2%.

2407,Cost-effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide for the management of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn,"OBJECTIVE: Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator that has become part of the standard management for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). This treatment modality, like many in neonatology, has not been well studied using quantitative economic techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of adding iNO to the treatment protocol of PPHN for term infants from birth to the time of discharge from their initial hospitalization. METHODS: We used decision analysis modeling from a societal perspective to obtain an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Outcome probabilities were taken from the medical literature and a cohort of 123 infants who were treated with PPHN at The Children""s Hospital of Philadelphia between 1991 and 2002. Costs were estimated from daily resources used by these infants in 2001 dollars. Survival and quality-adjusted life years were used as effectiveness measures. One-way, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the base-case estimate. RESULTS: The addition of iNO to the treatment regimen of PPHN increased the cost of treating an infant by an average of 1141 dollars, primarily from an increased number of mechanical ventilation days. Use of iNO led to 3.4% more lives saved and a 6% increase in the average utility gained per infant. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 33,234 dollars per life saved and 19,022 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained. The model was robust to changes in outcome probabilities, cost, and utility variables. Only 3.6% of the trials using probabilistic sensitivity analysis found iNO to be more expensive with a worse outcome than conventional therapy alone, whereas 35.7% of the trials found iNO to be cheaper and more effective than conventional treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: iNO is cost-effective but not cost-saving in treating infants with PPHN from a societal perspective. There are critical time points during an infant""s hospitalization that could improve the efficiency and consequently the cost of care for this patient population.",2004-01-00230,15286225,Pediatrics,Scott A Lorch,2004,114 / 2,417-26,No,15286225,"Scott A Lorch; Avital Cnaan; Kurt Barnhart; Avital Cnaan; Kurt Barnhart; Cost-effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide for the management of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, Pediatrics, 2004-Aug; 114(2):1098-4275; 417-26",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Inhaled nitric oxide vs. Standard care,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,19022,United States,2001,27798.44
2408,Cost-effectiveness of sirolimus-eluting stents for treatment of complex coronary stenoses: results from the Sirolimus-Eluting Balloon Expandable Stent in the Treatment of Patients With De Novo Native Coronary Artery Lesions (SIRIUS) trial,"BACKGROUND: Recently, sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) have been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of angiographic and clinical restenosis compared with bare metal stent (BMS) implantation. However, the overall cost-effectiveness of this strategy is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between February and August 2001, 1058 patients with complex coronary stenoses were enrolled in the SIRIUS trial and randomized to percutaneous coronary revascularization with either a SES or BMS. Clinical outcomes, resource use, and costs were assessed prospectively for all patients over a 1-year follow-up period. Initial hospital costs were increased by 2881 dollars per patient with SESs. Over the 1-year follow-up period, use of SESs led to substantial reductions in the need for repeat revascularization, including repeat percutaneous coronary intervention and bypass surgery. Although follow-up costs were reduced by 2571 dollars per patient with SESs, aggregate 1-year costs remained 309 dollars per patient higher. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for SES was 1650 dollars per repeat revascularization event avoided or 27,540 dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained, values that compare reasonably with other accepted medical interventions. Under updated treatment assumptions regarding available stent lengths and duration of antiplatelet therapy, use of SESs was projected to reduce total 1-year costs compared with BMSs. CONCLUSIONS: Although use of SESs was not cost-saving compared with BMS implantation, for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention of complex coronary stenoses, their use appears to be reasonably cost-effective within the context of the US healthcare system.",2004-01-00233,15262844,Circulation,David J Cohen,2004,110 / 5,508-14,No,15262844,"David J Cohen; Ameet Bakhai; Chunxue Shi; Louise Githiora; Tara Lavelle; Ronna H Berezin; Martin B Leon; Jeffrey W Moses; Joseph P Carrozza; James P Zidar; Richard E Kuntz; Ameet Bakhai; Chunxue Shi; Louise Githiora; Tara Lavelle; Ronna H Berezin; Martin B Leon; Jeffrey W Moses; Joseph P Carrozza; James P Zidar; Richard E Kuntz; Cost-effectiveness of sirolimus-eluting stents for treatment of complex coronary stenoses: results from the Sirolimus-Eluting Balloon Expandable Stent in the Treatment of Patients With De Novo Native Coronary Artery Lesions (SIRIUS) trial, Circulation, 2004-Aug-03; 110(5):0009-7322; 508-14",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Sirolimus coated stent, plus 3 months of clopidogrel vs. Bare metal stent, plus 1 month of clopidogrel",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,27540,United States,2002,39620.09
2409,Is B-type natriuretic peptide-guided heart failure management cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common medical problem and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)-guided heart failure management for outpatients with symptomatic CHF was found to reduce the readmission rate and mortality, but the costs of treatment may provoke concern in the current cost-conscious clinical setting. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model of regular BNP measurement in the outpatient setting. The target population was symptomatic CHF patients aged 35-85 years recently discharged from the hospital. Intervention was BNP measurement once every 3 months (BNP group) or no BNP measurement (clinical group). Clinical and utility data were retrieved from published studies. Costs were based on published data in the US. Cost-effectiveness was measured by $ per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The baseline analysis during the 9-month period after hospitalization showed the QALY to be longer for the BNP group (0.57 for the BNP group and 0.55 for the clinical group) and the costs were also lower for the BNP group ($9577 and 10,131). The dominance of the BNP group continued during the 1-year follow-up. The incremental costs would be $3491-7787 per QALY. In sensitivity analyses, two parameters with strong effects on the cost-effectiveness were the probability of the first readmission for CHF in the clinical group and the costs for inpatient CHF care. When these two parameters were simultaneously put on the simulation model, the incremental costs of the BNP group may exceed $50,000.

2410,"Cost effectiveness of memantine in Alzheimer""s disease: an analysis based on a probabilistic Markov model from a UK perspective","BACKGROUND: Clinical trials with memantine, an uncompetitive moderate-affinity NMDA antagonist, have shown improved clinical outcomes, increased independence and a trend towards delayed institutionalisation in patients with moderately severe-to-severe Alzheimer""s disease. In a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-week study conducted in the US, reductions in resource utilisation and total healthcare costs were noted with memantine relative to placebo. While these findings suggest that, compared with placebo, memantine provides cost savings, further analyses may help to quantify potential economic gains over a longer treatment period. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of memantine therapy compared with no pharmacological treatment in patients with moderately severe-to-severe Alzheimer""s disease over a 2-year period. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate patient progression through a series of health states related to severity, dependency (determined by patient scores on the Alzheimer""s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living [ADCS-ADL] inventory and residential status (""institutionalisation"") with a time horizon of 2 years (each 6-month Markov cycle was repeated four times). Transition probabilities from one health state to another 6 months later were mainly derived from a 28-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Inputs related to epidemiological and cost data were derived from a UK longitudinal epidemiological study, while data on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived from a Danish longitudinal study. To ensure conservative estimates from the model, the base case analysis assumed drug effectiveness was limited to 12 months. Monte Carlo simulations were performed for each state parameter following definition of a priori distributions for the main variables of the model. Sensitivity analyses included worst case scenario in which memantine was effective for 6 months and one-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters. Finally, a subgroup analysis was performed to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from memantine. Informal care was not included in this model as the costs were considered from National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective.RESULTS: The base case analysis found that, compared with no treatment, memantine was associated with lower costs and greater clinical effectiveness in terms of years of independence, years in the community and QALYs. Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. For each category of Alzheimer""s disease patient examined, treatment with memantine was a cost-effective strategy.

2411,Cost utility of photodynamic therapy for predominantly classic neovascular age related macular degeneration,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision impairment and blindness in older people throughout the developed world and currently affects around 420 000 UK citizens. Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is treatable with photodynamic therapy (PDT) but is expensive at over pound 1200 per treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the cost utility of PDT for better eye, predominantly classic, subfoveal choroidal neovascular lesions secondary to AMD. METHODS: Cost utility analysis (CUA) was conducted to estimate the cost effectiveness of PDT for scenarios involving reasonable (6/12) and poor (6/60) visual acuity. The models incorporated data from the Treatment of Age-related Macular Degeneration with PDT (TAP) Study and patient based utilities. The incremental CUA was based on decision analytical models, comparing treatment to a placebo comparator. Extensive one way sensitivity analysis of parameters was conducted to determine the robustness of the model. A discount rate of 6% was used for costs and quality adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: Model 1: in people with reasonable initial visual acuity, the cost utility of treating applicable neovascular AMD lesions was pound 31 607 per QALY saved, with a sensitivity analysis range from pound 25 285 to pound 37 928. Model 2: in people with poor initial visual acuity, the cost utility was pound 63 214 per QALY saved, with a sensitivity analysis range from pound 54 183 to pound 75 856.

2413,Economic evaluation of etoricoxib versus non-selective NSAIDs in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential economic implications of using etoricoxib versus non-selective NSAID alternatives in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the UK. STUDY DESIGN: Decision-analytical modelling was used to calculate the expected costs and consequences of the use of etoricoxib compared with non-selective NSAIDs alone, NSAIDs plus proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), NSAIDs plus histamine H2 receptor antagonists and NSAIDs plus misoprostol over a continuous treatment period of 1 year. METHODS: The model considered direct medical costs from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and used data from phase IIb and III clinical trials of etoricoxib to determine probabilities of gastrointestinal (GI) events. Model outcomes were defined as resource-consuming GI-related events, including clinically evident gastroduodenal perforations, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers, or upper GI bleeding (collectively, PUBs [""perforation, ulcers and/or bleeding""]). Resource utilisation and costs (2002 values) for the treatment of OA and RA as well as GI events were based on published literature and information available from UK-specific sources. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The model suggests that etoricoxib is cost saving compared with non-selective NSAIDs plus PPIs or non-selective NSAIDs plus misoprostol. The model also suggests that etoricoxib is cost effective in terms of the incremental cost per QALY gained for non-selective NSAIDs alone (pound 19,766) and for non-selective NSAIDs plus H2 antagonists (pound 9350). The incremental cost of etoricoxib per PUB avoided was pound 12,446 versus non-selective NSAIDs alone and pound 6438 versus NSAIDs co-prescribed with H2 antagonists. For patients without the presence of specific GI risk factors (history of GI event, corticosteroid use or disability), etoricoxib may be cost effective for patients over age 56 years, assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound 30,000 per QALY gained. Etoricoxib may also be cost effective in patients of all ages who had at least one specific GI risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests, with its underlying assumptions and data, that etoricoxib is a cost-effective alternative to therapeutic regimens involving non-selective NSAIDs for OA or RA, from the UK NHS perspective. Etoricoxib may be cost saving and dominant over non-selective NSAIDs used together with a PPI or misoprostol. When compared with non-selective NSAIDs alone or non-selective NSAIDs co-prescribed with H2 antagonists, the incremental cost per QALY gained with use of etoricoxib was within the generally accepted threshold for cost effectiveness (less than pound 30,000 per QALY gained).",2004-01-00244,15244490,Pharmacoeconomics,Andrew Moore,2004,22 / 17,643-60,Yes,15244490,"Andrew Moore; Ceri Phillips; Elke Hunsche; James Pellissier; Simone Crespi; Ceri Phillips; Elke Hunsche; James Pellissier; Simone Crespi; Economic evaluation of etoricoxib versus non-selective NSAIDs in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2004; 22(17):1179-2027; 643-60",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Etoricoxib vs. Non-selective NSAIDs,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,1.50,19766,United Kingdom,2002,42726.03
2414,From randomised clinical trials to clinical practice : a pragmatic cost-effectiveness analysis of Paclitaxel in first-line therapy for advanced ovarian cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Paclitaxel plus cisplatin is considered to be the standard first-line therapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Previous to this study, economic data on this combination resulted from randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the clinical and economic outcomes associated with paclitaxel-cisplatin (PC) and cyclophosphamide-cisplatin (CC) regimens using a pragmatic perspective based on daily clinical practice in a French university hospital. METHOD: A retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis, from the hospital-payer perspective, was carried out as a before-after case study in fifty-nine consecutive women with verified International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage II, III or IV ovarian cancer treated between 1995 and 2000. Median overall survival (OS) was used as the primary endpoint. The quality-adjusted time was assessed by the quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) method. Direct medical costs were collected for each patient. Monetary values for French prices in the year 2000 were used and converted to US dollars using an exchange rate of USD 1 = 7 French francs. Several univariate sensitivity analyses were carried out varying unit costs, medical practices and administration of paclitaxel. RESULTS: The incremental cost of the PC regimen was USD 10,716 per patient. OS and quality-adjusted time were improved by 10.8 and 9.3 months with the PC regimen. The cost per life-year gained and per added QALY were USD 11,907 and USD 13,827, respectively. The robustness of the results was confirmed in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that PC may be a cost-effective regimen for advanced ovarian cancer in a French university hospital setting. We reported higher incremental costs and lower clinical benefits than RCT-based findings, suggesting that RCT-based findings were clearly balanced by our pragmatic approach based on clinical practices.

2415,A cost-utility analysis of secondary prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND: Secondary prophylaxis for esophageal variceal hemorrhage (VH) is recommended, but there has never been a cost-utility analysis of its implementation. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the cost utility of various strategies for the secondary prophylaxis of VH including (a) observation alone, (b) medical therapy (MED), (c) endoscopic band ligation (EBL), (d) endoscopic band ligation plus medical therapy (EBL + M), and (e) transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and to examine the effect of adherence on these strategies. METHODS: A Markov model was developed for all five strategies, and included surveillance, risk of hepatic encephalopathy, complications, and nonadherence. Data sources: Published literature and the Health Care Financing Administration. Target population: People with cirrhosis and a history of controlled VH. Time horizon: Three years. Perspective: Third-party payer. Outcome measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Combination EBL + M was the optimal strategy, dominating all other strategies including observation, meaning that it was more effective and less expensive than the others. In addition, EBL alone dominated observation and TIPS in terms of QALYs, and MED alone dominated the strategy of observation in terms of QALYs. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS : Important variables affecting the optimal strategy were the odds ratio (OR) of VH with EBL compared to MED, the OR of VH with EBL + M compared to EBL, and patients"" preferences regarding taking the medication as reflected in the associated toll exacted on the health state utility.

2419,Cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety and depression in primary care: randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective for treating anxiety and depression in primary care, but there is a shortage of therapists. Computer-delivered treatment may be a viable alternative. AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of computer-delivered CBT. METHOD: A sample of people with depression or anxiety were randomised to usual care (n=128) or computer-delivered CBT (n=146). Costs were available for 123 and 138 participants, respectively. Costs and depression scores were combined using the net benefit approach. RESULTS: Service costs were 40 British pounds (90% CI - 28 British pounds to 148 British pounds) higher over 8 months for computer-delivered CBT. Lost-employment costs were 407 British pounds (90% CI 196 British pounds to 586 British pounds) less for this group. Valuing a 1-unit improvement on the Beck Depression Inventory at 40 British pounds, there is an 81% chance that computer-delivered CBT is cost-effective, and it revealed a highly competitive cost per quality-adjusted life year.

2420,The burden of ankylosing spondylitis and the cost-effectiveness of treatment with infliximab (Remicade),"OBJECTIVES: In the past, treatment options for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been limited, and the introduction of new treatments such as infliximab will have a noticeable impact on health-care budgets. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the current burden of the disease and estimate the cost-effectiveness of infliximab treatments. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective observational study of resource consumption and utility related to disease severity was performed in patients who had participated in a population survey between 1992 and 1994 at the University of Bath and patients regularly followed at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath for up to 9 years. Mean costs and utility were estimated using a regression model including age, gender, disease duration, disease activity and functional status, and disease development was expressed as annual progression of functional disability. Cost-effectiveness of infliximab was modelled using a 3-month placebo-controlled clinical trial with open 1-yr extension in 70 patients, over a total time frame of 2 yr. In the model, costs and utility controlled for disease severity and age from the observational study were assigned to individual patients. The effect of long-term treatment was evaluated in a hypothetical model over 30 yr. RESULTS: Fifty-seven per cent of patients answered the questionnaires. The mean age was 57 (s.d. 11.2) yr, 74% were male and mean disease duration was 30.2 (11.7) yr. Mean total costs were estimated at pound 6765 (s.d. pound 166). Indirect costs represented 57.9% and non-medical costs such as investments and informal care accounted for 16.5% of total costs. Mean utility was 0.67 (0.21). In the main model, mean costs for untreated patients are estimated at pound 25,128. For the infliximab group, mean costs (excluding treatment) are estimated at pound 17,240, a reduction of 31%. Thus, part of the treatment cost was offset by savings in other resources ( pound 7888), leaving an incremental cost of pound 6214. Treatment increased the number of quality-adjusted live years (QALYs) by 0.175 QALYs, leading to a cost per QALY gained of pound 35,400 for the first year of treatment. When treatment is assumed to continue for the full 2 yr, the cost per QALY is pound 32,800. When infliximab infusions are given every 8 weeks instead of every 6 weeks, the cost per QALY is reduced to pound 17,300. In the long-term model, the cost per QALY is estimated at pound 9600. CONCLUSIONS: Non-medical costs and production losses dominate costs in AS, and economic evaluation must therefore adopt a societal perspective. The cost of treatment with infliximab is partly offset by reductions in the cost of the disease and patients"" quality of life is increased, leading to a cost per QALY gained in the vicinity of pound 30,000 to pound 40,000 in the short term, but potentially below pound 10,000 in the long term.",2004-01-00252,15226514,Rheumatology (Oxford),Gisela Kobelt,2004,43 / 9,1158-66,No,15226514,"Gisela Kobelt; P Andlin-Sobocki; S Brophy; L Jönsson; A Calin; J Braun; G Kobelt; P Andlin-Sobocki; S Brophy; L Jönsson; A Calin; J Braun; The burden of ankylosing spondylitis and the cost-effectiveness of treatment with infliximab (Remicade), Rheumatology (Oxford), 2004-Sep; 43(9):1462-0324; 1158-66",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Infliximab vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,6.00,1.50,35400,United Kingdom,2002,76520.36
2421,The cost-effectiveness of aspirin versus cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors for colorectal carcinoma chemoprevention in healthy individuals,"BACKGROUND: Aspirin therapy is accepted widely for secondary prevention in patients with documented cardiovascular disease, but there is a growing trend among healthy individuals to use aspirin as primary chemoprevention for both cardiovascular and oncologic diseases. Accruing evidence suggests that cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) may be effective for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) chemoprevention but would not provide the primary cardiac benefit of aspirin. METHODS: A computer-based Markov model simulated hypothetical cohorts of healthy men age 50 years who took either 325 mg of enteric-coated aspirin daily or celecoxib at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. Patients in both cohorts could develop drug-related complications that would lead to its discontinuation. The aspirin group also was modeled to have a decreased rate of coronary ischemic events; however, decreased CRC mortality was not modeled in either group based on the assumption that the two treatments were effective equally in this regard. Data sources included published literature and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Endpoints used to compare the two strategies included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), mortality and complication rates, and cost. The analysis was from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 10 years from age 50 years. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Aspirin therapy resulted in 0.03 more QALYs and cost $23,000 less than coxib therapy over a 10-year period. Compared with the aspirin group, the coxib group had 3.877% more complications and 0.17% more deaths. Alternatively stated, coxib therapy resulted in 1 patient complication or death for every 26 or 588 patients treated with coxibs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming equal efficacy in CRC prevention over a 10-year period, aspirin was both more effective and less costly than coxib therapy when used for primary chemoprevention of CRC.",2004-01-00256,15222006,Cancer,Chin Hur,2004,101 / 1,189-97,No,15222006,"Chin Hur; Lee S Simon; G Scott Gazelle; Lee S Simon; G Scott Gazelle; The cost-effectiveness of aspirin versus cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors for colorectal carcinoma chemoprevention in healthy individuals, Cancer, 2004-Jul-01; 101(1):0008-543X; 189-97",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Asprin for colorectal carcinoma chemoprevention vs. Celecoxib,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-774066.69,United States,2000,-1163397.06
2422,An economic evaluation of fluvastatin used for the prevention of cardiac events following successful first percutaneous coronary intervention in the UK,"AIMS: To estimate the costs, benefits and cost effectiveness, from the UK NHS perspective, of fluvastatin (relative to no HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor [statin]) for the secondary prevention of major adverse cardiac events following a successful first percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using efficacy data from the Lescol Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS). LIPS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial undertaken in 77 centres (predominantly in Europe). Patients included in the trial had moderate hypercholesterolaemia and had successfully undergone their first PCI. Fluvastatin (Lescol) 40 mg twice daily plus dietary counselling was given to the intervention group for up to 4 years; the control group received dietary counselling only. A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs per QALY gained over a 10-year period, with cost data drawn from the UK NHS (2002 values). Monte Carlo simulations and multivariate analysis were used to assess uncertainty. Costs were discounted at 6% per annum, and health outcomes at 1.5% per annum. RESULTS: On average, treatment with fluvastatin cost an additional pound 300 (SD pound 303) [euro 423; SD euro 428] per patient and resulted in an additional 0.092 (SD 0.06) QALYs per patient over 10 years compared with controls. The incremental cost per QALY gained with fluvastatin versus the control group was pound 3207 (SD pound 5,497) [euro 4,527; SD euro 7,759]. Fluvastatin was dominant (better outcomes and lower costs) in 15.9% of the simulations and was dominated in 2.9%. The key determinants of cost effectiveness were: the effectiveness of fluvastatin in reducing acute myocardial infarction, subsequent PCI, coronary artery bypass graft and cardiac deaths; the utility weight associated with a subsequent post-PCI state; the cost of fluvastatin; and the time horizon evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Fluvastatin is the only statin which has proven effective in preventing major coronary adverse events in new PCI patients; other statins lack this evidence. This Markov model, with its underlying assumptions and data, suggests that fluvastatin is a viable and economically efficient pharmaceutical (relative to no statin) to reduce heart disease in the UK when given routinely to all patients following PCI.",2004-01-00258,15217308,Pharmacoeconomics,Paul A Scuffham,2004,22 / 17,525-35,Yes,15217308,"Paul A Scuffham; Stephen Chaplin; Stephen Chaplin; An economic evaluation of fluvastatin used for the prevention of cardiac events following successful first percutaneous coronary intervention in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2004; 22(17):1179-2027; 525-35",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fluvastatin plus dietary counselling vs. Dietary Counselling,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,6.00,1.50,3207,United Kingdom,2002,6932.23
2423,Cost-effectiveness of using electron beam computed tomography to identify patients at risk for clinical coronary artery disease,"BACKGROUND: The use of electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) to screen for coronary artery calcification (CAC) has been widely promulgated, although the cost effectiveness of this practice is unknown. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree to determine the marginal cost per additional patient who was ""at risk"" (>10% 10-year risk of coronary heart disease) identified with the addition of EBCT to the Framingham Risk Index (FRI) in a screening population with no cardiac symptoms. We also determined the marginal cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved, assuming a 30% improvement in life expectancy associated with primary prevention. A consecutive screening cohort of 39- to 45-year-old men and women was used for demographic and risk factor data. Estimates of the relevant input costs were made on the basis of published literature when available. RESULTS: Compared with using FRI alone, the strategy of incorporating EBCT detects patients who are ""at risk"" at a cost of 9789 dollars/additional case and a marginal cost of 86,752 dollars/QALY. The marginal cost per QALY is highly sensitive to the gain in life expectancy from early intervention (10,000-1,700,000 dollars/QALY for a relative risk reduction in mortality of 50% or 25%, respectively), the utility of being ""at risk"" (18,000 dollars/QALY to dominated for a utility of 1.0-<0.98, similar to other asymptomatic chronic illnesses), and the added prognostic value of EBCT (60,000 dollars/QALY to dominated in a wide range). CONCLUSION: The use of EBCT to improve cardiovascular risk prediction in a population with no cardiac symptoms who are at low absolute risk is expensive, even using favorable assumptions. If the utility of being ""at risk"" is comparable with other asymptomatic disease states, EBCT may in aggregate have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of screening populations.",2004-01-00260,15215799,Am Heart J,Patrick G O'Malley,2004,148 / 1,106-13,No,15215799,"Patrick G O'Malley; Bruce A Greenberg; Andrew J Taylor; Bruce A Greenberg; Allen J Taylor; Cost-effectiveness of using electron beam computed tomography to identify patients at risk for clinical coronary artery disease, Am Heart J, 2004-Jul; 148(1):1097-6744; 106-13",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Electron beam computed tomography with Framingham Risk Index (FRI) for detecting atherosclerosis vs. FRI only,Not Stated,45 Years,39 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,86752,United States,2002,124804.74
2424,Cost-effectiveness of fracture prevention treatments in the elderly,"OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of fracture prevention treatments (vitamin D and calcium and hip protectors) in male and female populations older than seventy years of age in the United-Kingdom was investigated. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to follow up, over lifetime, a hypothetical cohort of males and females at high-risk and general risk of fracture. Patients could sustain hip, wrist, vertebral, and/or other fractures. Fracture rates were obtained from population surveys in the United Kingdom. Effectiveness and quality of life data were identified from the clinical literature. Costs were those incurred by the UK National Health Service, and were obtained from several published sources. Uncertainty was explored through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the general-risk female (male) population, the incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) was dollar 11,722 (dollar 47,426) for hip protectors. In the male high-risk population, the incremental cost per QALY was dollar 17,017 for hip protectors. In the female high-risk population, hip protectors were cost-saving.

2435,Cost-effectiveness of fracture prevention treatments in the elderly,"OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of fracture prevention treatments (vitamin D and calcium and hip protectors) in male and female populations older than seventy years of age in the United-Kingdom was investigated. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to follow up, over lifetime, a hypothetical cohort of males and females at high-risk and general risk of fracture. Patients could sustain hip, wrist, vertebral, and/or other fractures. Fracture rates were obtained from population surveys in the United Kingdom. Effectiveness and quality of life data were identified from the clinical literature. Costs were those incurred by the UK National Health Service, and were obtained from several published sources. Uncertainty was explored through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the general-risk female (male) population, the incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) was dollar 11,722 (dollar 47,426) for hip protectors. In the male high-risk population, the incremental cost per QALY was dollar 17,017 for hip protectors. In the female high-risk population, hip protectors were cost-saving. Vitamin D and calcium alone was dominated by hip protectors in all four subgroups.

2436,Should clozapine continue to be restricted to third-line status for schizophrenia?: a decision-analytic model,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine is currently restricted to patients who have failed at least two trials of other antipsychotic medications because of concerns that its use as a first-line agent would lead to greater mortality, mainly through agranulocytosis. AIMS OF THE STUDY: We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of allowing clozapine to be a first-line treatment versus the current policy of restricting clozapine to third-line status. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using published data from randomized controlled trials and epidemiologic studies. The target population was patients with schizophrenia in an acute psychotic episode, with a lifetime time horizon and societal perspective. Outcome measures included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Using clozapine as a first agent would lead to modest gains in life-expectancy as well as quality-adjusted life expectancy, relative to restricting its use to patients who failed 2 conventional antipsychotics. The cost-effectiveness ratio of using clozapine first vs. using clozapine third would be $24,100 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, these findings were robust to a variety of assumptions. DISCUSSION: Allowing clozapine to be a first-line agent may lead to small gains in life expectancy at moderate but acceptable costs.

2439,Cost-effectiveness of interventions for depressed Latinos,"CONTEXT: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, but treatment rates are low, particularly for minority patients. OBJECTIVE: To estimated societal cost-effectiveness of two interventions to improve care for depression in primary care, examining Latino and white patients separately. METHODS: Intent-to-treat analysis of data from a group-level controlled trial, in which matched primary care clinics in the US were randomized to usual care or to one of two interventions designed to increase the rate of effective depression treatment. One intervention facilitated medication management (""QI-Meds"") and the other psychotherapy (""QI-Therapy""); but patients and clinicians could choose the type of treatment, or none. The study involved 46 clinics in 6 non-academic, managed care organizations; 181 primary care providers; and 398 Latino and 778 White patients with current depression. Outcomes are health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), depression burden, employment, and costs per QALY, over 24 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Relative to usual care, QI-Therapy resulted in significantly fewer depression burden days for Latinos and increased days employed for white patients. Average health care costs increased 278 dollars in QI-Meds and 161 dollars in QI-Therapy for Latinos, and by 655 dollars in QI-Meds and 752 dollars in QI-Therapy for whites, relative to usual care. The estimated cost per QALY for Latinos was 6,100 dollars or less under QI-Therapy, but 90,000 dollars or more in QI-Meds.

2443,One year comparison of costs of coronary surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention in the stent or surgery trial,"OBJECTIVES: To compare initial and one year costs of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the stent or surgery trial. DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded, randomised trial. SETTING: Multicentre study. PATIENTS: 988 patients with multivessel disease. INTERVENTIONS: CABG and stent assisted PCI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Initial hospitalisation and one year follow up costs. RESULTS: At one year mortality was 2.5% in the PCI arm and 0.8% in the CABG arm (p = 0.05). There was no difference in the composite of death or Q wave myocardial infarction (6.9% for PCI v 8.1% for CABG, p = 0.49). There were more repeat revascularisations with PCI (17.2% v 4.2% for CABG). There was no significant difference in utility between arms at six months or at one year. Quality adjusted life years were similar 0.6938 for PCI v 0.6954 for PCI, Delta = 0.00154, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.0242 to 0.0273). Initial length of stay was longer with CABG (12.2 v 5.4 days with PCI, p < 0.0001) and initial hospitalisation costs were higher (7321 pounds sterling v 3884 pounds sterling for PCI, Delta = 3437 pounds sterling, 95% CI 3040 pounds sterling to 3848 pounds sterling). At one year the cost difference narrowed but costs remained higher for CABG (8905 pounds sterling v 6296 pounds sterling for PCI, Delta = 2609 pounds sterling, 95% CI 1769 pounds sterling to 3314 pounds sterling). CONCLUSIONS: Over one year, CABG was more expensive and offered greater survival than PCI but little added benefit in terms of quality adjusted life years. The additional cost of CABG can be justified only if it offers continuing benefit at no further increase in cost relative to PCI over several years.",2004-01-00267,15201249,Heart,William S Weintraub,2004,90 / 7,782-8,No,15201249,"William S Weintraub; Elizabeth M Mahoney; Zefeng Zhang; H Chu; J Hutton; Martin Buxton; J Booth; F Nugara; R H Stables; P Dooley; J Collinson; M Stuteville; N Delahunty; A Wright; M D Flather; E De Cock; W S Weintraub; E M Mahoney; Z Zhang; H Chu; J Hutton; M Buxton; J Booth; F Nugara; R H Stables; P Dooley; J Collinson; M Stuteville; N Delahunty; A Wright; M D Flather; E De Cock; W S Weintraub; E M Mahoney; Z Zhang; H Chu; J Hutton; M Buxton; J Booth; F Nugara; R H Stables; P Dooley; J Collinson; M Stuteville; N Delahunty; A Wright; M D Flather; E De Cock; One year comparison of costs of coronary surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention in the stent or surgery trial, Heart, 2004-Jul; 90(7):1468-201X; 782-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Coronary artery bypass grafting vs. Percutaneous coronary intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,1694155.88,United Kingdom,2000,3859037.67

Alfa-1 antitrypsin deficiency and bronchiectasis had the highest survival gain. Secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis had the lowest survival gain and the lowest gain of quality-adjusted life-years.

2451,Cost effectiveness of alendronate for the treatment of male osteoporosis in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: One third of all the hip fractures occur in men. The risk for mortality following hip fracture is higher for men compared to women. The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) showed that the bisphosphonate alendronate reduces the risk of fractures and increases bone mineral density (BMD) in osteoporotic women. Similar effects of alendronate were observed in men in some other trials. There are also results demonstrating alendronate to be cost-effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in women. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of alendronate for male osteoporosis in Sweden by assuming the same relative risk reduction of fractures in men as for women, based on the FIT trial. DESIGN: A Markov model earlier used to analyze cost effectiveness of alendronate in treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Sweden was adapted to fit a cohort of Swedish men. Cost effectiveness of alendronate vs. no treatment was assessed by transitioning men in the model over time between different health states. TIME HORIZON: The patients were followed from start of intervention until 100 years of age or death. In the base-case alendronate was assumed to have a fracture-risk-reducing effect for 10 years; a treatment duration period of 5 years followed by a 5-year period where the effect declined linearly to zero. RESULTS: Taking a societal perspective treating a 71-year-old man (mean age in the FIT) with low BMD and prior vertebral fracture (VFA) with alendronate was found to be associated with a cost of 14,843 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

2459,Re-examination of the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus medical therapy in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease: the value of long-term data collection,"OBJECTIVES: For patients with reflux esophagitis, long-term therapeutic options include proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and/or antireflux surgery. An earlier cost-effectiveness analysis concluded that at 5 yr, medical therapy was less expensive but similarly effective to fundoplication, but the results were sensitive to estimates on quality of life and long-term medication usage, which were derived from ""expert opinion."" Recently, data from randomized controlled trials addressing these variables have become available. We have incorporated these new data into a revised Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus medical therapy in patients with severe reflux esophagitis. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed using specialized software (DATA PRO 4.0, Williamstown, MA). Total expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years were calculated for long-term medical therapy and for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Probabilities were obtained from the medical literature using Medline. Procedural and hospitalization costs used were the average Medicare reimbursements at our institution. Medication costs were the average wholesale price. The analysis was extended over a 10-yr time horizon at a discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: The discounted analysis shows that medical therapy is associated with total costs of 8,798 dollars and 4.59 quality-adjusted life-years, whereas the surgical strategy is more expensive (10,475 dollars) and less effective (4.55 quality-adjusted life-years). The results were robust to most one-way sensitivity analyses.

2460,Cost-effectiveness of testing for hypercoagulability and effects on treatment strategies in patients with deep vein thrombosis,"PURPOSE: Among patients with deep vein thrombosis, hypercoagulable conditions impart a substantial risk of recurrent thrombosis. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of testing for these disorders, as well as which tests should be selected and how results should be used. METHODS: Using a Markov state-transition model, strategies of testing or not testing for a hypercoagulable state followed by anticoagulation for 6 to 36 months were compared in a hypothetical cohort of patients with apparently idiopathic deep vein thrombosis who were followed for life. Strategies were compared based on lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and marginal cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In the base case, testing followed by 24 months of anticoagulation in patients with a hypercoagulable condition was more cost-effective ($54,820; 23.76 QALYs) than usual care, which comprised 6 months of anticoagulation without testing ($55,260; 23.72 QALYs). All hypercoagulable conditions tested were common enough and associated with a sufficient risk of recurrence to justify inclusion in a test panel. Twenty-four months of initial anticoagulation was preferred (<$50,000/QALY) for most conditions, whereas lifetime anticoagulation was preferred for patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ($2928/QALY) or homozygous factor V Leiden mutation ($3804/QALY). Models using newer evidence on recurrence suggested 18 to 36 months of anticoagulation without testing as the preferred approach. CONCLUSION: Testing for hypercoagulable disorders in patients with idiopathic deep vein thrombosis followed by 2 years of anticoagulation in affected patients is cost-effective. A simpler approach of treating all patients with prolonged anticoagulation without testing is justified if data confirm the persistent risk of recurrent thrombosis.",2004-01-00277,15178497,Am J Med,Andrew D Auerbach,2004,116 / 12,816-28,No,15178497,"Andrew D Auerbach; Gillian D Sanders; Julie Hambleton; Gillian D Sanders; Julie Hambleton; Cost-effectiveness of testing for hypercoagulability and effects on treatment strategies in patients with deep vein thrombosis, Am J Med, 2004-Jun-15; 116(12):0002-9343; 816-28",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,No testing for hypercoaguability and treatment (24 months) vs. Testing for hypercoaguability and treatment (24 months),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11100,United States,2000,16682.94

METHODS: We constructed Markov models assuming a societal perspective, and based analyses on the lifetime treatment of a 63-year-old patient facing event probabilities derived from the Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) trial as the base case. Outcome measures included costs, life expectancy in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and events averted. RESULTS: In patients with peripheral arterial disease, clopidogrel increased life expectancy by 0.55 QALYs at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,100 per QALY, as compared with aspirin. In poststroke patients, clopidogrel increased life expectancy by 0.17 QALYs at a cost of $31,200 per QALY. Aspirin was both less expensive and more effective than clopidogrel in post-myocardial infarction patients. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, our evaluation for patients with peripheral vascular disease was robust. Evaluations of stroke and myocardial infarction patients were sensitive predominantly to the cost and efficacy of clopidogrel, with aspirin therapy more effective and less expensive in 153 of 1000 simulations (15.3%) in poststroke patients and clopidogrel more effective in 119 of 1000 simulations (11.9%) in the myocardial infarction sample. CONCLUSION: Clopidogrel provides a substantial increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy at a cost that is within traditional societal limits for patients with either peripheral arterial disease or a recent stroke.

2468,A cost-effectiveness evaluation of two continuous-combined hormone therapies for the management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms,"OBJECTIVES: After the release of the results of the Women""s Health Initiative, an emerging consensus suggests that continuous-combined hormone therapy (CCHT) should be limited to short-term management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms. This, in turn, raises the important question of the economic value, if any, of short-term CCHT for this indication. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing a 1-year treatment course with 1 mg of norethindrone acetate/5 microg of ethinyl estradiol (1/5 NA/EE) or 0.625 mg/day of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone (0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA) compared with no therapy for the management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms. DESIGN: A literature-based Markov model was developed to compare these three options"" cost and quality-of-life (QOL) benefits. The impact of therapy on vasomotor symptoms and breakthrough bleeding/spotting on the direct costs of care and QOL were considered. RESULTS: Compared with no therapy, CCHTs resulted in net increases in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (0.110 for 1/5 NA/NE v 0.104 for 0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA). Net costs (v no therapy) were $167 lower for 1/5 NA/NE compared with 0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA. Cost per QALY gained (compared with no therapy) were $6,200 and $8,200, respectively. Cost-effectiveness was most favorable for individuals with more severe symptoms who were less bothered by breakthrough bleeding/spotting.

2471,A computer simulation model of the natural history and economic impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem with high societal costs. The Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD) has identified a need for health economics data for COPD. For chronic diseases, such as COPD, where the natural history of disease is lifetime, a modeling approach for economic evaluation may be more realistic than prospective, piggy-backed clinical trials or specific COPD cohort studies. Simulation models can be used to extrapolate clinical data beyond the limited time frame of clinical trials, to analyze subgroups of patients or to explore uncertainty regarding the results by using sensitivity analysis techniques. Our purpose has been to develop a flexible computer simulation model for COPD that will represent disease progression and GOLD recommendations, useful for economic evaluations of new medicines to meet the needs of various payer requirements for reimbursement and resource allocation. METHODS: This article describes a two-dimensional Markov model, which uses data from multiple sources about disease progression, exacerbation frequency and duration, mortality, costs, burden of illness, and the relationships between those variables. The model is evaluated using stochastic uncertainty analysis, it allows comparison of treatments affecting different disease mechanisms, and it uses primary data validated against published sources. RESULTS: We have evaluated two hypothetical interventions treating different features of the disease (lung function decline and acute exacerbations). These analyses show that reducing lung function decline must be a long-term strategy compared to reducing the number of exacerbations. It was necessary to have a long term like 30 years, with 10,000 patients and 20% increase in price, or 20 years with equal prices to show cost-effectiveness with statistical significance for a treatment that reduces lung function decline. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the value of modeling as a tool for evaluating different scenarios and for combining several sources of data, to provide estimates that would otherwise be unavailable. Clinical trials of this size and duration would be unrealistic.",2004-01-00288,15164805,Value Health,Sixten Borg,2004,7 / 2,153-67,Yes,15164805,"Sixten Borg; Asa Ericsson; Jadwiga Wedzicha; Amund Gulsvik; Bo Lundbäck; Gavin C Donaldson; Sean D Sullivan; Asa Ericsson; Jadwiga Wedzicha; Amund Gulsvik; Bo Lundbäck; Gavin C Donaldson; Sean D Sullivan; A computer simulation model of the natural history and economic impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Value Health, 2004 Mar-Apr; 7(2):1098-3015; 153-67",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hypothetical treatment A - halving FEV1 decline vs. Hypothetical treatment B - 25% reduction of exercabation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-126411.77,Sweden,2003,-22066.24
2472,Decision analysis of the cost-effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation versus electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of nonpsychotic severe depression,"BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new treatment with promise for resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: We tested the economic feasibility of this new method compared with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHOD: An economic decision analysis was used to compare the costs of three different treatment strategies for nonpsychotic severe depression. The strategies were: ECT alone; rTMS alone; and rTMS followed by ECT for nonresponders (rTMS-to-ECT). We calculated 12-month costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for the three treatment options for all nonpsychotic, severely depressed United States patients who would have otherwise undergone ECT. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the degree of change in outcome with various parameter changes. RESULTS: The additional cost of using ECT alone compared with rTMS alone was 460,031 US dollars per quality adjusted year of life gained. For ECT versus rTMS-to-ECT, there was both an increased cost and a loss of 1,538 QALYs with ECT alone. The sensitivity analysis revealed the model to be robust with various parameter changes. CONCLUSION: If rTMS were to be made widely available clinically in the US, it would offer a substantial economic benefit over ECT in treating resistant depression. Using rTMS-to-ECT offers not only an economic advantage but also an increase in QALYs. This analysis suggests that rTMS would be a cost-effective treatment for depression compared with the current option of ECT alone.",2004-01-00289,15162090,CNS Spectr,F Andrew Kozel,2004,9 / 6,476-82,No,15162090,"F Andrew Kozel; Mark S George; Kit N Simpson; Mark S George; Kit N Simpson; Decision analysis of the cost-effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation versus electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of nonpsychotic severe depression, CNS Spectr, 2004-Jun; 9(6):1092-8529; 476-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) vs. Electro-convulsive treatment (ECT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,460031,United States,2002,661818.14

We calculated 12-month costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for the three treatment options for all nonpsychotic, severely depressed United States patients who would have otherwise undergone ECT. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the degree of change in outcome with various parameter changes. RESULTS: The additional cost of using ECT alone compared with rTMS alone was 460,031 US dollars per quality adjusted year of life gained. For ECT versus rTMS-to-ECT, there was both an increased cost and a loss of 1,538 QALYs with ECT alone. The sensitivity analysis revealed the model to be robust with various parameter changes. CONCLUSION: If rTMS were to be made widely available clinically in the US, it would offer a substantial economic benefit over ECT in treating resistant depression. Using rTMS-to-ECT offers not only an economic advantage but also an increase in QALYs. This analysis suggests that rTMS would be a cost-effective treatment for depression compared with the current option of ECT alone.",2004-01-00289,15162090,CNS Spectr,F Andrew Kozel,2004,9 / 6,476-82,No,15162090,"F Andrew Kozel; Mark S George; Kit N Simpson; Mark S George; Kit N Simpson; Decision analysis of the cost-effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation versus electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of nonpsychotic severe depression, CNS Spectr, 2004-Jun; 9(6):1092-8529; 476-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) followed by electro-convulsive treatment (ECT) vs. ECT alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-39949,United States,2002,-57472.15
2474,Cost-effectiveness of primary implanted cardioverter defibrillator for sudden death prevention in congestive heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is expensive but highly effective in preventing sudden death. The value of primary prophylactic ICD in preventing sudden death for congestive heart failure patients (CHF) has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylactic ICD vs. standard drug therapy for preventing CHF sudden death. DESIGN: Incremental Cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) using a lifetime decision model. DATA SOURCES: Estimates of cost, utility and probabilities from literature, clinical experts, CMS fee schedule payments, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. CHF patients with NYHA functional Class II and III. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime; future values discounted at 3%. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In 2002 prices the discounted lifetime cost is 122,947 dollars with primary prophylactic ICD and 25,223 dollars without ICD; the QALYs gained were 2.9031 and 1.9045 respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 97,861 dollars per QALY saved with prophylactic ICD. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: ICD is not cost-effective under plausible scenarios using 50,000-80,000 dollars per QALY as the cost effectiveness threshold. The cost-effectiveness ratio is quite sensitive to patient utility after ICD implantation, and the proportion of CHF patients experiencing sudden death. CONCLUSIONS: Using a standard cost-effectiveness threshold and plausible parameter ranges, it is unlikely that ICD is cost-effectiveness in preventing CHF sudden death relative to standard drug therapy.",2004-01-00290,15162078,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,Lei Chen,2004,18 / 2,161-70,No,15162078,"Lei Chen; Joel W Hay; Joel W Hay; Cost-effectiveness of primary implanted cardioverter defibrillator for sudden death prevention in congestive heart failure, Cardiovasc Drugs Ther, 2004-Mar; 18(2):0920-3206; 161-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic implanted cardioverter diffibrillator (ICD) vs. Standard therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,97861,United States,2002,140786.57
2475,Costs and net health effects of contraceptive methods,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and contraceptive methods both have important health effects that include risks and benefits. The net impact of contraception on women""s health has not been reported previously. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation using the societal perspective for costs. The analysis compared 13 methods of contraception to nonuse of contraception with respect to healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Discounting was applied for future costs and health effects. The base-case analysis applies to women of average health and fertility, ranging from 15 to 50 years of age, who are sexually active in a mutually monogamous relationship; smoking rates observed in women of reproductive age were used. Sensitivity analysis extended the analysis to nonmonogamous status and smoking status. RESULTS: Compared with use of no contraception, contraceptive methods of all types result in substantial cost savings over 2 years, ranging from US$5907 per woman for tubal sterilization to US$9936 for vasectomy and health gains ranging from 0.088 QALYs for diaphragm to 0.147 QALYs for depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Compared with nonuse, even with a time horizon as short as 1 year, use of any method other than sterilization results in financial savings and health gains. Most of the financial savings and health gains were due to contraceptive effects. In a population of patients, even modest increases in the use of the most effective methods result in financial savings and health gains. CONCLUSIONS: Every method of contraception dominates nonuse in most clinical settings. Increasing the use of more effective methods even modestly at the expense of less effective methods will improve health and reduce costs.

2486,Costs and net health effects of contraceptive methods,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and contraceptive methods both have important health effects that include risks and benefits. The net impact of contraception on women""s health has not been reported previously. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation using the societal perspective for costs. The analysis compared 13 methods of contraception to nonuse of contraception with respect to healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Discounting was applied for future costs and health effects. The base-case analysis applies to women of average health and fertility, ranging from 15 to 50 years of age, who are sexually active in a mutually monogamous relationship; smoking rates observed in women of reproductive age were used. Sensitivity analysis extended the analysis to nonmonogamous status and smoking status. RESULTS: Compared with use of no contraception, contraceptive methods of all types result in substantial cost savings over 2 years, ranging from US$5907 per woman for tubal sterilization to US$9936 for vasectomy and health gains ranging from 0.088 QALYs for diaphragm to 0.147 QALYs for depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Compared with nonuse, even with a time horizon as short as 1 year, use of any method other than sterilization results in financial savings and health gains. Most of the financial savings and health gains were due to contraceptive effects. In a population of patients, even modest increases in the use of the most effective methods result in financial savings and health gains.

2488,Evaluating the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of foot orthoses in the treatment of plantar heel pain: a feasibility study,"This study evaluated the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two different types of foot orthoses used to treat plantar heel pain. Forty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive either a functional or an accommodative orthosis. General (EuroQol) and specific (Foot Health Status Questionnaire) health-status measures were used. Data were also collected using economic questionnaires relating to National Health Service costs for podiatry, other health-service costs, and patient costs. Data were measured at baseline and at 4- and 8-week intervals. Thirty-five patients completed the study. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in foot pain and a significant increase in foot function with the functional foot orthoses over the 8-week trial. The accommodative foot orthoses demonstrated a significant reduction in foot pain only at 4 weeks. The cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that functional orthoses, although initially more expensive, result in a better quality of life. Use of functional orthoses resulted in an increased cost of pound 17.99 (32.74 dollars) per patient, leading to an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year of pound 1,650 (3,003 dollars) for functional orthoses.",2004-01-00294,15153583,J Am Podiatr Med Assoc,Keith Rome,2004,94 / 3,229-38,No,15153583,"Keith Rome; J Gray; Fiona Stewart; Stephen Charles Hannant; Des Callaghan; Joanne Hubble; Joanne Gray; Fiona Stewart; Stephen Charles Hannant; Des Callaghan; Joanne Hubble; Evaluating the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of foot orthoses in the treatment of plantar heel pain: a feasibility study, J Am Podiatr Med Assoc, 2004 May-Jun; 94(3):8750-7315; 229-38",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Functional orthoses vs. Accommodative orthoses,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,1650,United Kingdom,2001,3471.4
2489,Cost-effectiveness of a community-based screening programme for chronic atrial fibrillation in Japan,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a community-based screening programme for chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) in Japan. METHODS: Using a computer model of a Markov process, the cost-effectiveness of an annual ECG screening programme and an annual pulse palpation screening programme for arrhythmia were compared with no screening. A hypothetical Japanese population of 65 year old individuals was followed until 85 years of age. We assumed that individuals with irregular beats on palpation were worked up by ECG and that ECG was perfect in detecting AF, whereas palpation was not. It was also assumed that patients diagnosed with AF received anticoagulant therapy, that some AF patients developed ischaemic stroke, and that some on anticoagulant therapy developed intracranial or gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Costs, efficacy of anticoagulation, utility of health status, and clinical variables were estimated from the literature. Outcomes were expressed as US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Both annual ECG screening programme and annual palpation screening programme were more costly and at the same time more effective compared with no screening, with their incremental cost-effectiveness ratios approximately US$8000 per QALY in males and US$10,000 per QALY in females. Sensitivity analyses showed high sensitivity of cost-effectiveness ratios to the incidence of ischaemic stroke and anticoagulants prescription rate.

2495,Serological testing for coeliac disease in patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome may have coeliac disease. AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of coeliac disease testing in suspected irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: We used decision analysis to estimate the number of coeliac disease cases detected, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and costs resulting from testing suspected irritable bowel syndrome patients for tissue transglutaminase antibody or an antibody panel (tissue transglutaminase, gliadin, total immunoglobulin A). Positive tests prompted endoscopic biopsy. A gluten-free diet improved quality of life in coeliac disease. RESULTS: Assuming a coeliac disease prevalence of 3%, tissue transglutaminase detected 28 and the panel detected 29 of 30 coeliac disease cases among 1000 suspected irritable bowel syndrome patients. The cost/case detected was $4600 with tissue transglutaminase and $8800 with the panel. The cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained with tissue transglutaminase was $7400, and the incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained for the panel vs. tissue transglutaminase was $287 000.

2498,Cost-effectiveness of screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients using abdominal ultrasonography and alpha-foetoprotein levels is widely practiced. AIM: To evaluate its cost-effectiveness using a Markov decision model. METHODS: Several screening strategies with abdominal ultrasonography or computerized tomography and serum alpha-foetoprotein at 6-12-month intervals in 40-year-old patients with chronic hepatitis C and compensated cirrhosis were simulated from a societal perspective, resulting in discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: For the least efficacious strategy, annual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (vs. no screening) was $23 043/quality-adjusted life-year. Biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography, the most commonly used strategy in the United States, was more efficacious, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $33 083/quality-adjusted life-year vs. annual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography. The most efficacious strategy, biannual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography, resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $73 789/quality-adjusted life-year vs. biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography. Biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual computerized tomography screening resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $51 750/quality-adjusted life-year vs. biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography screening. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is as cost-effective as other accepted screening protocols. Of the strategies evaluated, biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography gives the most quality-adjusted life-year gain while still maintaining a cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/quality-adjusted life-year.

METHODS: Several screening strategies with abdominal ultrasonography or computerized tomography and serum alpha-foetoprotein at 6-12-month intervals in 40-year-old patients with chronic hepatitis C and compensated cirrhosis were simulated from a societal perspective, resulting in discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: For the least efficacious strategy, annual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (vs. no screening) was $23 043/quality-adjusted life-year. Biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography, the most commonly used strategy in the United States, was more efficacious, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $33 083/quality-adjusted life-year vs. annual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography. The most efficacious strategy, biannual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography, resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $73 789/quality-adjusted life-year vs. biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography. Biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual computerized tomography screening resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $51 750/quality-adjusted life-year vs. biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography screening. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is as cost-effective as other accepted screening protocols. Of the strategies evaluated, biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography gives the most quality-adjusted life-year gain while still maintaining a cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/quality-adjusted life-year.
