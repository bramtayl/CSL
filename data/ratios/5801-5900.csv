5801,Cost-effectiveness analysis of solifenacin flexible dosing in patients with overactive bladder symptoms in four Nordic countries,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present analysis was to analyze and compare the cost-effectiveness of solifenacin flexible dosing (5-10 mg) with tolterodine 4 mg sustained release (SR) or placebo (assumed to be comparable to no treatment) for patients with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed. METHODS: Costs and effects were evaluated for the three treatment options in a one-year timeframe. Costs included were treatment costs, cost of pad use, and patients productivity loss based on data from the Nordic countries. SAMPLE: Results from two randomized controlled trials were used as input data in the cost-effectiveness analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Solifenacin flexible dosing was more effective with respect to reducing OAB symptoms compared to both placebo and tolterodine 4 mg. Treatment with both solifenacin and tolterodine was more costly compared to placebo, but treatment with solifenacin was a less costly alternative compared to tolterodine 4 mg SR. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the conclusions were robust.

5808,The long-term cost of multiple sclerosis in France and potential changes with disease-modifying interventions,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term costs and quality of life (QoL) with and without disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Data on resource consumption, productivity losses, QoL (utility), and fatigue were collected from 1355 patients registered with a patient association and descriptive analyses was performed.A Markov model was developed to estimate costs and utility over 20 years using the survey data. Disease progression without DMTs was taken from an epidemiological cohort in France (EDMUS cohort, LYON). Progression under DMTs was estimated from the Stockholm MS registry. Results are presented as cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), from the societal perspective, in EUR2007, discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 4.4 and mean total annual costs per patient were EUR44,400, of which 47% were productivity losses and 11% informal care. Public payers cover an estimated 48% of costs. Mean utility was 0.52, and the loss compared with the normal population was estimated at 0.28. Costs and utility ranged from EUR16,000 and 0.79 at EDSS 1 to EUR76,000 and 0.11 at EDSS 8-9.Over 20 years, costs were estimated at EUR429,000 and QALYs at 8.96 for patients without DMTs and at EUR433,207 and 9.24 QALYs if all patients were starting treated with DMTs at EDSS 1-3.

5810,The cost-effectiveness of induction immunosuppression in kidney transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Induction immunosuppression is perceived as an expensive therapy, so is often given only to select patients. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antibody induction comparing interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL2Ra) to standard therapy with no induction or induction with polyclonal antibodies. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes [survival (life years saved, LYS) and quality-adjusted survival (QALYs)] for the alternative strategies. Outcome data were obtained from a meta-analysis of randomized trials and large-scale renal registries. RESULTS: IL2Ra offers improved survival of 0.21 LYS (2.5 months) and 1.42 QALYs compared with no induction, with a cost saving over 20 years of $79,302 per patient treated regardless of risk profile. The incremental benefits of IL2Ra compared with polyclonal antibody induction therapy were 0.35 LYS (4.3 months) and 0.20 QALYs, with an incremental cost of $5144 per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IL2Ra compared to polyclonal induction was $14,803 per LYS and $25,928 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that IL2Ra remained more effective and less expensive than no induction. When IL2Ra was compared to polyclonal induction, the model was sensitive to changes in the cost of induction and the probability of malignancy. Over the range of all other variables tested, IL2Ra was cost-effective compared to polyclonal induction. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting IL2Ra as induction immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients improves survival and QALYs and is less costly than no induction.

5812,Fondaparinux versus Enoxaparin in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: short-term cost and long-term cost-effectiveness using data from the Fifth Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes Investigators (OASIS-5) trial,"BACKGROUND: The study aimed to compare the short-term costs and long-term cost-effectiveness of 2 antithrombotics, fondaparinux and enoxaparin, for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in the United States. METHODS: It was based on a large randomized trial of 20,078 patients Fifth Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes Investigators [OASIS-5] comparing the therapies in these patients. In OASIS-5, fondaparinux patients had about half the rate of major bleeding 9 days after randomization and at least as good clinical outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, major bleeding and stroke) after 6 months of follow-up. Health care resource use and clinical efficacy data from the trial were incorporated into a cost-effectiveness model as applied to a general US health care system both for the time horizon of the study (6 months) and over the longer term. RESULTS: The 180-day cost analysis indicates that fondaparinux would generate a cost saving of $547 per patient (95% CI $207-$924). Sensitivity analysis suggested that savings could vary between $494 and $733. When 180-day cost and clinical results were extrapolated to long-term cost-effectiveness, fondaparinux was dominant (less costly and more effective in terms of quality-adjusted life-years) under most scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Fondaparinux is a more cost-effective antithrombotic agent than enoxaparin in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome.

5813,Surgical treatments for men with benign prostatic enlargement: cost effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which surgical treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostate enlargement is cost effective. DESIGN: Care pathways describing credible treatment strategies were decided by consensus. Cost-utility analysis used Markov modelling and Monte Carlo simulation. DATA SOURCES: Clinical effectiveness data came from a systematic review and an individual level dataset. Utility values came from previous economic evaluations. Costs were calculated from National Health Service (NHS) and commercial sources. METHODS: The Markov model included parameters with associated measures of uncertainty describing health states between which individuals might move at three monthly intervals over 10 years. Successive annual cohorts of 25,000 men were entered into the model and the probability that treatment strategies were cost effective was assessed with Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations. RESULTS: A treatment strategy of initial diathermy vaporisation of the prostate followed by endoscopic holmium laser enucleation of the prostate in case of failure to benefit or subsequent relapse had an 85% probability of being cost effective at a willingness to pay value of pound20,000 (euro21,595, $28,686)/quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Other strategies with diathermy vaporisation as the initial treatment were generally cheaper and more effective than the current standard of transurethral resection repeated once if necessary. The use of potassium titanyl phosphate laser vaporisation incurred higher costs and was less effective than transurethral resection, and strategies involving initial minimally invasive treatment with microwave thermotherapy were not cost effective. Findings were unchanged by wide ranging sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The outcome of this economic model should be interpreted cautiously because of the limitations of the data used. The finding that initial vaporisation followed by holmium laser enucleation for failure or relapse might be advantageous both to men with lower urinary tract symptoms and to healthcare providers requires confirmation in a good quality prospective clinical trial before any change in current practice. Potassium titanyl phosphate laser vaporisation was unlikely to be cost effective in our model, which argues against its unrestricted use until further evidence of effectiveness and cost reduction is obtained.",2009-01-05018,19372131,BMJ,Nigel Armstrong,2009,338 /,b1288,No,19372131,"Nigel Armstrong; Luke Vale; Mark Deverill; Ghulam Nabi; Samuel McClinton; James N'Dow; Robert Pickard; Surgical treatments for men with benign prostatic enlargement: cost effectiveness study, BMJ, 2009; 338():0959-8138; b1288",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Holmium laser enucleation vs. Diathermy vaporisation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,7.68,United Kingdom,2006,18.18

Other strategies with diathermy vaporisation as the initial treatment were generally cheaper and more effective than the current standard of transurethral resection repeated once if necessary. The use of potassium titanyl phosphate laser vaporisation incurred higher costs and was less effective than transurethral resection, and strategies involving initial minimally invasive treatment with microwave thermotherapy were not cost effective. Findings were unchanged by wide ranging sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The outcome of this economic model should be interpreted cautiously because of the limitations of the data used. The finding that initial vaporisation followed by holmium laser enucleation for failure or relapse might be advantageous both to men with lower urinary tract symptoms and to healthcare providers requires confirmation in a good quality prospective clinical trial before any change in current practice. Potassium titanyl phosphate laser vaporisation was unlikely to be cost effective in our model, which argues against its unrestricted use until further evidence of effectiveness and cost reduction is obtained.",2009-01-05018,19372131,BMJ,Nigel Armstrong,2009,338 /,b1288,No,19372131,"Nigel Armstrong; Luke Vale; Mark Deverill; Ghulam Nabi; Samuel McClinton; James N'Dow; Robert Pickard; Surgical treatments for men with benign prostatic enlargement: cost effectiveness study, BMJ, 2009; 338():0959-8138; b1288",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diathermy vaporisation + holmium enucleation vs. Holmium laser enucleation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,9.5,United Kingdom,2006,22.49

5817,Economic evaluation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug strategies in rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVES: Although disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the first choice drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, many patients still take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well. These drugs may cause serious gastric adverse events with continuous usage. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitors were supposed to have a gastrointestinal (GI) friendly side effect profile. The aim of the study is to compare three therapeutic strategies: conventional NSAIDs, NSAID in combination with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and the selective COX2 inhibitor therapy (celecoxib). METHODS: A decision tree model was developed, for 1 year, to simulate cohorts within the three arms (NSAIDs, NSAID + PPI, celecoxib). The efficacy of the different active agents of NSAIDs in therapeutically relevant doses was assumed to be the same, consequently differences can be seen in the side effect profile of the drugs. Medical costs, the costs of the side effects (GI, cardiovascular [CV] events), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated to gain an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Evaluations were made from a third party payer's perspective. We performed one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses; the results were displayed in tornado diagrams. RESULTS: Our model indicates that NSAID + PPI offers extra health gain for extra costs compared with conventional NSAIDs (ICER:14,287 euro/QALY), while it dominates celecoxib because of celecoxib's higher costs and lower effectiveness. According to the sensitivity analyses, QALYs had the highest influence on ICER.

5819,Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination in Belgium: do not forget about cervical cancer screening,"OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in 12-year-old females to the recommended cervical cancer screening in Belgium is examined. Moreover, the health and economic consequences of a potential decline in screening uptake after initiation of a HPV vaccination program are investigated. METHODS: A static Markov model is developed to estimate the direct effect of vaccination on precancerous lesions and cervical cancers. RESULTS: Vaccination is estimated to avoid 20 percent of the cervical cancers occurring in a 12-year-old girls' cohort and to cost 32,665 euro per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (95 percent credibility interval [CrI]: 17,447 euro to 68,078 euro), assuming a booster injection after 10 years, a limited duration of protection and discounting costs and effects at 3 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Assuming lifelong protection, HPV vaccination is estimated to cost 14,382 euro (95 percent CrI: 9,238 euro to 25,644 euro) per QALY gained, while avoiding 50 percent of the cervical cancer cases. In the base-case, a 10 percent reduction in screening compliance after vaccination obliterates the effect of vaccination on cervical cancer cases avoided, whereas further declines in the level of screening compliance even turned out to be detrimental for the cohort's health, inducing a mean loss in QALYs and life-year gained compared with the situation prevaccination.

5821,A modelled economic evaluation comparing atomoxetine with methylphenidate in the treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Spain,"BACKGROUND: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioural disorder, affecting 3-6% of school age children and adolescents in Spain. Methylphenidate (MPH), a mild stimulant, had long been the only approved medication available for ADHD children in Spain. Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant alternative in the treatment of ADHD with once-a-day oral dosing. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of atomoxetine compared to MPH. In addition, atomoxetine is compared to 'no medication' for patient populations who are ineligible for MPH (i.e. having stimulant-failure experience or co-morbidities precluding stimulant medication). METHODS: An economic model with Markov processes was developed to estimate the costs and benefits of atomoxetine versus either MPH or 'no medication'. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for atomoxetine relative to the comparators. The Markov process incorporated 14 health states, representing a range of outcomes associated with treatment options. Utility values were obtained from the utility valuation survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD. The clinical data were based on a thorough review of controlled clinical trials and other clinical literature, and validated by international experts. Costs and outcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over a 1-year duration, with costs estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service in Spain. RESULTS: For stimulant-naive patients without contra-indications to stimulants, the incremental costs per QALY gained for atomoxetine were euro 34,308 (compared to an immediate-release MPH) and euro 24,310 (compared to an extended-release MPH). For those patients who have stimulant-failure experience or contra-indications to stimulants, the incremental costs per QALY gained of atomoxetine compared to 'no medication' were euro 23,820 and euro 23,323, respectively.

5825,Cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Canadian payer setting: modeling analysis,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to quantify the long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir (Levemir) versus intermediate-acting neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Canada, and to assess the sensitivity of results to dis-utilities for hypoglycemic events. dagger Levemir is a trade name of Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ, USA RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The web-based IMS-CORE diabetes model has a menu-driven interface programmed in hypertext markup language (HTML). It was used to project lifetime (60 years for T1DM and 35 years for T2DM) clinical and economic outcomes for patients on detemir vs. NPH. Cohort characteristics, utilities, and costs were derived from published literature. For T1DM, clinical trial data for HbA(1c) improvement (detemir -0.94% +/- 1.07; NPH -0.82% +/- 1.01) from baseline, and rates of hypoglycemic events (major events: 0.20 vs. 0.80 per patient-year for detemir vs. NPH, respectively) were modeled. For T2DM, observational study data for HbA(1c) improvement (detemir -0.18%) from baseline, and reductions in hypoglycemic events (major events: 0.0995 vs. 1.33 per patient-year for detemir vs. NPH, respectively) were modeled. Base-case hypoglycemia dis-utilities were -0.0118 for major and -0.0035 for minor events. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on discount rate and hypoglycemia dis-utility. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included costs of treatment/management and costs (and incidence) of diabetes-related complications. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from differences in total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Average total costs for T1DM were $CAN 83 622 +/- 4585 for detemir and $CAN 72 016 +/- 4593 for NPH. QALYs increased by 0.475 years with detemir, with an ICER of $CAN 24 389/QALY. Average direct costs for T2DM were $CAN 74 919 +/- 6391 (detemir) and $CAN 69 230 +/- 6840 (NPH). QALYs increased by 0.305 years. The ICER was $CAN 18 677. Although detemir was associated with slightly lower costs for most complications, results were driven by the differences in rates and costs for hypoglycemic events, and their assumed dis-utility.

5826,Cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Canadian payer setting: modeling analysis,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to quantify the long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir (Levemir) versus intermediate-acting neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Canada, and to assess the sensitivity of results to dis-utilities for hypoglycemic events. dagger Levemir is a trade name of Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ, USA RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The web-based IMS-CORE diabetes model has a menu-driven interface programmed in hypertext markup language (HTML). It was used to project lifetime (60 years for T1DM and 35 years for T2DM) clinical and economic outcomes for patients on detemir vs. NPH. Cohort characteristics, utilities, and costs were derived from published literature. For T1DM, clinical trial data for HbA(1c) improvement (detemir -0.94% +/- 1.07; NPH -0.82% +/- 1.01) from baseline, and rates of hypoglycemic events (major events: 0.20 vs. 0.80 per patient-year for detemir vs. NPH, respectively) were modeled. For T2DM, observational study data for HbA(1c) improvement (detemir -0.18%) from baseline, and reductions in hypoglycemic events (major events: 0.0995 vs. 1.33 per patient-year for detemir vs. NPH, respectively) were modeled. Base-case hypoglycemia dis-utilities were -0.0118 for major and -0.0035 for minor events. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on discount rate and hypoglycemia dis-utility. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included costs of treatment/management and costs (and incidence) of diabetes-related complications. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from differences in total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Average total costs for T1DM were $CAN 83 622 +/- 4585 for detemir and $CAN 72 016 +/- 4593 for NPH. QALYs increased by 0.475 years with detemir, with an ICER of $CAN 24 389/QALY. Average direct costs for T2DM were $CAN 74 919 +/- 6391 (detemir) and $CAN 69 230 +/- 6840 (NPH). QALYs increased by 0.305 years. The ICER was $CAN 18 677. Although detemir was associated with slightly lower costs for most complications, results were driven by the differences in rates and costs for hypoglycemic events, and their assumed dis-utility. Study limitations include the use of single trials for clinical assumptions and the lack of analyses for patient risk sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide evidence for the cost-effectiveness of detemir vs. NPH in treating T1 and T2DM in Canada, and support the key role of assumptions regarding the impact of hypoglycemic events.

5827,Lifetime cost-effectiveness of prophylactic implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator in patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function: results of Markov modelling in a European population,"AIMS: Current European guidelines recommend prophylactic implantation of cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who are not in NYHA class IV and have reasonable life expectancy. Cost and benefit implications of this recommendation have not been reported from a European perspective. METHODS AND RESULTS: Markov modelling estimated lifetime costs and effects [life years (LY) and quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained] of prophylactic ICD implantation vs. conventional treatment, among patients with a reduced LVEF. Efficacy was estimated from a meta-analysis of mortality rates in the six primary prevention trials with inclusion criteria matching ACC/AHA/ESC Class I or IIa recommendations. Direct medical costs were estimated using Belgian national references. Costs and effects were discounted at 3 and 1.5% per annum, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses estimated the uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. An ICD implantation increased the lifetime direct costs by euro 46,413. Estimated mean LY/QALY gained were 1.88/1.57, respectively. Probabilistic analysis estimated mean lifetime cost per QALY gained as euro 31,717 (95% CI: euro 19,760-euro 61,316). Cost-effectiveness was influenced most by ICD efficacy, time to replacement, utility, and patient age at implantation.

5828,"Cost-effectiveness of salmeterol, fluticasone, and combination therapy for COPD","OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of inhaled medication use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained of the alternative treatment arms used in the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study (ie, salmeterol-fluticasone propionate combination [SFC], salmeterol, fluticasone, and placebo). METHODS: The cycle length for the model was set to 3 months, and the maximum time horizon was set to 3 years. The cost-effective analysis was conducted from a third-party payer's perspective in the US healthcare system. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3%. Multiple 1-way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation were performed to handle uncertainty. RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategies are placebo (as-needed short-acting bronchodilator use with no maintenance therapy) when willingness to pay (WTP) is less than $52,800/QALY gained and SFC when WTP exceeds that threshold. When no maintenance therapy is not an acceptable option, the most cost-effective strategies are treatment with salmeterol when WTP is less than $49,500/QALY gained and treatment with SFC when WTP exceeds that threshold. The base-case analysis showed that incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of salmeterol, fluticasone, and SFC relative to placebo were $56,519, $62,833, and $52,046/QALY gained, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-effective strategy in moderate-to-severe COPD depends on how much society is willing to pay to achieve health improvements.

5831,"Cost-utility analysis of varenicline, an oral smoking-cessation drug, in Japan","OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-utility analysis of two 12-week smoking-cessation interventions in Japan: smoking-cessation counselling by a physician compared with use of varenicline, an oral smoking-cessation drug, in addition to counselling. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to analyse lifetime medical costs and QALYs from the perspective of the healthcare payer. The cycle length was 5 years. Both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. The cohort of smokers was classified by sex and age, and we assumed that smokers started smoking at the age of 20 years and received smoking-cessation therapy at the ages of 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70 years (five separate models were run). The healthcare costs and QALYs were calculated throughout the term until the age of 90 years. In the base-case analysis, success rates of varenicline plus counselling and counselling alone were assumed to be 37.9% and 25.5%, respectively, in male smokers, and 22.2% and 16.1%, respectively, in female smokers, based on a randomized controlled trial conducted in Japan. Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Prescribed varenicline was shown to be more effective and less costly than smoking-cessation counselling alone. Varenicline would save direct medical costs of Japanese Yen (yen)43 846 ($US381; $US1 = yen115; Oct 2007) and generate an increase of 0.094 QALYs in male smokers. In females the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was yen346 143 per QALY gained. Varenicline is estimated to save yen23.7 billion ($US206 million) of the medical costs for tobacco-associated diseases for the whole population. Overall savings are yen9.5 billion. Sensitivity analyses suggested the robustness of the results. CONCLUSIONS: As with any data of this nature, there is some uncertainty in the results and further research is warranted.

5832,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in Belgium,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV; types 6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine is expected to significantly reduce the burden of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), genital warts and other HPV-related diseases. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of providing a quadrivalent (6,11,16,18) HPV vaccine programme in adolescent females aged 12 years in addition to the existing cervical cancer screening programme in Belgium. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed for the Belgian context in order to evaluate the long-term impact of vaccinating a cohort of girls aged 12 years alongside the existing screening programme. Women were followed until the age of 85 years. A vaccine that would prevent 100% of diseases associated with HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18, with lifetime duration of efficacy, 80% coverage, in conjunction with current screening, was compared with screening alone. For this analysis, 35% of cases of CIN-1, 55% of CIN-2/3, 75% of cervical cancer and 90% of genital warts were considered to be attributable to HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18. The model estimated lifetime risks and total lifetime healthcare costs, survival and QALYs for cervical cancer, CIN and genital warts. Outcomes validation was applied. Model outcomes also included incremental costs per life-year gained and incremental costs per QALY gained. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Belgian healthcare payer, and costs were in year 2006 values. RESULTS: The model estimated a reduction in the lifetime risk of cervical cancer from 0.94% to 0.34%, therefore preventing 362 cases of cervical cancer and 131 related deaths in a cohort of 60,000 girls aged 12 years in Belgium. The base-case scenario suggests quadrivalent HPV vaccination in addition to current cervical screening in Belgium to be cost effective at euro 10,546 per QALY. This is within the accepted range of cost-effective interventions in Europe. This cost effectiveness is maintained for different parameter assumptions in the sensitivity analysis, with the exception of very high discount rates for costs and medical benefits, but, even in the worst case, ratios were still less than euro 50,000 per QALY. Even when a separate scenario modelled the requirement for a booster vaccination to sustain a lifetime duration of protection, the results remained cost effective at eruo 17,388 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be a cost-effective public health intervention in conjunction with the existing screening programme in Belgium. The additional costs of introducing vaccination to the established screening programme would be offset by the potential savings from not having to treat the diseases caused by HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18.",2009-01-05041,19354343,Pharmacoeconomics,Lieven Annemans,2009,27 / 3,231-45,Yes,19354343,"Lieven Annemans; Vanessa Rémy; James Oyee; Nathalie Largeron; Cost-effectiveness evaluation of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in Belgium, Pharmacoeconomics, 2009; 27(3):1179-2027; 231-45",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (versus types 6, 11, 16, 18) and cervical cancer screening vs. Cervical cancer screening only (rates based on existing screening program in Belgium)",Not Stated,85 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,10546,Euro,2006,17008.69

5837,Cost-effectiveness model comparing olanzapine and other oral atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is often a persistent and costly illness that requires continued treatment with antipsychotics. Differences among antipsychotics on efficacy, safety, tolerability, adherence, and cost have cost-effectiveness implications for treating schizophrenia. This study compares the cost-effectiveness of oral olanzapine, oral risperidone (at generic cost, primary comparator), quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia from the perspective of third-party payers in the U.S. health care system. METHODS: A 1-year microsimulation economic decision model, with quarterly cycles, was developed to simulate the dynamic nature of usual care of schizophrenia patients who switch, continue, discontinue, and restart their medications. The model captures clinical and cost parameters including adherence levels, relapse with and without hospitalization, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment discontinuation by reason, treatment-emergent adverse events, suicide, health care resource utilization, and direct medical care costs. Published medical literature and a clinical expert panel were used to develop baseline model assumptions. Key model outcomes included mean annual total direct cost per treatment, cost per stable patient, and incremental cost-effectiveness values per QALY gained. RESULTS: The results of the microsimulation model indicated that olanzapine had the lowest mean annual direct health care cost ($8,544) followed by generic risperidone ($9,080). In addition, olanzapine resulted in more QALYs than risperidone (0.733 vs. 0.719). The base case and multiple sensitivity analyses found olanzapine to be the dominant choice in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The utilization of olanzapine is predicted in this model to result in better clinical outcomes and lower total direct health care costs compared to generic risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. Olanzapine may, therefore, be a cost-effective therapeutic option for patients with schizophrenia.",2009-01-05044,19351408,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Nicolas M Furiak,2009,7 /,4,Yes,19351408,"Nicolas M Furiak; Haya Ascher-Svanum; Robert W Klein; Lee J Smolen; Anthony H Lawson; Robert R Conley; Steven D Culler; Cost-effectiveness model comparing olanzapine and other oral atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2009; 7():1478-7547; 4",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Olanzapine (15 mg daily) vs. Risperidone generic (4 mg daily),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-38285.71,United States,2007,-47789.47
5838,Cost effectiveness of risk-prediction tools in selecting patients for immediate post-prostatectomy treatment,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ideally, tests that predict the risk of cancer recurrence should be capable of guiding treatment decisions that are both therapeutically effective and cost effective. This paper evaluates the cost effectiveness of two tools that identify patients at high risk for biochemical (prostate-specific antigen) recurrence of prostate cancer after prostatectomy, the hypothesis being that accurate classification of high-risk patients will allow more appropriate use of secondary (adjuvant/salvage) treatment and may improve on current clinical practice. These risk-prediction tools are the Kattan postoperative nomogram, which uses clinicopathologic features, and the Prostate Px test, which employs additional morphometric and immunofluorescence features of the prostate specimen to predict risk of biochemical recurrence. These tools were trained on patients treated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (996 patients for the nomogram, 342 patients for the Prostate Px test). METHODS: The cost effectiveness of the Prostate Px test, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, and current clinical practice were compared using a decision analytic model. The modeled treatment for low-risk patients was watchful waiting. The modeled treatments for high-risk patients were local radiation, hormonal therapy, and watchful waiting. Costs, utilities, and transition probabilities were obtained from the literature. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per year. The time span modeled was 10 years after prostatectomy. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate cost and effectiveness; sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of uncertainty in the parameter values. RESULTS: The expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the Prostate Px test, nomogram, and current practice were 8.11, 7.39, and 6.47, respectively. The expected costs were $US17 549, $US14 162, and $US14 104, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the Prostate Px was $US4704/QALY compared with the nomogram, and $US2100/QALY compared with current practice. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the nomogram was $US63/QALY compared with current practice. These ratios are well below the common willingness-to-pay limit of $US50 000/QALY. Expected effectiveness was highest for the Prostate Px test, followed by the nomogram. Expected cost was slightly higher for Prostate Px than for either alternative; nevertheless, the Prostate Px was cost effective compared with both the nomogram and current practice. The nomogram was cost effective compared with current practice. The acceptable cost effectiveness of the Prostate Px test and the nomogram compared with current practice were not sensitive to changes in the values used to inform the model within clinically plausible ranges. The superior performance of both Prostate Px test and nomogram over current practice resulted from identifying high-risk patients likely to benefit from adjuvant treatment, while sparing the low-risk patients the added cost and toxicity of treatment.

STUDY DESIGN: Using decision-analysis modeling, we compared the cost-effectiveness of using laser photocoagulation with AD for the treatment of TTTS. The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective using a theoretical cohort of 1000 women with TTTS. Costs included the costs of procedures, perinatal complications from TTTS and of resources used for raising a child with cerebral palsy (CP) following TTTS. One-way, multiway and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) sensitivity analyses were carried out for all model variables. The main outcome measures were: cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from treating TTTS. RESULT: On the basis of the available data, the decision model favors SLP as the most cost-effective treatment option compared with AD. Using the theoretical cohort, laser photocoagulation will result in an overall perinatal survival of 59.3% compared with 51.5% for AD. The frequency of children with CP after laser would be 8.5% compared with 15.4% after AD. Sensitivity analyses showed the model to be robust over a wide range of values for the variables, except when the overall survival associated with AD is >62%. Above that survival rate, AD was the more cost-effective therapy.

STUDY DESIGN: Using decision-analysis modeling, we compared the cost-effectiveness of using laser photocoagulation with AD for the treatment of TTTS. The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective using a theoretical cohort of 1000 women with TTTS. Costs included the costs of procedures, perinatal complications from TTTS and of resources used for raising a child with cerebral palsy (CP) following TTTS. One-way, multiway and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) sensitivity analyses were carried out for all model variables. The main outcome measures were: cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from treating TTTS. RESULT: On the basis of the available data, the decision model favors SLP as the most cost-effective treatment option compared with AD. Using the theoretical cohort, laser photocoagulation will result in an overall perinatal survival of 59.3% compared with 51.5% for AD. The frequency of children with CP after laser would be 8.5% compared with 15.4% after AD. Sensitivity analyses showed the model to be robust over a wide range of values for the variables, except when the overall survival associated with AD is >62%. Above that survival rate, AD was the more cost-effective therapy.

5849,Cost-effectiveness of accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation after total hip and knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Accelerated perioperative rehabilitation protocols following total hip and knee arthroplasties are currently being implemented worldwide, but the cost-effectiveness of these protocols from a societal perspective is not known. We compared the cost-effectiveness of an accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation protocol with that of a more standard protocol for patients treated with total hip and knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness study was undertaken as a study piggybacked on a randomized clinical trial comparing early outcomes of an accelerated and intensive postoperative rehabilitation regimen with those of a more standard rehabilitation protocol. We assessed eighty-seven patients (forty-two who received the standard protocol and forty-five who received the accelerated protocol) for a total of twelve months. Costs from the time of the patient's visit immediately before the operation to one year postoperatively were calculated with use of activity-based costing analysis. Postoperative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated from validated patient diaries and questionnaires at fifteen time points. The primary objective was to determine whether one intervention was dominant over the other during a twelve-month period or, if neither was dominant, to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The result of the randomized clinical trial showed the accelerated intervention to be effective, with a reduction in the length of the hospital stay and a gain in health-related quality of life at the three-month follow-up time point. The cost-effectiveness study showed the accelerated protocol to be significantly less expensive than the standard protocol (p=0.036), with an average reduction in cost of 18,880 Danish kroner (95% confidence interval, 1899 to 38,152) (approximately US $4000). Patients treated with the accelerated protocol following hip arthroplasty had an additional average gain of 0.08 QALY (95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.15) compared with the patients who received the standard protocol (p=0.006); this led to a 98% dominance of the accelerated protocol over the standard protocol. No significant or clinically relevant difference in the numbers of QALYs associated with the two protocols was observed for the patients treated with knee arthroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: An accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation protocol can be both cost-saving and clinically more effective after total hip arthroplasty, whereas it can be cost-saving with no observed significant difference in effect, from a societal perspective, after knee arthroplasty.",2009-01-05061,19339559,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Kristian Larsen,2009,91 / 4,761-72,No,19339559,"Kristian Larsen; Torben B Hansen; Per B Thomsen; Terkel Christiansen; Kjeld Søballe; Cost-effectiveness of accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation after total hip and knee arthroplasty, J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2009-Apr; 91(4):0021-9355; 761-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Accelerated total hip and knee arthroplasty protocol (more intensive and personalized pre-operative and post-operative care) vs. Standard total hip and knee arthroplasty protocol,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-236000,Denmark,2006,-51034.2
5850,Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions aimed at preventing medication error at hospital admission (medicines reconciliation),"RATIONALE: Medication errors can lead to preventable adverse drug events (pADEs) that have significant cost and health implications. Errors often occur at care interfaces, and various interventions have been devised to reduce medication errors at the point of admission to hospital. The aim of this study is to assess the incremental costs and effects [measured as quality adjusted life years (QALYs)] of a range of such interventions for which evidence of effectiveness exists. METHODS: A previously published medication errors model was adapted to describe the pathway of errors occurring at admission through to the occurrence of pADEs. The baseline model was populated using literature-based values, and then calibrated to observed outputs. Evidence of effects was derived from a systematic review of interventions aimed at preventing medication error at hospital admission. RESULTS: All five interventions, for which evidence of effectiveness was identified, are estimated to be extremely cost-effective when compared with the baseline scenario. Pharmacist-led reconciliation intervention has the highest expected net benefits, and a probability of being cost-effective of over 60% by a QALY value of pound10 000. CONCLUSIONS: The medication errors model provides reasonably strong evidence that some form of intervention to improve medicines reconciliation is a cost-effective use of NHS resources.

5855,Chronic kidney disease Markov model comparing paricalcitol to calcitriol for secondary hyperparathyroidism: a US perspective,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness of paricalcitol versus calcitriol for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease in the United States setting. METHODS: A Markov process model was developed employing data sources from the published literature, paricalcitol clinical trials and observational studies, official US price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was calcitriol, a non-selective vitamin D receptor activator (VDRA) medication. The primary perspective of the study was that of the third-party payer in the US. The efficacy outcomes (reduction in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), reduction in proteinuria, complications and mortality) were extrapolated to: number of life-years gained (LYG) and number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: The reference case analysis was a 10-year time horizon based on a comparison of paricalcitol with calcitriol, which is started in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 and continued in CKD stage 4 and CKD stage 5. The use of paricalcitol leads to a cost saving of US$1941. The inclusion of indirect costs leads to a cost saving of US$2528. The use of paricalcitol leads to an increase in life-years gained (0.47 years) and a gain in QALYs (0.43). The use of paricalcitol results in a dominant outcome from the perspective of the third-party payer, as well as from the societal perspective. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. CONCLUSION: This model showed that the favorable clinical benefit of paricalcitol results in positive short and long-term health economic benefits.

5859,Cost effectiveness of ixabepilone plus capecitabine for metastatic breast cancer progressing after anthracycline and taxane treatment,"PURPOSE: Using data from a recent randomized trial, we evaluated the cost effectiveness of ixabepilone plus capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in patients with predominantly metastatic breast cancer considered to be taxane-resistant and previously treated with or resistant to an anthracycline. METHODS: We developed a stochastic decision-analytic model to represent data collected in the trial on medical resource use, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Estimates of overall survival were conditional on level of tumor response. We assigned monthly costs and utility weights according to periods defined by the duration of study treatment, time from discontinuation of the study drug until disease progression, and from progression until death and were specific to the level of response and receipt of subsequent therapy. Medical resources were valued in 2008 US dollars. We performed Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses to evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly associated with level of tumor response (P < .001). Total costs were estimated at $60,900 for patients receiving ixabepilone plus capecitabine and $30,000 for patients receiving capecitabine alone. The estimated gain in life expectancy with ixabepilone was 1.96 months (95% CI, 1.36 to 2.64 months); the estimated gain in quality-adjusted survival was 1.06 months (95% CI, 0.09 to 2.03 months). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $359,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (95% CI, $183,000 to $4,030,000). In sensitivity analyses, the results were robust to changes in numerous inputs and assumptions.

5860,Economic evaluation of drug-eluting stents compared to bare metal stents using a large prospective study in Ontario,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness (CE) and cost-utility (CU) of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared to bare metal stents (BMS) in Ontario using a large prospective ""real-world"" cohort study and determine the extent to which results vary by patient risk subgroups. METHODS: A field evaluation was conducted based on all stent procedures in the province of Ontario between December 1, 2003, and March 31, 2005, with a minimum subject follow-up of 1 year. Effectiveness data from the study using a propensity-score matched cohort were combined with resource utilization and cost data and quality of life (QOL) data from the published literature in a decision analytic modeling framework to determine 2-year cost-effectiveness (cost per revascularization avoided) and cost-utility (cost per quality-adjusted life-year ([QALY] gained). Stochastic model parameter uncertainty was expressed using probability distributions and analyzed using a probabilistic model. Modeling assumptions were assessed using traditional deterministic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in revascularization rates were found for patients with two or more high risk factors. Despite these differences, the CE and CU of DES remained high (e.g., $419,000 per QALY gained in the most favorable patient risk subgroup). In sensitivity analysis, the difference in cost between DES and BMS had an impact on the CE and CU results.

METHODS: A field evaluation was conducted based on all stent procedures in the province of Ontario between December 1, 2003, and March 31, 2005, with a minimum subject follow-up of 1 year. Effectiveness data from the study using a propensity-score matched cohort were combined with resource utilization and cost data and quality of life (QOL) data from the published literature in a decision analytic modeling framework to determine 2-year cost-effectiveness (cost per revascularization avoided) and cost-utility (cost per quality-adjusted life-year ([QALY] gained).

5869,Modeling the cost-effectiveness of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with rituximab using registry data from Southern Sweden,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rituximab in patients not responding adequately to the first tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor using a model constructed to predict resource consumption and health outcomes in a population-based registry of biological treatments in Southern Sweden (SSATG). METHODS: The model was developed as a discrete event simulation model, using SSATG data for the years 1999-2007. The data set included 1,903 patients with complete data on treatments (up to three treatment lines), functional capacity (HAQ), disease activity (DAS28), and utility (EQ-5D). Resource consumption was based on a regular population-based survey of patients in Southern Sweden. Rituximab was incorporated as second line treatment, using effectiveness data for the active group (N = 311) in a clinical trial comparing rituximab to placebo (REFLEX). It is thus compared to the mix of second line biologics used in SSATG. The analysis starts after failure of the first TNF inhibitor. Results are reported as costs (2008 euro) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY; both discounted 3 percent), for the societal perspective in Sweden. RESULTS: Total costs in the rituximab strategy are estimated at 401,100 euro compared with 403,000 euro in the TNF-inhibitor arm. Total QALYs are 5.98 and 5.78, respectively. The findings were found to be robust in extensive sensitivity analysis.

5877,Cost-effectiveness of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for patients with chronic hepatitis C treated in routine clinical practice,"OBJECTIVES: This study assesses whether pegylated interferon and ribavirin is cost-effective compared with no antiviral treatment provided in routine clinical practice, for different patient subgroups. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) uses a Markov decision model to estimate the lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of antiviral treatment compared with no treatment. The model is populated with data on sustained virological responses, costs, and transition probabilities all taken from a large representative sample of UK cases and centers (Trent HCV database). RESULTS: The CEA found that pegylated interferon and ribavirin was cost-effective for most patient subgroups. The CEA found that for patients with genotype non-1, the intervention led to cost reductions and gains of at least 0.5 QALYs. For genotype 1 cases with mild or moderate disease, and younger cirrhotic patients (aged 40 or less), costs per QALY remained below 20,000 pound sterling ($40,000 or 29,000 euro). For genotype 1 cases with cirrhosis aged 50, the mean cost per QALY rose to over 60,000 pound sterling ($120,000 or 87,000 euro). CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that, based on cost and effectiveness data collected from routine clinical practice, treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin is generally cost-effective.

5883,Microvolt T-wave alternans and the selective use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention: a cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVES: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are an effective but expensive treatment for the prevention of sudden cardiac deaths in patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction. Recent studies suggest that microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) predicts mortality and severe arrhythmic events in this population. However, the impact of MTWA on ICD cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: A Markov decision-analysis model evaluated three treatment strategies for primary prevention in patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction: (i) medical therapy for all; (ii) ICD therapy for all; and (iii) selective ICD therapy based on non-negative (positive or indeterminate) MTWA test results. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated from the perspective of a third party payer using a 10-year time horizon. Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of the estimates. RESULTS: A treatment strategy involving ICD therapy in all patients was associated with an ICER of $121,800/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with medical therapy, whereas a treatment strategy involving the selective use of ICDs based on MTWA test results was associated with an ICER of $108,900/QALY compared with medical therapy. Sensitivity analyses suggest that, under most scenarios, the selective use of ICDs based on MTWA results does not decrease the ICER to below $100,000/QALY.

METHODS: A Markov decision-analysis model evaluated three treatment strategies for primary prevention in patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction: (i) medical therapy for all; (ii) ICD therapy for all; and (iii) selective ICD therapy based on non-negative (positive or indeterminate) MTWA test results. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated from the perspective of a third party payer using a 10-year time horizon. Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of the estimates. RESULTS: A treatment strategy involving ICD therapy in all patients was associated with an ICER of $121,800/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with medical therapy, whereas a treatment strategy involving the selective use of ICDs based on MTWA test results was associated with an ICER of $108,900/QALY compared with medical therapy. Sensitivity analyses suggest that, under most scenarios, the selective use of ICDs based on MTWA results does not decrease the ICER to below $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: MTWA only marginally improves the cost-effectiveness of ICDs for primary prevention in patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction. There remains a need for improved means to effectively identify which patients will derive the greatest benefit from ICD implantation.",2009-01-05077,19331707,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Kristian B Filion,2009,25 / 2,151-60,No,19331707,"Kristian B Filion; Xuanqian Xie; Charlotte J van der Avoort; Nandini Dendukuri; James M Brophy; Microvolt T-wave alternans and the selective use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention: a cost-effectiveness study, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2009-Apr; 25(2):0266-4623; 151-60",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Primary prevention for all vs. Selective implantable cardioverter defibrillators therapy based on Microvolt T wave alternans test results,Not Stated,79 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,177400,Canada,2007,207253.69
5886,Cost-effectiveness of pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease in a Swiss setting,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pioglitazone versus placebo, given in addition to existing treatment regimens, in patients with type 2 diabetes and evidence of macrovascular disease in Switzerland. METHODS: Event rates corresponding to macrovascular outcomes from the PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events) trial of pioglitazone were used to project long-term clinical outcomes as part of a modified version of the previously validated CORE Diabetes Model. Direct medical costs associated with treatment regimens, complications and patient management were accounted in 2005 values based on Swiss-specific unit costs. Time horizon was set to lifetime (35 years). Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 2.5% annually in line with Swiss recommendations. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Addition of pioglitazone was associated with a reduced incidence of most diabetes-related complications, improved life expectancy (0.258 years) and improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.180 QALYs) compared with placebo. Pioglitazone treatment increased direct costs by CHF 10,914 per patient over a lifetime horizon. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pioglitazone versus placebo was CHF 42,274 per life-year gained and CHF 60,596 per QALY gained. ICERs were sensitive to variation in time horizon and duration of pioglitazone treatment effects. With a willingness to pay of CHF 80,000 per QALY in the Swiss setting, there was a 62.5% chance that pioglitazone would be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of pioglitazone to existing therapy was projected to reduce the long-term cumulative incidence of most diabetes complications and improve quality-adjusted life expectancy. Evaluation of incremental direct medical costs associated with these clinical benefits indicated that pioglitazone is likely to be a cost-effective treatment option in the Swiss setting over patient lifetimes.",2009-01-05081,19330561,Swiss Med Wkly,Michael Brändle,2009,139 / 11-12,173-84,No,19330561,"Michael Brändle; G Goodall; K M Erny-Albrecht; E Erdmann; W J Valentine; Cost-effectiveness of pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease in a Swiss setting, Swiss Med Wkly, 2009-Mar-21; 139(11-12):1424-7860; 173-84",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pioglitazone treatment vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,2.50,2.50,60596,Switzerland,2005,64558.02
5887,Cost-effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of major depression: a health economics analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a novel antidepressant therapy shown to be effective and safe in pharmacotherapy-resistant major depression. The incremental cost-effectiveness and the direct cost burden compared with sham treatment were estimated, and compared with the current standard of care. METHODS: Healthcare resource utilization data were collected during a multicenter study (n=301) and a decision analysis was used to stratify the 9-week treatment outcomes. A Markov model with an acute-outcome severity-based risk of relapse was used to estimate the illness course over a full year of treatment follow-up. These model estimates were also compared to best estimates of outcomes and costs of pharmacotherapy treatment, using the published STAR(*)D outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of TMS was described using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and on a direct cost per patient basis across a varying range of assumptions. The model's sensitivities to costs due to losses in work productivity and to caregiver time were also examined. RESULTS: Compared with sham treatment and at a cost of US$300 per treatment session, TMS provides an ICER of US$34,999 per QALY, which is less than the ""willingness-to-pay' standard of US$50,000 per QALY for a new treatment for major depression. When productivity gains due to clinical recovery were included, the ICER was reduced to US$6667 per QALY. In open-label conditions, TMS provided a net cost saving of US$1123 per QALY when compared with the current standard of care. In the openlabel condition, cost savings increased further when the costs for productivity losses were included in the model (net savings of US$7621). The overall cost benefits of treating MD using TMS were greater in those patients at the earliest levels of treatment resistance in the overall sample. CONCLUSION: TMS is a cost-effective treatment for patients who have failed to receive sufficient benefit from initial antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

5889,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ED decision making in patients with non-high-risk heart failure,"BACKGROUND: The ED disposition of patients with non-high-risk acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is challenging. To help address this problem, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of different ED disposition strategies. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model evaluating the cost-effectiveness of 3 possible ED ADHF disposition strategies in a 60-year-old man: (1) discharge home from the ED; (2) observation unit (OU) admission; (3) inpatient admission. Base case patients had no high-risk features. We used Medicare costs and the national physician fee schedule to capture ED, OU, and hospital costs, including costs of complications and death. All analyses were conducted using Decision Maker software (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ). RESULTS: Compared to ED discharge, OU admission had a reasonable marginal cost-effectiveness ratio ($44 249/quality adjusted life year), whereas hospital admission had an unacceptably high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio ($684 101/quality adjusted life year). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that as the risk of early (within 5 days) and late (within 30 days) readmission exceeded 36% and 74%, respectively, in those discharged from the ED, OU admission became less costly and more effective than ED discharge. Similarly, an increase in relative risk of both early and late death in those discharged from the ED improves the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of OU admission. Finally, as postdischarge event rates increase in those discharged from the OU, hospital admission became more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Observation unit admission for patients with non-high-risk ADHF has a societally acceptable marginal cost-effectiveness ratio compared to ED discharge.

5891,Using thrombophilia testing to determine anticoagulation duration in pediatric thrombosis is not cost-effective,"OBJECTIVE: To address the cost-effectiveness of thrombophilia testing and treatment strategies among children with a first episode of thrombosis. STUDY DESIGN: A 2-year Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of 3 strategies: (1) no testing, anticoagulate for 3 months, (2) no testing, anticoagulate for 6 months, and (3) testing, anticoagulate 3 or 6 months, based on results. We performed a literature search to estimate clinical probabilities and obtained quality-of-life and cost data from published sources. RESULTS: Total costs per patient were $7900 for no test, treat for 3 months; $8900 for test, treat based on results; and $12,100 for no test, treat for 6 months. Three months of treatment without testing was the least expensive strategy and also the most effective (1.74 quality-adjusted life-years) by 0.01 to 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years. Cost-utility ratios were sensitive to variation in hospitalization and medication costs, but 3 months, no testing, always remained the preferred choice.

5893,Cost-effectiveness of lay responder defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by lay responders (CPR+AED) versus CPR only for cardiac arrest during a multicenter randomized trial. METHODS: This was a prospective trial from July 2000 to September 2003 that randomly assigned 993 community units (eg, office buildings, public areas) in 24 sites to an emergency response system, using lay volunteers trained in CPR only or CPR+AED. Cost and quality of life data were collected with effectiveness data. The primary analysis evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness of defibrillator use in public locations by using Markov modeling. RESULTS: CPR only had 14 survivors to discharge and CPR+AED had 29. CPR only had a mean of 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.88) quality-adjusted life-years and a mean $42,400 (95% CI $22,100 to $62,600) costs. CPR+AED had mean 1.14 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.83) quality-adjusted life-years, mean $68,400 (95% CI $28,300 to $108,400) costs, and a long-term cost of mean $46,700 (95% CI $23,100 to $68,600) per quality-adjusted life-year.

5894,Cost-effectiveness of implementing low-tidal volume ventilation in patients with acute lung injury,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread guidelines recommending the use of lung-protective ventilation (LPV) in patients with acute lung injury (ALI), many patients do not receive this lifesaving therapy. We sought to estimate the incremental clinical and economic outcomes associated with LPV and determined the maximum cost of a hypothetical intervention to improve adherence with LPV that remained cost-effective. METHODS: Adopting a societal perspective, we developed a theoretical decision model to determine the cost-effectiveness of LPV compared to non-LPV care. Model inputs were derived from the literature and a large population-based cohort of patients with ALI. Cost-effectiveness was determined as the cost per life saved and the cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Application of LPV resulted in an increase in QALYs gained by 15% (4.21 years for non-LPV vs 4.83 years for LPV), and an increase in lifetime costs of $7,233 per patient with ALI ($99,588 for non-LPV vs $106,821 for LPV). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for LPV were $22,566 per life saved at hospital discharge and $11,690 per QALY gained. The maximum, cost-effective, per patient investment in a hypothetical program to improve LPV adherence from 50 to 90% was $9,482. Results were robust to a wide range of economic and patient parameter assumptions.

5895,The cost-effectiveness of implementing a new guideline for cardiovascular risk management in primary care in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: A new Dutch guideline for cardiovascular disease management substantially extends the number of individuals for whom treatment with statins and/or antihypertensive agents is recommended. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of implementing the new guideline at the national level. METHODS: First, the number of currently untreated individuals who would become eligible for cholesterol-lowering or antihypertensive treatment under the new guideline was estimated using data from a recent population study. Cost-effectiveness of treating this group of patients was then assessed using a mathematical model. RESULTS: Implementing the guideline in the age category 30-69 years would lead to an additional 465,000 individuals requiring treatment. Over a period of 20 years, the cumulative incidence of acute myocardial infarction in the whole population would drop by 3.0%, that of stroke by 3.9%, and all-cause mortality would drop by 0.9%. The lifetime cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to be 15,000 Euro per quality-adjusted life year gained. In the age categories 70-79 years and 80 years or above, an additional 600,000 and 450,000 persons, respectively, would need to be treated, resulting in corresponding reductions in cumulative incidences of 14 and 18% (acute myocardial infarction), 17 and 22% (stroke), and 1.2 and 0.6% (all-cause mortality) with cost-effectiveness ratios of 20,800 and 32,300 Euro, respectively, per quality-adjusted life year.

In the age categories 70-79 years and 80 years or above, an additional 600,000 and 450,000 persons, respectively, would need to be treated, resulting in corresponding reductions in cumulative incidences of 14 and 18% (acute myocardial infarction), 17 and 22% (stroke), and 1.2 and 0.6% (all-cause mortality) with cost-effectiveness ratios of 20,800 and 32,300 Euro, respectively, per quality-adjusted life year.

5898,The cost-effectiveness of implementing a new guideline for cardiovascular risk management in primary care in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: A new Dutch guideline for cardiovascular disease management substantially extends the number of individuals for whom treatment with statins and/or antihypertensive agents is recommended. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of implementing the new guideline at the national level. METHODS: First, the number of currently untreated individuals who would become eligible for cholesterol-lowering or antihypertensive treatment under the new guideline was estimated using data from a recent population study. Cost-effectiveness of treating this group of patients was then assessed using a mathematical model. RESULTS: Implementing the guideline in the age category 30-69 years would lead to an additional 465,000 individuals requiring treatment.
