4001,The cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women based on individual long-term fracture risks,"OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analyses are routinely based on data from group averages, restricting its generalizibility to those with below- or above-average risk. A pharmaco-economic model that used individualized risks for fractures was developed in order to take into account patient heterogeneity. METHODS: Data were obtained from The Health Improvement Network research database of general practitioners, comprising a UK general population of women aged more than 50 years (N = 330,000). Mortality and hip, vertebral, and other osteoporotic fracture risks for each individual were estimated by age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and other clinical risk factors. Estimates on costs, EuroQol (EQ-5D) utilities, and treatment efficacy were obtained from a UK national report (the National Institute for Clinical Excellence) and outcomes were simulated over a 10-year period. RESULTS: It was found that the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was lower in elderly women and in women with fracture history. There was a large variability in the cost-effectiveness with baseline fracture risk and with clinical risk factors. Patients with low BMI (<20) had considerable better cost-effectiveness than patients with high BMI (>or=26). Using a cost-acceptability ratio of 30k pounds per QALY gained, bisphosphonate treatment became cost-effective for patients with a 5-year risk of 9.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0-10.5%) for osteoporotic fractures and of 2.1% (95% CI 1.5-2.7%) for hip fractures. Including bone mineral density in the risk assessment, the cost per QALY gained was 35k pounds in women at age 60 with a fracture history and a T-score of -2.5 (at age 80, this was 3k pounds).

Estimates on costs, EuroQol (EQ-5D) utilities, and treatment efficacy were obtained from a UK national report (the National Institute for Clinical Excellence) and outcomes were simulated over a 10-year period. RESULTS: It was found that the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was lower in elderly women and in women with fracture history. There was a large variability in the cost-effectiveness with baseline fracture risk and with clinical risk factors. Patients with low BMI (<20) had considerable better cost-effectiveness than patients with high BMI (>or=26). Using a cost-acceptability ratio of 30k pounds per QALY gained, bisphosphonate treatment became cost-effective for patients with a 5-year risk of 9.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0-10.5%) for osteoporotic fractures and of 2.1% (95% CI 1.5-2.7%) for hip fractures. Including bone mineral density in the risk assessment, the cost per QALY gained was 35k pounds in women at age 60 with a fracture history and a T-score of -2.5 (at age 80, this was 3k pounds).

4019,Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injections of insulin: economic comparison in adult and adolescent type 1 diabetes mellitus in Australia,"BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analyses in the published medical literature have found improved glycaemic control with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin for patients with diabetes mellitus. In Australia, CSII is predominantly used in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patient populations. OBJECTIVE/INTERVENTION: To project long-term costs and outcomes of CSII (Novorapid or Humalog) compared with MDI (NPH insulin plus Novorapid or Humalog) in adult and adolescent T1DM patients in Australia. METHODS: The study was a modelling analysis utilising a lifetime horizon in adult and adolescent specialty care T1DM patient populations from Australia. Published Australian diabetes complication costs (adjusted to Australian dollars [$A], year 2006 values), treatment costs and discount rates of 5.0% per annum were applied to costs and clinical outcomes. A lifetime horizon was taken, considering only direct medical costs and excluding indirect and non-medical costs. The validated CORE diabetes model employs standard Markov/Monte Carlo simulation techniques. It was used to simulate diabetes progression in Australian adult (mean age 43 years, duration of diabetes 17 years, mean glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)] 8.2%) and adolescent (mean age 17 years, duration of diabetes 6 years, mean HbA(1c) 8.9%) patients with baseline characteristics taken predominantly from Australian National Diabetes Information Audit and Benchmarking (ANDIAB) in Australia. The main outcome measures were incremental costs and effectiveness of CSII compared with MDI in Australian adult and adolescent patients with T1DM. RESULTS: Mean direct lifetime costs were $A34,642 higher with CSII treatment than with MDI for adult patients and $A41,779 higher for adolescent patients. Treatment with CSII was associated with an improvement in life expectancy of 0.393 years for adults compared with MDI and 0.537 years for adolescents. The corresponding gains in QALYs were 0.467 QALYs and 0.560 QALYs for adults and adolescents, respectively. This produced incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $A88,220 and $A77,851 per life-year gained for CSII compared with MDI for adult and adolescent T1DM patients, respectively, in Australia. These data also produced corresponding ICERs of $A74,147 per QALY and $A74,661/QALY for adult and adolescent T1DM patients, respectively. Sensitivity analyses suggested that our base-case assumptions were mostly robust with improvements in ICERs for reduction in hypoglycaemic events with CSII treatment and worse ICERs for lower HbA(1c) changes associated with CSII treatment compared with MDI.

4021,Cost effectiveness of pegaptanib for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the primary cause of vision loss in the elderly and results in significant economic and humanistic burden. The selective vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, pegaptanib (Macugen) is indicated for patients with neovascular AMD. Guidance is needed regarding the cost effectiveness of treatment, any variation between sub-populations of differing clinical characteristics and the optimum duration of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of pegaptanib versus best supportive care (BSC) for AMD from the perspective of the UK government, and to evaluate the impact of patient characteristics and differing treatment discontinuation scenarios. METHODS: A cohort of 1000 patients aged >45 years with a best-corrected visual acuity (VA) in their better-seeing eye of < or =6/12 was modelled. Patients were either treated with pegaptanib (0.3mg every 6 weeks for a maximum of 2 years in their better-seeing eye only) or received BSC (no active treatment). Supportive services were provided for patients with a VA < or =6/60. A 10-year Markov model composed of 12 VA states (defined by individual Snellen lines) and a dead state was constructed. The model reported herein was used to support submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC). NICE guidance is expected to be available in October 2007 and the SMC advice was issued on 7 July 2006. SMC accepted pegaptanib for use in patients with visual acuity between 6/12 and 6/60 (inclusive) and should be stopped if visual acuity falls below 6/60 during treatment or where severe visual loss is experienced. Time-dependent transition probabilities for the loss and gain of Snellen lines were derived from parametric survival curves fitted to patient-level data from the VISION trials. Survival curves were fitted with treatment and baseline Snellen scores as covariates; additional curves were fitted with the addition of age, gender, lesion type or lesion size as covariates. Mortality rates were adjusted for the age, gender and VA of the population. Cost effectiveness was expressed as the incremental cost (IC) per vision-year saved and IC/QALY. Uncertainty was explored by probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analysis. Costs (year 2005 values) and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per anum. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, treatment was targeted to patients with a VA of 6/12 to 6/95 and discontinued after 2 years, or earlier if VA fell below 6/95 or by > or =6 lines. The IC/QALY was estimated as 8023 pounds(upper 95% CI 20,641 pounds). Cost effectiveness varied by age (age <75 years = 2033 pounds/QALY; age > or =75 years = 11,657 pounds/QALY) and by pre-treatment VA (6/12-6/95 = 8023 pounds/QALY; 6/12-6/60 = 6664 pounds/QALY; 6/12-6/24 = 1920 pounds/QALY). Gender and lesion type or size had little effect. Cost effectiveness was not sensitive to precise rules for treatment discontinuation, but was maximised if treatment was discontinued in patients no longer likely to benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that pegaptanib treatment is likely to be cost effective across all groups studied, and marginally more cost effective in younger patients and those with better pre-treatment VA. Cost effectiveness appears to be optimised if treatment is discontinued after 1 year if individual patients' VA has dropped by > or =6 lines from pre-treatment levels, or at any time if it drops below 6/95. However, strict application of discontinuation rules does not appear to be necessary for pegaptanib to be cost effective. Clinical judgement and patient preference should be an important determinant in decisions about stopping treatment.",2007-01-03074,17887807,Pharmacoeconomics,Sorrel E Wolowacz,2007,25 / 10,863-79,Yes,17887807,"Sorrel E Wolowacz; Neil Roskell; Steven Kelly; Fiona M Maciver; Chris S Brand; Cost effectiveness of pegaptanib for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2007; 25(10):1179-2027; 863-79",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pegatanib vs. Best supportive care (BSC),Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,8023,United Kingdom,2005,19354.3
4022,A comparison of the cost effectiveness of pharmacotherapy or surgery (laparoscopic fundoplication) in the treatment of GORD,"BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) causes some of the most frequently seen symptoms in both primary and secondary care. An estimated 4-5 patients (age range 18-60 years) per 10,000 (0.045% of the general population) are receiving maintenance proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for oesophagitis and reflux. The treatment of reflux disease represents significant prescription drug costs to the UK NHS. An alternative to lifelong pharmacotherapy is surgical treatment of reflux using the laparoscopic fundoplication technique to effect a cure. A multicentre study (REFLUX trial) comparing laparoscopic fundoplication with medical management (PPIs) among patients with GORD is currently underway in the UK. This study includes data collection to contribute to a cost-effectiveness analysis. OBJECTIVE: To generate some preliminary estimates of the cost effectiveness of surgical and medical management of GORD to guide UK NHS decision making before the REFLUX trial reports. METHODS: A Markov model was developed in Excel. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to assess the uncertainty associated with the point estimates. Two strategies were compared: long-term medical management or immediate laparoscopic surgery for GORD. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of QALYs with a lifetime time horizon (30 years) for a patient aged 45 years at commencement of treatment. Costs (pound, 2004 values) of drugs and costs associated with surgery were obtained from five of the REFLUX study centres. Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3.5% per anum. Value of information analysis was used to quantify the cost of uncertainty associated with the decision about which therapy to adopt, indicating the maximum value of future research. RESULTS: Treatment with laparoscopic fundoplication is the most costly strategy but is also associated with more QALYs. The incremental cost per additional QALY for surgery versus medical management was 180 pounds. However, the cost effectiveness of surgery was uncertain, and the probability that it is cost effective at the threshold of 30,000 pounds per QALY was 0.639. Value of information analysis suggests that further research in this area could be potentially worthwhile. Specifically, this research should focus on the health-related quality of life of patients on medical management or post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model suggest that, on the basis of current evidence, laparoscopic fundoplication represents a cost effective means of treating GORD rather than lifelong medical management.",2007-01-03075,17887805,Pharmacoeconomics,Laura Bojke,2007,25 / 10,829-41,Yes,17887805,"Laura Bojke; Edward Hornby; Mark Sculpher; A comparison of the cost effectiveness of pharmacotherapy or surgery (laparoscopic fundoplication) in the treatment of GORD, Pharmacoeconomics, 2007; 25(10):1179-2027; 829-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic Surgery vs. Medical management with proton-pump inhibitors,Not Stated,60 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,180,United Kingdom,2004,452.05
4023,The cost-effectiveness of the management of acute sinusitis,"BACKGROUND: Sinusitis is a common medical disease with a tremendous economic impact on health care. Our objective was to determine the most cost-effective strategy for the management of acute sinusitis from the societal and payers' perspectives. METHODS: A Markov disease simulation model was used for comparing four treatment strategies: (1) no antibiotic (Abx), (2) empiric Abx, (3) CT-based Abx, and (4) clinical guideline-based Abx. RESULTS: Empiric Abx treatment was the most cost-effective from the societal perspective. Clinical guideline-based treatment was the most cost-effective strategy from the payers' perspective ($38,515/quality-adjusted life year). Cost and effectiveness of Abx, time lost from work, and prevalence of acute bacterial sinusitis are influential variables.

4026,Potential risks and benefits of HIV treatment simplification: a simulation model of a proposed clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: In recent studies, subjects who had achieved suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA level while receiving an initial 3-drug antiretroviral regimen successfully maintained suppression while receiving treatment with a ""boosted"" protease inhibitor (PI) alone. We projected the long-term outcomes of this treatment simplification strategy to inform the design of a proposed multicenter, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: We used published studies to estimate the efficacy, adverse effects, and cost of a sequence of HIV drug regimens for the simplification strategy, compared with those outcomes for the current standard-of-care (SOC) strategy. Using a published simulation model of HIV disease, we projected life expectancy, discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and discounted lifetime medical costs for each strategy. RESULTS: Subjects who have not developed PI-resistant HIV infection at the time of failure of the simplification regimen have a greater life expectancy (27.9 vs. 27.1 years) and QALE (14.9 vs. 14.7 years), compared with SOC subjects, because they receive an additional line of therapy without negative consequences for future treatment options. The QALE for the simplification strategy remains higher than that for the SOC, unless a large proportion of patients experiencing virologic failure while receiving the simplification regimen develop PI resistance. Depending on the probability of simplification regimen failure, the advantage is maintained even if HIV develops PI resistance in 42%-70% of subjects. Projected lifetime costs are $26,500-$72,400 per person lower for the simplification strategy than for the SOC strategy. CONCLUSIONS: An HIV treatment simplification strategy involving use of a boosted PI alone may lead to longer survival overall at lower cost, compared with the SOC combination therapy, because the simplification strategy potentially adds an additional line of therapy.

METHODS: Using stochastic simulation, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of PGB 150-600 mg/d vs. GBP 900-3600 mg/d in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients. The model used data from three randomized controlled clinical trials. Pain was evaluated using a 0-10 scale. Mean baseline pain was 6.9 in both treatment groups. The model assigned untreated pain scores over 84 days. Treated scores were calculated using weekly changes in pain scores from trials. Outcomes included the numbers of days with no or mild pain (score < 4), days with >or= 30% and >or= 50% reductions in pain intensity, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and estimated health costs. RESULTS: Compared with GBP, PGB yielded an estimated mean of 8 (standard error, 0.4) additional days with no or mild pain, 6 (0.4) days with >or= 30% reduction in pain intensity, 9 (0.5) days with >or= 50% reduction in pain intensity, and a gain of 0.1186 (0.0002) QALYs for 12 weeks. The estimated total health costs of therapies were euro 1049 (euro 35) for PGB and euro 951 (euro 38) for GBP, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PGB versus GBP were a mean of euro 12 (95% confidence interval, euro 1-24) per additional day with no or mild pain, euro 431 (dominant-euro 876) per additional patient with no or mild pain, and euro 20 535 (euro 1607-40 345) per QALY gained.

4029,Economic impact of Tibolone compared with Continuous-Combined Hormone Replacement Therapy in the management of climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women,"BACKGROUND: Deciding whether to treat postmenopausal women suffering from climacteric symptoms with Continuous Combined Hormone Replacement Therapy (CCHRT) has become increasingly difficult after the release of the Women's Health Initiative results. As a result, development of alternatives to CCHRT is required. Tibolone, which is a synthetic steroid that has estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties, is reported to be a promising alternative. It has been used in Europe, in the same indication as CCHRT, for approximately 20 years but is not yet available in Canada. OBJECTIVE: We carried out a cost-utility analysis comparing a 3-year-treatment course with Tibolone 2.5mg and conjugated equine estrogens (CEE)/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (0.625 mg/2.5 mg) in the management of postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms. METHODS: A Markov model, considering persistence, vaginal bleeding and climacteric symptoms, was elaborated to compare the different options in terms of cost and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), according to a public third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: Compared with CEE/MPA, Tibolone led to an increase in cost (dollars 485 for Tibolone versus dollars 232 for CEE/MPA) and a slight increase in QALYs (2.08 for Tibolone versus 2.05 for CEE/MPA). Consequently, the incremental cost per QALY gained ratio was dollars 9198. CONCLUSION: According to the results, Tibolone seems to be a cost-effective alternative to CEE/MPA. However, those results should be interpreted with caution insofar as the difference in terms of QALY is clinically difficult to value and taking into account the limited data on Tibolone's long-term innocuity.",2007-01-03085,17870259,Maturitas,Vakaramoko Diaby,2007,58 / 2,138-49,No,17870259,"Vakaramoko Diaby; Sylvie Perreault; Jean Lachaine; Economic impact of Tibolone compared with Continuous-Combined Hormone Replacement Therapy in the management of climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women, Maturitas, 2007-Oct-20; 58(2):0378-5122; 138-49",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tibolone 2.5mg vs. Continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,9198,United States,2005,12189.16
4030,Cost-effectiveness of clinical interventions for AIDS wasting,"Economic studies of HIV/AIDS interventions are important for providing cost-effective care. This paper presents a costeffectiveness study of a three-arm clinical trial conducted at Tufts University School of Medicine/New England Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts that treated 50 patients with AIDS wasting from March 1998 through January 2001. This study compared the costs and impacts of a nutritional counseling intervention alone (NC arm), the nutrition intervention with oxandrolone (OX arm), and the nutrition intervention with progressive resistance training (PRTarm) for the treatment of AIDS wasting. The cost of each intervention was derived for both the three-month clinical trial and a six-month estimated community model (ECM), its projected adaptation to community-based medical care. The cost determination involved obtaining and multiplying unit economic costs and quantities expended of each resource within each study arm. The ECM average cost per client in the cost-effectiveness analysis incorporated both institutional and societal perspectives. The costeffectiveness analysis compared the cost of each intervention to its quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain (Zeckhauser and Shepard, 1976). From a societal perspective, for the NC arm, the cost per client totaled US dollars 983 for the actual and US dollars 596 under the ECM. For the OX arm, the cost per client totaled US dollars 3,772 for the actual study and US dollars 3,385 under the ECM. For the PRT arm, the cost per client totaled US dollars 3,189 for the actual study and US dollars 2,987 under the ECM. Under the societal perspective the cost per QALY was US dollars 55,000 (range: US dollars 51,000 to US dollars 83,000) for the NC arm, US dollars 151,000 (range: US dollars 149,000 to US dollars 171,000) for the OX arm, and US dollars 65,000 (range: US dollars 44,000 to US dollars 104,000) for the PRTarm. When using only an institutional perspective, the cost per QALY was US dollars 45,000 (range: US dollars 42,000-US dollars 64,000) for the NC arm, US dollars 147,000 (range: US dollars 147,000 to US dollars 163,000) for the OX arm, and US dollars 31,000 (US dollars 21,000 to US dollars 44,000) for the PRTarm. This paper shows that cost and cost-effectiveness analyses can be adapted to a community setting by combining information from community practice and costs with data from a randomized trial. Compared to other AIDS treatments, such as highly active antiretroviral therapies, all three interventions were affordable, but their cost-effectiveness was intermediate.

4033,Cost-effectiveness of diabetes case management for low-income populations,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Project Dulce, a culturally specific diabetes case management and self-management training program, in four cohorts defined by insurance status. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Clinical and cost data on 3,893 persons with diabetes participating in Project Dulce were used as inputs into a diabetes simulation model. STUDY DESIGN: The Center for Outcomes Research Diabetes Model, a published, peer-reviewed and validated simulation model of diabetes, was used to evaluate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY), cumulative incidence of complications and direct medical costs over patient lifetimes (40-year time horizon) from a third-party payer perspective.

4037,Detection of distant metastases in patients with oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer: a diagnostic decision analysis,"Computed tomography (CT) is presently a standard procedure for the detection of distant metastases in patients with oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer. We aimed to determine the additional diagnostic value of alternative staging investigations. We included 569 oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer patients who had undergone CT neck/thorax/abdomen, ultrasound (US) abdomen, US neck, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and/or chest X-ray for staging. Sensitivity and specificity were first determined at an organ level (results of investigations, i.e., CT, US abdomen, US neck, EUS, and chest X-ray, per organ), and then at a patient level (results for combinations of investigations), considering that the detection of distant metastases is a contraindication to surgery. For this, we compared three strategies for each organ: CT alone, CT plus another investigation if CT was negative for metastases (one-positive scenario), and CT plus another investigation if CT was positive, but requiring that both were positive for a final positive result (two-positive scenario). In addition, costs, life expectancy and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared between different diagnostic strategies. CT showed sensitivities for detecting metastases in celiac lymph nodes, liver and lung of 69, 73, and 90%, respectively, which was higher than the sensitivities of US abdomen (44% for celiac lymph nodes and 65% for liver metastases), EUS (38% for celiac lymph nodes), and chest X-ray (68% for lung metastases). In contrast, US neck showed a higher sensitivity for the detection of malignant supraclavicular lymph nodes than CT (85 vs 28%). At a patient level, sensitivity for detecting distant metastases was 66% and specificity was 95% if only CT was performed. A higher sensitivity (86%) was achieved when US neck was added to CT (one-positive scenario), at the same specificity (95%). This strategy resulted in lower costs compared to CT only, at an almost similar (quality adjusted) life expectancy. Slightly higher specificities (97-99%) were achieved if liver and/or lung metastases found on CT, were confirmed by US abdomen or chest X-ray, respectively (two-positive scenario). These strategies had only slightly higher QALYs, but substantially higher costs. The combination of CT neck/thorax/abdomen and US neck was most cost-effective for the detection of metastases in patients with oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer, whereas the performance of CT only had a lower sensitivity for metastases detection and higher costs.

4041,Erythromycin prior to endoscopy for acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Erythromycin is a potent stimulator of gastrointestinal motility. Recent studies have examined the use of intravenous erythromycin to clear the stomach of blood before oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (UGIH). These studies have shown clinical effectiveness. AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. METHODS: We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of erythromycin before EGD from the payer's perspective. We found three relevant studies of erythromycin and used these data for the analysis. We obtained costs for intravenous erythromycin and charges for peptic ulcer hospitalization, EGD, surgery, and angiographic embolization. Complication rates were also incorporated from the literature. We implemented a model of health-related quality of life to measure the impact of the intervention. We created a decision-analysis tree and performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A strategy of erythromycin prior to EGD resulted in a cost-effective outcome in a majority of trials using willingness-to-pay figures of USD 0, USD 50,000 and USD 100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

4042,Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using magnification chromoendoscopy and pepsinogen serum levels for the follow-up of patients with atrophic chronic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia,"BACKGROUND: The follow-up of patients with atrophic chronic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia may lead to early diagnosis of gastric cancer. However, to-date no cost-effective model has been proposed. Improved endoscopic examination using magnification chromoendoscopy together with non-invasive functional assessment with pepsinogen serum levels are accurate in the diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia (extension) and minute dysplastic lesions. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a follow-up model for patients with atrophic chronic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia based on gastric mucosal status using magnification chromoendoscopy and pepsinogen. METHODS: A cohort of patients with lesions as severe as atrophic chronic gastritis were followed-up according to a standardized protocol using magnification chromoendoscopy with methylene blue and measurement of serum pepsinogen I and II levels. A single node decision tree and Markov chain modeling were used to define cost-effectiveness of this follow-up model versus its absence. Transition rates were considered time-independent and calculated using primary data following cohort data analysis. Costs, quality of life and survival were estimated based on published data and extensive sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were successfully followed-up over 3 years. Seven cases of dysplasia were diagnosed during follow-up, all among patients with incomplete intestinal metaplasia at baseline, six of whom had extensive (pepsinogen I to II ratio <3) incomplete intestinal metaplasia. For those individuals with atrophic chronic gastritis or complete intestinal metaplasia, a yearly measurement of pepsinogen levels or an endoscopic examination on a 3-yearly basis would cost 455 euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain. Endoscopic examination and pepsinogen serum level measurement on a yearly basis would cost 1868 euros per QALY for patients with extensive intestinal metaplasia.

4044,Cost-effectiveness of a lidocaine 5% medicated plaster relative to gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of elderly patients develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) after herpes zoster infection (shingles). A lidocaine 5% medicated plaster marketed in the United Kingdom in January 2007 has been shown to be an effective topical treatment for PHN with minimal risk of systemic adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: This paper assessed the cost-effectiveness of using a lidocaine plaster in place of gabapentin in English primary care practice to treat those PHN patients who had insufficient pain relief with standard analgesics and could not tolerate or had contraindications to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The analysis took the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: The costs and benefits of gabapentin and the lidocaine plaster were calculated over a 6-month time horizon using a Markov model. The model structure allowed for differences in costs, utilities, and transition probabilities between the initial 30-day run-in period and maintenance therapy and also accounted for add-in medications and drugs received by patients who discontinued therapy. Most transition probabilities were based on non-head-to-head clinical trials identified through a systematic review. Data on resource utilization, discontinuation rates, and add-in or switch medications were obtained from a Delphi panel; cost data were from official price tariffs. Published utilities were adjusted for age and were supplemented and validated by the Delphi panel. RESULTS: Six months of therapy with the lidocaine plaster cost pound 549 per patient, compared with pound 718 for gabapentin, and generated 0.05 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The lidocaine plaster therefore dominated gabapentin (95% CI, dominant- pound 2163/QALY gained). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there was a 90.15% chance that the lidocaine plaster was both less costly and more effective than gabapentin and a 99.99% chance that it cost < pound 20,000/QALY relative to gabapentin. Extensive deterministic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the conclusions. CONCLUSION: This study found that the lidocaine 5% medicated plaster was a cost-effective alternative to gabapentin for PHN patients who were intolerant to TCAs and in whom analgesics were ineffective, from the perspective of the NHS.",2007-01-03102,17825701,Clin Ther,Helen Dakin,2007,29 / 7,1491-507,Yes,17825701,"Helen Dakin; Mark Nuijten; Hiltrud Liedgens; Barbara Poulsen Nautrup; Cost-effectiveness of a lidocaine 5% medicated plaster relative to gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia in the United Kingdom, Clin Ther, 2007-Jul; 29(7):1879-114X; 1491-507",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,5% Lidocaine plaster vs. Gabapentin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-3366.53,United Kingdom,2006,-7966.86
4045,Cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonate therapies for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: implications of improved persistence with less frequently administered oral bisphosphonates,"OBJECTIVE: Studies have shown that weekly bisphosphonate dosing results in improved persistence compared to daily dosing among patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, yet more than 50% of patients discontinue therapy within a year. An oral, less frequent administration bisphosphonate provides an opportunity to improve persistence, a parameter not well modeled in previous cost-effectiveness analyses of osteoporosis therapies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the effect of improved persistence on the cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates among postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis (vertebral fracture and bone mineral density T-score <or= -2.5) and an average age of 78 years. Fracture risks, clinical efficacy, mortality, resource use, costs, and utilities were obtained from the published literature. Persistence rates were derived primarily from a published clinical trial. Approximately 50% greater persistence with a monthly versus a weekly therapy was assumed on the basis of the PERSIST study, a 6-month, randomized, head-to-head prospective study that investigated treatment persistence in postmenopausal osteoporotic women on monthly versus weekly bisphosphonate therapy. Persistence was extrapolated to a maximum of 5 years. Following discontinuation, treatment benefit declined linearly and proportionally to the duration of active treatment. RESULTS: Based on model estimates, more fractures were avoided (versus no treatment) with monthly bisphosphonate (58.1 per 1000 treated women) than with weekly bisphosphonates (33.8 per 1000 treated women), resulting in lower fracture care costs per woman ($7317 and $7548, respectively). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was lower with a monthly bisphosphonate ($13,749) than with weekly bisphosphonates ($16,657) when compared to no treatment. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of a monthly bisphosphonate was $9476 when compared to a weekly bisphosphonate. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, improvement in persistence with a less frequently administered oral bisphosphonate therapy could augment the fracture benefit and thereby improve cost-effectiveness.

4048,Cost-effectiveness of activated protein C in real-life clinical practice,"BACKGROUND: Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) has been reported to be cost-effective in severely ill septic patients in studies using data from a pivotal randomized trial. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of rhAPC in patients with severe sepsis and multiple organ failure in real-life intensive care practice. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study involving adult patients recruited before and after licensure of rhAPC in France. Inclusion criteria were applied according to the label approved in Europe. The expected recruitment bias was controlled by building a sample of patients matched for propensity score. Complete hospitalization costs were quantified using a regression equation involving intensive care units variables. rhAPC acquisition costs were added, assuming that all costs associated with rhAPC were already included in the equation. Cost comparisons were conducted using the nonparametric bootstrap method. Cost-effectiveness quadrants and acceptability curves were used to assess uncertainty of the cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: In the initial cohort (n = 1096), post-license patients were younger, had less co-morbid conditions and had failure of more organs than did pre-license patients (for all: P < 0.0001). In the matched sample (n = 840) the mean age was 62.4 +/- 14.9 years, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 56.7 +/- 18.5, and the number of organ failures was 3.20 +/- 0.83. When rhAPC was used, 28-day mortality tended to be reduced (34.1% post-license versus 37.4% pre-license, P = 0.34), bleeding events were more frequent (21.7% versus 13.6%, P = 0.002) and hospital costs were higher (47,870 euros versus 36,717 euros, P < 0.05). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios gained were as follows: 20,278 euros per life-year gained and 33,797 euros per quality-adjusted life-year gained. There was a 74.5% probability that rhAPC would be cost-effective if there were willingness to pay 50,000 euros per life-year gained. The probability was 64.3% if there were willingness to pay 50,000 euros per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSION: This study, conducted in matched patient populations, demonstrated that in real-life clinical practice the probability that rhAPC will be cost-effective if one is willing to pay 50,000 euros per life-year gained is 74.5%.",2007-01-03106,17822547,Crit Care,Jean-François Dhainaut,2007,11 / 5,R99,No,17822547,"Jean-François Dhainaut; Stéphanie Payet; Benoit Vallet; Lionel Riou França; Djillali Annane; Pierre-Edouard Bollaert; Yves Le Tulzo; Isabelle Runge; Yannick Malledant; Bertrand Guidet; Katell Le Lay; Robert Launois; Cost-effectiveness of activated protein C in real-life clinical practice, Crit Care, 2007; 11(5):1466-609X; R99",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) vs. Non-rhAPC,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,33797,Euro,2004,57595.07
4049,Pillbox organizers are associated with improved adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy and viral suppression: a marginal structural model analysis,"BACKGROUND: Pillbox organizers are inexpensive and easily used; however, their effect on adherence to antiretroviral medications is unknown. METHODS: Data were obtained from an observational cohort of 245 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects who were observed from 1996 through 2000 in San Francisco, California. Adherence was the primary outcome and was measured using unannounced monthly pill counts. Plasma HIV RNA level was considered as a secondary outcome. Marginal structural models were used to estimate the effect of pillbox organizer use on adherence and viral suppression, adjusting for confounding by CD4+ T cell count, viral load, prior adherence, recreational drug use, demographic characteristics, and current and past treatment. RESULTS: Pillbox organizer use was estimated to improve adherence by 4.1%-4.5% and was associated with a decrease in viral load of 0.34-0.37 log10 copies/mL and a 14.2%-15.7% higher probability of achieving a viral load < or = 400 copies/mL (odds ratio, 1.8-1.9). All effect estimates were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Pillbox organizers appear to significantly improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and to improve virologic suppression. We estimate that pillbox organizers may be associated with a cost of approximately $19,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the economic implications, from the Dutch healthcare perspective, of the use of clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI (elective procedures or in patients with acute coronary syndrome), comparing pre-treatment followed by long-term therapy with only 4 weeks of treatment. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was used to combine data from the PCI-CURE and CREDO trials with data from the literature concerning epidemiology, costs and quality of life. The model was run separately for each trial. Only direct healthcare costs (euro, year 2004 values) were considered. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4% per anum. For each trial, the cost effectiveness is expressed as costs per life-year and QALY gained. Uncertainties are addressed by uni- and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: When starting with the data from the PCI-CURE trial, pre-treatment plus 9-month clopidogrel therapy was predicted to save 1119 euros and gain 0.03 life-years and 0.07 QALYs per patient compared with short-term treatment. When starting with the data from the CREDO trial, the combination of pre-treatment and prolonged clopidogrel therapy (1 year) was estimated to save 497 euros and gain 0.10 life-years and 0.14 QALYs per patient. Univariate and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses suggested that the conclusions were generally robust, but that the expected gain in survival for the PCI-CURE population was very sensitive to the effects on mortality within the combined endpoint of myocardial infarction/stroke-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: In The Netherlands, pre-treatment plus long-term (9-12 months) therapy with clopidogrel is estimated to save costs and increase (quality-adjusted) survival in the prevention of ischaemic events among patients undergoing elective PCI (CREDO) and in patients with acute coronary syndrome (PCI-CURE) compared with short-term treatment with clopidogrel without pre-treatment.",2007-01-03110,17803335,Pharmacoeconomics,Bart M S Heeg,2007,25 / 9,769-82,Yes,17803335,"Bart M S Heeg; Ron J G Peters; Marc Botteman; Ben A van Hout; Long-term clopidogrel therapy in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention, Pharmacoeconomics, 2007; 25(9):1179-2027; 769-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clopidogrel pre-treatment followed by 9 months long-term therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin vs. Clopidogrel pre-treatment followed by 4 weeks short-term therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,-15985.71,Euro,2004,-27242.01

We conducted a retrospective, pre-post study which compared data for a cohort of veterans (n=370) before and after the introduction of the CCHT programme for two periods of 12 months. To assess the cost-effectiveness, we converted the patients' health-related quality of life data into Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) utility scores and used costs to construct incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The overall mean ICER for the programme at one-year was $60,941, a value within the commonly-cited range of cost-effectiveness of $50,000-100,000. The programme was cost-effective for one-third of the participants. Characteristics that contributed to cost-effectiveness were marital status, location and clinically relevant co-morbidities.

4053,A health economic evaluation of concomitant surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVE: Current drug treatment for atrial fibrillation is suboptimal and percutaneous catheter-based ablation techniques may be associated with complications. The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-assisted surgical ablation, (2) the classic 'cut and sew' maze procedure and (3) percutaneous ablation, all concomitant to cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG, valve repair) in comparison with non-interventional (drug) treatment. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict the cost-effectiveness of the interventional approaches. The model consisted of four disease states (sinus rhythm without complications, atrial fibrillation without complications, stroke and death), allowing for 3-monthly transitions between these states and using direct UK costs from the National Health Service perspective. Clinical input data are obtained from literature and cost input data from National Health Service sources and literature. Five-year total and incremental costs are calculated. Incremental effects are expressed in quality-adjusted-life-years-gained (QALYG). RESULTS: All interventional treatments show good incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in all atrial fibrillation types, compared to drug treatment. For classic maze the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to non-interventional atrial fibrillation treatment varies from 1343 to 3471 GBP/QALYG, for HIFU-assisted surgical ablation from 4005 to 7448 GBP/QALYG and for percutaneous ablation from 7041 to 17,372 GBP/QALYG depending on the atrial fibrillation type. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Performing a classic maze procedure or HIFU-assisted surgical ablation concomitant to a scheduled CABG or valve procedure is highly cost-effective.

4064,"Spinal cord stimulation versus reoperation for failed back surgery syndrome: a cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis based on a randomized, controlled trial","OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of treating failed back-surgery syndrome using spinal cord stimulation (SCS) versus reoperation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A disinterested third party collected charge data for the first 42 patients in a randomized controlled crossover trial. We computed the difference in cost with regard to success (cost-effectiveness) and mean quality-adjusted life years (cost-utility). We analyzed the patient-charge data with respect to intention to treat (costs and outcomes as a randomized group), treated as intended (costs as randomized; crossover failure assigned to a randomized group), and final treatment costs and outcomes. RESULTS: By our mean 3.1-year follow-up, 13 of 21 patients (62%) crossed to reoperation versus 5 of 19 patients (26%) who crossed to SCS (P < 0.025). The mean cost per success was US $117,901 for crossovers to SCS. No crossovers to reoperation achieved success despite a mean per-patient expenditure of US $260,584. The mean per-patient costs were US $31,530 for SCS versus US $38,160 for reoperation (intention to treat), US $48,357 for SCS versus US $105,928 for reoperation (treated as intended), and US $34,371 for SCS versus US $36,341 for reoperation (final treatment). SCS was dominant (more effective and less expensive) in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental cost-utility ratios. A bootstrapped simulation for incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years confirmed SCS's dominance, with approximately 72% of the cost results occurring below US policymakers' ""maximum willingness to pay"" threshold. CONCLUSION: SCS was less expensive and more effective than reoperation in selected failed back-surgery syndrome patients, and should be the initial therapy of choice. SCS is most cost-effective when patients forego repeat operation.

4065,Cost-effectiveness of childhood hepatitis A vaccination in Argentina: a second dose is warranted,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of childhood vaccination against hepatitis A in the five geographic regions of Argentina, and to determine whether adding a second dose to the current one-dose schedule would provide health gains justifying its added cost. METHODS: A Markov model was used to consider four immunization options for the 2005 birth cohort: (1) no vaccination; (2) vaccination at 12 months of age, (3) vaccinations at 12 and 72 months of age; or (4) vaccinations at 12 and 18 months of age. Hepatitis A costs and consequences were predicted over 50 years. The cost-effectiveness of first and second vaccine doses was assessed through a range of vaccine prices and assumptions regarding the duration of vaccine protection. Costs and health gains (measured in quality-adjusted life years) were adjusted to present values using a 3% annual discount rate. RESULTS: The one-dose vaccination policy is predicted to reduce each birth cohort member's 50-year probability of overt hepatitis A from 7.2% to 4.1%. A second dose would reduce the probability to between 2.0% and 2.2%. Vaccination at 12 months of age, at 12 and 72 months, or at 12 and 18 months would reduce cases among personal contacts by 82%, 87%, and 92%, respectively. The first vaccine dose would meet accepted standards of cost-effectiveness in each region, and reduce costs in the Northeast, Central, and South regions. Adding a second dose at age 18 months would be cost-effective in each region, and further reduce costs in the Cuyo region. If the duration of protection with one dose is less than anticipated, the second dose would be more cost-effective.

4068,Cost-effectiveness of psoriasis therapy with etanercept in Germany,"BACKGROUND: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of intermittent therapy with etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis in comparison to non-systemic therapy in Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using the endpoint costs per quality-adjusted life year gained (costs/QALY). For this purpose, we adapted a UK-based Markov model by means of resource use data that we derived from a German cost study. Efficacy data, information on frequency of adverse events and changes in quality of life were derived from three pooled clinical trials.

4071,The long-term benefits of genotypic resistance testing in patients with extensive prior antiretroviral therapy: a model-based approach,"OBJECTIVES: Resistance testing in HIV disease may provide long-term benefits that are not evident from short-term data. Our objectives were to estimate the long-term effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of genotype testing in patients with extensive antiretroviral exposure. METHODS: We used an HIV simulation model to estimate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of genotype testing. Clinical data incorporated into the model were from NARVAL, a randomized trial of resistance testing in patients with extensive antiretroviral exposure, and other randomized trials. Each simulated patient was eligible for up to three sequential regimens of antiretroviral therapy (i.e. two additional regimens beyond the trial-based regimen) using drugs not available at the time of the study, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir and enfuvirtide. RESULTS: In the long term, projected undiscounted life expectancy increased from 132.2 months with clinical judgement alone to 147.9 months with genotype testing. Median survival was estimated at 11.9 years in the resistance testing arm vs 10.4 years in the clinical judgement alone arm. Because of increased survival, the projected lifetime discounted cost of genotype testing was greater than for clinical judgement alone (euro313,900 vs euro263,100; US$399,000 vs US$334,400). Genotype testing cost euro69,600 (US$88,500) per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with clinical judgement alone. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with extensive prior antiretroviral exposure, genotype testing is likely to increase life expectancy in the long term as a result of the increased likelihood of receiving two active new drugs. Genotype testing is associated with cost-effectiveness comparable to that of strategies accepted in patients with advanced HIV disease, such as enfuvirtide use.",2007-01-03123,17760736,HIV Med,Y Yazdanpanah,2007,8 / 7,439-50,No,17760736,"Y Yazdanpanah; M Vray; J Meynard; E Losina; M C Weinstein; L Morand-Joubert; S J Goldie; H E Hsu; R P Walensky; C Dalban; P E Sax; P M Girard; K A Freedberg; The long-term benefits of genotypic resistance testing in patients with extensive prior antiretroviral therapy: a model-based approach, HIV Med, 2007-Oct; 8(7):1464-2662; 439-50",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genotype testing vs. Clincal judgement,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,69600,Euro,2006,112251.54
4072,Prospective comparative study on cost-effectiveness of subthalamic stimulation and best medical treatment in advanced Parkinson's disease,"This is an open, prospective, longitudinal study designed to compare two cohorts of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease during 1 year, one undergoing bilateral subthalamic stimulation (STN-DBS) and the other receiving the best medical treatment (BMT), with respect to the clinical effects observed and the medical expenses produced. Assessments were done by using clinical measures and a generic health related quality of life scale. A questionnaire was used to collect direct healthcare resources. As a measure of cost-effectiveness, we calculated life years gained adjusted by health-related quality of life (QALY) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Clinical and demographic variables of both groups were comparable at baseline. Total UPDRS scores improved from 50.5 +/- 3.6 to 28.5 +/- 3.8 in STN-DBS patients and worsened from 44.3 +/- 3.3 to 54.2 +/- 4 in the control group. Pharmacological costs in the operated patients were 3,799 +/- 940 euro, while in the BMT group the costs were 13,208 +/- 4,966 euro. Other medical costs were 1,280 +/- 720 euro in the STN-DBS group and 4,017 +/- 2,962 euro in BMT patients. Nondirect medical costs were 4,079 +/- 1,289 in operated patients and 2,787 +/- 1,209 euro in the BMT group. Mean QALYs were 0.7611 +/- 0.03 in STN-DBS and 0.5401 +/- 0.06 in BMT patients. In STN-DBS patients, the ICER needed to obtain an improvement of one point in the total UPDRS score was of 239.8 euro and the ICER/QALY was of 34,389 euro. Cost-effectiveness parameters were mostly related to the degree of clinical improvement and the reduction of pharmacological costs after STN-DBS.

4073,Should hemodialysis patients with atrial fibrillation undergo systemic anticoagulation? A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 14% of hemodialysis patients have atrial fibrillation. Hemodialysis patients with atrial fibrillation appear to be at increased risk of both thromboembolic complications and bleeding. Furthermore, there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of warfarin or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy for preventing strokes in this subgroup because they were excluded from relevant trials. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cost-utility analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to incorporate parameter uncertainty into the model. Expected value of perfect information and scenario analyses were performed to identify the important drivers of the decision and focus future research. SETTING & POPULATION: Base case was a 60-year-old male hemodialysis patient in the United States. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIME FRAME: A Markov Monte Carlo microsimulation model was constructed from the perspective of the health care payer, and patients were followed up during their lifetime. INTERVENTION: We compared 3 alternative treatment strategies for permanent atrial fibrillation in hemodialysis patients: warfarin, ASA, or no treatment. OUTCOMES: Quality-adjusted survival and cost. RESULTS: ASA and warfarin both prolonged survival compared with no treatment (0.06 and 0.15 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs], respectively). ASA was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $82,100/QALY. Warfarin provided additional benefits at a cost of $88,400 for each QALY gained relative to ASA. At a threshold of $100,000/QALY, the probabilities that no treatment, warfarin, and ASA were the most efficient therapy were 20%, 58%, and 23%, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Parameterization data and costs were taken from US studies and may not be generalizable to other countries. Peritoneal dialysis patients were not included in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The high future cost of hemodialysis constrains incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to values greater than commonly cited thresholds ($50,000/QALY).

4075,Is primary angioplasty cost effective in the UK? Results of a comprehensive decision analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of primary angioplasty, compared with medical management with thrombolytic drugs, to achieve reperfusion after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from the perspective of the UK NHS. DESIGN: Bayesian evidence synthesis and decision analytic model. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted and Bayesian statistical methods used to synthesise evidence from 22 randomised control trials. Resource utilisation was based on UK registry data, published literature and national databases, with unit costs taken from routine NHS sources and published literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Costs from a health service perspective and outcomes measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: For the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of primary angioplasty was 9241 pounds sterling for each additional QALY, with a probability of being cost effective of 0.90 for a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pounds sterling. Results were sensitive to variations in the additional time required to initiate treatment with primary angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Primary angioplasty is cost effective for the treatment of AMI on the basis of threshold cost-effectiveness values used in the NHS and subject to a delay of up to about 80 minutes. These findings are mainly explained by the superior mortality benefit and the prevention of non-fatal outcomes associated with primary angioplasty for delays of up to this length.",2007-01-03130,17717037,Heart,Yolanda Bravo Vergel,2007,93 / 10,1238-43,No,17717037,"Yolanda Bravo Vergel; Stephen Palmer; Christian Asseburg; Elisabeth Fenwick; Mark de Belder; Keith Abrams; Mark Sculpher; Is primary angioplasty cost effective in the UK?

4076,Cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alpha-2a compared to lamivudine treatment in patients with hepatitis B e antigen positive chronic hepatitis B in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Peginterferon alpha-2a (40KD), a new treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), offers improved efficacy with a defined treatment duration compared with lamivudine, but at a higher cost. We undertook an economic evaluation of peginterferon alpha-2a from the perspective of the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance to assess the clinical outcomes and costs of 48 weeks of peginterferon alpha-2a for the treatment of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB, compared to lamivudine treatment for 48 weeks. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a state-transition Markov model simulating the natural history of HBeAg-positive CHB. Efficacy data were obtained from a randomized clinical trial of 820 patients (87% were Asian) comparing peginterferon alpha-2a to lamivudine. We modeled a hypothetical cohort of 32-year-old patients with HBeAg-positive CHB. Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs ($NTD) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on all parameters in the model to evaluate uncertainty. RESULTS: Treatment with peginterferon alpha-2a compared to lamivudine resulted in higher total costs, but longer quality-adjusted life expectancy, yielding an ICER of $NTD 381 000 ($US 12,000) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Although there is uncertainty associated with the prognosis of HBeAg-positive CHB, the ICER did not exceed $NTD 485,000 ($US 15,000) per QALY gained despite variation in the parameters used in the analysis.

The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of their treatment in comparison with no treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The assessed treatment is composed of pegylated interferon alpha-2a and ribavirin, which is the current standard treatment. Two groups were studied: patients with genotype 1 and patients with genotypes 2-3. At the beginning of the study, patients were aged of 45. Long-term economic and clinical outcomes over a 30 year period were predicted using a Markov simulation model. A health care payer perspective was chosen. Data were obtained from published literature. Variations of uncertainty parameters were assessed through a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were Euro 5,338/QALY for genotype 1 and Euro 1,080/QALY for genotypes 2-3. In the sensitivity analysis, ratios remained lower than Euro 20,000.

4079,Randomized trial of two physiotherapy interventions for primary care back and neck pain patients: cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a brief physiotherapy pain management approach using cognitive-behavioural principles (Solution-Finding Approach) when compared with a commonly used traditional method of physical therapy (McKenzie Approach). METHODS: Economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomized trial. The study related incremental differences in costs and benefits associated with the Solution Finding and McKenzie approaches over 12 months. Costs were measured in UK pounds sterling. Benefit was measured as health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D, which was used to estimate patient-specific quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The McKenzie treatment required, on average, one extra physiotherapist visit (4.15 vs 3.10). Over a 12-month period, Solution Finding was associated with a lower per patient cost of pound-24.4 (95% CI pound-49.6 to 0.789 pounds). The mean difference in QALYs between the two groups was -0.020 (95% CI -0.057 to 0.017); favouring those receiving McKenzie.

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the additional cost associated with the McKenzie treatment when compared with the Solution Finding Approach may be worth paying, given the additional benefit the approach seems more likely to provide.

4080,Cost-effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Since the late 1980s, the Taiwanese government has provided all HIV-infected citizens with free access to antiretroviral therapy. Recently, there is controversy as to whether or not free access to expensive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) should be continued for HIV-infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HAART therapy. METHODS: HAART-associated improvement in survival was obtained by analyzing the follow-up data of all HIV-positive patients identified during April 1984 to March 1997 (pre-HAART era) and May 1997 to April 2003 (HAART era) in Taiwan. Data on quality of life in HIV-positive patients was obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 224 patients using standard gamble method and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF instrument. Information regarding the cost of HAART was obtained from the National Health Insurance (NHI). RESULTS: In 2000, the average annual NHI expenditure on HAART per HIV-positive patient receiving HAART was NT$210,018 (US$6177, at an exchange rate of 34.0 NT$/US$). In the AIDS group, the cost was NT$176,441 (US$5189) per life year gained and NT$241,700 (US$7109) per quality-adjusted life year gained. For non-AIDS patients, the corresponding costs were NT$226,156 (US$6652) and NT$332,582 (US$9782), respectively. These estimates have not yet included the additional cost savings from HAART-associated reduction in hospitalization and use of antimicrobial agents for opportunistic infections, and the additional life years gained from the reduction in HIV transmission under the universal availability of HAART.

4096,Is proton beam therapy cost effective in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the prostate?,"PURPOSE: New treatments are introduced routinely into clinical practice without rigorous economic analysis. The specific aim of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of proton beam radiation compared with current state-of-the art therapy in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Materials and METHODS: A Markov model was informed with cost, freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), and utility data obtained from the literature and from patient interviews to compare the cost effectiveness of 91.8 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) delivered with proton beam versus 81 CGE delivered with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The length of how many years the model was run, patient's age, probability of FFBF after treatment with proton beam therapy and IMRT, utility of patients treated with salvage hormone therapy, and treatment cost were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Analysis at 15 years resulted in an expected mean cost of proton beam therapy and IMRT of $63,511 and $36,808, and $64,989 and $39,355 for a 70-year-old and 60-year-old man respectively, with quality-adjusted survival of 8.54 and 8.12 and 9.91 and 9.45 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated to be $63,578/QALY for a 70-year-old man and $55,726/QALY for a 60-year-old man. CONCLUSION: Even when based on the unproven assumption that protons will permit a 10-Gy escalation of prostate dose compared with IMRT photons, proton beam therapy is not cost effective for most patients with prostate cancer using the commonly accepted standard of $50,000/QALY.

Materials and METHODS: A Markov model was informed with cost, freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), and utility data obtained from the literature and from patient interviews to compare the cost effectiveness of 91.8 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) delivered with proton beam versus 81 CGE delivered with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The length of how many years the model was run, patient's age, probability of FFBF after treatment with proton beam therapy and IMRT, utility of patients treated with salvage hormone therapy, and treatment cost were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Analysis at 15 years resulted in an expected mean cost of proton beam therapy and IMRT of $63,511 and $36,808, and $64,989 and $39,355 for a 70-year-old and 60-year-old man respectively, with quality-adjusted survival of 8.54 and 8.12 and 9.91 and 9.45 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated to be $63,578/QALY for a 70-year-old man and $55,726/QALY for a 60-year-old man. CONCLUSION: Even when based on the unproven assumption that protons will permit a 10-Gy escalation of prostate dose compared with IMRT photons, proton beam therapy is not cost effective for most patients with prostate cancer using the commonly accepted standard of $50,000/QALY. Consideration should be given to limiting the number of proton facilities to allow comprehensive evaluation of this modality.",2007-01-03142,17704408,J Clin Oncol,Andre Konski,2007,25 / 24,3603-8,No,17704408,"Andre Konski; William Speier; Alexandra Hanlon; J Robert Beck; Alan Pollack; Is proton beam therapy cost effective in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the prostate?, J Clin Oncol, 2007-Aug-20; 25(24):0732-183X; 3603-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Proton beam therapy vs. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT),Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Male,Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,55726,United States,2005,73847.94
4098,The cost-effectiveness of the new protocol reflecting rapid virologic response to peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have reported the effectiveness of shorter courses of treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin for patients with chronic hepatitis C, who achieved a rapid virologic response (RVR), defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV-) RNA at week 4. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the new protocol for treatment, from the perspective of RVR. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis based on the rate of sustained virologic response was performed. A Markov cohort model of hepatitis C was constructed to demonstrate the clinical states on the basis of the assigned transition probabilities over 30 years. The treatment strategies were classified into five subgroups taking into consideration the viral genotypes, viral load, and RVR. The lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared between the new and standard protocols for treatment. RESULTS: Genotype 1-infected patients in the new protocol for treatment compared with the standard one could prolong QALYs by 0.33 and reduce lifetime cost by euro 5993. Genotype 2 or 3-infected patients in the new protocol for treatment compared with the standard one could prolong QALYs by 0.02 and reduce lifetime cost by euro2851. CONCLUSION: Treatment strategies that consider viral load and RVR for patients with a low viral load infected with genotype 1 and those infected with genotype 2 or 3 are more cost-effective compared with the standard protocol for treatment.",2007-01-03149,17700257,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Junichiro Nakamura,2007,19 / 9,733-9,No,17700257,"Junichiro Nakamura; Kuriko Kobayashi; Shin-Ichi Toyabe; Yutaka Aoyagi; Kouhei Akazawa; The cost-effectiveness of the new protocol reflecting rapid virologic response to peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C, Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2007-Sep; 19(9):0954-691X; 733-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Shorter course of treatment with new protocol with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin vs. Current standard treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-18160.61,Euro,2006,-29289.6

4100,Cost-effectiveness of screening for pre-diabetes among overweight and obese U.S. adults,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening overweight and obese individuals for pre-diabetes and then modifying their lifestyle based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov simulation model was used to estimate disease progression, costs, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a health care system perspective. We considered two screening/treatment strategies for pre-diabetes. Strategy 1 included screening overweight subjects and giving them the lifestyle intervention included in the DPP if they were diagnosed with both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Strategy 2 included screening followed by lifestyle intervention for subjects diagnosed with either IGT or IFG or both. Each strategy was compared with a program of no screening. RESULTS: Screening for pre-diabetes and treating those identified as having both IGT and IFG with the DPP lifestyle intervention had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $8,181 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) relative to no screening. If treatment was also provided to subjects with only IGT or only IFG (strategy 2), the cost-effectiveness ratio increased to $9,511 per QALY. Changes in screening-related parameters had small effects on the cost-effectiveness ratios; the results were more sensitive to changes in intervention-related parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for pre-diabetes in the overweight and obese U.S. population followed by the DPP lifestyle intervention has a relatively attractive cost-effectiveness ratio.",2007-01-03150,17698614,Diabetes Care,Thomas J Hoerger,2007,35 / 9,2874-9,No,17698614,"Thomas J Hoerger; Katherine A Hicks; Stephen W Sorensen; William H Herman; Robert E Ratner; Ronald T Ackermann; Ping Zhang; Michael M Engelgau; Cost-effectiveness of screening for pre-diabetes among overweight and obese U.S. adults, Diabetes Care, ; 35(9):0149-5992; 2874-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening overweight subjects and giving them the lifestyle intervention if they were diagnosed with both IGT and IFG vs. No screening,Not Stated,74 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,8181,United States,2001,11955.58
