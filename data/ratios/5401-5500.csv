5401,Economic evaluation of sunitinib malate for the first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost effectiveness and cost utility of sunitinib malate as a first-line treatment in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) compared with interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) from a US societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression and to determine progression-free survival, total life-years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Model parameters were derived from the pivotal trial of sunitinib, published literature, government sources, and clinical experts' opinions. The model included trial-based adverse events (AEs). Costs of drug treatment, routine follow-up, AEs, disease progression, and best supportive care (BSC) of terminally ill patients were included. Results were tested using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Treatment with sunitinib is associated with a gain in progression-free years of 0.41 and 0.35 over IFN-alpha and IL-2. The estimated gains over IFN-alpha were 0.11 LYs and 0.14 QALYs, and over IL-2 were 0.24 LYs and 0.20 QALYs. Both IFN-alpha and sunitinib treatments dominate IL-2 treatment; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of sunitinib versus IFN-alpha was $18,611 per progression-free year gained and $67,215 per LY gained, and the cost-utility ratio is $52,593 per QALY gained (at a 5% discount rate). Sensitivity analyses found the results to be most sensitive to utility values during treatment, the cost of sunitinib, and the cost of BSC. Model results were robust to changes in other model variables. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sunitinib is a cost-effective alternative to IFN-alpha as a first-line treatment for mRCC.",2008-01-04578,18711190,J Clin Oncol,Edit Remák,2008,26 / 24,3995-4000,No,18711190,"Edit Remák; Claudie Charbonneau; Sylvie Négrier; Sindy T Kim; Robert J Motzer; Economic evaluation of sunitinib malate for the first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, J Clin Oncol, 2008-Aug-20; 26(24):0732-183X; 3995-4000",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Sunitinib malate, 6 week cycles therapy vs. Interferon alpha",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,52593,United States,2006,67518.09

5403,The cost-effectiveness of using hepatitis A/B combined vaccine versus hepatitis B vaccine alone for high-risk heterosexuals,"Previous studies estimated that vaccinating high-risk heterosexuals (HRH) with combination hepatitis A/B vaccine was a cost-effective alternative to vaccinating HRH against hepatitis B alone. Since then, the incidence of hepatitis A has declined dramatically in the United States. We re-estimate the cost-effectiveness of this policy accounting for modern declines in incidence. According to our estimates, vaccinating with combination vaccine resulted in a cost of $120,000 per quality adjusted life year gained (2.79 times the 2005 United States Gross Domestic Product per capita), a ratio that is less favorable than those for most other vaccination strategies.",2008-01-04582,18706957,Vaccine,David B Rein,2008,26 / 42,5331-3,Yes,18706957,"David B Rein; Cindy M Weinbaum; The cost-effectiveness of using hepatitis A/B combined vaccine versus hepatitis B vaccine alone for high-risk heterosexuals, Vaccine, 2008-Oct-03; 26(42):1873-2518; 5331-3",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Hepatitis A/B combined vaccine vs. Hepatitis B vaccine, three doses",Not Stated,44 Years,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,120000,United States,2006,154054.17
5404,The cost utility of solifenacin in the treatment of overactive bladder,"OBJECTIVES: Overactive bladder may cause significant discomfort to patients. The standard therapy for overactive bladder includes behavioural therapy and sometimes medication. Recently, a new medication (solifenacin 5 and 10 mg) was developed for treatment of overactive bladder.

5406,Cost-effectiveness of switching to biphasic insulin aspart in poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes patients in China,"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is an increasing problem in China, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in the Chinese setting. METHODS: Previous data were obtained from PRESENT (Physicians' Routine Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of NovoMix 30 Therapy), a multi-country, single-arm, observational study where type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled with biphasic human insulin (BHI) were converted to biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp30); the Chinese subgroup experienced an improvement in HbA(1c) and a reduction in hypoglycaemic events. A published and validated computer simulation model of diabetes (the CORE Diabetes Model) was used to estimate the long-term clinical and cost consequences of switching to BIAsp30 from BHI in the Chinese setting. Treatment effects and patient characteristics were derived from PRESENT and country-specific published sources. Primary research was performed to ascertain patient management practices and diabetes-related complication costs. Risks of modelled complications were derived from landmark clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Costs and clinical projections were made over patient lifetimes from a third-party payer perspective and discounted at 3% annually. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Conversion to BIAsp30 from BHI was projected to improve discounted life expectancy by 0.38 years per patient (9.91 vs 9.53 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.91 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient (6.32 vs 5.41 QALYs). Conversion to BIAsp30 was associated with increased direct medical costs of Chinese Yuan (CNY) 1751 per patient, due to higher pharmacy and management costs (CNY +19,007), offset by reduced diabetes-related complication costs (CNY -17,254) over patient lifetimes. BIAsp30 was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CNY 1926 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: BIAsp30 was projected to substantially improve clinical outcomes but was associated with increased lifetime medical costs. BIAsp30 would be considered cost-effective in China given a willingness-to-pay threshold of CNY 100,000 per QALY gained in type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled on BHI.",2008-01-04586,18704282,Adv Ther,James L Palmer,2008,25 / 8,752-74,No,18704282,"James L Palmer; Meaghan Gibbs; Huib W K F H Scheijbeler; Robert W Kotchie; Steffen Nielsen; Jeremy White; William J Valentine; Cost-effectiveness of switching to biphasic insulin aspart in poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes patients in China, Adv Ther, 2008-Aug; 25(8):0741-238X; 752-74",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biphasic insulin aspart 30 vs. Biphasic human insulin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1926,China,2007,316.18
5407,"A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Arthroplasty Options for Displaced Femoral Neck Fractures in the Active, Healthy, Elderly Population","This study was performed to explore the cost-effectiveness of total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared with hemiarthroplasty (HEMI) in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in active otherwise healthy older patients in whom the optimum treatment is believed to be an arthroplasty procedure. A Markov decision model was used to determine whether THA or HEMI was most cost-effective for the management of a displaced femoral neck fracture in this patient population. Total hip arthroplasty was associated with an average cost $3000 more than HEMI, and the average quality-adjusted life year gain was 1.53. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with the THA treatment strategy is $1960 per quality-adjusted life year. Currently available data support the use of THA as the more cost-effective treatment strategy in this specific population.

5408,Implementing cognitive behavior therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome in mental health care: a costs and outcomes analysis,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the costs and outcomes of implementing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in a mental health center (MHC). CBT is an evidence-based treatment for CFS that was scarcely available until now. To investigate the possibilities for wider implementation, a pilot implementation project was set up. METHOD: Costs and effects were evaluated in a non-controlled before- and after study with an eight months time-horizon. Both the costs of performing the treatments and the costs of implementing the treatment program were included in the analysis. The implementation interventions included: informing general practitioners (GPs) and CFS patients, training therapists, and instructing the MHC employees. Given the non-controlled design, cost outcome ratios (CORs) and their acceptability curves were analyzed. Analyses were done from a health care perspective and from a societal perspective. Bootstrap analyses were performed to estimate the uncertainty around the cost and outcome results. RESULTS: 125 CFS patients were included in the study. After treatment 37% had recovered from CFS and the mean gained QALY was 0.03. Costs of patients' health care and productivity losses had decreased significantly. From the societal perspective the implementation led to cost savings and to higher health states for patients, indicating dominancy. From the health care perspective the implementation revealed overall costs of 5.320 euros per recovered patient, with an acceptability curve showing a 100% probability for a positive COR at a willingness to pay threshold of 6.500 euros per recovered patient. CONCLUSION: Implementing CBT for CFS in a MHC appeared to have a favorable cost outcome ratio (COR) from a societal perspective. From a health care perspective the COR depended on how much a recovered CFS patient is being valued. The strength of the evidence was limited by the non-controlled design.

5410,Cost effectiveness of chest pain unit care in the NHS,"BACKGROUND: Acute chest pain is responsible for approximately 700,000 patient attendances per year at emergency departments in England and Wales. A single centre study of selected patients suggested that chest pain unit (CPU) care could be less costly and more effective than routine care for these patients, although a more recent multi-centre study cast doubt on the generalisability of these findings. METHODS: Our economic evaluation involved modelling data from the ESCAPE multi-centre trial along with data from other sources to estimate the comparative costs and effects of CPU versus routine care. Cost effectiveness ratios (cost per QALY) were generated from our model. RESULTS: We found that CPU compared to routine care resulted in a non-significant increase in effectiveness of 0.0075 QALYs per patient and a non-significant cost decrease of 32 pounds sterling per patient and thus a negative incremental cost effectiveness ratio. If we are willing to pay 20,000 pounds sterling for an additional QALY then there is a 70% probability that CPU care will be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that CPU care is likely to be slightly more effective and less expensive than routine care, however, these estimates are surrounded by a substantial amount of uncertainty. We cannot reliably conclude that establishing CPU care will represent a cost-effective use of health service resources given the substantial amount of investment it would require.",2008-01-04595,18700961,BMC Health Serv Res,Yemi Oluboyede,2008,8 /,174,Yes,18700961,"Yemi Oluboyede; Steve Goodacre; Allan Wailoo; Cost effectiveness of chest pain unit care in the NHS, BMC Health Serv Res, 2008; 8():1472-6963; 174",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Chest pain unit care vs. Routine care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-4266.67,United Kingdom,2006,-10097.01
5411,Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine in patients with sub-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: Exenatide belongs to a new therapeutic class in the treatment of diabetes (incretin mimetics), allowing glucose-dependent glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. Randomised controlled trial data suggest that exenatide is as effective as insulin glargine at reducing HbA1c in combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylureas; with reduced weight but higher incidence of adverse gastrointestinal events. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine using RCT data and a previously published model of type 2 diabetes disease progression that is based on the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study; the perspective of the health-payer of the United Kingdom National Health Service. METHODS: The study used a discrete event simulation model designed to forecast the costs and health outcome of a cohort of 1,000 subjects aged over 40 years with sub-optimally-controlled type 2 diabetes, following initiation of either exenatide, or insulin glargine, in addition to oral hypoglycaemic agents. Sensitivity analysis for a higher treatment discontinuation rate in exenatide patients was applied to the cohort in three different scenarios; (1) either ignored or (2) exenatide-failures excluded or (3) exenatide-failures switched to insulin glargine. Analyses were undertaken to evaluate the price sensitivity of exenatide in terms of relative cost effectiveness. Baseline cohort profiles and effectiveness data were taken from a published randomised controlled trial. RESULTS: The relative cost-effectiveness of exenatide and insulin glargine was tested under a variety of conditions, in which insulin glargine was dominant in all cases. Using the most conservative of assumptions, the cost-effectiveness ratio of exenatide vs. insulin glargine at the current UK NHS price was -29,149 pounds/QALY (insulin glargine dominant) and thus exenatide is not cost-effective when compared with insulin glargine, at the current UK NHS price. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the relative cost effectiveness of insulin glargine versus exenatide in the management of type 2 diabetes using a published model. Given no significant difference in glycaemic control and applying the additional effectiveness of exenatide over insulin glargine, with respect to weight loss, and using the current UK NHS prices, insulin glargine was found to be dominant over exenatide in all modelled scenarios. With current clinical evidence, exenatide does not appear to represent a cost-effective treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes when compared to insulin glargine.",2008-01-04600,18694484,Cardiovasc Diabetol,Anette Woehl,2008,7 /,24,No,18694484,"Anette Woehl; Mark Evans; Anthony P Tetlow; Philip McEwan; Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine in patients with sub-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom, Cardiovasc Diabetol, 2008; 7():1475-2840; 24",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exenatide vs. Insulin glargine,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.50,3.50,-29211.13,United Kingdom,2007,-72997.43
5412,Cost-effectiveness of treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The study goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery and endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a previous aneurysm, incorporating the results of the prospective International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we performed a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis comparing surgery or endovascular treatment with no treatment. Twelve clinical scenarios were defined based on aneurysm size and location. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for 50- and 40-year-old cohorts. Treatment was considered to be cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: In 50-year-old patients, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy for aneurysms located in the cavernous carotid artery. For aneurysms less than 7 mm located in the anterior circulation, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy. Endovascular treatment was the most cost-effective option for 7- to 24-mm aneurysms, whereas surgery was the most cost-effective option for aneurysms of 25 mm or larger.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we performed a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis comparing surgery or endovascular treatment with no treatment. Twelve clinical scenarios were defined based on aneurysm size and location. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for 50- and 40-year-old cohorts. Treatment was considered to be cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: In 50-year-old patients, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy for aneurysms located in the cavernous carotid artery. For aneurysms less than 7 mm located in the anterior circulation, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy. Endovascular treatment was the most cost-effective option for 7- to 24-mm aneurysms, whereas surgery was the most cost-effective option for aneurysms of 25 mm or larger. For aneurysms less than 7 mm and located in the posterior circulation, endovascular treatment was the most cost-effective option, whereas surgery was the most cost-effective option for 7- to 12-mm aneurysms.

5416,Cost effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in the Nordic region: an analysis based on the CARE-HF trial,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The analysis was based on the CARE-HF trial, a randomised clinical trial investigating the efficacy of adding CRT (n=409) to optimal pharmacological treatment (n=404) in patients with moderate to severe heart failure with markers of cardiac dyssynchrony. The average follow-up time was 29.4 months. METHODS: The health effects were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Data on health care resource consumption from CARE-HF was combined with costs for CRT implantation and hospitalisation from university hospitals in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Calculations were based on patients' expected life time. The expected device lifetime (6 years) was used for CRT, and no additional gains in clinical effects were assumed after the 6 years. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained was 4800 euros in Denmark, 3600 euros in Finland and 6700 euros in Sweden. The 95% confidence intervals for the cost per QALY gained varied between a lower limit of 1169 euros in Finland to an upper limit of 17,482 euros in Sweden. These values were all below the threshold for being cost-effective in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.

5419,Cost-Effectiveness of Primary versus Secondary Prophylaxis with Pegfilgrastim in Women with Early-Stage Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy,"Objective: Prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduces the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of G-CSF pegfilgrastim primary (starting in cycle 1 and continuing in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy) versus secondary (only after an FN event) prophylaxis in women with early-stage breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with a >/=20% FN risk. Methods: A decision-analytic model was constructed from a health insurer's perspective with a lifetime study horizon. The model considers direct medical costs and outcomes related to reduced FN and potential survival benefits because of reduced FN-related mortality. Inputs for the model were obtained from the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted across plausible ranges in parameter values. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pegfilgrastim as primary versus secondary prophylaxis was $48,000/FN episode avoided. Adding survival benefit from avoiding FN mortality yielded an ICER of $110,000/life-year gained (LYG) or $116,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The most influential factors included FN case-fatality, FN relative risk reduction from primary prophylaxis, and age at diagnosis. Conclusions: Compared with secondary prophylaxis, the cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis may be equivalent or superior to other commonly used supportive care interventions for women with breast cancer. Further assessment of the direct impact of G-CSF on short- and long-term survival is needed to substantiate these findings.",2008-01-04612,18673353,Value Health,Scott D Ramsey,2008,/,,Yes,18673353,"Scott D Ramsey; Zhimei Liu; Rob Boer; Sean D Sullivan; Jennifer Malin; Quan V Doan; Robert W Dubois; Gary H Lyman; Cost-Effectiveness of Primary versus Secondary Prophylaxis with Pegfilgrastim in Women with Early-Stage Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy, Value Health, 2008-Jul-31; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim vs. Secondary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim,Not Stated,80 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,116000,United States,2006,148919.03
5420,Assessing efficiency and costs of scaling up HIV treatment,"INTRODUCTION: Whereas cost-effectiveness/utility analyses theoretically assess efficiency in HIV treatment, in practice they are of limited use to policy makers who are also concerned with the total costs of scaling up. This paper proposes an approach to simultaneously assessing both factors when setting priorities for HIV treatment. METHODS: Three interventions were assessed: a no antiretroviral therapy (ART) status quo, ART including first-line only, and ART including first and second-line regimens. Data were from a cohort receiving healthcare in a poor South African setting. Markov modelling was used to calculate patient-level lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) as well as population-level total costs and QALY in each intervention. Linear programming was used to assess efficiency at the population level. RESULTS: First-line ART costs US$795 per QALY gained compared to no ART, while first and second-line costs US$1625 compared to first-line alone. The efficiency of either ART strategy depends on the HIV treatment budget. If this is less than US$10 billion during the planning period, first-line ART is most efficient. A combination of first-line with first and second-line treatment is most efficient if the budget is US$10-12 billion. Using both first and second-line treatment for everyone becomes efficient as the main strategy only at budgets greater than US$13 billion. CONCLUSION: An approach has been developed to HIV treatment priority setting that simultaneously considers efficiency and the costs of scaling up.

5422,Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Pioglitazone versus Placebo in Addition to Existing Diabetes Treatment: A US Analysis Based on PROactive,"Objective: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of adding pioglitazone versus placebo to standard treatment in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: The validated CORE Diabetes Model was modified to project long-term clinical and cost outcomes associated with pioglitazone versus placebo, based on results from PROactive. The model retained basic structure and functionality, with interdependent Markov submodels, Monte Carlo simulation and user interface. Adjustments to submodels were made to accommodate the PROactive primary end points. The analysis was from the perspective of a third party US health-care payer perspective, projected over a lifetime horizon using a 3% annual discount. Results: Over a lifetime horizon, addition of pioglitazone was associated with increased life expectancy (0.237 life-years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) [0.166 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] versus placebo. Estimated long-term complication rates showed that pioglitazone reduced the number of events versus placebo for most outcomes. Lifetime total direct costs were marginally higher with pioglitazone versus placebo ($272,694 vs. $265,390, difference $7,305). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for pioglitazone versus placebo was $44,105 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 55% likelihood that pioglitazone would be considered cost-effective in the United States, with a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY gained. Conclusions: The addition of pioglitazone to existing therapy in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes was projected to improve life expectancy, QALE and complication rates compared with placebo.

A study was performed to identify key factors that determine the cost-effectiveness as compared to conventional carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of CAS over CEA for different scenarios was estimated using a modeling approach. Treatment costs were based on actual costs of successful procedures whereas costs of complications were taken from the literature. Patient survival was modeled using the endarterectomy patients from the ECST trial. RESULTS: Procedural costs of CAS are higher than those of CEA, mainly as a result of the high material costs. Cost-effectiveness of CAS primarily depends on major stroke rates. One percent increase in the peri-operative major stroke rate causes a cost increase of 1051 euros and a loss of 0.06 quality adjusted life years.

5426,Cost-effectiveness of coronary MDCT in the triage of patients with acute chest pain,"OBJECTIVE: Patients at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who present to the emergency department complaining of acute chest pain place a substantial economic burden on the U.S. health care system. Noninvasive 64-MDCT coronary angiography may facilitate their triage, and we evaluated its cost-effectiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed to compare costs and health effects of performing CT coronary angiography and either discharging, stress testing, or referring emergency department patients for invasive coronary angiography, depending on their severity of atherosclerosis, compared with a standard-of-care (SOC) algorithm that based management on biomarkers and stress tests alone. RESULTS: Using CT coronary angiography to triage 55-year-old men with acute chest pain increased emergency department and hospital costs by $110 and raised total health care costs by $200. In 55-year-old women, the technology was cost-saving; emergency department and hospital costs decreased by $410, and total health care costs decreased by $380. Compared with the SOC, CT coronary angiography-based triage extended life expectancy by 10 days in men and by 6 days in women. This translated into corresponding improvements of 0.03 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.01 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for CT coronary angiography was $6,400 per QALY in men; in women, CT coronary angiography was cost-saving. Cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to several parameters but generally remained in the range of what is typically considered cost-effective.

5427,Cost-effectiveness of coronary MDCT in the triage of patients with acute chest pain,"OBJECTIVE: Patients at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who present to the emergency department complaining of acute chest pain place a substantial economic burden on the U.S. health care system. Noninvasive 64-MDCT coronary angiography may facilitate their triage, and we evaluated its cost-effectiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed to compare costs and health effects of performing CT coronary angiography and either discharging, stress testing, or referring emergency department patients for invasive coronary angiography, depending on their severity of atherosclerosis, compared with a standard-of-care (SOC) algorithm that based management on biomarkers and stress tests alone. RESULTS: Using CT coronary angiography to triage 55-year-old men with acute chest pain increased emergency department and hospital costs by $110 and raised total health care costs by $200. In 55-year-old women, the technology was cost-saving; emergency department and hospital costs decreased by $410, and total health care costs decreased by $380. Compared with the SOC, CT coronary angiography-based triage extended life expectancy by 10 days in men and by 6 days in women. This translated into corresponding improvements of 0.03 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.01 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for CT coronary angiography was $6,400 per QALY in men; in women, CT coronary angiography was cost-saving. Cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to several parameters but generally remained in the range of what is typically considered cost-effective. CONCLUSION: CT coronary angiography-based triage for patients with low-risk chest pain is modestly more effective than the SOC.

5428,The Potential Clinical and Economic Outcomes of Pharmacogenomic Approaches to EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"Objectives: Pharmacogenomic applications in oncology offer significant promise, but the clinical and economic implications remain unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential cost-utility of implementing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing before initiating second-line therapy for advanced refractory non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate the cost-utility of EGFR protein expression or gene copy number testing compared to standard care with erlotinib in refractory advanced NSCLC patients. Costs and utilities were obtained from publicly available sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results. Results: The quality-adjusted life expectancies for erlotinib, EGFR protein expression testing, and gene copy number testing were: 0.44, 0.48, and 0.50 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and the costs were: $57,238, $63,512, and $66,447, respectively. The most cost-effective testing option, EGFR gene copy number testing, produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $162,018/QALY compared to no testing (erlotinib). The results were most sensitive to the survival estimates, health state utilities, and cost of disease progression. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, erlotinib without testing was the optimal treatment strategy until the $150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, after which gene copy testing was optimal. The discounted expected value of perfect information at a $100,000/QALY threshold in the USA over 5 years was $31.4 million.

5431,Cost-Effectiveness of Testing for Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes,"Objectives: Genetic mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1/2 are associated with an increased risk of breast/ovarian cancers. Cost-effective preventive measures are available for women who test positive. The objective of this study was to determine at what risk of mutation it is cost-effective to test women for BRCA1/2 mutations. Methods: A semi-Markov model accrued costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) annually from the societal perspective. The estimates of health-care costs, life expectancy, likelihood of obtaining a mastectomy or oophorectomy, and patient preferences for treatment and certainty about their BRCA1/2 status were based on the literature. Results: At a 10% probability of mutation (the current guideline), the test strategy generated 22.9 QALYs over the lifetime and cost $118k, while the no-test strategy generated 22.7 QALYs and cost $117k. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the test strategy was $9k and the differences between costs and effects were not substantial. The test strategy remained cost-effective to a probability of mutation of 0%, as long as utility gained from a negative test result was 0.006 or greater. These results were sensitive to the frequency of inconclusive test results and utility gain from a negative test result. Conclusions: The costs and effectiveness of both the test and no-test strategies are very similar even when there is a small probability of mutation. Current guidelines, which can be used by insurance companies to refuse coverage, could deny some women a cost-effective approach. Further research to decrease the frequency of inconclusive results could improve the cost-effectiveness of this test.",2008-01-04647,18647256,Value Health,Margaret L Holland,2008,/,,Yes,18647256,"Margaret L Holland; Alissa Huston; Katia Noyes; Cost-Effectiveness of Testing for Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes, Value Health, 2008-Jul-18; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Testing for BRCA 1/2 mutation vs. No testing, usual care",Not Stated,Not Stated,35 Years,Female,Full,70 Years,3.00,3.00,5000,United States,2006,6418.92

5438,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of elective endovascular repair compared with open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms for patients at a high surgical risk: A 1-year patient-level analysis conducted in Ontario, Canada","BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent health condition affecting up to 14% of men and 6% of women. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared with open surgical repair (OSR) in patients at a high risk of surgical complications. METHODS: Patient-level cost and outcome data from a 1-year prospective observational study conducted at London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada, was used to determine the incremental cost per life-year gained and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of EVAR compared with OSR in patients with an AAA >5.5 cm and a high risk of surgical complications. The analysis was taken from a societal perspective and the time horizon was 1 year. To measure sampling uncertainty on costs and effects, nonparametric bootstrap techniques were applied. Uncertainty results were expressed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Extrapolations of the 1-year results to a 5-year time horizon were conducted in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Between August 11, 2003, and April 3, 2005, 192 patients at a high risk of surgical complications were enrolled: 140 received EVAR and 52 OSR. Point estimates during a 1-year period showed that EVAR dominated OSR for high-risk patients in terms of incremental cost per life-year gained and incremental cost per QALYs. However, bootstrap estimates for the two cost-effectiveness measures indicated there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding the costs and the QALYs and less uncertainty regarding life-years gained. If society was willing to pay $50,000 per life-year gained or per QALY gained, the probability of EVAR being cost-effective was found to be 0.76 and 0.55, respectively. Five-year extrapolations indicated that EVAR was cost-effective compared with OSR. CONCLUSIONS: According to this 1-year observational study, EVAR may be a cost-effective strategy compared with OSR for high-risk patients. Longer-term data are needed to decrease the uncertainty associated with the results.",2008-01-04659,18639421,J Vasc Surg,Jean-Eric Tarride,2008,48 / 4,779-87,No,18639421,"Jean-Eric Tarride; Gord Blackhouse; Guy De Rose; Teresa Novick; James M Bowen; Robert Hopkins; Daria O'Reilly; Ron Goeree; Cost-effectiveness analysis of elective endovascular repair compared with open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms for patients at a high surgical risk: A 1-year patient-level analysis conducted in Ontario, Canada, J Vasc Surg, 2008-Oct; 48(4):0741-5214; 779-87",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular aortic repair vs. Open surgical aortic repair,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-960,Canada,2006,-1087.07
5439,"Health care costs, long-term survival, and quality of life following intensive care unit admission after cardiac arrest","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the costs and health status outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients who present after sudden cardiac arrest with in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Five-year survival, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 questionnaire, SF-36), ICU costs, hospital costs and post-hospital health care costs per survivor, costs per life year gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life year gained of patients admitted to a single ICU were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred ten of 354 patients (31%) were alive 5 years after hospital discharge. The mean health status index of 5-year survivors was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.85). Women rated their health-related quality of life significantly better than men did (0.87 versus 0.74; P < 0.05). Costs per hospital discharge survivor were 49,952 euro. Including the costs of post-hospital discharge health care incurred during their remaining life span, the total costs per life year gained were 10,107 euro. Considering 5-year survivors only, the costs per life year gained were calculated as 9,816 euro or 14,487 euro per quality-adjusted life year gained.

5440,The cost-effectiveness of screening and treatment for hepatitis C in prisons in England and Wales: a cost-utility analysis,"Prisoners have a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection compared with the general population in England and Wales and in many locations throughout the world. This is because of large numbers of injecting drug users that engage in behaviours likely to transmit HCV being present within prison populations. It is, therefore, suggested that prison may be an appropriate location for HCV screening and treatment to be administered. Using cost-utility analysis, this study considers the costs and benefits of administering a single round of screening on reception into prison to all individuals followed by possible later screening in the community and comparing this to individuals who may only be tested and treated in the community at a later date. The cost/QALY of one round of prison testing and treatment was found to be 54,852 pounds sterling, although probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed extensive uncertainty about this estimate. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed the importance of the parameters describing the progression of chronic HCV and the discount rates. While the results presented here at baseline would suggest that screening and treatment for HCV in prisons is not cost-effective, these results are subject to much uncertainty. The importance of the rates describing the progression of chronic HCV on the cost-effectiveness of this intervention has been demonstrated and this suggests that future work should be undertaken to gain further insight into the rates that individuals progress to the later stages of chronic HCV infection.",2008-01-04663,18637074,J Viral Hepat,A J Sutton,2008,15 / 11,797-808,No,18637074,"A J Sutton; W J Edmunds; M J Sweeting; O N Gill; The cost-effectiveness of screening and treatment for hepatitis C in prisons in England and Wales: a cost-utility analysis, J Viral Hepat, 2008-Nov; 15(11):1352-0504; 797-808",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Screening for Hepatitis C within prison population, possible follow up screening in community for those positive in prison screening vs. Usual care -- no prison screening, only symptomatic testing within community",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,80 Years,3.50,3.50,54852,United Kingdom,2004,137754.41
5441,Cost-effectiveness of abatacept in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists,"OBJECTIVE: To assess cost-effectiveness of abatacept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists (anti-TNF). METHODS: We developed a simulation model to depict progression of disability [in terms of Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)] in women aged 55-64 years with moderately to severely active RA and inadequate response to anti-TNF. At model entry, patients were assumed to receive either oral disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) only or oral DMARD plus abatacept. Patients were then tracked from model entry until death. Future health-state utilities and medical-care costs (except study therapy) were estimated based on predicted values of the HAQ-DI. The model was estimated using data from a Phase III clinical trial of abatacept plus secondary sources. Cost-effectiveness was expressed in terms of incremental cost (2006 US$) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained alternatively over 10 years and a lifetime. Future costs and health effects were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: Over 10 years, abatacept would yield 1.0 additional QALY (undiscounted) per patient (4.0 vs 3.0 for oral DMARD) at an incremental (discounted) cost of $45,497 (100,648 vs $55,151) respectively; over a lifetime, corresponding figures were 1.6 QALY (5.8 vs 4.2) and $64,978 ($140,714 vs $82,489). Cost-effectiveness was [mean (95% CI)] $50,576 ($47,056, $54,944) per QALY gained over 10 years, and $45,979 ($42,678, $49,932) per QALY gained over a lifetime.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial studied 43 patients at 5 sites. All patients were implanted with 3 transponders each. In 41 patients, the system was used for initial alignment at each therapy session. Thirty-five patients had continuous monitoring during their radiation treatment. Over 1,000 alignment comparisons were made to a commercially available kV X-ray positioning system (BrainLAB ExacTrac, Munich, Germany). Using decision analysis and Markov processes, the outcomes of patients were simulated over a 5-year period and measured in terms of costs from a payer's perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: All patients had satisfactory transponder implantations for monitoring purposes. In over 75% of the treatment sessions, the correction to conventional positioning (laser and tattoos) directed by an electromagnetic patient positioning and monitoring system was greater than 5 mm. Ninety-seven percent (34/35) of the patients who underwent continuous monitoring had target motion that exceeded preset limits at some point during the course of their radiation therapy. Exceeding preset thresholds resulted in user intervention at least once during the therapy in 80% of the patients (28/35). Compared with localization using ultrasound, electronic portal imaging devices (EPID), or computed tomography (CT), localization with the electromagnetic patient positioning and monitoring system yielded superior gains in QALYs at comparable costs. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients positioned with conventional tattoos and lasers for prostate radiation therapy were found by use of the electromagnetic patient positioning and monitoring system to have alignment errors exceeding 5 mm. Almost all patients undergoing external beam radiation of the prostate have been shown to have target organ movement exceeding 3 mm during radiation therapy delivery. The ability of the electromagnetic technology to monitor tumor target location during the same time as radiation therapy is being delivered allows clinicians to provide real time adaptive radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This permits clinicians to intervene when the prostate moves outside the radiation isocenter, which should decrease adverse events and improve patient outcomes.

5462,Do estimates of cost-utility based on the EQ-5D differ from those based on the mapping of utility scores?,"BACKGROUND: Mapping has been used to convert scores from condition-specific measures into utility scores, and to produce estimates of cost-effectiveness. We sought to compare the QALY gains, and incremental cost per QALY estimates, predicted on the basis of mapping to those based on actual EQ-5D scores. METHODS: In order to compare 4 different interventions 389 individuals were asked to complete both the EQ-5D and the Western Ontartio and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months post-intervention. Using baseline data various mapping models were developed, where WOMAC scores were used to predict the EQ-5D scores. The performance of these models was tested by predicting the EQ-5D post-intervention scores. The preferred model (that with the lowest mean absolute error (MAE)) was used to predict the EQ-5D scores, at all time points, for individuals who had complete WOMAC and EQ-5D data. The mean QALY gain associated with each intervention was calculated, using both actual and predicted EQ-5D scores. These QALY gains, along with previously estimated changes in cost, were also used to estimate the actual and predicted incremental cost per QALY associated with each of the four interventions. RESULTS: The EQ-5D and the WOMAC were completed at baseline by 348 individuals, and at all time points by 259 individuals. The MAE in the preferred model was 0.129, and the mean QALY gains for each of the four interventions was predicted to be 0.006, 0.058, 0.058, and 0.136 respectively, compared to the actual mean QALY gains of 0.087, 0.081, 0.120, and 0.149. The most effective intervention was estimated to be associated with an incremental cost per QALY of pound6,068, according to our preferred model, compared to pound13,154 when actual data was used. CONCLUSION: We found that actual QALY gains, and incremental cost per QALY estimates, differed from those predicted on the basis of mapping. This suggests that though mapping may be of value in predicting the cost-effectiveness of interventions which have not been evaluated using a utility measure, future studies should be encouraged to include a method of actual utility measurement.

5463,Do estimates of cost-utility based on the EQ-5D differ from those based on the mapping of utility scores?,"BACKGROUND: Mapping has been used to convert scores from condition-specific measures into utility scores, and to produce estimates of cost-effectiveness. We sought to compare the QALY gains, and incremental cost per QALY estimates, predicted on the basis of mapping to those based on actual EQ-5D scores. METHODS: In order to compare 4 different interventions 389 individuals were asked to complete both the EQ-5D and the Western Ontartio and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months post-intervention. Using baseline data various mapping models were developed, where WOMAC scores were used to predict the EQ-5D scores. The performance of these models was tested by predicting the EQ-5D post-intervention scores. The preferred model (that with the lowest mean absolute error (MAE)) was used to predict the EQ-5D scores, at all time points, for individuals who had complete WOMAC and EQ-5D data. The mean QALY gain associated with each intervention was calculated, using both actual and predicted EQ-5D scores. These QALY gains, along with previously estimated changes in cost, were also used to estimate the actual and predicted incremental cost per QALY associated with each of the four interventions.

This study determined the cost effectiveness of adding salmeterol (S) or fluticasone/salmeterol (FS) to tiotropium (T) for COPD. METHODS: This concurrent, prospective, economic analysis was based on costs and health outcomes from a 52 week randomised study comparing: (1) T 18 microg once daily + placebo twice daily (TP group); (2) T 18 microg once daily + S 25 microg/puff, 2 puffs twice daily (TS group); and (3) T 18 microg once daily + FS 250/25 microg/puff, 2 puffs twice daily (TFS group). The incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were defined as incremental cost per exacerbation avoided, and per additional quality adjusted life year (QALY) between treatments. A combination of imputation and bootstrapping was used to quantify uncertainty, and extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The average patient in the TP group generated CAN$2678 in direct medical costs compared with $2801 (TS group) and $4042 (TFS group). The TS strategy was dominated by TP and TFS. Compared with TP, the TFS strategy resulted in ICERs of $6510 per exacerbation avoided, and $243,180 per QALY gained. In those with severe COPD, TS resulted in equal exacerbation rates and slightly lower costs compared with TP.

5467,The impact of using different costing methods on the results of an economic evaluation of cardiac care: microcosting vs gross-costing approaches,"Background: Published guidelines on the conduct of economic evaluations provide little guidance regarding the use and potential bias of the different costing methods.Objectives: Using microcosting and two gross-costing methods, we (1) compared the cost estimates within and across subjects, and (2) determined the impact on the results of an economic evaluation.Methods: Microcosting estimates were obtained from the local health region and gross-costing estimates were obtained from two government bodies (one provincial and one national). Total inpatient costs were described for each method. Using an economic evaluation of sirolimus-eluting stents, we compared the incremental cost-utility ratios that resulted from applying each method.Results: Microcosting, Case-Mix-Grouper (CMG) gross-costing, and Refined-Diagnosis-Related grouper (rDRG) gross-costing resulted in 4-year mean cost estimates of $16 684, $16 232, and $10 474, respectively. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the cost per QALY gained was $41 764 (95% CI: $41 182-$42 346), $42 538 (95% CI: $42 167-$42 907), and $36 566 (95% CI: $36 172-$36 960) for microcosting, rDRG-derived and CMG-derived estimates, respectively (P<0.001).Conclusions: Within subject, the three costing methods produced markedly different cost estimates.

5470,Cost-effectiveness of frequent in-center hemodialysis,"Published evidence suggests that frequent hemodialysis (more than three times per week) for patients with ESRD may improve health-related quality of life and has the potential to increase longevity and reduce hospitalization and other complications. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to compare varying combinations of in-center hemodialysis frequency (three to six treatments per week) and session length (2 to 4.5 h per session) with regard to unadjusted and quality-adjusted life-years and total lifetime costs for a cohort of 200,000 patients, representing the prevalent ESRD population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for the various regimens relative to a conventional hemodialysis regimen (three treatments per week, 3.5 h per session). Using conservative assumptions of the potential effects of more frequent hemodialysis on outcomes, most strategies achieved a cost-effectiveness ratio of <$125,000, although all had a cost-effectiveness ratio of >$75,000. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased with the frequency of hemodialysis. More frequent in-center hemodialysis strategies could become cost-neutral if the cost per hemodialysis session could be reduced by 32 to 43%. No other change in model assumptions achieved cost neutrality. In conclusion, given the extraordinarily high costs of the ESRD program, the viability of more frequent hemodialysis strategies depends on significant improvements in the economic model underlying the delivery of hemodialysis.",2008-01-04696,18614773,J Am Soc Nephrol,Chris P Lee,2008,19 / 9,1792-7,No,18614773,"Chris P Lee; Stefanos A Zenios; Glenn M Chertow; Cost-effectiveness of frequent in-center hemodialysis, J Am Soc Nephrol, 2008-Sep; 19(9):1046-6673; 1792-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Dialysis 4-times per week, 3.0 hours per session vs. Dialysis 3-times per week, 3.5 hours per session",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,89000,United States,2006,114256.84
5471,Universal or targeted screening for fetal alcohol exposure: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: In this article, we compared the costs of testing meconium for alcohol exposure in newborns with the lifetime benefits of early detection and intervention. METHOD: A decision analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of testing meconium for two scenarios: (1) all infants in the Canadian province of Ontario and (2) infants who have an older sibling diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The model incorporated the costs of early screening, early intervention, and the lifetime societal benefits of early intervention. RESULTS: The cost of the meconium test is Can. $150. The lifetime societal cost of the disease is Can. $1.3 million per incident case. The benefit of early intervention is an improvement in literacy, which improves the quality of life parameter by 0.17 and increases adult lifetime earnings by $26,400 per year. The ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental benefits results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for mandating a universal screen of all newborns in Ontario of $65,874 per quality-adjusted life years. When considering targeted screening, there is a cost savings for society and improvements in quality of life.

5477,"Cost-utility of a walking programme for moderately depressed, obese, or overweight elderly women in primary care: a randomised controlled trial","BACKGROUND: There is a considerable public health burden due to physical inactivity, because it is a major independent risk factor for several diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, moderate mood disorders neurotic diseases such as depression, etc.). This study assesses the cost utility of the adding a supervised walking programme to the standard ""best primary care"" for overweight, moderately obese, or moderately depressed elderly women. METHODS: One-hundred six participants were randomly assigned to an interventional group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 51). The intervention consisted of an invitation, from a general practitioner, to participate in a 6-month walking-based, supervised exercise program with three 50-minute sessions per week. The main outcome measures were the healthcare costs from the Health System perspective and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) using EuroQol (EQ-5D.) RESULTS: Of the patients invited to participate in the program, 79% were successfully recruited, and 86% of the participants in the exercise group completed the programme. Over 6 months, the mean treatment cost per patient in the exercise group was 41 euros more than ""best care"". The mean incremental QALY of intervention was 0.132 (95% CI: 0.104-0.286). Each extra QALY gained by the exercise programme relative to best care cost 311 euros (95% CI, 143 euros-394 euros). The cost effectiveness acceptability curves showed a 90% probability that the addition of the walking programme is the best strategy if the ceiling of inversion is 350 euros/QALY. CONCLUSION: The invitation strategy and exercise programme resulted in a high rate of participation and is a feasible and cost-effective addition to best care. The programme is a cost-effective resource for helping patients to increase their physical activity, according to the recommendations of general practitioners. Moreover, the present study could help decision makers enhance the preventive role of primary care and optimize health care resources.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Decision model. PATIENTS: Neonates with fever with no other symptoms and neonates with fever with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. INTERVENTIONS: Four clinical strategies: (1) HSV testing and empirical treatment while awaiting test results; (2) HSV testing and treatment if test results were positive for HSV or the patient had symptoms of HSV; (3) treatment alone without testing; or (4) no HSV testing or treatment unless the patient exhibited symptoms. The 2 HSV testing methods used were CSF HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and comprehensive evaluation with blood HSV PCR, CSF HSV PCR, and multiple viral cultures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twelve-month survival and quality-adjusted life expectancy with a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Clinical strategy 1, when applied in febrile neonates with CSF pleocytosis, saved 17 lives per 10,000 neonates and was cost-effective using CSF HSV PCR testing ($55,652/QALY gained). The cost-effectiveness of applying clinical strategy 1 in all febrile neonates depended on the cost of the CSF HSV PCR, prevalence of disease, and parental preferences for neurodevelopmental outcomes.

5482,The impact of prevention on reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent and expensive. While many interventions are recommended to prevent CVD, the potential effects of a comprehensive set of prevention activities on CVD morbidity, mortality, and costs have never been evaluated. We therefore determined the effects of 11 nationally recommended prevention activities on CVD-related morbidity, mortality, and costs in the United States. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used person-specific data from a representative sample of the US population (National Health and Nutrition Education Survey IV) to determine the number and characteristics of adults aged 20-80 years in the United States today who are candidates for different prevention activities related to CVD. We used the Archimedes model to create a simulated population that matched the real US population, person by person. We then used the model to simulate a series of clinical trials that examined the effects over the next 30 years of applying each prevention activity one by one, or altogether, to those who are candidates for the various activities and compared the health outcomes, quality of life, and direct medical costs to current levels of prevention and care. We did this under two sets of assumptions about performance and compliance: 100% success for each activity and lower levels of success considered aggressive but still feasible. RESULTS: Approximately 78% of adults aged 20-80 years alive today in the United States are candidates for at least one prevention activity. If everyone received the activities for which they are eligible, myocardial infarctions and strokes would be reduced by 63% and 31%, respectively. If more feasible levels of performance are assumed, myocardial infarctions and strokes would be reduced 36% and 20%, respectively. Implementation of all prevention activities would add approximately 221 million life-years and 244 million quality-adjusted life-years to the US adult population over the coming 30 years, or an average of 1.3 years of life expectancy for all adults. Of the specific prevention activities, the greatest benefits to the US population come from providing aspirin to high-risk individuals, controlling pre-diabetes, weight reduction in obese individuals, lowering blood pressure in people with diabetes, and lowering LDL cholesterol in people with existing coronary artery disease (CAD). As currently delivered and at current prices, most prevention activities are expensive when considering direct medical costs; smoking cessation is the only prevention strategy that is cost-saving over 30 years. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive application of nationally recommended prevention activities could prevent a high proportion of the CAD events and strokes that are otherwise expected to occur in adults in the United States today.

5486,The impact of prevention on reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent and expensive. While many interventions are recommended to prevent CVD, the potential effects of a comprehensive set of prevention activities on CVD morbidity, mortality, and costs have never been evaluated. We therefore determined the effects of 11 nationally recommended prevention activities on CVD-related morbidity, mortality, and costs in the United States. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used person-specific data from a representative sample of the US population (National Health and Nutrition Education Survey IV) to determine the number and characteristics of adults aged 20-80 years in the United States today who are candidates for different prevention activities related to CVD. We used the Archimedes model to create a simulated population that matched the real US population, person by person. We then used the model to simulate a series of clinical trials that examined the effects over the next 30 years of applying each prevention activity one by one, or altogether, to those who are candidates for the various activities and compared the health outcomes, quality of life, and direct medical costs to current levels of prevention and care. We did this under two sets of assumptions about performance and compliance: 100% success for each activity and lower levels of success considered aggressive but still feasible. RESULTS: Approximately 78% of adults aged 20-80 years alive today in the United States are candidates for at least one prevention activity. If everyone received the activities for which they are eligible, myocardial infarctions and strokes would be reduced by 63% and 31%, respectively. If more feasible levels of performance are assumed, myocardial infarctions and strokes would be reduced 36% and 20%, respectively. Implementation of all prevention activities would add approximately 221 million life-years and 244 million quality-adjusted life-years to the US adult population over the coming 30 years, or an average of 1.3 years of life expectancy for all adults. Of the specific prevention activities, the greatest benefits to the US population come from providing aspirin to high-risk individuals, controlling pre-diabetes, weight reduction in obese individuals, lowering blood pressure in people with diabetes, and lowering LDL cholesterol in people with existing coronary artery disease (CAD). As currently delivered and at current prices, most prevention activities are expensive when considering direct medical costs; smoking cessation is the only prevention strategy that is cost-saving over 30 years.

5494,Cost-effectiveness analysis of periacetabular osteotomy,"BACKGROUND: A lack of long-term outcomes data following periacetabular osteotomy makes it difficult for surgeons to recommend the most appropriate procedure to young patients who might be candidates for a joint-preserving procedure. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of periacetabular osteotomy with total hip arthroplasty in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year for the young adult. METHODS: A decision model was constructed for a cost-utility analysis of periacetabular osteotomy compared with total hip arthroplasty. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from the literature. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years gained. Cost data were compiled and verified from our institution. Costs and utilities were discounted in accord with the United States Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Principal outcome measures were average incremental costs, incremental effectiveness, incremental quality-adjusted life years, and net health benefits. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to assess the contribution of included variables in the model's outcomes. RESULTS: For Tönnis grade-1 coxarthrosis, periacetabular osteotomy dominates with an average incremental cost-effectiveness of $7856 per quality-adjusted life year and an average incremental effectiveness of 0.15. For Tönnis grade-2 coxarthrosis, periacetabular osteotomy is, on the average, more cost-effective than total hip arthroplasty with an incremental cost-effectiveness of $824 per quality-adjusted life year, but it is less effective than total hip arthroplasty, on the average, with an incremental effectiveness of -1.4 quality-adjusted life years. Periacetabular osteotomy becomes more cost-effective at a longevity of 5.5 years for Tönnis grade-1 coxarthrosis and 18.25 years for Tönnis grade-2 coxarthrosis. In Tönnis grade-3 coxarthrosis, total hip replacement becomes the dominant treatment strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Periacetabular osteotomy is, on the average, more cost-effective in Tönnis grade-1 and grade-2 coxarthrosis, while it is both more costly and less effective in Tönnis grade-3 coxarthrosis. These findings can inform clinical decision-making in the absence of long-term data. On the basis of this model, periacetabular osteotomy is preferable to total hip arthroplasty in Tönnis grade-1 and grade-2 coxarthrosis when the patient is sufficiently young and when functionality in sports is important.",2008-01-04713,18594092,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Emile Sharifi,2008,90 / 7,1447-56,No,18594092,"Emile Sharifi; Husham Sharifi; Saam Morshed; Kevin Bozic; Mohammad Diab; Cost-effectiveness analysis of periacetabular osteotomy, J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2008-Jul; 90(7):0021-9355; 1447-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Periacetabular osteotomy vs. Usual care; total hip arthoplasty,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,5.00,5.00,-41320,United States,2004,-56612.34

Periacetabular osteotomy becomes more cost-effective at a longevity of 5.5 years for Tönnis grade-1 coxarthrosis and 18.25 years for Tönnis grade-2 coxarthrosis. In Tönnis grade-3 coxarthrosis, total hip replacement becomes the dominant treatment strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Periacetabular osteotomy is, on the average, more cost-effective in Tönnis grade-1 and grade-2 coxarthrosis, while it is both more costly and less effective in Tönnis grade-3 coxarthrosis. These findings can inform clinical decision-making in the absence of long-term data. On the basis of this model, periacetabular osteotomy is preferable to total hip arthroplasty in Tönnis grade-1 and grade-2 coxarthrosis when the patient is sufficiently young and when functionality in sports is important.",2008-01-04713,18594092,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Emile Sharifi,2008,90 / 7,1447-56,No,18594092,"Emile Sharifi; Husham Sharifi; Saam Morshed; Kevin Bozic; Mohammad Diab; Cost-effectiveness analysis of periacetabular osteotomy, J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2008-Jul; 90(7):0021-9355; 1447-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Periacetabular osteotomy vs. Usual care; total hip arthoplasty,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,5.00,5.00,1512.14,United States,2004,2071.78
5496,Cost-effectiveness analysis of periacetabular osteotomy,"BACKGROUND: A lack of long-term outcomes data following periacetabular osteotomy makes it difficult for surgeons to recommend the most appropriate procedure to young patients who might be candidates for a joint-preserving procedure. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of periacetabular osteotomy with total hip arthroplasty in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year for the young adult. METHODS: A decision model was constructed for a cost-utility analysis of periacetabular osteotomy compared with total hip arthroplasty. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from the literature. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years gained. Cost data were compiled and verified from our institution. Costs and utilities were discounted in accord with the United States Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Principal outcome measures were average incremental costs, incremental effectiveness, incremental quality-adjusted life years, and net health benefits. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to assess the contribution of included variables in the model's outcomes. RESULTS: For Tönnis grade-1 coxarthrosis, periacetabular osteotomy dominates with an average incremental cost-effectiveness of $7856 per quality-adjusted life year and an average incremental effectiveness of 0.15. For Tönnis grade-2 coxarthrosis, periacetabular osteotomy is, on the average, more cost-effective than total hip arthroplasty with an incremental cost-effectiveness of $824 per quality-adjusted life year, but it is less effective than total hip arthroplasty, on the average, with an incremental effectiveness of -1.4 quality-adjusted life years.

5497,A cost-effectiveness analysis of folic acid fortification policy in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the health and economic outcomes associated with changes in folic acid consumption following the fortification of enriched grain products in the USA. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Annual burden of disease, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and costs were projected for four steady-state strategies: no fortification, or fortifying with 140, 350 or 700 mug folic acid per 100 g enriched grain. The analysis considered four health outcomes: neural tube defects (NTD), myocardial infarctions (MI), colon cancers and B12 deficiency maskings. SUBJECTS: The US adult population subgroups defined by age, gender and race/ethnicity, with folate intake distributions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1988-1992 and 1999-2000), and reference sources for disease incidence, utility and economic estimates. RESULTS: The greatest benefits from fortification were predicted in MI prevention, with 16 862 and 88 172 cases averted per year in steady state for the 140 and 700 mug fortification levels, respectively. These projections were between 6261 and 38 805 for colon cancer and 182 and 1423 for NTD, while 15-820 additional B12 cases were predicted. Compared with no fortification, all post-fortification strategies provided QALY gains and cost savings for all subgroups, with predicted population benefits of 266 649 QALY gained and $3.6 billion saved in the long run by changing the fortification level from 140 mug/100 g enriched grain to 700 mug/100 g.

5500,Economic evaluation of sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence,"BACKGROUND: Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is an established treatment for faecal incontinence in patients who have failed conservative management. This study established the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with SNS compared with non-surgical treatment. METHODS: A decision analysis model was performed. Data from 70 patients were obtained from medical records, bowel habit diaries and Short Form 36 quality of life questionnaires. Direct medical and non-medical costs were ascertained using the 2005/2006 national tariff, national statistics, and medication, pad and device costs. Indirect non-medical costs were also estimated. RESULTS: Incontinence episodes were reduced from a median of 12 per fortnight at baseline to one per fortnight with SNS. Based on direct medical and non-medical costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for SNS was pound25 070 per QALY gained. It cost pound1038 more per year to treat patients with SNS for a median reduction of 286 incontinence episodes, equating to pound3.63 per episode reduced. When indirect non-medical costs were included the ICER was reduced to pound12 959 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The ICER of pound25 070 is within the pound30 000 per QALY threshold recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as an effective use of National Health Service resources with proper justification.",2008-01-04721,18581439,J Clin Psychopharmacol,T C Dudding,2008,95 / 9,1155-63,No,18581439,"T C Dudding; E Meng Lee; O Faiz; D Parés; C J Vaizey; A McGuire; M A Kamm; Economic evaluation of sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence, J Clin Psychopharmacol, 2008-Sep; 95(9):0271-0749; 1155-63",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sacral nerve stimulation vs. Non-surgical treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,25070,United Kingdom,2006,59327.82
