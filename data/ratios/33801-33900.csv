33839,Impact and cost-effectiveness of potential interventions against infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 131 low-income and middle-income countries using a static cohort model.,"OBJECTIVES: Interventions to prevent childhood respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease are limited and costly. New interventions are in advanced stages of development and could be available soon. This study aims to evaluate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of two interventions to prevent childhood RSV-a maternal vaccine and a monoclonal antibody (mAb). DESIGN: Using a static population-based cohort model, we evaluate impact and cost-effectiveness of RSV interventions, from a health systems perspective. The assumed baseline efficacy and duration of protection were higher for the mAb (60%-70% efficacy, protection 6 months) compared with the maternal vaccine (40%-60% efficacy, protection 3 months). Both interventions were evaluated at US$3 and US$5 per dose for Gavi and non-Gavi countries, respectively. A range of input values were considered to explore uncertainty. SETTINGS: 131 low-income and middle-income countries. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women and live birth cohorts. INTERVENTIONS: Maternal vaccine given to pregnant women and mAb given to young infants. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life years averted, severe case averted, deaths averted, incremental cost effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, maternal vaccine and mAbs were projected to avert 25% and 55% of RSV-related deaths among infants younger than 6 months of age, respectively. The average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per disability-adjusted life year averted was US$1342 (range US$800-US$1866) for maternal RSV vaccine and US$431 (range US$167-US$692) for mAbs. At a 50% gross domestic product per capita threshold, maternal vaccine and mAbs were cost-effective in 60 and 118 countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions are projected to be impactful and cost-effective in many countries, a finding that would be enhanced if country-specific Gavi cofinancing to eligible countries were included. mAbs, with assumed higher efficacy and duration of protection, are expected to be more cost-effective than RSV maternal vaccines at similar prices.

The average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per disability-adjusted life year averted was US$1342 (range US$800-US$1866) for maternal RSV vaccine and US$431 (range US$167-US$692) for mAbs. At a 50% gross domestic product per capita threshold, maternal vaccine and mAbs were cost-effective in 60 and 118 countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions are projected to be impactful and cost-effective in many countries, a finding that would be enhanced if country-specific Gavi cofinancing to eligible countries were included. mAbs, with assumed higher efficacy and duration of protection, are expected to be more cost-effective than RSV maternal vaccines at similar prices.

DESIGN: Using a static population-based cohort model, we evaluate impact and cost-effectiveness of RSV interventions, from a health systems perspective. The assumed baseline efficacy and duration of protection were higher for the mAb (60%-70% efficacy, protection 6 months) compared with the maternal vaccine (40%-60% efficacy, protection 3 months). Both interventions were evaluated at US$3 and US$5 per dose for Gavi and non-Gavi countries, respectively. A range of input values were considered to explore uncertainty. SETTINGS: 131 low-income and middle-income countries. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women and live birth cohorts. INTERVENTIONS: Maternal vaccine given to pregnant women and mAb given to young infants. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life years averted, severe case averted, deaths averted, incremental cost effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, maternal vaccine and mAbs were projected to avert 25% and 55% of RSV-related deaths among infants younger than 6 months of age, respectively. The average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per disability-adjusted life year averted was US$1342 (range US$800-US$1866) for maternal RSV vaccine and US$431 (range US$167-US$692) for mAbs. At a 50% gross domestic product per capita threshold, maternal vaccine and mAbs were cost-effective in 60 and 118 countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions are projected to be impactful and cost-effective in many countries, a finding that would be enhanced if country-specific Gavi cofinancing to eligible countries were included. mAbs, with assumed higher efficacy and duration of protection, are expected to be more cost-effective than RSV maternal vaccines at similar prices.

33863,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Ultrasound Screening for Thyroid Cancer in Asymptomatic Adults.,"Objectives: This study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer compared with non-screening in asymptomatic adults. Methods: Applying a Markov decision-tree model with effectiveness and cost data from literature, we compared the long-term cost-effectiveness of the two strategies: ultrasound screening and non-screening for thyroid cancer. A one-way sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to verify the stability of model results. Results: The cumulative cost of screening for thyroid cancer was $18,819.24, with 18.74 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), whereas the cumulative cost of non-screening was $15,864.28, with 18.71 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $106,947.50/QALY greatly exceeded the threshold of $50,000. The result of the one-way sensitivity analysis showed that the utility values of benign nodules and utility of health after thyroid cancer surgery would affect the results. Conclusions: Ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer has no obvious advantage in terms of cost-effectiveness compared with non-screening.

33868,Cost-utility of triple versus dual inhaler therapy in moderate to severe asthma.,"BACKGROUND: An important proportion of asthma patients remain uncontrolled despite using inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Clinical guidelines recommend, in these patients, using add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists (triple therapy) to treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids-long-acting beta2-agonist (dual therapy). The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of triple therapy versus dual therapy for patients with severe asthma. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with severe asthma in Colombia. Total costs and QALYS of dual and triple therapy were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $19,000. RESULTS: The model suggests a potential gain of 1.55 QALYs per patient per year on triple therapy with respect to dual therapy. We observed a difference of US$304 in discounted cost per person-year on triple therapy with respect to dual therapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$196 in the probabilistic model. In the sensitivity analysis, our base-case results were robust to variations in all assumptions and parameters. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, triple therapy in patients with moderate-severe asthma was cost-effective.

33871,Cost-effectiveness of Radiofrequency Denervation for Zygapophyseal Joint Pain.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability. Radiofrequency denervation (RFD) is effective when performed according to guidelines for patients with correctly diagnosed zygapophyseal joint pain (ZJP). However, the cost-effectiveness of this method has not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze whether RFD is cost-effective for ZJP from a societal perspective. STUDY DESIGN: Cost effectiveness study based on an observational study. SETTING: An interventional pain management clinic in central Sweden. METHODS: Patients - This cost-effectiveness study was performed for all patients (n = 873) assessed between 2010 and 2016 at a specialized interventional pain clinic in Sweden. Those diagnosed with ZJP (n = 331, 37.9%) were treated with RFD and followed up for 1 year after the RFD. Using data collected from national registers, we determined the health care costs, medication costs, the patients' time and travel costs, and the patients' ability to work. The effects of RFD on quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and cost/QALY gained were calculated. RESULTS: On average, patients reported very low health-related quality of life (HRQoL; EQ-5D index: 0.212). After RFD, HRQoL increased significantly to 0.530 (P < 0.0001). Drug consumption and specialized health care consumption were reduced by 54% and 81%, respectively, and the cost/QALY gained from a societal perspective was 221,324 Swedish krona (USD ~26,008). The sensitivity analysis showed that the treatment was cost-effective in all scenarios evaluated, using the patients as their own controls. The cost/QALY gained from a health care perspective was 72,749 Swedish krona (USD ~8,548). LIMITATIONS: The results are based on data collected at one center. The results need to be compared with those from pain rehabilitation programs and should be confirmed using data from other centers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients referred for RFD in Sweden report extremely low HRQoL. HRQoL significantly increased following RFD in patients with ZJP. Medications and health care consumption decreased after RFD. RFD was cost-effective, and the sensitivity analysis yielded stable results in different scenarios. Therefore, RFD is a cost-effective treatment that meets the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare criteria for a high priority treatment.

Design: A registry-based pre-post study linking patient-level data from the Good Life with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D) registry to national registries in Denmark. Setting and participants: 16 255 patients with symptomatic knee or hip OA attending GLA:D. Intervention: GLA:D is a structured supervised patient education and exercise programme delivered by certified physiotherapists and implemented in Denmark. Outcome measures: Adjusted healthcare costs per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained from baseline to 1 year (ratio of change in healthcare costs to change in EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Level questionnaire (EQ-5D)). All adjusted measures were estimated using a generalised estimating equation gamma regression model for repeated measures. Missing data on EQ-5D were imputed with Multiple Imputations (3 months: 23%; 1 year: 39 %). Results: Adjusted change in healthcare cost was 298€ (95% CI: 206 to 419) and 640€ (95% CI: 400 to 1009) and change in EQ-5D was 0.035 (95% CI: 0.033 to 0.037) and 0.028 (95% CI: 0.025 to 0.032) for knee and hip patients, respectively.

Design: A registry-based pre-post study linking patient-level data from the Good Life with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D) registry to national registries in Denmark. Setting and participants: 16 255 patients with symptomatic knee or hip OA attending GLA:D. Intervention: GLA:D is a structured supervised patient education and exercise programme delivered by certified physiotherapists and implemented in Denmark. Outcome measures: Adjusted healthcare costs per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained from baseline to 1 year (ratio of change in healthcare costs to change in EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Level questionnaire (EQ-5D)). All adjusted measures were estimated using a generalised estimating equation gamma regression model for repeated measures. Missing data on EQ-5D were imputed with Multiple Imputations (3 months: 23%; 1 year: 39 %). Results: Adjusted change in healthcare cost was 298€ (95% CI: 206 to 419) and 640€ (95% CI: 400 to 1009) and change in EQ-5D was 0.035 (95% CI: 0.033 to 0.037) and 0.028 (95% CI: 0.025 to 0.032) for knee and hip patients, respectively.

33876,Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of a guided self-help head and neck exercise program for patients treated with total laryngectomy: Results of a multi-center randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES: The guided self-help exercise program called In Tune without Cords (ITwC) is effective in improving swallowing problems and communication among patients treated with a total laryngectomy (TL). This study investigated the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of ITwC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients within 5 years after TL were included in this randomized controlled trial. Patients in the intervention group (n = 46) received access to the self-help exercise program with flexibility, range-of-motion and lymphedema exercises, and a self-care education program. Patients in the control group (n = 46) received access to the self-care education program only. Healthcare utilization (iMCQ), productivity losses (iPCQ), health status (EQ-5D-3L, EORTC QLU-C10D) and swallowing problems (SwalQol) were measured at baseline, 3- and 6-months follow-up. Hospital costs were extracted from medical files. Mean total costs and effects (quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or SwalQol score) were compared with regression analyses using bias-corrected accelerated bootstrapping. RESULTS: Mean total costs were non-significantly lower (-€685) and QALYs were significantly higher (+0.06) in the intervention compared to the control group. The probability that the intervention is less costly and more effective was 73%. Sensitivity analyses with adjustment for baseline costs and EQ-5D scores showed non-significantly higher costs (+€119 to +€364) and QALYs (+0.02 to +0.03). A sensitivity analysis using the QLU-C10D to calculate QALYs showed higher costs (+€741) and lower QALYs (-0.01) and an analysis that used the SwalQol showed higher costs (+€232) and higher effects (improvement of 6 points on a 0-100 scale). CONCLUSION: ITwC is likely to be effective, but possibly at higher expenses.

33877,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of 12-Versus 4-Weekly Administration of Bone-Targeted Agents in Patients with Bone Metastases from Breast and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"A cost-utility analysis was performed based on the Rethinking Clinical Trials (REaCT) bone-targeted agents (BTA) clinical trial that compared 12-weekly (once every 12 weeks) (n = 130) versus 4-weekly (once every 4 weeks) (n = 133) BTA dosing for metastatic breast and castration-resistant prostate (CRPC) cancer. Using a decision tree model, we calculated treatment and symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) costs as well as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each treatment option. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the study findings. The total cost of BTA treatment in Canadian dollars (C$) and estimated QALYs was C$8965.03 and 0.605 QALY in the 4-weekly group versus C$5669.95 and 0.612 QALY in the 12-weekly group, respectively. De-escalation from 4-weekly to 12-weekly BTA reduces cost (C$3293.75) and improves QALYs by 0.008 unit, suggesting that 12-weekly BTA dominates 4-weekly BTA in breast and CRPC patients with bone metastases. Sensitivity analysis suggests high levels of uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness findings.

33878,The price is right: Routine fluorescent cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Background: Early experience with indocyanine green-based fluorescent cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy suggests the potential to improve outcomes. However, the cost-effectiveness of routine use has not been studied. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fluorescent cholangiography versus standard bright light laparoscopic cholecystectomy for noncancerous gallbladder disease. Methods: A Markov model decision analysis was performed comparing fluorescent cholangiography versus standard bright light laparoscopic cholecystectomy alone. Probabilities of outcomes, survival, toxicities, quality-adjusted life-years, and associated costs were determined from literature review and pooled analysis of currently available studies on fluorescent cholangiography (n = 37). Uncertainty in the model parameters was evaluated with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying parameters up to 40% of their means. Cost-effectiveness was measured with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as the dollar amount per quality-adjusted life-year. Results: The model predicted that fluorescent cholangiography reduces lifetime costs by $1,235 per patient and improves effectiveness by 0.09 quality-adjusted life-years compared to standard bright light laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Reduced costs were due to a decreased operative duration (21.20 minutes, P < .0001) and rate of conversion to open (1.62% vs 6.70%, P < .0001) associated with fluorescent cholangiography. The model was not influenced by the rate of bile duct injury. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that fluorescent cholangiography was both more effective and less costly in 98.83% of model iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year. Conclusion: The current evidence favors routine use of fluorescent cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a cost-effective surgical strategy. Our model predicts that fluorescent cholangiography reduces costs while improving health outcomes, suggesting fluorescence imaging may be considered standard surgical management for noncancerous gallbladder disease. Further study with prospective trials should be considered to verify findings of this predictive model.",2021-01-41732,34952715,Surgery,"Reeves, J Jeffery",2021,/,,No,34952715,"Reeves, J Jeffery; Ryan Broderick; Arielle Lee; Rachel Blitzer; Ruth Waterman; Joslin Cheverie; Garth Jacobsen; Bryan Sandler; Michael Bouvet; Jay Doucet; James Murphy; Santiago Horgan; The price is right: Routine fluorescent cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy., Surgery, 2021 Dec 21; ():",QALY,United States of America,"Disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas","Medical Procedure, Surgical",indocyanine green based near-infrared fluorescent cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy vs. standard bright light laparoscopic cholecystectomy,noncancerous,45 Years,45 Years,Female,Full,"35 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-13718,United States,2020,-14362.47
33879,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a single-inhaler triple therapy for COPD in the UK.,"UK management costs for COPD, estimated at £1.9 billion/year, are rising. In the FULFIL (Lung Function and Quality of Life Assessment in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Closed Triple Therapy) study, single-inhaler triple therapy with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (100/62.5/25 µg) improved clinical outcomes versus budesonide/formoterol (400/12 µg) in patients with symptomatic COPD at risk of exacerbations. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol versus budesonide/formoterol for treating COPD from a UK National Health Service perspective. A model was developed combining a trial-based and Markov component and populated with baseline and treatment effect data from FULFIL, together with UK healthcare resource costs and disease-related utilities. Costs per life year and per quality-adjusted life year gained (costing year 2017) for fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol versus budesonide/formoterol were calculated for a lifetime horizon. Results were explored using deterministic sensitivity, scenario and probabilistic analyses. Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol was associated with gains in life years (0.533) and quality-adjusted life years (0.506) versus budesonide/formoterol, but at slightly increased total costs (£26 416 versus £25 860). This translated to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £1042/life year and £1098/quality-adjusted life year for fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol versus budesonide/formoterol. In scenario analyses, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from dominant to £1547/quality-adjusted life year gained.

33880,Cost Analysis of Volar Plate Fixation Versus Plaster Cast Immobilization for Intra-Articular Distal Radial Fractures.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility between plaster cast immobilization and volar plate fixation for acceptably reduced intra-articular distal radial fractures. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial comparing operative (volar plate fixation) with nonoperative (plaster cast immobilization) treatment in patients between 18 and 75 years old with an acceptably reduced intra-articular distal radial fracture. Health-care utilization and use of resources per patient were documented prospectively and included direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The mean total cost per patient was $291 (95% bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval [bcaCI] = -$1,286 to $1,572) higher in the operative group compared with the nonoperative group. The mean total number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained at 12 months was significantly higher in the operative group than in the nonoperative group (mean difference = 0.15; 95% bcaCI = 0.056 to 0.243). The difference in the cost per QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) was $2,008 (95% bcaCI = -$9,608 to $18,222) for the operative group compared with the nonoperative group, which means that operative treatment is more effective but also more expensive. Subgroup analysis including only patients with a paid job showed that the ICER was -$3,500 per QALY for the operative group with a paid job compared with the nonoperative group with a paid job, meaning that operative treatment is more effective and less expensive for patients with a paid job. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in QALYs gained for the operatively treated group was equivalent to an additional 55 days of perfect health per year. In adult patients with an acceptably reduced intra-articular distal radial fracture, operative treatment is a cost-effective intervention, especially in patients with paid employment. Operative treatment is slightly more expensive than nonoperative treatment but provides better functional results and a better quality of life.

33881,Cost-effectiveness of field trauma triage among injured children transported by emergency medical services.,"BACKGROUND: A pediatric field triage strategy that meets the national policy benchmark of ≥95% sensitivity would likely improve health outcomes but increase heath care costs. Our objective was to compare the cost-effectiveness of current pediatric field triage practices to an alternative field triage strategy that meets the national policy benchmark of ≥95% sensitivity. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision-analysis Markov model to compare the outcomes and costs of the two strategies. We used a prospectively collected cohort of 3507 (probability weighted, unweighted n = 2832) injured children transported by 44 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies to 28 trauma and non-trauma centers in the Northwestern United States from 1/1/2011 to 12/31/2011 to derive the alternative field triage strategy and to populate model probability and cost inputs for both strategies. We compared the two strategies by calculating quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs over a time horizon from the time of injury until death. We set an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of less than $100,000 per QALY for the alternative field triage to be a cost-effective strategy. RESULTS: Current pediatric field triage practices had a sensitivity of 87.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.9 to 95.0%) and a specificity of 82.3% (95% CI 81.0 to 83.5%) and the alternative field triage strategy had a sensitivity of 97.3% (95% CI 82.6 to 99.6%) and a specificity of 46.1% (95% CI 43.8 to 48.4%). The alternative field triage strategy would cost $476,396 per QALY gained compared to current pediatric field triage practices and thus would not be a cost-effective strategy. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar findings. CONCLUSION: Current field triage practices do not meet national policy benchmarks for sensitivity. However, an alternative field triage strategy that meets the national policy benchmark of ≥95% sensitivity is not a cost-effective strategy.",2021-01-41727,34536721,Am J Emerg Med,Daniel Nishijima,2021,50 /,492-500,No,34536721,"Daniel Nishijima; Zhuo Yang; Craig Newgard; Cost-effectiveness of field trauma triage among injured children transported by emergency medical services., Am J Emerg Med, 2021 Dec; 50():; 492-500",QALY,"United States of America, United States of America",Injuries involving multiple body regions,Care Delivery,alternative triage strategy vs. current pediatric field triage strategy,injured children transported by emergency medical services to hospitals,14 Years,0 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,476396,United States,2019,504930.53
