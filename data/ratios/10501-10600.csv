10501,Economic evaluation of different treatment modalities in acute kidney injury,"Major controversy exists regarding the preferred treatment option for acute kidney injury (AKI). The purpose of this study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) versus intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) and conservative (CONS) AKI treatment in Belgium.An area-under-the-curve model based on survival analysis was used to estimate costs and health outcomes using a 2-year time horizon. Input data were derived from the multi-centre Stuivenberg Hospital Acute Renal Failure 4 study.Analyses indicated that in-hospital mortality, hospitalization costs and hospital length of stay differed significantly between treatment modes. Follow-up mortality rates and follow-up cost per day showed no significant difference between the treatment modes. Utility values, which improved gradually after admission to the hospital, revealed no significant differences between the three treatment strategies. CONS treatment was associated with a 2-year cost of 33,802? and 0.54 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The CRRT was the most expensive therapy with a cost of 51,365? leading to 0.57 QALYs. The cost and QALYs associated with IRRT were 43,445? and 0.50, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated the 'in-hospital mortality' as the variable with the greatest influence on the results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in a significant difference in treatment costs but no significant difference in QALY gain.This study has indicated that the most expensive treatment (CRRT) associated with an incremental cost of approximately ?7920 generates only a minor non-significant increase in QALYs of 0.07 compared with IRRT. Additionally, the results revealed that the RRTs did not result in a significant increase in QALYs despite their higher cost compared with the CONS treatment. From a health economic perspective, the latter seems to be the preferred treatment strategy.",2012-01-10024,23144072,Nephrol Dial Transplant,Delphine M De Smedt,2012,27 / 11,4095-101,No,23144072,"Delphine M De Smedt; Monique M Elseviers; Robert L Lins; Lieven Annemans; Economic evaluation of different treatment modalities in acute kidney injury, Nephrol Dial Transplant, ; 27(11):0931-0509; 4095-101",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) vs. Conservative (CONS) acute kidney injury (AKI) treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-242896.72,Euro,2010,-381539.6

10503,Cost-effectiveness of candesartan versus losartan in the primary preventive treatment of hypertension,"Although angiotensin receptor blockers have different receptor binding properties, no comparative randomized studies with cardiovascular event endpoints have been performed for this class of drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of candesartan (Atacand(?)) versus generic losartan in the primary preventive treatment of hypertension.A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes over a patient's lifetime.

Costs and quality of life data were from published sources. Costs were in Swedish kronor and the outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).Due to reduced rates of cardiovascular complications, candesartan was associated with a QALY gain and lower health care costs compared with generic losartan (0.053 QALYs gained and reduced costs of approximately 4700 Swedish kronor for women; and 0.057 QALYs gained and reduced costs of approximately 4250 Swedish kronor for men).

10505,An exercise intervention to prevent falls in Parkinson's: an economic evaluation,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's (PwP) experience frequent and recurrent falls. As these falls may have devastating consequences, there is an urgent need to identify cost-effective interventions with the potential to reduce falls in PwP. The purpose of this economic evaluation is to compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of a targeted exercise programme versus usual care for PwP who were at risk of falling. METHODS: One hundred and thirty participants were recruited through specialist clinics, primary care and Parkinson's support groups and randomised to either an exercise intervention or usual care. Health and social care utilisation and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) were assessed over the 20 weeks of the study (ten-week intervention period and ten-week follow up period), and these data were complete for 93 participants. Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was estimated. The uncertainty around costs and QALYs was represented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The mean cost of the intervention was [pound sign]76 per participant. Although in direction of favour of exercise intervention, there was no statistically significant differences between groups in total healthcare (-[pound sign]128, 95% CI: -734 to 478), combined health and social care costs ([pound sign]-35, 95% CI: -817 to 746) or QALYs (0.03, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.03) at 20 weeks. Nevertheless, exploration of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates suggests there is more than 80% probability that the exercise intervention is a cost-effective strategy relative to usual care. CONCLUSION: Whilst we found no difference between groups in total healthcare, total social care cost and QALYs, analyses indicate that there is high probability that the exercise intervention is cost-effective compared with usual care.

10507,Targeted screening for Coeliac Disease among irritable bowel syndrome patients: analysis of cost-effectiveness and value of information,"OBJECTIVES: A high prevalence of Coeliac Disease (CD) is found among patients with a clinical diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared to the general population. Symptoms of CD are quite similar to IBS, but its treatment is different. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for CD in patients with diarrhoea/mixed type IBS (IBS-D/mix) in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in the Netherlands. METHODS: A decision model was constructed to evaluate the costs and health benefits of serological testing followed by confirmatory endoscopy with biopsy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to examine the effect of parameter uncertainty. Finally, the budget impact of implementing the screening process was also computed for implementation over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Screening resulted in an increase of about 0.07 quality life years (QALYs) per patient over a lifetime horizon. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was about 6,200 euro/QALY compared to no screening. The PSA showed that the uncertainty in cost effectiveness results is not considerable. The value of information analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. Screening all current patients with diarrhea/mixed type IBS would require a total budget of about 25 million Euros over a 10 year time period. CONCLUSION: Screening patients with IBS-D or IBS-mix for CD is almost certainly cost-effective.

10513,Alzheimer's dementia: budget impact and cost-utility analysis of a combination treatment of a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine in Switzerland,"The objective of this study was to estimate the potential budget impact and cost-effectiveness of the combination treatment of a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine in Switzerland.The prevalence of dementia according to European sources and future Swiss population data were used to estimate the number of patients with Alzheimer's dementia in Switzerland. Both direct and indirect costs calculated from Swiss sources were included. Utility estimates and transition probabilities were obtained from the published literature. A Markov model was used for the cost-utility analysis in order to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from a health care and a societal perspective.Assuming mono treatment (either a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine), treatment costs would increase from CHF 22.7 million in 2012 to CHF 26.1 million in 2016, the additional yearly treatment costs for the combination treatment (cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine) would be between CHF 1.7 million and CHF 1.9 million. The Markov model compared health care costs of the mono treatment to costs of the combination treatment over five years.

10514,Alzheimer's dementia: budget impact and cost-utility analysis of a combination treatment of a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine in Switzerland,"The objective of this study was to estimate the potential budget impact and cost-effectiveness of the combination treatment of a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine in Switzerland.The prevalence of dementia according to European sources and future Swiss population data were used to estimate the number of patients with Alzheimer's dementia in Switzerland. Both direct and indirect costs calculated from Swiss sources were included. Utility estimates and transition probabilities were obtained from the published literature. A Markov model was used for the cost-utility analysis in order to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from a health care and a societal perspective.Assuming mono treatment (either a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine), treatment costs would increase from CHF 22.7 million in 2012 to CHF 26.1 million in 2016, the additional yearly treatment costs for the combination treatment (cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine) would be between CHF 1.7 million and CHF 1.9 million. The Markov model compared health care costs of the mono treatment to costs of the combination treatment over five years. From a health care perspective, the combination treatment saved CHF 27,655 per patient over five years and CHF 248,895/quality adjusted life year compared to the mono treatment.Implementation of the reimbursed combination treatment would incur additional treatment costs of about CHF 10 million over five years.

10515,"Rehabilitation in advanced, progressive, recurrent cancer: a randomized controlled trial","CONTEXT: Two million people across the U.K. are living with cancer, often experienced as a long-term condition. They may have unmet needs after active treatment. Rehabilitation aims to address these needs, maximize psychological and physical function, and enable minimum dependency regardless of life expectancy. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test, in a randomized controlled trial, the clinical and cost effectiveness of a rehabilitation intervention for patients with advanced, recurrent cancer. METHODS: We conducted a two-arm, wait-list control, randomized trial of a complex rehabilitation intervention delivered by a hospice-based multidisciplinary team vs. usual care for active, progressive, recurrent hematological and breast malignancies, with a follow-up at three months. The primary outcome was the psychological subscale of the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS). Secondary outcomes were other domains of the SCNS, psychological status, continuity of care, quality of life, and resource use. RESULTS: Forty-one participants were enrolled and 36 completed the trial. The primary outcome was significantly lower in the intervention arm (adjusted difference -16.8, 95% CI -28.34 to -5.3; P = 0.006). The SCNS physical and patient care subscales (-14.2, 95% CI -26.2 to -2.2; P = 0.02 and -7.4, 95% CI -13.7 to -1.1; P = 0.02, respectively) and self-reported health state (12.8, 95% CI 3.2 to 22.4; P = 0.01) also differed significantly. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound19,390 per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION: This intervention significantly reduced the unmet needs of cancer survivors and it is likely that it is cost-effective. Despite small numbers, the main effect size was robust. We recommend implementation alongside evaluation in wider clinical settings and patient populations.",2012-01-10081,23182307,J Pain Symptom Manage,Louise Jones,2013,46 / 3,,No,23182307,"Louise Jones; Gail Fitzgerald; Baptiste Leurent; Jeffrey Round; Jane Eades; Sarah Davis; Faye Gishen; Amanda Holman; Katherine Hopkins; Adrian Tookman; Rehabilitation in advanced, progressive, recurrent cancer: a randomized controlled trial, J Pain Symptom Manage, 2013 Sep; 46(3):0885-3924",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Complex rehabilitation intervention delivered by a hospice-based multidisciplinary team vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,19391,United Kingdom,2010,35530.55
10516,Genetic testing in combination with preventive donepezil treatment for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment : an exploratory economic evaluation of personalized medicine,"To evaluate the cost effectiveness of genetic screening for the apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 allele in combination with preventive donepezil treatment in comparison with the standard of care for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AMCI) patients in Canada.We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model with a societal perspective and a time horizon of 30?years. For each strategy, we calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), using utilities from the literature. Costs were also based on the literature and, when appropriate, Ontario sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis was conducted to explore the value of future research.The base case results in our exploratory study suggest that the combination of genetic testing and preventive donepezil treatment resulted in a gain of 0.027 QALYs and an incremental cost of $1,015 (in 2009 Canadian dollars [Can$]), compared with the standard of care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the base case was Can$38,016 per QALY. The ICER was sensitive to the effectiveness of donepezil in slowing the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD), utility in AMCI patients, and AD and donepezil treatment costs. EVPI analysis showed that additional information on these parameters would be of value.Using presently available clinical evidence, this exploratory study illustrates that genetic testing combined with preventive donepezil treatment for AMCI patients may be economically attractive. Since our results were based on a secondary post hoc analysis, our study alone is insufficient to warrant recommending APOE genotyping in AMCI patients. Future research on the effectiveness of preventive donepezil as a targeted therapy is recommended.",2012-01-10088,23188525,Mol Diagn Ther,Sandjar Djalalov,2012,16 / 6,389-99,No,23188525,"Sandjar Djalalov; Jean Yong; Jaclyn Beca; Sandra Black; Gustavo Saposnik; Zahra Musa; Katherine Siminovitch; Myla Moretti; Jeffrey S Hoch; Genetic testing in combination with preventive donepezil treatment for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment : an exploratory economic evaluation of personalized medicine, Mol Diagn Ther, ; 16(6):1177-1062; 389-99",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for apolipoprotein (APOE) E4 followed by donepezil in carriers and non-carriers monitoried until development of Alzheimer's disease vs. Standard of care (monitored until Alzheimer's disease progression),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,38016,Canada,2009,40373.68
10517,Cost-effectiveness of lumbar artificial intervertebral disc replacement: driven by the choice of comparator,"BACKGROUND: Lower back pain is a common and costly condition in Australia. This paper aims to conduct an economic evaluation of lumbar artificial intervertebral disc replacement (AIDR) compared with lumbar fusion for the treatment of patients suffering from significant axial back pain and/or radicular (nerve root) pain, secondary to disc degeneration or prolapse, who have failed conservative treatment. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness approach was used to compare costs and benefits of AIDR to five fusion approaches. Resource use was based on Medicare Benefits Schedule claims data and expert opinion. Effectiveness and re-operation rates were based on published randomized controlled trials. The key clinical outcomes considered were narcotic medication discontinuation, achievement of overall clinical success, achievement of Oswestry Disability Index success and quality-adjusted life-years gained. RESULTS: AIDR was estimated to be cost-saving compared with fusion overall ($1600/patient); however, anterior lumbar interbody fusion and posterolateral fusion were less costly by $2155 and $807, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness depends on the outcome considered and the comparator.

10519,Screening and rapid molecular diagnosis of tuberculosis in prisons in Russia and eastern europe: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Prisons of the former Soviet Union (FSU) have high rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and are thought to drive general population tuberculosis (TB) epidemics. Effective prison case detection, though employing more expensive technologies, may reduce long-term treatment costs and slow MDR-TB transmission.We developed a dynamic transmission model of TB and drug resistance matched to the epidemiology and costs in FSU prisons. We evaluated eight strategies for TB screening and diagnosis involving, alone or in combination, self-referral, symptom screening, mass miniature radiography (MMR), and sputum PCR with probes for rifampin resistance (Xpert MTB/RIF). Over a 10-y horizon, we projected costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and TB and MDR-TB prevalence. Using sputum PCR as an annual primary screening tool among the general prison population most effectively reduced overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.31%) and MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.63%), and cost US$543/QALY for additional QALYs gained compared to MMR screening with sputum PCR reserved for rapid detection of MDR-TB. Adding sputum PCR to the currently used strategy of annual MMR screening was cost-saving over 10 y compared to MMR screening alone, but produced only a modest reduction in MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.69%) and had minimal effect on overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.74%). Strategies based on symptom screening alone were less effective and more expensive than MMR-based strategies. Study limitations included scarce primary TB time-series data in FSU prisons and uncertainties regarding screening test characteristics.In prisons of the FSU, annual screening of the general inmate population with sputum PCR most effectively reduces TB and MDR-TB prevalence, doing so cost-effectively. If this approach is not feasible, the current strategy of annual MMR is both more effective and less expensive than strategies using self-referral or symptom screening alone, and the addition of sputum PCR for rapid MDR-TB detection may be cost-saving over time.

We evaluated eight strategies for TB screening and diagnosis involving, alone or in combination, self-referral, symptom screening, mass miniature radiography (MMR), and sputum PCR with probes for rifampin resistance (Xpert MTB/RIF). Over a 10-y horizon, we projected costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and TB and MDR-TB prevalence. Using sputum PCR as an annual primary screening tool among the general prison population most effectively reduced overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.31%) and MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.63%), and cost US$543/QALY for additional QALYs gained compared to MMR screening with sputum PCR reserved for rapid detection of MDR-TB. Adding sputum PCR to the currently used strategy of annual MMR screening was cost-saving over 10 y compared to MMR screening alone, but produced only a modest reduction in MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.69%) and had minimal effect on overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.74%). Strategies based on symptom screening alone were less effective and more expensive than MMR-based strategies. Study limitations included scarce primary TB time-series data in FSU prisons and uncertainties regarding screening test characteristics.In prisons of the FSU, annual screening of the general inmate population with sputum PCR most effectively reduces TB and MDR-TB prevalence, doing so cost-effectively. If this approach is not feasible, the current strategy of annual MMR is both more effective and less expensive than strategies using self-referral or symptom screening alone, and the addition of sputum PCR for rapid MDR-TB detection may be cost-saving over time.

10534,"How rebates, copayments, and administration costs affect the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis therapies","Because of rising drug expenditures, cost considerations have become essential, necessitating the requirement for cost-effectiveness analyses for managed care organizations (MCOs). The study objective is to examine the impact of various drug-cost components, in addition to wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), on the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis therapies.A Markov model of osteoporosis was used to exemplify different drug cost scenarios.We examined the effect of varying rebates for oral bisphosphonates--risedronate and ibandronate--as well as considering the impact of varying copayments and administration costs for intravenous zoledronate. The population modeled was 1,000 American women, > or = 50 years with osteoporosis. Patients were followed for 1 year to reflect an annual budget review of formularies by MCOs. The cost of therapy was based on an adjusted WAC, and is referred to as net drug cost. The total annual cost incurred by an MCO for each drug regimen was calculated using the net drug cost and fracture cost. We estimated cost on a quality adjusted life year (QALY) basis.When considering different rebates, results for risedronate versus ibandronate vary from cost-savings (i.e., costs less and more effective) to approximately $70,000 per QALY. With no risedronate rebate, an ibandronate rebate of approximately 65% is required before cost per QALY surpasses $50,000. With rebates greater than 25% for risedronate, irrespective of ibandronate rebates, results become cost-saving. Results also showed the magnitude of cost savings to the MCO varied by as much as 65% when considering no administration cost and the highest coinsurance rate for zoledronate.Our study showed that cost-effectiveness varies considerably when factors in addition to the WAC are considered.

10535,Cost-utility analysis of oral deferasirox versus infusional deferoxamine in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients,"BACKGROUND: Deferasirox (DFX) is a novel iron chelator that has been shown to have similar efficacy and safety compared with deferoxamine (DFO) in patients with beta-thalassemia. The aim of this study was to determine the cost utility of DFX versus DFO in beta-thalassemia major patients from Iran''s society perspective. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model has been developed to determine lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients. To estimate the annual cost of each method, a cross-sectional study was conducted among two groups of patients who received DFO and DFX (n = 100 and n = 45, respectively). Also a time trade-off method was used to estimate the utility of two strategies. Finally a one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the strength of the results. RESULTS: Our base-case analysis showed that estimated total lifetime costs per patient for DFX and DFO were 47,029 international dollar ($Int) and $Int143,522, respectively, while the estimated total discounted QALYs per person were 12.28 and 7.76, respectively. Calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio showed that DSX is a dominant therapy and its estimated lifetime net monetary benefit was $Int273,528. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the use of DFX instead of DFO represents a cost-effective use of resources for treatment of iron overload in patients with beta-thalassemia from Iran''s society perspective.",2012-01-10162,23241074,Transfusion,Ali Keshtkaran,2013,53 / 8,,No,23241074,"Ali Keshtkaran; Mehdi Javanbakht; Sedigheh Salavati; Atefeh Mashayekhi; Mehran Karimi; Bijan Nuri; Cost-utility analysis of oral deferasirox versus infusional deferoxamine in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, Transfusion, ; 53(8):0041-1132",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral deferasirox once daily vs. Deferoxamine (5 days per week),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated
10536,Cost-effectiveness of using a molecular diagnostic test to improve preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancer,"Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a safe and inexpensive diagnostic procedure for evaluating thyroid nodules.Up to 25% of the results from an FNAB, however, may not be diagnostic or may be indeterminate, leading to a subsequent diagnostic thyroid surgery. A new molecularly based diagnostic test could potentially reduce indeterminate cytological results and, with high accuracy, provide a definitive diagnosis for cancer in thyroid nodules. The aim of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of utilizing a molecular diagnostic (DX) test as an adjunct to FNAB, compared with NoDX, to improve the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules.We constructed a patient-level simulation model to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of using a DX test compared with current practice (NoDX) for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. By using a cost-effectiveness framework, we measured incremental clinical benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years and incremental costs over a 10-year time horizon.Assuming 95% sensitivity and specificity of the Dx test when used as an adjunct to FNAB, the utilization of the DX test resulted in a gain of 0.046 quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval 0.019-0.078) and a saving of $1087 (95% confidence interval $691-$1533) in direct costs per patient. If the cost of the Dx test is less than $1087 per test, we expect to save quality-adjusted life-years and reduce costs when it is utilized.

This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness and costs from a US societal perspective of a multigene recurrence score (RS) assay for patients recently diagnosed with stage II colon cancer (T3, proficient DNA mismatch repair) eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy.RS was compared with guideline-recommended clinicopathological factors (tumor stage, lymph nodes examined, tumor grade, and lymphovascular invasion) by using a state-transition (Markov) lifetime model. Data were obtained from published literature, a randomized controlled trial (QUick And Simple And Reliable) of adjuvant chemotherapy, and rates of chemotherapy use from the National Cooperative Cancer Network Colon/Rectum Cancer Outcomes study. Life-years, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime costs were examined.The RS is projected to reduce adjuvant chemotherapy use by 17% compared with current treatment patterns and to increase quality-adjusted life expectancy by an average of 0.035 years. Direct medical costs are expected to decrease by an average of $2971 per patient. The assay was cost saving for all subgroups of patients stratified by clinicopathologic factors. The most influential variables affecting treatment decisions were projected years of life remaining, recurrence score, and patients' disutilities associated with adjuvant chemotherapy.Use of the multigene RS to assess recurrence risk after surgery in stage II colon cancer (T3, proficient DNA mismatch repair) may reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without decreasing quality-adjusted life expectancy and be cost saving from a societal perspective.

10538,QuantiFERON-TB gold in-tube implementation for latent tuberculosis diagnosis in a public health clinic: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"ABSTRACT:The tuberculin skin test (TST) has limitations for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnosis in low-prevalence settings. Previously, all TST-positive individuals referred from the community to Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) were offered LTBI treatment, after active TB was excluded. In 2010, BCHD introduced adjunctive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) testing for TST-positive referrals. We evaluated costs and cost-effectiveness of this new diagnostic algorithm.A decision-analysis model compared the strategy of treating all TST-positive referrals versus only those with positive results on adjunctive QFT-GIT testing. Costs were collected at BCHD, and Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were utilized to report on cost-effectiveness.QFT-GIT testing at BCHD cost $43.51 per test. Implementation of QFT-GIT testing was associated with an ICER of $1,202 per quality-adjusted life-year gained and was considered highly cost-effective. In sensitivity analysis, the QFT-GIT strategy became cost-saving if QFT-GIT sensitivity increased above 92% or if less than 3.5% of individuals with LTBI progress to active TB disease.LTBI screening with TST in low-prevalence settings may lead to overtreatment and increased expenditures.

Studies have been reported to support effects of transitional care programs in reducing hospital readmissions and enhancing clinical outcomes. However, there is a paucity of studies executing full economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of these transitional care programs. This study is therefore launched to fill this knowledge gap.Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of a Health-Social Transitional Care Management Program (HSTCMP) for medical patients discharged from an acute regional hospital in Hong Kong. The cost and health outcomes were compared between the patients receiving the HSTCMP and usual care. The total costs comprised the pre-program, program, and healthcare utilization costs. Quality of life was measured with SF-36 and transformed to utility values between 0 and 1.The readmission rates within 28 (control 10.2%, study 4.0%) and 84 days (control 19.4%, study 8.1%) were significantly higher in the control group. Utility values showed no difference between the control and study groups at baseline (p?=?0.308). Utility values for the study group were significantly higher than in the control group at 28 (p?<?0.001) and 84 days (p?=?0.002).

Outcomes at baseline, 2, and 6 months included self-reported health, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), EuroQol, and exercise.Forty-four per cent responded to GP invitation, 116 were randomised: mean (standard deviation [SD]) age 69.5 (9.8) years, 46% male, 78% had unscheduled COPD care in the previous year. Forty per cent of intervention patients completed the course; 35% attended no sessions; and 78% participants completed the 6-month follow-up questionnaire. Results suggest that the intervention may increase both QoL (mean EQ-5D change 0.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.02 to 0.26) higher, intervention versus control) and exercise levels, but not SGRQ score. Economic analyses suggested that with thresholds of ?20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, the intervention is likely to be cost-effective.This intervention has good potential to meet the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence criteria for cost effectiveness, and further research is warranted.

10542,TIPP and Lichtenstein modalities for inguinal hernia repair: a cost minimisation analysis alongside a randomised trial,"The transinguinal preperitoneal (TIPP) technique using a soft mesh with a memory ring was developed recently for inguinal hernia repair. To compare TIPP with the Lichtenstein method, a randomised trial was conducted (ISRCTN93798494). The aim of this study was to perform an economic evaluation of the TIPP modality compared to the Lichtenstein modality from both a hospital and societal perspective alongside the clinical trial. The TULIP study was a double-blind randomised clinical trial comparing two techniques for inguinal hernia repair (TIPP and Lichtenstein). Correct generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up were used/applied according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook. Next to the cost drivers, the short-form-36 health survey (SF-36) data from the TULIP trial was used to determine utility. The SF-36 data from the TULIP trial were revised using the SF-6D algorithm according to Brazier. Two scenarios-a hospital and a societal perspective-were presented. If the analyses showed no difference in effects (on the SF-6D) the cost effectiveness decision rule to cost minimisation was altered. No significant difference in SF-6D utility between both modalities was found (mean difference: 0.888, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.23); consequently, the economic decision rule became cost minimisation. For the hospital perspective no significant differences in costs were found (mean difference: euro -13, 95% CI euro -130 to euro 104). However, when including productivity gains in the analysis, significant differences (P = 0.037) in costs favouring the TIPP modality (mean saving: euro 1,472, 95% CI euro 463- euro 2,714) were found. The results show that TIPP is a cost-saving inguinal hernia repair technique compared to the Lichtenstein modality against equal effectiveness expressed as quality adjusted life week at 1 year given a societal perspective. In the trial, TIPP patients showed on average a quicker recovery of 6.5 days compared to Lichtenstein patients.",2012-01-10204,23271350,Eur J Health Econ,G G Koning,2013,14 / 6,,Yes,23271350,"G G Koning; E M M Adang; P F M Stalmeier; F Keus; P W H E Vriens; C J H M van Laarhoven; TIPP and Lichtenstein modalities for inguinal hernia repair: a cost minimisation analysis alongside a randomised trial, Eur J Health Econ, ; 14(6):1618-7598",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transinguinal preperitoneal (TIPP) technique using a soft mesh with a memory ring vs. Lichtenstein technique,Not Stated,80 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1322.48,Euro,2010,-2077.34
10543,Accounting for increased non-target-disease-specific mortality in decision-analytic screening models for economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Positive screening results are often associated not only with target-disease-specific but also with non-target-disease-specific mortality. In general, this association is due to joint risk factors. Cost-effectiveness estimates based on decision-analytic models may be biased if this association is not reflected appropriately. OBJECTIVE: To develop a procedure for quantifying the degree of bias when an increase in non-target-disease-specific mortality is not considered. METHODS: We developed a family of parametric functions that generate hazard ratios (HRs) of non-target-disease-specific mortality between subjects screened positive and negative, with the HR of target-disease-specific mortality serving as the input variable. To demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure, we fitted a function within the context of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk screening, based on HRs related to different risk factors extracted from published studies. Estimates were embedded into a decision-analytic model, and the impact of ''modelling increased non-target-disease-specific mortality'' was assessed. RESULTS: In 55-year-old German men, based on a risk screening with 5% positively screened subjects, and a CAD risk ratio of 6 within the first year after screening, incremental quality-adjusted life-years were 19% higher and incremental costs were 8% lower if no adjustment was made.

10545,Cost-effectiveness analysis of SBRT versus IMRT for low-risk prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been established as the standard external-beam modality in treating low-risk prostate cancer. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a novel approach involving high-dose radiotherapy in 5 fractions. This analysis compared their cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to delineate the health states after treatment with IMRT and SBRT. Disease, treatment, and toxicity data were extracted from the literature. Costs included both robotic (R-SBRT) and nonrobotic (NR-SBRT) reimbursement. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed over a wide range of potential parameters. RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life expectancy after IMRT was slightly higher than after SBRT, because we assumed worse toxicity after SBRT. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for IMRT over R-SBRT and NR-SBRT were $285,000 and $591,100/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. On sensitivity analysis, SBRT was almost always the cost-effective therapy, in which the ICER for IMRT was generally over $100,000/QALY. Reimbursement for R-SBRT versus NR-SBRT significantly influenced its ICER. Treatment efficacy, rectal toxicity and impotence, and the potential for unforeseen SBRT late effects were the most critical parameters in the model; when including these uncertain parameters in a PSA, SBRT was still most likely to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY.

10547,Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid compared with clodronate in multiple myeloma,"In the U.K. Medical Research Council Myeloma IX trial (mmix), zoledronic acid 4 mg once every 3-4 weeks, compared with clodronate 1600 mg daily, reduced the incidence of skeletal related events (sres), increased progression-free survival (pfs), and prolonged overall survival (os) in 1970 patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma. The incidence of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw was higher with zoledronic acid than with clodronate. The objective of the present study was to evaluate, based on the findings in mmix, the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid compared with clodronate in patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma.An economic model was used to project pfs, os, the incidence of sres and adverse events, and expected lifetime health care costs for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are alternatively assumed to receive zoledronic acid or clodronate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of zoledronic acid compared with clodronate was calculated as the ratio of the difference in cost to the difference in quality-adjusted life years (qalys). Model inputs were based on results of mmix and published sources. Results were generated under different assumptions regarding the beneficial effects of zoledronic acid on os beyond 5 years after treatment initiation.Assuming lifetime treatment effects of zoledronic acid, treatment with zoledronic acid (compared with clodronate) increased qalys by 0.27 at an additional cost of CA$13,407, yielding an icer of CA$49,829 per qaly gained. If the threshold icer is CA$100,000 per qaly, the estimated probability that zoledronic acid is cost-effective is 80%. Assuming that the benefits of zoledronic acid on pfs and os diminish over 5 years beginning at the end of year 5, the icer is CAN$63,027 per qaly gained. If the benefits of zoledronic acid on pfs and os are assumed to persist for 5 years only, the icer is CAN$76,948 per qaly gained.Compared with clodronate, zoledronic acid represents a cost-effective treatment alternative in patients with multiple myeloma.",2012-01-10220,23300363,Curr Oncol,T E Delea,2012,19 / 6,e392-403,No,23300363,"T E Delea; K El Ouagari; J Rotter; A Wang; S Kaura; G J Morgan; Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid compared with clodronate in multiple myeloma, Curr Oncol, ; 19(6):1198-0052; e392-403",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3-4 weeks) vs. Bisphosphonate therapy with clodronate (1600 mg daily),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,49829,Canada,2010,57450.55

Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) are not routinely administered to patients at risk for delivery between 34 and 36 6/7 weeks. Our objective was to determine whether ACS are cost-effective for late-preterm infants at risk for imminent preterm delivery. We hypothesized that the preferred strategy <36 weeks would include ACS while the preferred strategy =36 weeks would not. Methods. We performed decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness analyses to determine whether ACS was cost-effective at 34, 35, and 36 weeks. We conducted a literature review to determine probability, utility, and cost estimates absent of patient-level data. Base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, univariable sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation were performed. A threshold of $100,000/QALY was considered cost-effective. Results.

10550,Antenatal corticosteroids for late-preterm infants: a decision-analytic and economic analysis,"Objectives. Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) are not routinely administered to patients at risk for delivery between 34 and 36 6/7 weeks. Our objective was to determine whether ACS are cost-effective for late-preterm infants at risk for imminent preterm delivery. We hypothesized that the preferred strategy <36 weeks would include ACS while the preferred strategy =36 weeks would not. Methods. We performed decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness analyses to determine whether ACS was cost-effective at 34, 35, and 36 weeks. We conducted a literature review to determine probability, utility, and cost estimates absent of patient-level data. Base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, univariable sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation were performed. A threshold of $100,000/QALY was considered cost-effective. Results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio favored the administration of a full course of ACS at 34, 35, and 36 weeks ($62,888.25/QALY, $64,425.67/QALY, and $64,793.71/QALY, resp.).

10551,Cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for prevention of post-surgical venous thromboembolism from a U.S. payer's perspective,"Major orthopaedic surgery, such as total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR), is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of rivaroxaban, a once-daily, orally administered Factor Xa inhibitor, for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing THR or TKR. This analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin, from a U.S. payer's perspective.A decision-analytic model was developed to compare the costs and outcomes associated with rivaroxaban and enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE. The model replicated short-term clinical outcomes from the phase III RECORD trials. RECORD1 and RECORD2 compared rivaroxaban 10?mg daily (qd), given for 35 days, with enoxaparin 40?mg qd, given for 35 days or 10 to 14 days, respectively, in patients undergoing THR. RECORD3 compared 10?mg of rivaroxaban qd for 10 to 14 days versus 40?mg of enoxaparin qd for 10 to 14 days in patients undergoing TKR. The decision-analytic model also included data on long-term complications and sequelae as captured in observational studies and databases. It also included direct year 2010 medical costs over 1-year and 5-year time horizons. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of different factors on the results of the model. Results of the cost-effectiveness analysis were reported in terms of symptomatic VTE events avoided.Rivaroxaban was associated with cost savings of $US 511.93 per patient and prevented an average of 0.0145 symptomatic VTE events per patient in the THR population, compared with enoxaparin. For a TKR population, 10 to 14 days of rivaroxaban prophylaxis was associated with cost savings of $US 465.74 and prevented an average 0.0193 symptomatic VTE events per patient. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the results of the model were robust, with cost savings ranging from $US 133.96-629.57 in the THR population and $US 293.01-848.68 in the TKR population, depending on the variables used. Sensitivity analysis also suggested that the economic profile of rivaroxaban is improved when the time horizon of the model is extended from 1 year to 5 years. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the findings of baseline results, showing that rivaroxaban was less costly and more effective in all model simulations for both populations.This decision-analytic model analysis, from the U.S. payer's perspective, concluded that rivaroxaban may be cost saving in both the THR and the TKR populations, when compared with enoxaparin in the U.S.",2012-01-10257,22187932,Pharmacoeconomics,Aurea Duran,2012,30 / 2,87-101,Yes,22187932,"Aurea Duran; Nishan Sengupta; Alexander Diamantopoulos; Fiona Forster; Louis Kwong; Michael Lees; Cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for prevention of post-surgical venous thromboembolism from a U.S. payer's perspective, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 30(2):1179-2027; 87-101",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) vs. Enoxaparin (40 mg daily),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-269436.84,United States,2010,-319795

Cost-utility analysis with multiple strategies was conducted to compare the costs and effects of 13 different screening alternatives with respect to the following eligibility criteria: age at the beginning of screening, screening interval, and screening method. The main outcome measurement was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.The results revealed that annual endoscopic screening from ages 50-80 was the most cost-effective for the male population. In the females, biennial endoscopy screening from ages 50-80 was calculated as the most cost-effective strategy among the 12 screening alternatives.

Advances in this field are mainly due to enhanced processing capacity of computers, availability of specific software to perform the necessary tasks, and refined mathematical techniques. We here estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of ten strategies for colon cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance and data on the costs and profit of chemotherapy in Iran. We used a Markov model to measure the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of a 50-year-old average-risk Iranian without screening and with screening by each test. In this paper, we tested the model with data from the Ministry of Health and published literature. We considered costs from the perspective of a health insurance organization, with inflation to 2011, the Iranian Rial being converted into US dollars. We focused on three tests for the 10 strategies considered currently being used for population screening in some Iranians provinces (Kerman, Golestan Mazandaran, Ardabil, and Tehran): low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually; fecal immunochemical test, performed annually; and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years. These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 39%, 60% and 76%, and mortality by 50%, 69% and 78%, respectively, compared with no screening.

Data for the evaluation were obtained from the case costing centre at a large teaching hospital in Ontario, supplemented by data from the literature.The per child cost for the system-based approach cohort was $176, compared with $173 in the traditional practice cohort. The higher cost associated with the system-based cohort reflects increased costs for predischarge screening and treatment and increased postdischarge follow-up visits. These costs are partially offset by reduced costs from fewer emergency room visits, hospital readmissions and kernicterus cases. Compared with the traditional approach, the cost to prevent one kernicterus case using the system-based approach was $570,496, the cost per life year gained was $26,279, and the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was $65,698.The cost to prevent one kernicterus case using the system-based approach is much lower than previously reported in the literature.",2012-01-10390,23277747,Paediatr Child Health,Bin Xie,2012,17 / 1,11-6,No,23277747,"Bin Xie; Orlando da Silva; Greg Zaric; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a system-based approach for managing neonatal jaundice and preventing kernicterus in Ontario, Paediatr Child Health, ; 17(1):1205-7088; 11-6",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,System based approach for the management of neonatal jaundice and the prevention of kernicterus vs. Traditional practice based on visual inspection and selected bilirubin testing,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,65698,Canada,2008,74564.17

10574,Cost-effectiveness of treating upper limb spasticity due to stroke with botulinum toxin type A: results from the botulinum toxin for the upper limb after stroke (BoTULS) trial,"Stroke imposes significant burdens on health services and society, and as such there is a growing need to assess the cost-effectiveness of stroke treatment to ensure maximum benefit is derived from limited resources. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of treating post-stroke upper limb spasticity with botulinum toxin type A plus an upper limb therapy programme against the therapy programme alone. Data on resource use and health outcomes were prospectively collected for 333 patients with post-stroke upper limb spasticity taking part in a randomized trial and combined to estimate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained of botulinum toxin type A plus therapy relative to therapy alone.

10575,Cost effectiveness of infant vaccination for rotavirus in Canada,"Rotavirus is the main cause of gastroenteritis in Canadian children younger than five years of age, resulting in significant morbidity and cost. The present study provides evidence on the cost effectiveness of two alternative rotavirus vaccinations (RotaTeq [Merck Frosst Canada Ltd, Canada] and Rotarix [GlaxoSmithKline, Canada]) available in Canada.Analysis was conducted through a Markov model that followed a cohort of children from birth to five years of age. Analysis used pertinent data on the natural history of rotavirus and the effects of vaccination. Estimates of heath care costs for children requiring hospitalizations and emergency department visits were derived from the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program, Active (IMPACT) surveillance, emergency department studies, as well as other Canadian studies. The model estimated the effect of vaccination on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).The incremental cost per QALY gained from the health care system perspective was $122,000 for RotaTeq and $108,000 for Rotarix.

10594,Cost-effectiveness of 3-years of adjuvant imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trial data have demonstrated that 3 years vs 1 year of adjuvant imatinib therapy for patients with surgically resected Kit+ Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) leads to a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival and overall survival. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with 3 years vs 1 year of imatinib from a US payer''s perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict GIST recurrence and treatment costs. Patients enter the model after surgery and transition among three health states: free of recurrence, recurrence, and death. Recurrence, mortality, costs, and utilities were derived from clinical trial and published literature. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated and discounted at 3%/year. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Patients receiving 3 years of imatinib had higher QALYs (8.53 vs 7.18) than those receiving 1 year of imatinib. Total lifetime per-patient cost was $302,100 for 3 years vs $217,800 for 1 year of imatinib. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 3 years vs 1 year of imatinib was $62,600/QALY. Model results were sensitive to long-term rate of GIST recurrence (beyond 5 years) and cost of imatinib. At a threshold of $100,000/QALY, 3 years vs 1 year of imatinib was cost-effective in 100% of simulations. LIMITATIONS: The model is a simplified representation of disease natural history and may not account for all possible health states and complications associated with disease. Resource utilization on treatment was estimated using the resource use data from previous trials, therefore calculated medical costs might be over-estimated compared to the real-world setting. CONCLUSIONS: Model results suggest that treatment with 3 years vs 1 year of imatinib is cost-effective at a $100,000/QALY threshold. Clinical and economic results suggest treating surgically resected Kit+ GIST patients with 3 years of imatinib would result in improved quality-adjusted survival.",2013-01-09443,22762291,J Med Econ,Myrlene Sanon,2013,16 / 1,150-159,Yes,22762291,"Myrlene Sanon; Douglas C A Taylor; Anju Parthan; John Coombs; Marc Paolantonio; Medha Sasane; Cost-effectiveness of 3-years of adjuvant imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) in the United States, J Med Econ, 2013; 16(1):1369-6998; 150-159",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,3 years of imatinib (400mg/day administered orally) vs. 1 year of imatinib (400mg/day administered orally),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,62600,United States,2010,74300.04
10595,A modeled economic evaluation of sevelamer for treatment of hyperphosphatemia associated with chronic kidney disease among patients on dialysis in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: There is limited information regarding the cost-effectiveness of sevelamer for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis in the UK. Using a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective and final results of the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited (DCOR) study, an evaluation was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of sevelamer compared to calcium-based phosphate binders for the first-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, incremental cost per life year (LY) gained, and QALY gained. Treatment-specific overall survival up to 44 months, hospitalizations, and resource utilization were derived from the DCOR study. Survival was extrapolated to a lifetime horizon using Weibull regression analysis. Unit costs and utility estimates specific to the UK were obtained from the published literature. Sub-group analyses were conducted based on data reported from the DCOR study for increasing age cut-points. Outcomes and costs were modeled for a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the use of sevelamer resulted in a gain of approximately 0.73 LYs and 0.44 QALYs per patient (discounted at 3.5% per year). Total per-patient costs were higher for sevelamer, resulting in an incremental cost of pound22,157 per QALY gained and pound13,427 per LY gained (in pound2009). Increasingly favorable cost per QALY ratios were observed with increasing age cut-points, ranging from pound15,864 for patients >/=45 to pound13,296 for patients >/=65 years of age. Results were most sensitive to assumptions regarding overall survival and the inclusion of dialysis costs. Key limitations of the analysis included the use of non-UK trial data for survival and hospitalizations, and the exclusion of quality-of-life impacts associated with hospitalization.

10596,Denosumab versus zoledronic acid for treatment of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Denosumab has been approved in the US for skeletal-related event (SRE) prevention in bone-metastatic prostate cancer on the basis of a phase III clinical trial in which denosumab reduced SREs relative to zoledronic acid. Overall survival, disease progression, and serious adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid in bone-metastatic prostate cancer from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A literature-based Markov model, wherein inputs were selected to reproduce clinical trial outcomes, was developed to estimate the survival, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), number and costs of SREs, and drug and administration costs for patients receiving denosumab or zoledronic acid over 27 months. QALYs were estimated by assigning health-state utilities. SRE-related costs and utilities were literature-based. Outcomes were discounted 3% per annum, and model robustness was tested via scenario, univariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Denosumab resulted in fewer estimated SREs (-0.241; 1.036 vs 1.277), more QALYs (0.0074; 0.9306 vs 0.9232), and lower SRE-related costs (-$2340; $8824 vs $11,164), but higher drug-related costs ($10,181; $23,144 vs $12,963) and total costs ($7841; $31,968 vs $24,127) vs zoledronic acid. The base case estimated cost per QALY-gained was $1,058,741. CONCLUSION: This analysis was limited by the restricted availability of clinical data and the need to use projection methods beyond the trial time frame. However, a wide range of scenarios predicted denosumab to have an incremental cost/QALY gained above what may be considered acceptable value for money in the US.

10597,Using the 21-gene assay to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decision-making in early-stage breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness evaluation in the German setting,"OBJECTIVE: The 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Test (Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA)) is a well validated test that predicts the likelihood of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit and the 10-year risk of distant recurrence in patients with ER+, HER2- early-stage breast cancer. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the assay to inform adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in Germany. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to make long-term projections of distant recurrence, survival, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and direct costs for patients with ER+, HER2-, node-negative, or up to 3 node-positive early-stage breast cancer. Scenarios using conventional diagnostic procedures or the 21-gene assay to inform treatment recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy were modeled based on a prospective, multi-center trial in 366 patients. Transition probabilities and risk adjustment were based on published landmark trials. Costs (2011 Euros (euro)) were estimated from a sick fund perspective based on resource use in patients receiving chemotherapy. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: The 21-gene assay was projected to increase mean life expectancy by 0.06 years and quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.06 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with current clinical practice over a 30-year time horizon. Clinical benefits were driven by optimized allocation of adjuvant chemotherapy. Costs from a healthcare payer perspective were lower with the 21-gene assay by approximately euro561 vs standard of care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that there was an 87% probability that the 21-gene assay would be dominant (cost and life saving) to standard of care. LIMITATIONS: Country-specific data on the risk of distant recurrence and quality-of-life were not available.

10598,Cost-effectiveness of single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion five years after surgery,"STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort. OBJECTIVE.: The purpose of this study is to determine the cost per quality-adjusted life year (cost/QALY) gained for single-level instrumented anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) over 5 years. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Economic value is an increasingly important component of health care policy decision making. METHODS: Control patients who had undergone ACDF with complete 5-year follow-up data who were part of the Investigational Device Exemption trials for cervical disc arthroplasty were identified. Direct costs for each intervention reported as part of the trial were determined using the 2012 Medicare Fee schedule. Health utility was determined using the Short Form-6D, calculated by transformation from the Short Form-36. RESULTS: There were 352 patients (182 women, 170 men), mean age was 44.6 years (22-73 yr). Cost per patient for the index ACDF was $15,714. Over 5 years, 41 repeat ACDFs, 15 posterior fusions, 6 foraminotomies, 2 implant removals, 2 hematoma evacuations, and 1 esophageal fistula repair were performed. Mean QALY gained in each year of follow-up was 0.16, 0.18, 0.17, 0.18, and 0.18 for a cumulative 0.88 QALY gain over 5 years. The resultant cost/QALY gain at 1 year was $104,831; $53,074 at year 2; $37,717 at year 3; $28,383 at year 4; and $23,460 at year 5. In this cohort, 11 nerve releases and 26 rotator cuff repairs were done within 5 years after the index ACDF. Subanalysis to include upper extremity procedures was performed. The cost/QALY gained at 1 year including upper extremity procedures was $106,256; $54,622 at year 2; $38,836 at year 3; $29,454 at year 4; and $24,479 at year 5. CONCLUSION: Increasing health care costs call for demonstration of cost-effectiveness in order to justify payment for interventions, including ACDFs. This study indicates that at 5-year follow-up, single-level instrumented ACDF is both effective and durable resulting in a favorable cost/QALY gained as compared to other widely accepted health care interventions.",2013-01-09770,22986842,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Leah Y Carreon,2013,38 / 6,,No,22986842,"Leah Y Carreon; Paul A Anderson; Vincent C Traynelis; Praveen V Mummaneni; Steven D Glassman; Cost-effectiveness of single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion five years after surgery, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , ; 38(6):1528-1159",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single-level anterior disectomy and fusion (ACDF) using allograft with an ATLANTIS plate vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,23477.51,United States,2012,26465.14
10599,Cost-effectiveness of alendronate for the treatment of osteopenic postmenopausal women in Japan,"Many postmenopausal women have osteopenia, a condition characterized by loss of bone mineral density (BMD) that is not as severe as in osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of alendronate to prevent fractures in osteopenic postmenopausal women without a history of fracture in Japan. An individual simulation model was developed to predict lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 5 years of preventive alendronate therapy versus no preventive therapy. The risk of hip and vertebral fracture associated with age and BMD was derived from epidemiologic studies in Japan. We ran the model with different combinations of age (65, 70, and 75 years), BMD (70%, 75%, and 80% of young adult mean [YAM]), and additional clinical risk factors. For 70-year-old women with a BMD of 70% of the YAM having one of the following risk factors: a family history of hip fracture, high alcohol intake, or current smoking, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of alendronate was $92,937, $126,251, and $129,067 per QALY, respectively. These results were sensitive to age, BMD, and number of clinical risk factors. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis for the base case showed that in the presence of one, two, and three risk factors, alendronate was cost-effective in 0.2% to 2.6%, 13.1% to 56.1%, and 99.1% of the simulations, respectively, if society is willing to pay $50,000 per QALY. Additional analysis indicated that alendronate can be a good value in osteopenic women if the 10-year probability for a osteoporotic hip or vertebral fracture is more than 26.2%.

Our results indicate that whether to treat osteopenia with alendronate should be determined on the basis of age, BMD, and number of clinical risk factors in terms of cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-09777,22991163,J Bone Miner Res,Kensuke Moriwaki,2013,28 / 2,,No,22991163,"Kensuke Moriwaki; Hirotaka Komaba; Shinichi Noto; Shinichiro Yanagisawa; Toru Takiguchi; Hiroki Inoue; Takeshi Toujo; Masafumi Fukagawa; Hideaki E Takahashi; Cost-effectiveness of alendronate for the treatment of osteopenic postmenopausal women in Japan, J Bone Miner Res, 2013 Feb; 28(2):1523-4681",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,5 years of preventive alendronate therapy vs. None,Postmenopausal women aged 70 years with no history of clinical fracture (no risk factors) and bone mineral density (BMD) of 70% of young adult mean (YAM),Not Stated,65 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,227905,United States,2012,256907.07
