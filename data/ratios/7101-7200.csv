7101,Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance angiography versus intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography to follow-up patients with coiled intracranial aneurysms,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To follow up patients with coiled intracranial aneurysms, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a promising noninvasive alternative to current standard intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA). MRA test results do not always concord with those of IA-DSA, and the impact of discrepancies on health benefits and costs is unknown. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of follow-up with MRA vs IA-DSA to assess whether in this setting MRA may replace IA-DSA. METHODS: We studied aneurysm occlusion on MRA in addition to follow-up IA-DSA in 310 patients with 341 coiled intracranial aneurysms. The observed sensitivity (82%) and specificity (89%) of MRA for detection of reopening with IA-DSA as a reference were used as input for a Markov decision-analytic model. Other determinants were derived from the literature. We compared life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), costs, and expected number of events for the two strategies. RESULTS: Follow-up with MRA yielded similar life expectancy (MRA, 26.66 years; IA-DSA, 26.63 years; difference, 0.03 years; 95% CI, -0.17-0.23) and QALY (MRA, 10.96; IA-DSA, 10.95; difference, 0.01 QALY; 95% CI, -0.05-0.08) at lower costs (MRA, $7003; IA-DSA, $8241 per patient; difference, -$1238; 95% CI, -2617--36). The expected number of events was comparable except for complications from IA-DSA. CONCLUSIONS: MRA provided equivalent health benefits as IA-DSA and was cost-saving. MRA dominates and should replace routine IA-DSA to follow-up patients with coiled aneurysms.",2010-01-06597,20595661,Stroke,JD Schaafsma,2010,41 / 8,1736-42,No,20595661,"JD Schaafsma; Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance angiography versus intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography to follow-up patients with coiled intracranial aneurysms, Stroke, 2010-Aug; 41(8):1524-4628; 1736-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRA) vs. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,-123800,United States,2007,-154531.17
7102,"Cost-effectiveness of current treatment strategies for lumbar spinal stenosis: nonsurgical care, laminectomy, and X-STOP","OBJECT Standard treatment options for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis include nonoperative therapies as well as decompressive laminectomy. The introduction of interspinous decompression devices such as the X-STOP has broadened treatment options, but data comparing these treatment strategies are lacking. The object of this study was to provide a cost-effectiveness analysis of laminectomy, interspinous decompression, and nonoperative treatment for patients with lumbar stenosis. METHODS The authors performed a structured literature review of lumbar stenosis and constructed a cost-effectiveness model. Using conservative treatment, decompressive laminectomy, and placement of X-STOP as the treatment arms, their primary analysis evaluated the optimal treatment strategy for a patient with lumbar stenosis at a 2-year time horizon. Secondary analyses were done to compare cases in which patients required single-level procedures with those in which multilevel procedures were required as well as to examine the outcomes for a 4-year time horizon. Outcomes were calculated using quality-adjusted life years and costs were considered from the perspective of society. RESULTS Laminectomy was found to be the most effective treatment strategy, followed by X-STOP and then conservative treatment at a 2-year time horizon. Both surgical procedures were more costly than conservative treatment. Because laminectomy was both more effective and less costly than X-STOP, it is said to dominate overall. When single level procedures were considered alone, laminectomy was more effective but also more costly than X-STOP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A subset of 1,665 women (age range, 18-50 y) participating in a cervical cancer screening study were screened by liquid-based cytology and by high-risk HPV DNA testing of both self-collected vaginal swab samples and clinician-collected cervical samples. Women with positive/abnormal screening test results and a subset of women with negative screening test results were triaged to colposcopy. On the basis of individual and combined test results, 5 screening strategies were defined. Estimates of sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse were calculated, and a Markov model was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each strategy. RESULTS: Compared with cytology-based screening, high-risk HPV DNA testing of self-collected vaginal samples was more sensitive (68%, 95% CI = 58%-78% vs 85%, 95% CI = 76%-94%) but less specific (89%, 95% CI = 86%-91% vs 73%, 95% CI = 67%-79%). A strategy of high-risk HPV DNA testing of self-collected vaginal samples followed by cytology triage of HPV-positive women was comparably sensitive (75%, 95% CI = 64%-86%) and specific (88%, 95% CI = 85%-92%) to cytology-based screening. In-home self-collection for high-risk HPV DNA detection followed by in-clinic cytology triage had a slightly lower lifetime cost and a slightly higher quality-adjusted life year (QALY) expectancy than did cytology-based screening (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of triennial screening compared with no screening was $9,871/QALY and $12,878/QALY, respectively).

In-home self-collection for high-risk HPV DNA detection followed by in-clinic cytology triage had a slightly lower lifetime cost and a slightly higher quality-adjusted life year (QALY) expectancy than did cytology-based screening (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of triennial screening compared with no screening was $9,871/QALY and $12,878/QALY, respectively).

7114,A population model evaluating the costs and benefits associated with different oral treatment strategies in people with type 2 diabetes,"AIM: The attainment of near-normal glycaemia is an important feature in reducing complications in people with type 2 diabetes. Current treatment pathways advocate a failure-driven therapy algorithm for blood-glucose lowering that leads to the sequential addition of therapies. The addition and combination of multiple blood-glucose lowering agents may be associated with significant side effects, such as weight gain and hypoglycaemia, resulting in a detrimental quality of life. The objective of this study is to quantify the overall costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) associated with therapy escalation via oral only treatment strategies with different adverse event profiles as a function of target HbA1c achievement. METHODS: A previously published model was adapted to run as a non-terminating simulation model. The model is designed to evaluate the cost utility of treatment strategies in a population of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Model outputs include incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, hypoglycaemia and diabetes-specific and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The total number of vascular events predicted by the model varied little across the four treatment strategies because of the glycaemic profile associated with each therapy strategy being similar. The strategy with sequential addition of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and sulphonylureas (SUs) to metformin (MF) was associated with greatest predicted hypoglycaemia burden. The addition of SU and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4) inhibitors to MF was associated with the highest estimated QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: A treatment strategy involving the sequential addition of SU and TZD to first-line MF therapy is associated with the lowest cost and lowest gain across a population, whereas addition of TZD and SU sequentially to first-line MF therapy resulted in the highest cost and incrementally less QALY gain when compared with treatment strategies involving the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor and SU to first-line MF (irrespective of the treatment sequence) that were associated with both less cost and greatest QALY gain.",2010-01-06602,20590737,Diabetes Obes Metab,Phil McEwan,2010,12 / 7,623-30,No,20590737,"Phil McEwan; A population model evaluating the costs and benefits associated with different oral treatment strategies in people with type 2 diabetes, Diabetes Obes Metab, 2010-Jul; 12(7):1462-8902; 623-30",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Metformin as first line, Metformin + Thiazolidinediones as second line, Metformin + Thiazolidinediones + Sulphonylureas as thrid line. vs. Metformin as first line, Metformin + Sulfonylureas as second line, Metformin + Thiazolidinediones + Sulphonylureas as thrid line.",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,93553.33,United Kingdom,2008,208551.88

7120,The cost-effectiveness of the SPHERE intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,"OBJECTIVES: The Secondary Prevention of Heart disEase in geneRal practicE (SPHERE) trial has recently reported. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of the SPHERE intervention in both healthcare systems on the island of Ireland. METHODS: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. A probabilistic model was developed to combine within-trial and beyond-trial impacts of treatment to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of two secondary prevention strategies: Intervention - tailored practice and patient care plans; and Control - standardized usual care. RESULTS: The intervention strategy resulted in mean cost savings per patient of euro512.77 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], -1086.46-91.98) and an increase in mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient of 0.0051 (95 percent CI, -0.0101-0.0200), when compared with the control strategy. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 94 percent if decision makers are willing to pay euro45,000 per additional QALY.

7121,"Is surgery for displaced, midshaft clavicle fractures in adults cost-effective? Results based on a multicenter randomized, controlled trial","OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of displaced, midshaft clavicle fractures in adults. DESIGN: Formal cost-effectiveness analysis based on a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Eight hospitals in Canada (seven university-affiliated and one community hospital). PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-two adults with acute, completely displaced, midshaft clavicle fractures. INTERVENTION: Clavicle ORIF versus nonoperative treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Utilities derived from SF-6D. RESULTS: The base case cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ORIF was $65,000. Cost-effectiveness improved to $28,150/QALY gained when the functional benefit from ORIF was assumed to be permanent with cost per QALY gained falling below $50,000 when the functional advantage persisted for 9.3 years or more. In other sensitivity analyses, the cost per QALY gained for ORIF fell below $50,000 when ORIF cost less than $10,465 (base case cost $13,668) or the long-term utility difference between nonoperative treatment and ORIF was greater than 0.034 (base case difference 0.014). Short-term disutility associated with fracture healing also affected cost-effectiveness with the cost per QALY gained for ORIF falling below $50,000 when the utility of a fracture treated nonoperatively before union was less than 0.617 (base case utility 0.706) or when nonoperative treatment increased the time to union by 20 weeks (base case difference 12 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of ORIF after acute clavicle fracture depended on the durability of functional advantage for ORIF compared with nonoperative treatment.

7122,Economic evaluation of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for anemia related to cancer,"BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) administered to cancer patients with anemia reduce the need for blood transfusions and improve quality-of-life (QOL). Concerns about toxicity have led to more restrictive recommendations for ESA use; however, the incremental costs and benefits of such a strategy are unknown. METHODS: The authors created a decision model to examine the costs and consequences of ESA use in patients with anemia and cancer from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system. Model inputs were informed by a recent systematic review. Extensive sensitivity analyses and scenario analysis rigorously assessed QOL benefits and more conservative ESA administration practices (initial hemoglobin [Hb] <10 g/dL, target Hb < or =12 g/dL, and chemotherapy induced anemia only). RESULTS: Compared with supportive transfusions only, conventional ESA treatment was associated with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $267,000 during a 15-week time frame. During a 1.3-year time horizon, ESA was associated with higher costs and worse clinical outcomes. In scenarios where multiple assumptions regarding QOL all favored ESA, the lowest incremental cost per QALY gained was $126,000. Analyses simulating the use of ESA in accordance with recently issued guidelines resulted in incremental cost per QALY gained of > $100,000 or ESA being dominated (greater costs with lower benefit) in the majority of the scenarios, although greater variability in the cost-utility ratio was present.

7128,The cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of failed back surgery syndrome,"OBJECTIVES: Healthcare policy makers and payers require cost-effectiveness evidence to inform their treatment funding decisions. Thus, in 2008, the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence analyzed the cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) compared with conventional medical management (CMM) and with reoperation and recommended approval of SCS in selected patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). We present previously unavailable details of the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence analysis and an analysis of the impact on SCS cost effectiveness of rechargeable implanted pulse generators (IPGs). METHODS: We used a decision analytic model to examine the cost effectiveness of SCS versus CMM and versus reoperation in patients with FBSS. We also modeled the impact of nonrechargeable versus rechargeable IPGs. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of SCS compared with CMM was pound5624 per quality-adjusted life year, with 89% probability that SCS is cost effective at a willingness to pay threshold of pound20,000. Compared with reoperation, the incremental cost-effectiveness of SCS was pound6392 per quality-adjusted life year, with 82% probability of cost-effectiveness at the pound20,000 threshold. When the longevity of an IPG is 4 years or less, a rechargeable (and initially more expensive) IPG is more cost-effective than a nonrechargeable IPG.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of LTRAs versus ICS for patients initiating asthma controller therapy. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 2-year, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial set in 53 primary-care practices in the UK. Patients aged 12-80 years with asthma and symptoms requiring regular anti-inflammatory therapy (n = 326) were randomly assigned to LTRAs (n = 162) or ICS (n = 164). The main outcome measures were the incremental costs per point improvement in the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, per point improvement in the Asthma Control Questionnaire and per QALY gained from the UK NHS and societal perspectives. RESULTS: Over 2 years, resource use was similar between the two treatment groups, but the cost to society per patient was significantly higher for the LTRA group, at pounds sterling 711 versus pounds sterling 433 for the ICS group (adjusted difference pounds sterling 204; 95% CI 74, 308) [year 2005 values]. Cost differences were driven primarily by differences in prescription drug costs, particularly study drug costs. There was a nonsignificant (imputed, adjusted) difference between treatment groups, favouring ICS, in QALYs gained at 2 years of -0.073 (95% CI -0.143, 0.010). Therapy with LTRAs was, on average, a dominated strategy, and, at a threshold for willingness to pay of pounds sterling 30,000 per QALY gained, the probability of LTRAs being cost effective compared with ICS was approximately 3% from both societal and NHS perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very low probability of LTRAs being cost effective in the UK, at 2005 values, compared with ICS for initial asthma controller therapy.

7132,"The cost, quality of life impact, and cost-utility of bariatric surgery in a managed care population","Our purpose was to assess the cost, quality of life impact, and the cost-utility of bariatric surgery in a managed care population. We studied 221 patients who underwent bariatric surgery between 2001 and 2005. We analyzed medical claims data for all patients and survey data for 122 survey respondents (55% response rate). Patients were generally middle-aged, female, and white. Sixty-four percent underwent open and 33% underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y procedures. One year after surgery, mean body mass index fell from 51 to 31 kg/m(2) in women and from 59 to 35 kg/m(2) in men with substantial improvements in comorbidities. Postsurgical mortality and morbidity were low. Total per member per month costs increased in the 6 months before bariatric surgery, were lower in the 12 months after bariatric surgery, but increased somewhat over the next 12 months. When presurgical quality of life was assessed prospectively, average health utility scores improved by 0.14 one year after surgery. In analyses that took a lifetime time horizon, projected future costs based on age and obesity and discounted costs and health utilities at 3% per year, the cost-utility ratio for bariatric surgery versus no surgery was approximately $1,400 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In sensitivity analyses, bariatric surgery was more cost-effective in women, non-whites, more obese patients, and when performed laparoscopically. Although not cost-saving, bariatric surgery represents a very good value for money. Its long-term cost effectiveness appears to depend on the natural history and cost of late postsurgical complications and the natural history and cost of untreated morbid obesity.",2010-01-06622,20446053,Obes Surg,Laura N McEwen,2010,20 / 7,919-28,No,20446053,"Laura N McEwen; The cost, quality of life impact, and cost-utility of bariatric surgery in a managed care population, Obes Surg, 2010-Jul; 20(7):0960-8923; 919-28",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bariatric surgery (laparoscopic or open Roux-en-Y procedures) vs. No surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1425,United States,2008,1712.96
7133,An economic evaluation of treatments for HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy: a cost-utility analysis,"INTRODUCTION: HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy (FLA) is a stigmatizing hallmark for persons living with HIV [PLWH], and can lead to poor social functioning, social isolation, and reduced labour force participation. Treatments for this condition are prohibitively expensive and are not publicly insured in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Information gleaned from an economic evaluation of treatments for FLA could inform policy decision making concerning coverage. METHOD: Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the lifetime incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from use of either Poly-l-lactic acid or Polyalkylimide gel from the perspectives of society and the Ontario Ministry of Health. Disease progression probabilities and utilities were derived from the literature. Costs were obtained through interviews with product distributors and physicians who perform these treatments. Costs were valued in 2009 Canadian Dollars. Costs and outcomes were discounted annually at 3%. FINDINGS: Treatments using Polyalkylimide gel exhibit such a cost advantage over those using Poly-l-lactic acid that they more than compensate for the health-related quality of life advantages of Poly-l-lactic acid. From a Ministry of Health perspective, the incremental cost-utility ratios for Polyalkylimide gel or Poly-l-lactic acid compared to no treatment were $45,457 CAD or $57,352 CAD per QALY, respectively, $1.00 CAD = $0.876 USD). From a societal perspective the equivalent ratios were $48,583 CAD and $66,608 CAD respectively. These findings were not altered in the sensitivity analyses.

With 100% vaccine uptake, dual vaccination cost $37,700/QALY gained compared to a CDC recommendation strategy; with observed vaccine uptake, dual vaccination cost $5,300/QALY. Results were sensitive to shorter time horizons, favoring CDC recommendations. We found dual vaccination of all 50-year-olds economically reasonable.

7140,Cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve quality of osteoporosis care after wrist fracture,"In a randomized trial, a multifaceted intervention tripled rates of osteoporosis treatment in older patients with wrist fracture. An economic analysis of the trial now demonstrates that the intervention tested ""dominates"" usual care: over a lifetime horizon, it reduces fracture, increases quality-adjusted life years, and saves the healthcare system money. INTRODUCTION: In a randomized trial (N?=?272), we reported a multifaceted quality improvement intervention directed at older patients and their physicians could triple rates of osteoporosis treatment within 6 months of a wrist fracture when compared with usual care (22% vs 7%). Alongside the trial, we conducted an economic evaluation. METHODS: Using 1-year outcome data from our trial and micro-costing time-motion studies, we constructed a Markov decision-analytic model to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with usual care over the patients' remaining lifetime. We took the perspective of third-party healthcare payers. In the base case, costs and benefits were discounted at 3% and expressed in 2006 Canadian dollars. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 60 years, 77% were women, and 72% had low bone mineral density (BMD). The intervention cost $12 per patient. Compared with usual care, the intervention strategy was dominant: for every 100 patients receiving the intervention, three fractures (one hip fracture) would be prevented, 1.1 quality-adjusted life year gained, and $26,800 saved by the healthcare system over their remaining lifetime. The intervention dominated usual care across numerous one-way sensitivity analyses: with respect to cost, the most influential parameter was drug price; in terms of effectiveness, the most influential parameter was rate of BMD testing. The intervention was cost saving in 80% of probabilistic model simulations. CONCLUSIONS: For outpatients with wrist fractures, our multifaceted osteoporosis intervention was cost-effective. Healthcare systems implementing similar interventions should expect to save money, reduce fractures, and gain quality-adjusted life expectancy.",2010-01-06636,20878389,Osteoporos Int,Robin M Ikeda,2010,/,,No,20878389,"Robin M Ikeda; Cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve quality of osteoporosis care after wrist fracture, Osteoporos Int, 2010-Sep-29; ():0937-941X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multifaceted intervention vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-24363.64,Canada,2006,-27588.52
7141,Choice of Vascular Access among Incident Hemodialysis Patients: A Decision and Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are widely accepted as the preferred hemodialysis vascular access type. However, supporting data have failed to consider morbidity and mortality incurred during failed creation attempts and may therefore overstate potential advantages. This study compares survival, quality-adjusted survival, and costs among incident hemodialysis patients after attempted placement of AVFs or arteiovenous grafts (AVGs). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Analogous Markov models were created, one each for AVF and AVG. Patients entered consideration at the time of first access creation, contemporaneous with dialysis initiation. Subsequent outcomes were determined probabilistically; transition probabilities, utilities, and costs were gathered from published sources. To ensure comparability between AVFs and AVGs, the timing and likelihood of access maturation were measured in a contemporary cohort of incident hemodialysis patients. RESULTS: Mean (SD) overall survival was 39.2 (0.8) and 36.7 (1.0) months for AVFs and AVGs, respectively: difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) 2.6 (1.8, 3.3) months. Quality-adjusted survival was 36.1 (0.8) and 32.5 (0.9) quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) for AVFs and AVGs, respectively: difference (95% CI) 3.6 (2.8, 4.3) QALMs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (95% CI) for AVFs relative to AVGs was $446 (-6023, 6994) per quality-adjusted life year saved. CONCLUSIONS: AVFs are associated with greater overall and quality-adjusted survival than AVGs. Observed differences were much less pronounced than might be expected from existing literature, suggesting that prospective identification of patients at high risk for AVF maturational failure might enable improvements in health outcomes via individualization of access planning.",2010-01-06638,20876675,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,H Xue,2010,/,,No,20876675,"H Xue; Choice of Vascular Access among Incident Hemodialysis Patients: A Decision and Cost-Utility Analysis, Clin J Am Soc Nephrol, 2010-Sep-28; ():1555-905X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) vs. Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,60 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,446,United States,2008,536.13
7142,Economic evaluation of Vacuum Assisted Closure(®) Therapy for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in France,"The objective of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Vacuum Assisted Closure(®) (V.A.C.(®) ) Therapy compared with advanced wound care (AWC) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in France. A cost-effectiveness model intended to reflect the management of DFUs was updated for the French setting. The Markov model follows the progression of 1000 hypothetical patients over a 1-year period. The model was populated with French-specific data, obtained from published sources and clinical experts. The analysis evaluated costs and health outcomes, in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), wounds healed and amputations, from the perspective of the payer. The patients treated with V.A.C.(®) Therapy experienced more QALYs (0·787 versus 0·784) and improved healing rates (50·2% versus 48·5%) at a lower total cost of care (€24 881 versus €28 855 per patient per year) when compared with AWC. Sensitivity analyses conducted around key model parameters indicated that the results were affected by hospital resource use and costs. DFU treatment using V.A.C.(®) Therapy in France was associated with lower costs, additional QALYs, more healed ulcers and fewer amputations than treatment with AWC.

7143,Modeling the economic impact of medication adherence in type 2 diabetes: a theoretical approach,"AIMS: While strong correlations exist between medication adherence and health economic outcomes in type 2 diabetes, current economic analyses do not adequately consider them. We propose a new approach to incorporate adherence in cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We describe a theoretical approach to incorporating the effect of adherence when estimating the long-term costs and effectiveness of an antidiabetic medication. This approach was applied in a Markov model which includes common diabetic health states. We compared two treatments using hypothetical patient cohorts: injectable insulin (IDM) and oral (OAD) medications. Two analyses were performed, one which ignored adherence (analysis 1) and one which incorporated it (analysis 2). Results from the two analyses were then compared to explore the extent to which adherence may impact incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In both analyses, IDM was more costly and more effective than OAD. When adherence was ignored, IDM generated an incremental cost-effectiveness of $12,097 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus OAD. Incorporation of adherence resulted in a slightly higher ratio ($16,241/QALY). This increase was primarily due to better adherence with OAD than with IDM, and the higher direct medical costs for IDM. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating medication adherence into economic analyses can meaningfully influence the estimated cost-effectiveness of type 2 diabetes treatments, and should therefore be considered in health care decision-making.

Progressive perineal dilation is a minimally invasive method with high success rates. However, the economic merits of progressive perineal dilation compared to surgical vaginoplasty are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We performed a Markov based cost-effectiveness analysis of 3 management strategies for vaginal agenesis-progressive perineal dilation with and without subsequent vaginoplasty, and up-front vaginoplasty. Cost data were drawn from the Pediatric Health Information System database (2004 to 2009) for inpatient procedures and from governmental cost data (2009) for outpatient procedures and clinical followup. Other model parameters were derived from a systematic literature review and comparison with other congenital and acquired pediatric and/or adolescent gynecologic conditions. Bounded and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess model stability. RESULTS:: Including all procedures, equipment and physician visits, progressive perineal dilation had a mean cost of $796, while vaginoplasty cost $18,520. Up-front vaginoplasty was strongly dominated at any age, ie was more expensive but no more effective than other options. In cases of progressive perineal dilation failure the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of progressive perineal dilation with subsequent vaginoplasty was $1,564 per quality adjusted life-year. Only the utility weights of life after treatment impacted model outcomes, while frequency of followup and probability of treatment success did not.

7147,Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Blood Pressure Screening in Adolescents in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 3 approaches to managing elevated blood pressure (BP) in adolescents in the United States: no intervention, ""screen-and-treat,"" and population-wide strategies to lower the entire BP distribution. STUDY DESIGN: We used a simulation model to combine several data sources to project the lifetime costs and cardiovascular outcomes for a cohort of 15-year-old U.S. adolescents under different BP approaches and conducted cost-effectiveness analysis. We obtained BP distributions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 and used childhood-to-adult longitudinal correlation analyses to simulate the tracking of BP. We then used the coronary heart disease policy model to estimate lifetime coronary heart disease events, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: Among screen-and-treat strategies, finding and treating the adolescents at highest risk (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy) was most cost-effective ($18000/QALY [boys] and $47000/QALY [girls]). However, all screen-and-treat strategies were dominated by population-wide strategies such as salt reduction (cost-saving [boys] and $650/QALY [girls]) and increasing physical education ($11000/QALY [boys] and $35000/QALY [girls]).

7154,Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Blood Pressure Screening in Adolescents in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 3 approaches to managing elevated blood pressure (BP) in adolescents in the United States: no intervention, ""screen-and-treat,"" and population-wide strategies to lower the entire BP distribution. STUDY DESIGN: We used a simulation model to combine several data sources to project the lifetime costs and cardiovascular outcomes for a cohort of 15-year-old U.S. adolescents under different BP approaches and conducted cost-effectiveness analysis. We obtained BP distributions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 and used childhood-to-adult longitudinal correlation analyses to simulate the tracking of BP. We then used the coronary heart disease policy model to estimate lifetime coronary heart disease events, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY).

7155,"The cost-effectiveness of introducing nucleic acid testing to test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus among blood donors in Sweden","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of using individual-donor nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT) in addition to serologic tests compared with the sole use of serologic tests for the identification of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among blood donors in Sweden. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The two strategies analyzed were serologic tests and ID-NAT plus serologic tests. A health-economic model was used to estimate the lifetime costs and effects.

RESULTS: The largest number of viral transmissions occurred with serologic testing only. However, the risks for viral transmissions were very low with both strategies. The total cost was mainly influenced by the cost of the test carried out.

Methods: We used partitioned survival analysis to assess survival data decomposed into 3 states: (1) alive before disease progression; (2) alive after progression; and (3) dead. The effects of treatment on time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were obtained from published reports of the APEX, MM-009, and MM-010 randomized clinical trials. Costs included drug and administration costs, adverse events, treatment of relapses, and end-of-life costs. Utility estimates were derived from the literature. Results: BTZ mean OS was 57.4 months compared with 44.6 and 54.1 months for DEX and LEN/DEX, respectively. Mean lifetime direct medical costs per patient were approximately 2010 SEK 1,904,462, 1,278,854, and 2,450,588 for BTZ, DEX, and LEN/DEX, respectively. Mean incremental cost per QALY of BTZ compared to DEX was 2010 SEK 902,874 (€95,073) (95% C.I.: 514,791, 962,416) and was dominant with respect to LEN/DEX.

METHODS: Incremental costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) associated with rivastigmine patch and capsule treatment versus best supportive care (BSC) were calculated using two economic models, one based solely on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and one also incorporating activities of daily living (ADL) scores. The clinical pathway was populated with data from a clinical trial of rivastigmine patch (9.5?mg/24?h) and capsules (12?mg/day) versus placebo. Costs were based on the UK health and social care costs and basic UK National Health Service (NHS) prices. Disease progression was modelled beyond the trial period over 5 years using published equations to predict natural decline in AD patients. Base case costing variables included drugs, clinical monitoring, and institutionalization. RESULTS: The MMSE model estimated incremental costs per QALY of £10?579 for rivastigmine patch and £15?154 for capsule versus BSC. The MMSE-ADL model estimated incremental costs per QALY of £9114 for rivastigmine patch and £13?758 for capsules. The main difference between the models was a greater number of institutionalized days avoided for rivastigmine versus BSC estimated by the MMSE-ADL model. CONCLUSIONS: Both the MMSE and MMSE-ADL models suggest that rivastigmine patch and capsules are cost-effective treatments versus BSC.

7166,Addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Adding cetuximab to standard chemotherapy results in a moderate increase of overall survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the cost-effectiveness is unknown. Materials and methods: A Markov model was constructed based on the results of the First-Line ErbituX in lung cancer randomized trial, adding cetuximab to cisplatin-vinorelbine first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding cetuximab, expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and relative to a willingness-to-pay threshold of €60?000/QALY. The impact of cetuximab intermittent dosing schedules on the ICER was also evaluated. RESULTS: Adding cetuximab to standard chemotherapy leads to a gain of 0.07 QALYs per patient at an additional cost of €26?088. The ICER for adding cetuximab to chemotherapy was €376?205 per QALY gained. Intermittent cetuximab dosing schedules resulted in ICERs per QALY gained between €31?300 and €83?100, under the assumption of equal efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: From a health economic perspective, the addition of cetuximab to standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing advanced NSCLC cannot be recommended to date, due to a high ICER compared with other health care interventions. Treatment schedules resulting in more favorable cost-utility ratios should be evaluated.",2010-01-06671,20843984,Ann Oncol,M Joerger,2010,/,,No,20843984,"M Joerger; Addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a cost-utility analysis, Ann Oncol, 2010-Sep-13; ():0923-7534",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adding cetuximab to standard cisplatin-vinorelbine first-line chemotherapy vs. Standard cisplatin-vinorelbine first-line chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,376205,Euro,2009,632450.84
7167,Cost-effectiveness of guidelines for insertion of inferior vena cava filters in high-risk trauma patients,"BACKGROUND:: Inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) can prevent pulmonary embolism (PE); however, indications for use vary. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) 2002 guidelines suggest prophylactic IVCF use in high-risk patients, but the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2008 guidelines do not. This analysis compares cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vs therapeutic retrievable IVCF placement in high-risk trauma patients. METHODS:: Markov modeling was used to determine incremental cost-effectiveness of these guidelines in dollars per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) during hospitalization and long-term follow-up. Our population was 46-year-old trauma patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) by EAST criteria to whom either the EAST (prophylactic IVCF) or ACCP (no prophylactic IVCF) guidelines were applied. The analysis assumed the societal perspective over a lifetime. For base case and sensitivity analyses, probabilities and utilities were obtained from published literature and costs calculated from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedules, the Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project database, and Red Book wholesale drug prices for 2007. For data unavailable from the literature, similarities to other populations were used to make assumptions. RESULTS:: In base case analysis, prophylactic IVCFs were more costly ($37,700 vs $37,300) and less effective (by 0.139 QALYs) than therapeutic IVCFs. In sensitivity analysis, the EAST strategy of prophylactic filter placement would become the preferred strategy in individuals never having a filter, with either an annual probability of VTE of =9.6% (base case, 5.9%), or a very high annual probability of anticoagulation complications of =24.3% (base case, 2.5%). The EAST strategy would also be favored if the annual probability of venous insufficiency was <7.69% (base case, 13.9%) after filter removal or <1.90% with a retained filter (base case, 14.1%). In initial hospitalization only, EAST guidelines were more costly by $2988 and slightly more effective by .0008 QALY, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $383,638/QALY. CONCLUSIONS:: Analysis suggests prophylactic IVC filters are not cost-effective in high-risk trauma patients. The magnitude of this result is primarily dependent on probabilities of long-term sequelae (venous thromboembolism, bleeding complications). Even in the initial hospitalization, however, prophylactic IVCF costs for the additional quality-adjusted life years gained did not justify use.",2010-01-06674,20843631,J Vasc Surg,EL Spangler,2010,/,,No,20843631,"EL Spangler; Cost-effectiveness of guidelines for insertion of inferior vena cava filters in high-risk trauma patients, J Vasc Surg, 2010-Sep-14; ():0741-5214",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic indications for inferior vena cava filters ( IVCFs) vs. Traditional (therapeutic) indications for IVCFs,Not Stated,46 Years,46 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-2877.7,United States,2007,-3592.04
7168,"Within a smoking-cessation program, what impact does genetic information on lung cancer need to have to demonstrate cost-effectiveness?","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Many smoking-cessation programs and pharmaceutical aids demonstrate substantial health gains for a relatively low allocation of resources. Genetic information represents a type of individualized or personal feedback regarding the risk of developing lung cancer, and hence the potential benefits from stopping smoking, may motivate the person to remain smoke-free. The purpose of this study was to explore what the impact of a genetic test needs to have within a typical smoking-cessation program aimed at heavy smokers in order to be cost-effective. METHODS: Two strategies were modelled for a hypothetical cohort of heavy smokers aged 50 years; individuals either received or did not receive a genetic test within the course of a usual smoking-cessation intervention comprising nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counselling. A Markov model was constructed using evidence from published randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses for estimates on 12-month quit rates and long-term relapse rates. Epidemiological data were used for estimates on lung cancer risk stratified by time since quitting and smoking patterns. Extensive sensitivity analyses were used to explore parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The discounted incremental cost per QALY was AU$34,687 (95% CI $12,483, $87,734) over 35 years. At a willingness-to-pay of AU$20,000 per QALY gained, the genetic testing strategy needs to produce a 12-month quit rate of at least 12.4% or a relapse rate 12% lower than NRT and counselling alone for it to be equally cost-effective. The likelihood that adding a genetic test to the usual smoking-cessation intervention is cost-effective was 20.6% however cost-effectiveness ratios were favourable in certain situations (e.g., applied to men only, a 60 year old cohort). CONCLUSIONS: The findings were sensitive to small changes in critical variables such as the 12-month quit rates and relapse rates. As such, the cost-effectiveness of the genetic testing smoking cessation program is uncertain. Further clinical research on smoking-cessation quit and relapse rates following genetic testing is needed to inform its cost-effectiveness.",2010-01-06675,20843376,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Louisa G Gordon,2010,8 /,18,Yes,20843376,"Louisa G Gordon; Within a smoking-cessation program, what impact does genetic information on lung cancer need to have to demonstrate cost-effectiveness?, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2010; 8():1478-7547; 18",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Usual smoking-cessation (USC) plus genetic test vs. Usual smoking-cessation (USC),Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,5.00,5.00,27572,Australia,2009,26365.64
7169,Tiotropium's cost-effectiveness for the treatment of COPD: a cost-utility analysis under real-world conditions,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Tiotropium is reimbursed since March 2004 in Belgium for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Questions however remain on this product's value for money. The purpose of this study is to calculate tiotropium's cost-effectiveness under real-world conditions. METHODS: Strengths of both observational and RCT data were combined in a model. A large longitudinal (2002-2006) observational dataset of regular tiotropium users (56 321 patients) was analysed to retrieve the baseline risk for exacerbations and exacerbation-related hospitalisations the year before the first delivery of tiotropium. The relative treatment effect from the UPLIFT (Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium) trial was then applied to this baseline risk to reflect the effect of tiotropium treatment and calculate the intervention's incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: After 1000 Latin Hypercube simulations, the incremental benefit expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained is on average 0.00048 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00009 - 0.00092). In combination with a substantial mean incremental cost of €373 per patient (95% CI 279 - 475), this results in an unfavourable average ICER of €1 244 023 (95% CI 328 571 - 4 712 704) per QALY gained. Results were most sensitive to the treatment effect on hospitalisations. Based on our large observational database, up to 89% of the patients were not hospitalised for COPD in the year before the first tiotropium delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The main cause for tiotropium's unfavourable cost-effectiveness ratio is a combination of a relative high price for tiotropium, a low number of hospitalisations without tiotropium treatment (on average 0.14/year) and a non-significant treatment effect (on average 0.94) with respect to avoiding exacerbation-related hospitalisations. From an economic point of view, a revision of reimbursement modalities (e.g. with a lower price) would be justified and would entail a more efficient use of resources.",2010-01-06676,20843311,BMC Pulm Med,Mattias Neyt,2010,10 /,47,No,20843311,"Mattias Neyt; Tiotropium's cost-effectiveness for the treatment of COPD: a cost-utility analysis under real-world conditions, BMC Pulm Med, 2010; 10():1471-2466; 47",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tiotropium vs. Usual care treated with similar long-acting bronchodilators such as salmeterol,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,777083.38,Euro,2008,1375540.04
7170,The Gain in Quality-Adjusted Life Months by Switching to Esomeprazole in Those With Continued Reflux Symptoms in Primary Care: EncomPASS-A Cluster-Randomized Trial,"OBJECTIVES:Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are effective in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but their cost effectiveness is unknown. This is usually determined by cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, but whether PPI therapy improves QALYs has not been assessed in a randomized trial. The PPI acid suppression symptom (PASS) test is a five-item questionnaire that identifies patients with persistent acid-related symptoms. We evaluated whether a PASS test-based management strategy of changing GERD therapy to esomeprazole in those with continued symptoms on another PPI or H(2) receptor antagonist therapy would be cost effective. We expressed the data in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life months (QALM), as this was a 4-week trial.METHODS:This is a multicenter, cluster-randomized, open-label study in primary care physician centers across Canada. Primary care physician centers were randomized to intervention or control arms. Patients on acid-suppressing medication were identified from primary care records and asked to complete the PASS test. PASS test failures at baseline assessment continued current therapy in control practices or switched to esomeprazole 20 or 40?mg daily (the dose was at the clinician's discretion) for 4 weeks in intervention practices. A planned secondary end point was QALM gain, measured using the validated Euroqol (EQ-5D) completed at baseline and 4 weeks. Medication use was also assessed by questionnaire. Canadian unit generic costs were applied to all GERD drugs, except to esomeprazole and lansoprazole, wherein proprietary costs were used (all costs in Canadian $). Data were analyzed using bootstrap sampling.RESULTS:A total of 1,564 patients were recruited from 134 intervention sites and 92 control sites. Data were evaluable for 808 intervention and 445 control patients. The mean (±standard deviation) QALM at 4 weeks in the intervention group was 0.885±0.164 compared with 0.814±0.179 in the control group, resulting in a mean 0.071 (95% CI=0.091-0.051) QALM gain (P<0.0001). Esomeprazole was cost effective for PASS test failures, with a mean cost of $763 (95% CI=456-1,414) per QALM gain.CONCLUSIONS:Esomeprazole was associated with a statistically significant gain in QALMs and was cost effective in primary care patients with persistent acid-related symptoms identified by the PASS test.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 14 September 2010; doi:10.1038/ajg.2010.368.",2010-01-06677,20842110,Am J Gastroenterol,P Moayyedi,2010,/,,No,20842110,"P Moayyedi; The Gain in Quality-Adjusted Life Months by Switching to Esomeprazole in Those With Continued Reflux Symptoms in Primary Care: EncomPASS-A Cluster-Randomized Trial, Am J Gastroenterol, 2010-Sep-14; ():0002-9270",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Esomeprazole 20 or 40 mg once daily vs. Current therapy, proton pump inhibitor or H2-receptor antagonist",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,8235.29,Canada,2008,9346.67
7171,Quality of life and cost-effectiveness of a 3-year trial of lifestyle intervention in primary health care,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions reduce cardiovascular risk and risk of diabetes mellitus, but reports on long-term effects on quality of life (QOL) and health care utilization are rare. We investigated the impact of a primary health care-based lifestyle intervention program on QOL and cost-effectiveness over 3 years. METHODS: A total of 151 men and women, aged 18 to 65 years, at moderate to high risk for cardiovascular disease, were randomly assigned to either lifestyle intervention with standard care or standard care alone. Intervention consisted of supervised exercise sessions and diet counseling for 3 months, followed by regular group meetings over a 3-year period. Change in QOL was measured with EuroQol (5-dimensional EuroQol-5D [EQ-5D] and EuroQol-VAS [EQ-VAS]), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the 6-dimensional Short-Form 6D (SF-6D). The health economic evaluation was performed from a societal view and a treatment perspective. In a cost-utility analysis, the costs, gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and savings in health care were considered. Cost-effectiveness was also described using the net monetary benefit method. RESULTS: Significant differences between the groups over the 3-year period were shown in the EQ-VAS (P = .002), SF-6D (P = .01), and SF-36 (P = .04) physical component summary but not in the EQ-5D (P = .24) or SF-36 (P = .37) mental component summary. The net savings were $47 per participant. Costs per gained QALY, savings not counted, were $1668 to $4813. Probabilities of cost-effectiveness were 89% to 100% when the amount of $50,000 was used as stakeholder's threshold of willingness to pay for a gained QALY. CONCLUSION: Lifestyle intervention in primary care improves QOL and is highly cost-effective in relation to standard care.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model compared the cost-effectiveness (taking into account drugs; medical visits; laboratory tests; X-rays; terminal care; adverse event management) of sunitinib and BSC across three disease states: no progression, survival with progression and death from mRCC or other causes. RESULTS: The monthly incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values for sunitinib treatment were €6073/progression-free survival month, €25,199/life years and €34,196/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. In 95% of cases, the ICER/QALY values were below the accepted €45,000/QALY threshold. Efficacy and cost of sunitinib had the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness.

7173,Cost-Effectiveness of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Preliminary Comparison of Single-Bundle and Double-Bundle Techniques,"BACKGROUND: There has been growing interest in anatomical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), including the use of double-bundle (DB) reconstruction techniques. HYPOTHESIS: The DB technique will not be cost-effective when compared with single-bundle (SB) reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A decision-analysis model with input values derived from the literature was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DB ACL reconstruction compared with SB ACL reconstruction. Effectiveness was based on the revision rate and the postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of DB knees result in an IKDC score of A, compared with 54% of SB knees. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a DB reconstruction compared with an SB reconstruction was $6416 per quality adjusted life year in the baseline scenario and $64 371 per quality adjusted life year in the alternate scenario. The model is very sensitive to the proportions of IKDC A outcomes. The model is also sensitive to the utility values assigned to IKDC A and B outcomes and is less sensitive to the marginal cost of a DB reconstruction. CONCLUSION: This preliminary analysis based on published clinical results to date shows DB ACL reconstruction may be cost-effective, despite increased upfront cost. More research is needed to confirm whether there is any difference in the distribution of IKDC outcomes between the 2 techniques. Perhaps more importantly, the lack of any other demonstrated clinical benefit from the DB technique questions the clinical relevance of this difference in IKDC scores. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Revision data and longer term outcomes after DB reconstruction and more reliable clinical utility data are needed to definitively compare the cost-effectiveness of DB and SB ACL reconstruction. Studies of ACL reconstruction and other sports medicine procedures should report the distribution of outcomes data to facilitate future analyses of clinical effectiveness.",2010-01-06691,20829416,Am J Sports Med,ES Paxton,2010,/,,No,20829416,"ES Paxton; Cost-Effectiveness of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Preliminary Comparison of Single-Bundle and Double-Bundle Techniques, Am J Sports Med, 2010-Sep-09; ():1552-3365",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Double-bundle surgical reconstruction of the ACL vs. Single-bundle surgical reconstruction of the ACL,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Years,3.00,3.00,6416,United States,2009,7740.07

Methods: A Markov model was used to calculate costs and benefits of nucleos(t)ide strategies in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with hepatitis B virus mono-infection and compensated liver disease. The model included 18 disease states representing CHB progression. Quality-of-life data and costs for severe disease states were based on published studies, while monitoring costs for other disease states were based on expert opinion. Transition probabilities for movements between states were based on a meta-analysis, clinical trials, and natural history studies. Results: First-line TDF generated the highest net benefits of all 211 nucleos(t)ide strategies evaluated at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. First-line TDF cost £19,084/QALY gained compared with giving lamivudine (LAM) first-line and switching to TDF when LAM resistance occurs.

7182,Cost-Effectiveness of Lumbar Supports for Home Care Workers With Recurrent Low Back Pain: An Economic Evaluation Alongside a Randomized-Controlled Trial,"STUDY DESIGN.: Economic evaluation from a societal perspective alongside a 12-months randomized-controlled trial. OBJECTIVE.: To determine the cost-effectiveness of wearing a lumbar support for home care workers with recurrent low back pain (LBP) (secondary prevention). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: LBP is a large medical and economical burden. Evidence on the secondary preventive use of lumbar supports is sparse. METHODS.: A total of 360 home care workers with a self-reported history of LBP were randomly assigned to usual care or usual care plus wearing a lumbar support on working days with LBP, during a 1-year period. Primary clinical outcome measures were the average number of self-reported days with LBP, number of calendar days sick leave in general, and quality of life. Direct and indirect costs were measured by means of cost diaries. Differences in mean costs between groups, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility ratios were evaluated, and cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves presented by applying nonparametric bootstrapping techniques. RESULTS.: During the intervention period, the home care workers using a lumbar support in addition to usual care reported on average 54 fewer days with LBP (95%confidence interval [CI], -85 to -29). The estimated mean difference in sick leave was not statistically significant (-5.0 days per year in favor of the lumbar support group; 95% CI, -21.1 to 6.8). There was no statistically significant difference in quality of life. Direct costs were &OV0556;235 (US$ 266) lower in the lumbar support group (95% CI, -386 to -79). Indirect costs were &OV0556;255 (US$ 288) lower, but this was not statistically significant (95% CI, -879 to 299). CONCLUSION.: Lumbar support seems to be a cost-effective addition to usual care for home care workers with recurrent LBP. For estimating the LBP-related indirect costs, it would be more precise when an objective measure for LBP-related sick leave would have been available. There is a need for more evidence to confirm these findings, also in other working populations.",2010-01-06701,20823783,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),PD Roelofs,2010,/,,No,20823783,"PD Roelofs; Cost-Effectiveness of Lumbar Supports for Home Care Workers With Recurrent Low Back Pain: An Economic Evaluation Alongside a Randomized-Controlled Trial, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 2010-Sep-03; ():1528-1159",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Lumbar support + usual care vs. Usual care, no lumbar support",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-49000,Euro,2003,-78024.22
7183,A cost-effectiveness analysis of carotid artery stenting compared with endarterectomy,"Endarterectomy and angioplasty with stenting have emerged as 2 alternative treatments for carotid artery stenosis. This study's objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of carotid artery stenting (CAS) compared with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in symptomatic subjects who are suitable for either intervention. A Markov analysis of these 2 revascularization procedures was conducted using direct Medicare costs (2007 US$) and characteristics of a symptomatic 70-year-old cohort over a lifetime. In the base case analysis, CAS produced 8.97 quality-adjusted life-years, compared with 9.64 quality-adjusted life-years for CEA. The incremental cost of stenting was $17,700, and thus CAS was dominated by CEA. Sensitivity analyses show that the long-term probabilities of major stroke or mortality influenced the results. In the base case analysis, CEA for patients with symptomatic stenosis has a greater benefit than CAS, with lower direct costs. With 59% probability, CEA will be the optimal intervention when all of the model assumptions are varied simultaneously.",2010-01-06707,20816349,J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,KC Young,2010,19 / 5,404-9,No,20816349,"KC Young; A cost-effectiveness analysis of carotid artery stenting compared with endarterectomy, J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis, 2010 Sep-Oct; 19(5):1532-8511; 404-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS) vs. Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-26417.91,United States,2007,-32975.69

METHODS: Participants (n = 1,629) from 23 Dutch general practices were randomized into one of four groups, which received 4 TPCs, 4 TMIs, 2 of each (combined), or no intervention (control), respectively. The self-reported outcomes, measured at baseline and 73 weeks follow-up (7 months after the last intervention component), were difference in total number of guidelines met at follow-up compared to baseline, and number of QALYs experienced over 73 weeks. The costs of implementing the intervention were estimated using a bottom-up approach. RESULTS: At 73 weeks follow-up participants showed increased adherence with 0.62 (TPC), 0.40 (TMI), 0.50 (combined), and 0.26 (control) guidelines compared to baseline, and experienced 1.09, 1.08, 1.08, and 1.07 QALYs, respectively. The costs for the control group were considered to be zero. TMI was more expensive (€107 per person) than both the combined intervention (€80) and TPC (€57). The control condition was most cost-effective for lower ceiling ratios, while TPC had the highest probability of being most cost-effective for higher ceiling ratios (more than €160 per additional guideline met, and €2,851 for each individual QALY). CONCLUSIONS: For low society's willingness to pay, the control group was most cost-effective for the number of QALYs experienced over 73 weeks. This also applied to the increase in the number of guidelines met at lower ceiling ratios, whereas at higher ceiling ratios, TPC had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than the TMI, combined or control conditions. This also seemed to apply for QALYs experienced over 73 weeks. More research is needed on the long-term efficacy of both TPC and TMI, as well as on how to increase their cost-effectiveness.

7187,"Cost effectiveness of deferasirox compared to desferrioxamine in the treatment of iron overload in lower-risk, transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome patients","Abstract Objective: The study evaluated the cost effectiveness of deferasirox (Exjade * ) compared to non-proprietary desferrioxamine (DFO) for the control of transfusional iron overload in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. A UK National Health Service perspective was adopted. Methods: Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in transfusion-dependent MDS patients with elevated serum ferritin levels. An economic model was used to extrapolate the clinical benefits of iron chelation therapy (ICT) in a cohort of lower risk MDS patients. Costs for drug acquisition, drug administration and monitoring, and quality of life (utility) outcomes associated with mode of drug administration were derived from a variety of sources. The incremental cost per QALY gained for deferasirox was estimated. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% in line with UK standards. Results: The base-case cost effectiveness of deferasirox versus DFO was estimated to be £20,822 per QALY gained, the key driver being the additional quality of life benefits associated with a simpler mode of administration for deferasirox. A mean survival benefit for both forms of ICT of 4.5 years was estimated. The results were sensitive to drug dose, days of DFO administration, and patient weight. Conclusions: In the UK, a cost per QALY below £20,000-30,000 is considered cost effective.

Results: The base-case cost effectiveness of deferasirox versus DFO was estimated to be £20,822 per QALY gained, the key driver being the additional quality of life benefits associated with a simpler mode of administration for deferasirox. A mean survival benefit for both forms of ICT of 4.5 years was estimated. The results were sensitive to drug dose, days of DFO administration, and patient weight.

7196,Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus: cost-utility of different screening strategies based on a woman's individual risk of disease,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The cost-effectiveness of eight strategies for screening for gestational diabetes (including no screening) was estimated with respect to the level of individual patient risk. METHODS: Cost-utility analysis using a decision analytic model populated with efficacy evidence pooled from recent randomised controlled trials, from the funding perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. Seven screening strategies using various combinations of screening and diagnostic tests were tested in addition to no screening. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) over a lifetime. RESULTS: The strategy that has the greatest likelihood of being cost-effective is dependent on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus for each individual woman. When gestational diabetes mellitus risk is <1% then the no screening/treatment strategy is cost-effective; where risk is between 1.0% and 4.2% fasting plasma glucose followed by OGTT is most likely to be cost-effective; and where risk is >4.2%, universal OGTT is most likely to be cost-effective. However, acceptability of the test alters the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Screening for gestational diabetes can be cost-effective. The best strategy is dependent on the underlying risk of each individual and the acceptability of the tests used. The current study suggests that if a woman's individual risk of gestational diabetes could be accurately predicted, then healthcare resource allocation could be improved by providing an individualised screening strategy.",2010-01-06715,20809381,Diabetologia,JA Round,2010,/,,No,20809381,"JA Round; Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus: cost-utility of different screening strategies based on a woman's individual risk of disease, Diabetologia, 2010-Aug-31; ():0012-186X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) follow by glucose challenge test (GCT) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.50,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2009,Not Stated

The present exploratory study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ZOL in this population, adopting a French, German, and United Kingdom (UK) government payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cost-effectiveness model was based on a post hoc retrospective analysis of a subset of patients with RCC who were included in a larger randomized clinical trial of patients with bone metastases secondary to a variety of cancers. In the trial, patients were randomized to receive ZOL (n = 27) or placebo (n = 19) with concomitant antineoplastic therapy every 3 weeks for 9 months (core study) plus 12 months during a study extension. Since the trial did not collect costs or data on the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the patients, these outcomes had to be assumed via modeling exercises. The costs of SREs were estimated using hospital DRG tariffs. These estimates were supplemented with literature-based costs where possible. Drug, administration, and supply costs were obtained from published and internet sources. Consistent with similar economic analyses, patients were assumed to experience quality of life decrements lasting 1 month for each SRE. Uncertainty surrounding outcomes was addressed via multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Patients receiving ZOL experienced 1.07 fewer SREs than patients on placebo. Patients on ZOL experienced a gain in discounted QALYs of approximately 0.1563 in France and Germany and 0.1575 in the UK. Discounted SRE-related costs were substantially lower among ZOL than placebo patients (-<euro> 4,196 in France, -<euro> 3,880 in Germany, and -<euro> 3,355 in the UK). After taking into consideration the drug therapy costs, ZOL saved <euro> 1,358, <euro> 1,223, and <euro> 719 in France, Germany, and the UK, respectively.

7200,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for the prevention of postsurgical venous thromboembolism in Canada,"This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with rivaroxaban vs. enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare system. A model was developed that included both acute VTE (represented as a decision tree) and long-term complications (represented as a Markov process with one-year cycles). Transition probabilities were derived from phase III clinical trials comparing rivaroxaban with enoxaparin and published literature. Costs were derived from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative and publicly available sources. Utilities were derived from published literature. The model reported VTE event rates, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs over a five-year horizon. Costs are reported in 2007 Canadian Dollars (C$). When rivaroxaban and enoxaparin are compared in patients undergoing THR, rivaroxaban dominates enoxaparin. That is, rivaroxaban is associated with improved health outcomes as measured by increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.0006) and fewer symptomatic VTE events (0.0061), and also with lower cost (savings of C$300) per patient.
