17301,Prevention of renal failure in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the second leading cause (16.4%) of end-stage renal disease in China. The current study assessed the cost-effectiveness of preventing DKD in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the Chinese healthcare perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov decision model was developed according to the disease course of DKD. Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes might receive treatment according to one of the following three strategies: (i) ""do nothing"" strategy (control strategy); (ii) treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (universal strategy); (iii) or screening for microalbuminuria followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment (screening strategy). Clinical and utility data were obtained from the published literature. Direct medical costs and resource utilization in the Chinese healthcare setting were considered. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the impact of a range of variables and assumptions on the results. RESULTS: Compared with the control strategy, both the screening and universal strategies were cost-saving options that showed lower costs and better health benefits. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the universal strategy over the screening strategy was US $30,087 per quality-adjusted life-year, which was higher than the cost-effectiveness threshold of China. The sensitivity analyses showed robust results, except for the probability of developing macroalbuminuria from microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for microalbuminuria could be a cost-saving option for the prevention of DKD in the Chinese setting.",2017-01-23578,28296280,J Diabetes Investig,Bin Wu,2017,/,,No,28296280,"Bin Wu; Suhua Zhang; Houwen Lin; Shan Mou; Prevention of renal failure in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: A cost-effectiveness analysis, J Diabetes Investig, 2017 May 11; ():2040-1116",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening strategy: screening for microalbuminuria followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment vs. None,Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-14380,United States,2014,-15720.9
17302,Cost-effectiveness of combination daclatasvir-sofosbuvir for treatment of genotype 3 chronic hepatitis C infection in the United States,"BACKGROUND: A phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Daklinza (daclatasvir or DCV) in combination with sofosbuvir (SOF) for treatment of genotype (GT) 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. AIM: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of DCV + SOF vs SOF in combination with ribavirin (RBV) over a 20-year time horizon from the perspective of a United States (US) payer. METHODS: A published Markov model was adapted to reflect US demographic characteristics, treatment patterns, costs of drug acquisition, monitoring, disease and adverse event management, and mortality risks. Clinical inputs came from the ALLY-3 and VALENCE trials. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-utility ratio. Life-years, incidence of complications, number of patients achieving sustained virological response (SVR), and the total cost per SVR were secondary outcomes. Costs (2014 USD) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3% per year. Deterministic, probabilistic, and scenario sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: DCV + SOF was associated with lower costs and better effectiveness than SOF + RBV in the base case and in almost all scenarios (i.e. treatment-experienced, non-cirrhotic, time horizons of 5, 10, and 80 years). DCV + SOF was less costly, but also slightly less effective than SOF + RBV in the cirrhotic and treatment-naive population scenarios. Results were sensitive to variations in the probability of achieving SVR for both treatment arms. DCV + SOF costs less than $50,000 per QALY gained in 79% of all probabilistic iterations compared with SOF + RBV. CONCLUSION: DCV + SOF is a dominant option compared with SOF + RBV in the US for the overall GT 3 HCV patient population.",2017-01-23581,28294645,J Med Econ,Catherine Saint-Laurent Thibault,2017,/,1-11,Yes,28294645,"Catherine Saint-Laurent Thibault; Divya Moorjaney; Michael L Ganz; Bruce Sill; Shalini Hede; Yong Yuan; Boris Gorsh; Cost-effectiveness of combination daclatasvir-sofosbuvir for treatment of genotype 3 chronic hepatitis C infection in the United States, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-11",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Daklinza (daclatasvir or DCV) in combination with sofosbuvir (SOF) vs. Sofosbuvir (SOF) in combination with ribavirin (RBV),Genotype (GT) 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-286420,United States,2014,-313127.9
17303,Cost-effectiveness of sequenced treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with targeted immune modulators,"AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or Janus kinase/STAT pathway inhibitors (collectively referred to as bDMARDs) vs conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs) from the US societal perspective for treatment of patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with inadequate responses to cDMARDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was developed that assesses the impact of treatments on disease based on clinical trial data and real-world evidence. Treatment strategies included sequences starting with etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, or abatacept. Each of these treatment strategies was compared with cDMARDs. Incremental cost, incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each treatment sequence relative to cDMARDs. The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was determined using a US willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY. RESULTS: For the base-case scenario, bDMARD treatment sequences were associated with greater treatment benefit (i.e. more QALYs), lower lost productivity costs, and greater treatment-related costs than cDMARDs. The expected ICERs for bDMARD sequences ranged from approximately $126,000 to $140,000 per QALY gained, which is below the US-specific WTP.

17312,Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira versus liraglutide added to basal insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control on basal insulin in the USA,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: IDegLira, a fixed ratio combination of insulin degludec and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, utilizes the complementary mechanisms of action of these two agents to improve glycemic control with low risk of hypoglycemia and avoidance of weight gain. The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira vs liraglutide added to basal insulin, for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US setting. METHODS: Projections of lifetime costs and clinical outcomes were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effect data for patients receiving IDegLira and liraglutide added to basal insulin were modeled based on the outcomes of a published indirect comparison, as no head-to-head clinical trial data is currently available. Costs were accounted in 2015 US dollars ($) from a healthcare payer perspective. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with small improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with liraglutide added to basal insulin (8.94 vs 8.91 discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). The key driver of improved clinical outcomes was the greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin associated with IDegLira. IDegLira was associated with mean costs savings of $17,687 over patient lifetimes vs liraglutide added to basal insulin, resulting from lower treatment costs and cost savings as a result of complications avoided. CONCLUSIONS: The present long-term modeling analysis found that IDegLira was dominant vs liraglutide added to basal insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control on basal insulin in the US, improving clinical outcomes and reducing direct costs.",2017-01-23583,28294641,J Med Econ,B Hunt,2017,/,1-8,Yes,28294641,"B Hunt; M Mocarski; W J Valentine; J Langer; Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira versus liraglutide added to basal insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control on basal insulin in the USA, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,IDegLira vs. Liraglutide + basal insulin,not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-556233.33,United States,2015,-607379.66
17313,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty versus Hemiarthroplasty for the Management of Complex Proximal Humeral Fractures in the Elderly,"BACKGROUND: There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal surgical treatment of complex proximal humeral fractures in elderly patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) compared with hemiarthroplasty (HA) in the management of complex proximal humeral fractures, using a cost-utility analysis. METHODS: On the basis of data from published literature, a cost-utility analysis was conducted using decision tree and Markov modeling. A single-payer perspective, with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of Can$50,000 (Canadian dollars), and a lifetime time horizon were used. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the study''s primary outcome measure. RESULTS: In comparison with HA, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained for RTSA was Can$13,679. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed the model to be sensitive to the RTSA implant cost and the RTSA procedural cost. The ICER of Can$13,679 is well below the WTP threshold of Can$50,000, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 92.6% of model simulations favored RTSA. CONCLUSIONS: Our economic analysis found that RTSA for the treatment of complex proximal humeral fractures in the elderly is the preferred economic strategy when compared with HA. The ICER of RTSA is well below standard WTP thresholds, and its estimate of cost-effectiveness is similar to other highly successful orthopedic strategies such as total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of hip arthritis.",2017-01-23594,28292485,Value Health,Georg Osterhoff,2017,20 / 3,404-411,Yes,28292485,"Georg Osterhoff; Nathan N O'Hara; Jennifer D'Cruz; Sheila A Sprague; Nick Bansback; Nathan Evaniew; Gerard P Slobogean; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty versus Hemiarthroplasty for the Management of Complex Proximal Humeral Fractures in the Elderly, Value Health, 2017 Mar; 20(3):1098-3015; 404-411",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty vs. Hemiarthroplasty,complex proximal humerus fracture and general health suitable for either arthroplasty procedure,72 Years,72 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,13679,Canada,2014,13548.14
17314,An Economic Evaluation of Sacubitril/Valsartan for Heart Failure Patients in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: In September 2014, the PARADIGM-HF trial showed the heart failure drug combination sacubitril/valsartan to be superior to enalapril for patients with a reduced ejection fraction. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in the Netherlands using the clinical data from the PARADIGM-HF trial. METHODS: To compare sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril in a cost-effectiveness study, a Markov model was developed using the effectiveness data from the PARADIGM-HF trial. A health care payer''s perspective was applied in the economic evaluation. The developed model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness for sacubitril/valsartan at different per diem prices. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that sacubitril/valsartan can be cost-effective at maximum daily costs of euro5.50 and euro14.14 considering willingness-to-pay thresholds of euro20,000 and euro50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the model, identifying only the price of sacubitril/valsartan and the mortality within the sacubitril/valsartan group as significant drivers of the cost-effectiveness ratio. Sacubitril/valsartan was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000 per QALY (euro50,000 per QALY) in more than 80% of the replications with certainty at the price point of euro3 (euro10). CONCLUSIONS: Sacubitril/valsartan can be considered a cost-effective treatment at a daily price of euro5.25.

17315,Real-World Data for the Evaluation of Transarterial Radioembolization versus Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the use of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with that of sorafenib in the treatment of patients with intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. METHODS: Patient-level data were consecutively recorded and collected at three oncology centers in Italy. A propensity score matching was performed to compare patients with similar clinical characteristics who underwent TARE or sorafenib treatment. Clinical data from the matched cohorts were used to populate a Markov model to project, on a lifetime horizon, life years, quality-adjusted life years, and economic outcomes associated with TARE and sorafenib for both intermediate and advanced HCC stages. RESULTS: Starting from data covering 389 and 241 patients who underwent TARE and sorafenib treatment, respectively, the propensity score matching yielded a total of 308 matched patients. For intermediate-stage patients, the model estimated for TARE versus sorafenib an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro3,302/QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro1,865 per life year gained), whereas for patients in advanced stage TARE dominated (lower costs and greater health improvements) compared with sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: From an Italian health care service perspective, TARE could be a cost-effective strategy in comparison with sorafenib for patients with intermediate or advanced HCC.

17317,A Real-world Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Sevelamer Versus Calcium Acetate in Korean Dialysis Patients,"PURPOSE: Sevelamer, a noncalcium phosphate binder, has been shown to attenuate the progression of vascular calcification and improve survival in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis compared with calcium-based binders. Using real-world data from a cohort study and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing sevelamer with calcium acetate in dialysis patients from the perspective of the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. METHODS: Data (demographic, diagnostic, laboratory, and survival) from 4674 patients undergoing dialysis enrolled in a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted in South Korea between September 2008 and December 2012 were linked to phosphate binder use, hospitalization, and cost data available from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. After propensity score matching, a dataset comprising comparable patients treated with either sevelamer (n = 501) or calcium acetate (n = 501) was used in the cost-effectiveness analysis. A Markov model was used to estimate costs, life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness over each patient''s lifetime. Forty-month treatment-specific overall survival (OS) data available from the dataset were extrapolated to lifetime survival with the use of regression analysis. FINDINGS: Patients had a mean age of 56.3 years and were treated with dialysis for a mean duration of 67.6 months. Compared with calcium acetate, sevelamer was associated with an incremental cost of South Korean Won () 12,246,911 ($10,819) and a gain of 1.758 life years and 1.108 QALYs per patient. This outcome yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 6,966,350 ($6154) and 11,057,699 ($9768) per life year and QALY gained, respectively. Conclusions regarding sevelamer''s cost-effectiveness were insensitive to alternative assumptions in time horizon, discount rate, hospitalization rate, costs, and health utility estimates, and they remained consistent in 100% of the model iterations, considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of 31,894,720 ($28,176) per QALY gained. IMPLICATIONS: This analysis of real-world data found that sevelamer''s higher cost relative to calcium acetate was adequately offset by improved survival among patients undergoing dialysis in South Korea. As such, sevelamer offers good value for money, representing a cost-effective alternative to calcium-based binders.",2017-01-23604,28291581,Clin Ther,Jang-Hee Cho,2017,/,,Yes,28291581,"Jang-Hee Cho; Hye Min Jang; Hee-Yeon Jung; Ji-Young Choi; Sun-Hee Park; Chan-Duck Kim; Chul Woo Yang; Dong-Chan Jin; Yong-Lim Kim; A Real-world Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Sevelamer Versus Calcium Acetate in Korean Dialysis Patients, Clin Ther, 2017 Apr 24; ():1879-114X",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sevelamer vs. Calcium acetate,undergoing dialysis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,9768,United States,2015,10666.18
17318,Adding bevacizumab to single agent chemotherapy for the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer: A cost effectiveness analysis of the AURELIA trial,"OBJECTIVE: AURELIA, a randomized phase III trial of adding bevacizumab (B) to single agent chemotherapy (CT) for the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer, demonstrated improved progression free survival (PFS) in the B+CT arm compared to CT alone. We aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding B to CT in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding bevacizumab (B) to single agent chemotherapy (CT) based on the arms of the AURELIA trial. Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and progression free survival (PFS) were modeled over fifteen months. Model inputs were extracted from published literature and public sources. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per QALY gained and ICERs per progression free life year saved (PF-LYS) were calculated. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of results. RESULTS: The ICER associated with B+CT is $410,455 per QALY gained and $217,080 per PF-LYS. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY, adding B to single agent CT is not cost effective for this patient population. Even at a WTP threshold of $100,000/QALY, B+CT is not cost effective. These findings are robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite gains in QALY and PFS, the addition of B to single agent CT for treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer is not cost effective.

17319,The cost-effectiveness of using chronic kidney disease risk scores to screen for early-stage chronic kidney disease,"BACKGROUND: Better treatment during early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) may slow progression to end-stage renal disease and decrease associated complications and medical costs. Achieving early treatment of CKD is challenging, however, because a large fraction of persons with CKD are unaware of having this disease. Screening for CKD is one important method for increasing awareness. We examined the cost-effectiveness of identifying persons for early-stage CKD screening (i.e., screening for moderate albuminuria) using published CKD risk scores. METHODS: We used the CKD Health Policy Model, a micro-simulation model, to simulate the cost-effectiveness of using CKD two published risk scores by Bang et al. and Kshirsagar et al. to identify persons in the US for CKD screening with testing for albuminuria. Alternative risk score thresholds were tested (0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, and 0.02) above which persons were assigned to receive screening at alternative intervals (1-, 2-, and 5-year) for follow-up screening if the first screening was negative. We examined incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incremental lifetime costs divided by incremental lifetime QALYs, relative to the next higher screening threshold to assess cost-effectiveness. Cost-effective scenarios were determined as those with ICERs less than $50,000 per QALY. Among the cost-effective scenarios, the optimal scenario was determined as the one that resulted in the highest lifetime QALYs. RESULTS: ICERs ranged from $8,823 per QALY to $124,626 per QALY for the Bang et al. risk score and $6,342 per QALY to $405,861 per QALY for the Kshirsagar et al. risk score. The Bang et al. risk score with a threshold of 0.02 and 2-year follow-up screening was found to be optimal because it had an ICER less than $50,000 per QALY and resulted in the highest lifetime QALYs.

METHODS: We used the CKD Health Policy Model, a micro-simulation model, to simulate the cost-effectiveness of using CKD two published risk scores by Bang et al. and Kshirsagar et al. to identify persons in the US for CKD screening with testing for albuminuria. Alternative risk score thresholds were tested (0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, and 0.02) above which persons were assigned to receive screening at alternative intervals (1-, 2-, and 5-year) for follow-up screening if the first screening was negative. We examined incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incremental lifetime costs divided by incremental lifetime QALYs, relative to the next higher screening threshold to assess cost-effectiveness. Cost-effective scenarios were determined as those with ICERs less than $50,000 per QALY. Among the cost-effective scenarios, the optimal scenario was determined as the one that resulted in the highest lifetime QALYs. RESULTS: ICERs ranged from $8,823 per QALY to $124,626 per QALY for the Bang et al. risk score and $6,342 per QALY to $405,861 per QALY for the Kshirsagar et al. risk score. The Bang et al. risk score with a threshold of 0.02 and 2-year follow-up screening was found to be optimal because it had an ICER less than $50,000 per QALY and resulted in the highest lifetime QALYs.

We examined the cost-effectiveness of identifying persons for early-stage CKD screening (i.e., screening for moderate albuminuria) using published CKD risk scores. METHODS: We used the CKD Health Policy Model, a micro-simulation model, to simulate the cost-effectiveness of using CKD two published risk scores by Bang et al. and Kshirsagar et al. to identify persons in the US for CKD screening with testing for albuminuria. Alternative risk score thresholds were tested (0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, and 0.02) above which persons were assigned to receive screening at alternative intervals (1-, 2-, and 5-year) for follow-up screening if the first screening was negative. We examined incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incremental lifetime costs divided by incremental lifetime QALYs, relative to the next higher screening threshold to assess cost-effectiveness. Cost-effective scenarios were determined as those with ICERs less than $50,000 per QALY. Among the cost-effective scenarios, the optimal scenario was determined as the one that resulted in the highest lifetime QALYs. RESULTS: ICERs ranged from $8,823 per QALY to $124,626 per QALY for the Bang et al. risk score and $6,342 per QALY to $405,861 per QALY for the Kshirsagar et al. risk score. The Bang et al. risk score with a threshold of 0.02 and 2-year follow-up screening was found to be optimal because it had an ICER less than $50,000 per QALY and resulted in the highest lifetime QALYs.

17344,The cost-effectiveness of using chronic kidney disease risk scores to screen for early-stage chronic kidney disease,"BACKGROUND: Better treatment during early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) may slow progression to end-stage renal disease and decrease associated complications and medical costs. Achieving early treatment of CKD is challenging, however, because a large fraction of persons with CKD are unaware of having this disease. Screening for CKD is one important method for increasing awareness. We examined the cost-effectiveness of identifying persons for early-stage CKD screening (i.e., screening for moderate albuminuria) using published CKD risk scores. METHODS: We used the CKD Health Policy Model, a micro-simulation model, to simulate the cost-effectiveness of using CKD two published risk scores by Bang et al. and Kshirsagar et al. to identify persons in the US for CKD screening with testing for albuminuria. Alternative risk score thresholds were tested (0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, and 0.02) above which persons were assigned to receive screening at alternative intervals (1-, 2-, and 5-year) for follow-up screening if the first screening was negative. We examined incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incremental lifetime costs divided by incremental lifetime QALYs, relative to the next higher screening threshold to assess cost-effectiveness. Cost-effective scenarios were determined as those with ICERs less than $50,000 per QALY. Among the cost-effective scenarios, the optimal scenario was determined as the one that resulted in the highest lifetime QALYs. RESULTS: ICERs ranged from $8,823 per QALY to $124,626 per QALY for the Bang et al. risk score and $6,342 per QALY to $405,861 per QALY for the Kshirsagar et al. risk score.

METHODS: We performed a decision analysis to compare the health outcomes and costs of 4 mediastinal staging strategies: no invasive staging, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), mediastinoscopy, and EBUS-TBNA followed by mediastinoscopy if EBUS-TBNA is negative. We determined incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) for all strategies and performed comprehensive deterministic sensitivity analyses using a willingness to pay threshold of $80,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Under the base-case scenario, the no invasive mediastinal staging strategy was least effective (QALY, 5.80) and least expensive ($11,863), followed by mediastinoscopy, EBUS-TBNA, and EBUS-TBNA followed by mediastinoscopy with 5.86, 5.87, and 5.88 QALYs, respectively. The ICER was approximately $26,000/QALY for EBUS-TBNA staging and approximately $1,400,000/QALY for EBUS-TBNA followed by mediastinoscopy. The mediastinoscopy strategy was dominated. Once pN2 exceeds 2.5%, EBUS-TBNA staging is cost-effective ( approximately $80,000/QALY). Once the pN2 reaches 57%, EBUS-TBNA followed by mediastinoscopy is cost-effective (ICER approximately $79,000/QALY).

CONCLUSIONS: Invasive mediastinal staging in NSCLC is unlikely to be cost-effective in clinical N0 patients if pN2 <2.5%.

17352,A cost-utility analysis of risk model-guided versus physician's choice antiemetic prophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer: a net benefit regression approach,"PURPOSE: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a risk model-guided (RMG) antiemetic prophylaxis strategy compared with the physician''s choice (PC) strategy in patients receiving chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis based on a published randomized controlled trial of 324 patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy at two Canadian cancer centers. Patients were randomized to receive their antiemetic treatments according to either predefined risk scores or the treating physician''s preference. Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Cost and utility data were obtained from the Canadian published literature. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) over a range of willingness-to-pay values. The lower and upper bounds of the 95% CIs were used to characterize the statistical uncertainty for the cost-effectiveness estimates and construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: From the health care system''s perspective, the RMG strategy was associated with greater QALYs gained (0.0016, 95% CI 0.0009, 0.0022) and higher cost ($49.19, 95% CI $24.87, $73.08) than the PC strategy, resulting in an ICER of $30,864.28 (95% CI $14,718.98, $62,789.04). At the commonly used threshold of $50,000/QALY, the probability that RMG prophylaxis is cost-effective was >94%; this probability increased with greater willingness-to-pay values.

17353,"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Quadripolar Versus Bipolar Left Ventricular Leads for Cardiac Resynchronization Defibrillator Therapy in a Large, Multicenter UK Registry","OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of quadripolar versus bipolar cardiac resynchronization defibrillator therapy systems. BACKGROUND: Quadripolar left ventricular (LV) leads for cardiac resynchronization therapy reduce phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) and are associated with reduced mortality compared with bipolar leads. METHODS: A total of 606 patients received implants at 3 UK centers (319 Q, 287 B), between 2009 and 2014; mean follow-up was 879 days. Rehospitalization episodes were costed at National Health Service national tariff rates, and EQ-5D utility values were applied to heart failure admissions, acute coronary syndrome events, and mortality data, which were used to estimate quality-adjusted life-year differences over 5 years. RESULTS: Groups were matched with regard to age and sex. Patients with quadripolar implants had a lower rate of hospitalization than those with bipolar implants (42.6% vs. 55.4%; p = 0.002). This was primarily driven by fewer hospital readmissions for heart failure (51 [16%] vs. 75 [26.1%], respectively, for quadripolar vs. bipolar implants; p = 0.003) and generator replacements (9 [2.8%] vs. 19 [6.6%], respectively; p = 0.03). Hospitalization for suspected acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, device explantation, and lead revisions were similar. This lower health-care utilization cost translated into a cumulative 5-year cost saving for patients with quadripolar systems where the acquisition cost was < pound932 (US $1,398) compared with bipolar systems. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results mirrored the deterministic calculations. For the average additional price of pound1,200 (US $1,800) over a bipolar system, the incremental cost-effective ratio was pound3,692 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (US $5,538), far below the usual willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 (US $30,000). CONCLUSIONS: In a UK health-care 5-year time horizon, the additional purchase price of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization defibrillator therapy systems is largely offset by lower subsequent event costs up to 5 years after implantation, which makes this technology highly cost-effective compared with bipolar systems.",2017-01-23629,28280785,JACC Clin Electrophysiol,Jonathan M Behar,2017,3 / 2,107-116,No,28280785,"Jonathan M Behar; Hui Men Selina Chin; Steve Fearn; Julian O M Ormerod; James Gamble; Paul W X Foley; Julian Bostock; Simon Claridge; Tom Jackson; Manav Sohal; Antonios P Antoniadis; Reza Razavi; Tim R Betts; Neil Herring; Christopher Aldo Rinaldi; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Quadripolar Versus Bipolar Left Ventricular Leads for Cardiac Resynchronization Defibrillator Therapy in a Large, Multicenter UK Registry, JACC Clin Electrophysiol, 2017 Feb; 3(2):2405-500X; 107-116",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quadripolar cardiac resynchronization defibrillator therapy systems vs. Standard/Usual Care- Bipolar cardiac resynchronization defibrillator therapy systems,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,3692,United Kingdom,2016,5396.67
17354,Optimizing choice of oral interferon-free treatment for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus using testing for NS5A resistance: a cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service,"BACKGROUND: Patients with genotype-1 hepatitis C virus infection who have failed to respond to standard therapy or who relapse following treatment may be considered for an interferon-free regimen incorporating a nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor. Sustained virologic response (SVR) with these regimens is typically >90%, but this is reduced in patients with NS5A resistance. European Association for Study of the Liver guidelines recommend simeprevir + sofosbuvir +/- ribavirin (SMV+SOF+/-R) for re-treating patients failing an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen. An alternative strategy would be to test for NS5A resistance prior to treatment, with therapy optimized based on the results. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate disease progression for treatment-experienced genotype 1 patients with severe fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis. Targeted treatment with either SMV+SOF+/-R or sofosbuvir + ledipasvir +/- ribavirin (SOF+LDV+/-R) based on pretreatment NS5A resistance testing was compared to routine SOF+LDV+/-R without testing. Treatment duration was 12 or 24 weeks for patients with severe fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis (Metavir F3/F4). SVR data for the treatment options were based on the results of published clinical trials. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. RESULTS: Optimized treatment using NS5A resistance testing yielded 0.163 additional QALYs and increased costs of euro2,789 per patient versus no testing. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was euro17,078/QALY. Sensitivity analysis identified the SVR attributable to each of the treatment regimens as the most sensitive determinant of ICER (range: euro10,055/QALY-euro43,501/QALY across plausible range). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000/QALY, the probability that NS5A-directed treatment will be cost-effective is 81.4%.

17355,Cost-effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements in older malnourished care home residents,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is common in care home residents, but information on the cost-effectiveness of nutritional interventions is lacking. This study, involving a randomised trial in care home residents, aimed to examine whether oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are cost-effective relative to dietary advice. METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken prospectively in 104 older care home residents (88 +/- 8 years) without overt dementia, who were randomised to receive either ONS or dietary advice for 12 weeks. Costs were estimated from resource use and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) from health-related quality of life, assessed using EuroQoL (EQ-5D-3L, time-trade-off) and mortality. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using ''intention to treat'' and ''complete case'' analyses. RESULTS: The ONS group gained significantly more QALYs than the dietary advice group at significantly greater costs. The ICER (extra cost per QALY gained), adjusted for nutritional status, type of care, baseline costs and quality of life, was found to be pound10,961 using the ''intention to treat'' analysis ( pound190.60 (cost)/0.0174 (QALYs); n = 104) and pound11,875 using ''complete case'' analysis ( pound217.30/0.0183; n = 76) (2016 prices). Sensitivity analysis based on ''intention to treat'' data indicated an 83% probability that the ICER was </= pound20,000 and 92% that it was </= pound30,000. With the ''complete case data'' the probabilities were 80% and 90% respectively.

17356,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in patients with chronic hepatitis C: Treatment of patients with absence or mild fibrosis compared to patients with advanced fibrosis,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 (GT1) in the absence or mild fibrosis (F0-F1) versus advanced fibrosis (F2-F4), from the perspective of the Spanish Health System. A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression, estimating costs and outcomes [life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] derived from starting with LDV/SOF in patients with F0-F1 compared with F2-F4. Therapy duration was 8 weeks in noncirrhotic patients with viral load <6 million IU/mL and 12 weeks in the remaining patients. Sustained virologic response rates were obtained from real-world cohort studies. Transition probabilities, utilities and direct costs were obtained from the literature. A 3% annual discount rate was applied to costs and outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed. LDV/SOF in F0-F1 patients was a dominant strategy, being more effective (19.85 LYG and 19.80 QALY) than beginning treatment in F2-F4 patients (18.63 LYG and 16.25 QALY), generating savings of euro9228 per patient (euro3661 due to disease management and monitoring). In a cohort of 1000 patients, LDV/SOF in F0-F1 patients decreased the number of cases of decompensated cirrhosis (93%), hepatocellular carcinoma (97%) and liver-related deaths (95%) and prevented 6 liver transplants compared to initiating LDV/SOF in F2-F4 patients. In CHC treatment-naive GT1 patients, starting treatment with LDV/SOF in patients with F0-F1 compared to those with F2-F4 increases effectiveness by 1.22 LYG and 3.55 QALY gained and reduces disease burden and it is associated with cost savings.",2017-01-23642,28273410,J Viral Hepat,M Buti,2017,/,,No,28273410,"M Buti; R Dominguez-Hernandez; I Oyaguez; M A Casado; R Esteban; Cost-effectiveness analysis of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in patients with chronic hepatitis C: Treatment of patients with absence or mild fibrosis compared to patients with advanced fibrosis, J Viral Hepat, 2017 Mar 08; ():1352-0504",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in the absence or mild fibrosis (F0-F1) vs. Standard/Usual Care- ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) with advanced fibrosis (F2-F4),treatmentnaïve patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 (GT1),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-2599.57,Euro,2015,-3150.08
17357,Cost-Effectiveness of Remote Cardiac Monitoring With the CardioMEMS Heart Failure System,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States and presents a substantial economic burden. A recently approved implantable wireless pulmonary artery pressure remote monitor, the CardioMEMS HF System, has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalizations among New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III HF patients. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of this remote monitoring technology compared to standard of care treatment for HF. A Markov cohort model relying on the CHAMPION (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Patients) clinical trial for mortality and hospitalization data, published sources for cost data, and a mix of CHAMPION data and published sources for utility data, was developed. The model compares outcomes over 5 years for implanted vs standard of care patients, allowing patients to accrue costs and utilities while they remain alive. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in input parameters. The CardioMEMS HF System was found to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $44,832 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analysis found the model was sensitive to the device cost and to whether mortality benefits were sustained, although there were no scenarios in which the cost/QALY exceeded $100,000.

METHODS: Treatment-naive HBeAg-positive CHB patients with AE who received pegIFN or NA (entecavir (ETV) or telbivudine (LDT)) therapies were retrospectively selected. The HBeAg seroconversion rate, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss rate and the cost-effectiveness of different treatments were compared. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients with pegIFN therapy and 78 with NA (38 with ETV and 40 with LDT) therapy were included. The HBsAg loss rate was significantly higher in the pegIFN group when compared with the NA group (on week 96: 9/63 (14.29%) vs. 1/78 (1.28%), P = 0.005). No significant difference in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA negativity or the HBeAg/HBsAg seroconversion rate was found between ETV and LDT group. One year of pegIFN therapy resulted in 18.56 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, and the incremental cost per additional QALY gained was $3,709.

METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to simulate lifetime costs and benefits of brentuximab vedotin compared with best supportive care for the treatment of patients with hl after failure of asct. Administrative data from Ontario were used to set the model parameters. RESULTS: In the base case, treatment with brentuximab vedotin resulted in incremental quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) of 0.544 and an incremental cost of $89,366 per patient, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of $164,248 per qaly gained. The icer was sensitive to the cost of brentuximab vedotin, the hazard ratio used to assess the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin treatment, and health state utilities. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the available information, brentuximab vedotin has an icer exceeding $100,000 per qaly gained, which is a level often classified as having ""weak evidence for adoption and appropriate utilization"" in Canada. However, it is worth noting that provincial cancer agencies take into account not only the costs and associated icer, but also other factors such as a lack of alternative treatment options and the clinical benefits of expensive cancer drugs.

17363,Cost-effectiveness of adding novel or group 5 interventions to a background regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is complex, lengthy, and involves a minimum of four drugs termed a background regimen (BR), that have not previously been prescribed or that have proven susceptible to patient sputum culture isolates. In recent years, promising new treatment options have emerged as add-on therapies to a BR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term costs and effectiveness of adding the novel or group 5 interventions bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid to a background regimen (BR) of drugs for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), within their marketing authorisations, from a German healthcare cost-effectiveness perspective. METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to simulate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR, delamanid plus BR, or linezolid plus BR versus BR alone in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and Life-Years Gained (LYG), using inputs from clinical trials for bedaquiline and delamanid and from a German observational study for linezolid. Cost data were obtained from German Drug Directory costs (euro/2015), published literature, and expert opinion. A 3% yearly discount rate was applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The total discounted costs per-patient were euro85,575 for bedaquiline plus BR, euro81,079 for delamanid plus BR, and euro80,460 for linezolid plus BR, compared with a cost of euro60,962 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per-patient were 5.95 for bedaquiline plus BR, 5.36 for delamanid plus BR, and 3.91 for linezolid plus BR, compared with 3.68 for BR alone. All interventions were therefore associated with higher QALYs and higher costs than BR alone, with incremental costs per QALY gained of euro22,238 for bedaquiline, euro38,703 for delamanid, and euro87,484 for linezolid, versus BR alone. In a fully incremental analysis, bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment option at thresholds greater than euro22,000 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, the probability that bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000 was 54.5%, compared with 22.9% for BR alone, 18.2% for delamanid plus BR, and 4.4% for linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: In Germany, the addition of bedaquiline, delamanid, or linezolid to a BR would result in QALY gains over BR alone. Based on this analysis, bedaquiline is likely to be the most cost-effective intervention for the treatment of MDR-TB, when added to a BR regimen at thresholds greater than euro22,000 per QALY.",2017-01-23649,28270207,BMC Health Serv Res,Daniel Wirth,2017,17 / 1,182,Yes,28270207,"Daniel Wirth; Ramesh Dass; Robert Hettle; Cost-effectiveness of adding novel or group 5 interventions to a background regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Germany, BMC Health Serv Res, 2017 May 15; 17(1):1472-6963; 182",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Linezolid plus background regimen (BR) of a minimum of four drugs, not previously prescribed, for 18-24 months vs. Standard/Usual Care- background regimen (BR) of a minimum of four drugs, not previously prescribed, for 18-24 months",Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,87484,Euro,2015,106010.48

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term costs and effectiveness of adding the novel or group 5 interventions bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid to a background regimen (BR) of drugs for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), within their marketing authorisations, from a German healthcare cost-effectiveness perspective. METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to simulate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR, delamanid plus BR, or linezolid plus BR versus BR alone in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and Life-Years Gained (LYG), using inputs from clinical trials for bedaquiline and delamanid and from a German observational study for linezolid. Cost data were obtained from German Drug Directory costs (euro/2015), published literature, and expert opinion. A 3% yearly discount rate was applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The total discounted costs per-patient were euro85,575 for bedaquiline plus BR, euro81,079 for delamanid plus BR, and euro80,460 for linezolid plus BR, compared with a cost of euro60,962 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per-patient were 5.95 for bedaquiline plus BR, 5.36 for delamanid plus BR, and 3.91 for linezolid plus BR, compared with 3.68 for BR alone. All interventions were therefore associated with higher QALYs and higher costs than BR alone, with incremental costs per QALY gained of euro22,238 for bedaquiline, euro38,703 for delamanid, and euro87,484 for linezolid, versus BR alone. In a fully incremental analysis, bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment option at thresholds greater than euro22,000 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, the probability that bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000 was 54.5%, compared with 22.9% for BR alone, 18.2% for delamanid plus BR, and 4.4% for linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: In Germany, the addition of bedaquiline, delamanid, or linezolid to a BR would result in QALY gains over BR alone. Based on this analysis, bedaquiline is likely to be the most cost-effective intervention for the treatment of MDR-TB, when added to a BR regimen at thresholds greater than euro22,000 per QALY.",2017-01-23649,28270207,BMC Health Serv Res,Daniel Wirth,2017,17 / 1,182,Yes,28270207,"Daniel Wirth; Ramesh Dass; Robert Hettle; Cost-effectiveness of adding novel or group 5 interventions to a background regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Germany, BMC Health Serv Res, 2017 May 15; 17(1):1472-6963; 182",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Delamanid plus background regimen (BR) of a minimum of four drugs not previously prescribed vs. Standard/Usual Care- Background regimen (BR) of drugs not previously prescribed,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,38703,Euro,2015,46899.13

This study estimates the costs and benefits of acupuncture, braces, heat treatment, insoles, interferential therapy, laser/light therapy, manual therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, pulsed electrical stimulation, pulsed electromagnetic fields, static magnets and transcutaneous electrical nerve Stimulation (TENS), based on all relevant data, to facilitate a more complete assessment of value. METHODS: Data from 88 randomised controlled trials including 7,507 patients were obtained from a systematic review. The studies reported a wide range of outcomes. These were converted into EQ-5D index values using prediction models, and synthesised using network meta-analysis. Analyses were conducted including firstly all trials and secondly only trials with low risk of selection bias. Resource use was estimated from trials, expert opinion and the literature. A decision analytic model synthesised all evidence to assess interventions over a typical treatment period (constant benefit over eight weeks or linear increase in effect over weeks zero to eight and dissipation over weeks eight to 16). RESULTS: When all trials are considered, TENS is cost-effective at thresholds of pound20-30,000 per QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound2,690 per QALY vs. usual care. When trials with a low risk of selection bias are considered, acupuncture is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound13,502 per QALY vs. TENS.

When trials with a low risk of selection bias are considered, acupuncture is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound13,502 per QALY vs. TENS. The results of the analysis were sensitive to varying the intensity, with which interventions were delivered, and the magnitude and duration of intervention effects on EQ-5D.

BACKGROUND: Data on cost-effectiveness of liver resection for advanced breast cancer with liver metastasis are lacking. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of liver resection followed by postoperative conventional systemic therapy (strategy A) versus conventional therapy alone (strategy B) versus newer targeted therapy alone (strategy C).

17382,Cost-effectiveness analysis of once-yearly injection of zoledronic acid for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan,"Model-based economic evaluation was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid. Although zoledronic acid was dominated by alendronate, the incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was quite small in extent. Considering the advantage of once-yearly injection of zoledronic acid in persistence, zoledronic acid might be a cost-effective treatment option compared to once-weekly oral alendronate. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of once-yearly injection of zoledronic acid for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan. METHODS: A patient-level state-transition model was developed to predict the outcome of patients with osteoporosis who have experienced a previous vertebral fracture. The efficacy of zoledronic acid was derived from a published network meta-analysis. Lifetime cost and QALYs were estimated for patients who had received zoledronic acid, alendronate, or basic treatment alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of zoledronic acid was estimated. RESULTS: For patients 70 years of age, zoledronic acid was dominated by alendronate with incremental QALY of -0.004 to -0.000 and incremental cost of 430 USD to 493 USD. Deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that the relative risk of hip fracture and drug cost strongly affected the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid compared to alendronate. Scenario analysis considering treatment persistence showed that the ICER of zoledronic acid compared to alendronate was estimated to be 47,435 USD, 27,018 USD, and 10,749 USD per QALY gained for patients with a T-score of -2.0, -2.5, or -3.0, respectively.

17384,Treatment of Patients Waitlisted for Liver Transplant with an All-Oral DAAs is a Cost-Effective Treatment Strategy in the United States,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: All-oral direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have been shown to have high safety and efficacy in treating patients with Hepatitis C (HCV) awaiting liver transplant (LT). However, there is limited empirical evidence comparing the health and economic outcomes associated with treating patients pre- vs. post-LT. The objective of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of pre- vs. post-LT treatment with an all-oral DAA regimen among HCV patients with HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) or DCC (decompensated cirrhosis). METHODS: We constructed decision-analytic Markov models of the natural disease progression of HCV in HCC patients and DCC patients waitlisted (WL) for LT. The model followed hypothetical cohorts of 1,000 patients with a mean age 50 over a 30 year time horizon from a third-party US payer perspective, and estimated their health and cost outcomes based on pre- vs. post-LT treatment with an all-oral DAA regimen. Transition probabilities and utilities were based on the literature and hepatologist consensus. Sustained viral response (SVR) rates were sourced from ASTRAL-4 and SOLAR-1, -2. Costs were sourced from RedBook, Medicare fee schedules, and published literature. RESULTS: In the HCC analysis, the pre-LT treatment strategy resulted in 11.48 per-patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and $365,948 per patient lifetime costs vs. 10.39 and $283,696 in the post-LT arm. In the DCC analysis, the pre-LT treatment strategy results in 9.27 per-patient QALYs and $304,800 per patient lifetime costs vs. 8.7 and $283,789 in the post-LT arm. As such, the pre-LT treatment strategy was found to be the most cost-effective in both populations with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,255 (HCC) and $36,583 (DCC). Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed results were most sensitive to the utility of patients post-LT, treatment SVR rates, LT costs, and baseline MELD score (DCC analysis only). CONCLUSION: The timing of initiation of antiviral treatment for HCV patients with HCC or DCC relative to LT is an important area of clinical and policy research. Our results indicate that pre-LT treatment with a highly effective, all-oral DAA regimen provides the best health outcomes and is the most cost-effective strategy for the treatment of HCV patients with HCC or DCC waitlisted for LT.

In the DCC analysis, the pre-LT treatment strategy results in 9.27 per-patient QALYs and $304,800 per patient lifetime costs vs. 8.7 and $283,789 in the post-LT arm. As such, the pre-LT treatment strategy was found to be the most cost-effective in both populations with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,255 (HCC) and $36,583 (DCC). Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed results were most sensitive to the utility of patients post-LT, treatment SVR rates, LT costs, and baseline MELD score (DCC analysis only). CONCLUSION: The timing of initiation of antiviral treatment for HCV patients with HCC or DCC relative to LT is an important area of clinical and policy research. Our results indicate that pre-LT treatment with a highly effective, all-oral DAA regimen provides the best health outcomes and is the most cost-effective strategy for the treatment of HCV patients with HCC or DCC waitlisted for LT.

17386,Economic Value and Cost-Effectiveness of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Among Patients With Mild Heart Failure: Projections From the REVERSE Long-Term Follow-Up,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the cost effectiveness of early cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation among patients with mild heart failure (HF). The differential cost effectiveness between CRT using a defibrillator (CRT-Ds) and CRT using a pacemaker (CRT-P) was also assessed. BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization has been shown to be cost effective in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III/IV but is less studied in class II HF. The incremental costs of early CRT implementation in mild HF compared with the costs potentially avoided because of delaying disease progression to advanced HF are also unknown. Finally, combined biventricular pacing and defibrillator (CRT-D) devices are more expensive than biventricular pacemakers (CRT-P), but the relative cost effectiveness is controversial. METHODS: Data from the 5-year follow-up phase of REVERSE (REsynchronization reVErses Remodeling in Systolic Left vEntricular Dysfunction) were used. The economics were evaluated from the U.S. Medicare perspective based on published clinical projections. RESULTS: Probabilistic estimates yielded $8,840/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (95% confidence interval [CI]: $6,705 to $10,804/QALY gained) for CRT-ON versus CRT-OFF (i.e., programmed ""ON"" or ""OFF"" at pre-specified post-implantation timings) and $43,678/QALY gained for CRT-D versus CRT-P (95% CI: $35,164 to $53,589/QALY gained) over the patient''s lifetime. Results were robust to choice of patient subgroup and alterations of +/-10% to key model parameters. An ""early"" CRT-D class II strategy totaled $95,292 compared with $91,511 for a ""late"" implantation. An ""early"" implant offered on average 1.00 year of additional survival for $3,781, resulting in an ICER of $3,795/LY gained. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates CRT cost effectiveness in mild HF. The incremental CRT-D costs are justified by the anticipated benefits, despite increased procurement costs and shorter generator longevities.

17388,Cost-effectiveness analysis of shunt surgery for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus based on the SINPHONI and SINPHONI-2 trials,"BACKGROUND: We showed that ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt surgeries are beneficial for patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) in the Study of Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus on Neurological Improvement (SINPHONI; a multicenter prospective cohort study) and in SINPHONI-2 (a multicenter randomized trial). Although therapeutic efficacy is important, cost-effectiveness analysis is equally valuable. METHODS: Using both a set of assumptions and using the data from SINPHONI and SINPHONI-2, we estimated the total cost of treatment for iNPH, which consists of medical expenses (e.g., operation fees) and costs to the long-term care insurance system (LCIS) in Japan. Regarding the natural course of iNPH patients, 10% or 20% of patients on each modified Rankin Scale (mRS) show aggravation (aggravation rate: 10% or 20%) every 3 months if the patients do not undergo shunt surgery, as described in a previous report. We performed cost-effectiveness analyses for the various scenarios, calculating the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and the incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER). Then, based on the definition provided by a previous report, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of shunt surgery for iNPH. RESULTS: In the first year after shunt surgery, the ICER of VP shunt varies from 29,934 to 40,742 USD (aggravation rate 10% and 20%, respectively) and the ICER of LP shunt varies from 58,346 to 80,392 USD (aggravation rate 10% and 20%, respectively), which indicates that the shunt surgery for iNPH is a cost-effective treatment. In the 2nd postoperative year, the cost to the LCIS will continue to decrease because of the lasting improvement of the symptoms due to the surgery. The total cost for iNPH patients will show a positive return on investment in as soon as 18 months (VP) and 21 months (LP), indicating that shunt surgery for iNPH is a cost-effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because the total cost for iNPH patients will show a positive return on investment within 2 years, shunt surgery for iNPH is a cost-effective treatment and therefore recommended.

17392,"Multi-arm Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) comparing different durations of adjuvant trastuzumab in early breast cancer, from the English NHS payer perspective","BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab improves survival in HER2+ breast cancer patients, with some evidence of adverse cardiac side effects. Current recommendations are to give adjuvant trastuzumab for one year or until recurrence, although trastuzumab treatment for only 9 or 10 weeks has shown similar survival rates to 12-month treatment. We present here a multi-arm joint analysis examining the relative cost-effectiveness of different durations of adjuvant trastuzumab. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to examine which trials'' data to include in the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). A network using FinHer (9 weeks vs. zero) and BCIRG006 (12 months vs. zero) trials offered the only jointly randomisable network so these trials were used in the CEA. The 3-arm CEA compared costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with zero, 9-week and 12-month adjuvant trastuzumab durations in early breast cancer, using a decision tree followed by a Markov model that extrapolated the results to a lifetime time horizon. Pairwise incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated for each pair of regimens and used in budget impact analysis, and the Bucher method was used to check face validity of the findings. Addition of the PHARE trial (6 months vs. 12 months) to the network, in order to create a 4-arm CEA including the 6-month regimen, was not possible as late randomisation in this trial resulted in recruitment of a different patient population as evidenced by the NMA findings. The CEA results suggest that 9 weeks'' trastuzumab is cost-saving and leads to more QALYs than 12 months'', i.e. the former dominates the latter. The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) favours zero trastuzumab at willingness-to-pay levels below pound2,500/QALY and treatment for 9 weeks above this threshold. The combination of the NMA and Bucher investigations suggests that the 9-week duration is as efficacious as the 12-month duration for distant-disease-free survival and overall survival, and safer in terms of fewer adverse cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS: Our CEA results suggest that 9-week trastuzumab dominates 12-month trastuzumab in cost-effectiveness terms at conventional thresholds of willingness to pay for a QALY, and the 9-week regimen is also suggested to be as clinically effective as the 12-month regimen according to the NMA and Bucher analyses. This finding agrees with the results of the E2198 head-to-head study that compared 10 weeks'' with 14 months'' trastuzumab and found no significant difference.

Pairwise incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated for each pair of regimens and used in budget impact analysis, and the Bucher method was used to check face validity of the findings. Addition of the PHARE trial (6 months vs. 12 months) to the network, in order to create a 4-arm CEA including the 6-month regimen, was not possible as late randomisation in this trial resulted in recruitment of a different patient population as evidenced by the NMA findings. The CEA results suggest that 9 weeks'' trastuzumab is cost-saving and leads to more QALYs than 12 months'', i.e. the former dominates the latter. The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) favours zero trastuzumab at willingness-to-pay levels below pound2,500/QALY and treatment for 9 weeks above this threshold. The combination of the NMA and Bucher investigations suggests that the 9-week duration is as efficacious as the 12-month duration for distant-disease-free survival and overall survival, and safer in terms of fewer adverse cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS: Our CEA results suggest that 9-week trastuzumab dominates 12-month trastuzumab in cost-effectiveness terms at conventional thresholds of willingness to pay for a QALY, and the 9-week regimen is also suggested to be as clinically effective as the 12-month regimen according to the NMA and Bucher analyses. This finding agrees with the results of the E2198 head-to-head study that compared 10 weeks'' with 14 months'' trastuzumab and found no significant difference. Appropriate trial design and reporting is critical if results are to be synthesisable with existing evidence, as selection bias can lead to recruitment of a different patient population from existing trials. Our analysis was not based on head-to-head trials'' data, so the results should be viewed with caution. Short-duration trials would benefit from recruiting larger numbers of participants to reduce uncertainty in the synthesised results.",2017-01-23688,28248984,PLoS One,Caroline S Clarke,2017,12 / 3,e0172731,No,28248984,"Caroline S Clarke; Rachael M Hunter; Ian Shemilt; Victoria Serra-Sastre; Multi-arm Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) comparing different durations of adjuvant trastuzumab in early breast cancer, from the English NHS payer perspective, PLoS One , 2017; 12(3):1932-6203; e0172731",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Trastuzumab treatment for 12 weeks vs. Standard/Usual Care- Not stated,HER2/neu positive breast cancer,Not Stated,52 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,43845,United Kingdom,2014,79015.15
17395,Cost Effectiveness of Genotype-Guided Warfarin Dosing in Patients with Mechanical Heart Valve Replacement Under the Fee-for-Service System,"BACKGROUND: Although studies assessing the cost effectiveness of genotype-guided warfarin dosing for the management of atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism have been reported, no publications have addressed genotype-guided warfarin therapy in mechanical heart valve replacement (MHVR) patients or genotype-guided warfarin therapy under the fee-for-service (FFS) insurance system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of genotype-guided warfarin dosing in patients with MHVR under the FFS system from the Korea healthcare sector perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of genotype-guided warfarin dosing compared with standard dosing. Estimates of clinical adverse event rates and health state utilities were derived from the published literature. The outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the range of plausible results. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, genotype-guided warfarin dosing was associated with marginally higher QALYs than standard warfarin dosing (6.088 vs. 6.083, respectively), at a slightly higher cost (US$6.8) (year 2016 values). The ICER was US$1356.2 per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was an 82.7% probability that genotype-guided dosing was dominant compared with standard dosing, and a 99.8% probability that it was cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$50,000 per QALY gained.

17396,Real-world and trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of bevacizumab in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients: a study of the Southeast Netherlands Breast Cancer Consortium,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of our analysis was to assess the real-world cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in addition to taxane treatment versus taxane monotherapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer compared with the cost-effectiveness based on the efficacy results from a trial. METHODS: A state transition model was built to estimate costs, life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both treatments. Two scenarios were examined: a real-world scenario and a trial-based scenario in which transition probabilities were primarily based on a real-world cohort study and the E2100 trial, respectively. In both scenarios, costs and utility parameter estimates were extracted from the real-world cohort study. Moreover, the Dutch health care perspective was adopted. RESULTS: In both the real-world and trial scenarios, bevacizumab-taxane is more expensive (incremental costs of euro56,213 and euro52,750, respectively) and more effective (incremental QALYs of 0.362 and 0.189, respectively) than taxane monotherapy. In the real-world scenario, bevacizumab-taxane compared to taxane monotherapy led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro155,261 per QALY gained. In the trial scenario, the ICER amounted to euro278,711 per QALY gained.

17398,Cost-effectiveness of SQ(R) HDM SLIT-tablet in addition to pharmacotherapy for the treatment of house dust mite allergic rhinitis in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is a global health problem that burdens society due to associated health care costs and its impact on health. Standardized quality (SQ(R)) house dust mite (HDM) sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablet is a sublingually administered allergy immunotherapy tablet for patients with persistent moderate to severe HDM allergic rhinitis despite use of allergy pharmacotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of SQ HDM SLIT-tablet in Germany for patients suffering from HDM allergic rhinitis. METHODS: A pharmacoeconomic analysis, based on data collected in a double-blinded, phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial (n=992), was undertaken to compare SQ HDM SLIT-tablet in addition to allergy pharmacotherapy to placebo plus allergy pharmacotherapy. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scores and health care resource use data recorded in the trial were applied to each treatment group and extrapolated over a nine-year time horizon. A series of scenarios were used to investigate the impact of changes on long-term patient health for both treatment groups, which was measured by annual changes in QALY scores. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, compared with allergy pharmacotherapy, SQ HDM SLIT-tablet led to a QALY gain of 0.31 at an incremental cost of euro2,276 over the nine-year time horizon, equating to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro7,519. The treatment was cost-effective for all scenarios analyzed; however, results were sensitive to changes in individual parameter values during the deterministic sensitivity analysis.

17399,Cost-Effectiveness of Screening Patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease for Barrett's Esophagus With a Minimally Invasive Cell Sampling Device,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is important to identify patients with Barrett''s esophagus (BE), the precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Patients with BE are usually identified by endoscopy, which is expensive. The cytosponge, which collects tissue from the esophagus non-invasively, could be a cost-effective tool for screening individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), who are at increased risk for BE. We developed a model to analyze the cost effectiveness of using cytosponge in first-line screening of patients with GERD for BE with endoscopic confirmation, compared to endoscopy screening only, METHODS: We incorporated data from a large clinical trial of cytosponge performance into 2 validated microsimulation models of EAC progression (the esophageal adenocarcinoma model from the Massachusetts General Hospital and the microsimulation screening analysis model from Erasmus University Medical Center). The models had been calibrated for United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results data on EAC incidence and mortality. In each model, we simulated the effect of a 1-time screen for BE in male patients with GERD, 60 years of age, using endoscopy alone or cytosponge collection of tissue and analysis for level of trefoil factor 3 with endoscopic confirmation of positive results. For each strategy we recorded the number of cases of EAC that developed, the number of EAC cases detected screening by cytosponge only or by subsequent targeted surveillance, and the number of endoscopies needed. Additionally, we recorded the cumulative costs (including indirect costs) incurred and quality-adjusted years of life lived within each strategy, discounted at a rate of 3% per year, and computed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) among the 3 strategies. RESULTS: According to the models, screening patients with GERD by cytosponge with follow-up confirmation of positive results by endoscopy would reduce the cost of screening by 38%-41%, compared to screening by endoscopy, but led to 1.8 to 4.0 (per 1000 patients) fewer quality-adjusted life years. The ICERs for cytosponge screening compared to no screening ranged from $28,791 to $33,307. For screening patients by endoscopy compared to cytosponge, the ICERs ranged from $143,041 to $330,361. These results were sensitive to cytosponge cost within a plausible range of values. CONCLUSION: In a comparative modeling analysis of screening strategies for BE in patients with GERD, we found cytosponge screening with endoscopic confirmation to be a cost-effective strategy.
