32701,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Therapy Compared With Surgery and Radiofrequency Ablation in Two Patient Cohorts: Metastatic Liver Cancer and Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SABR) with radiofrequency ablation and surgery in adult patients with metastatic liver cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two patient cohorts were assessed: liver oligometastases and HCC. For each patient cohort, a decision analytic model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions over a 5-year horizon. A Markov process was embedded in the decision model to simulate the possible prognosis of cancer. Data on transition probabilities, survival, side-effects, quality of life and costs were obtained from published sources and the SABR Commissioning through Evaluation (CtE) scheme. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with respect to quality-adjusted life-years. The robustness of the results was examined in a sensitivity analysis. Analyses were conducted from a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, which assumed that all three interventions were associated with the same cancer progression rates and mortality rates, SABR was the most cost-effective intervention for both patient cohorts. This conclusion was sensitive to the cancer progression rate, mortality rate and cost of interventions. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the probability that SABR is cost-effective was 57% and 50% in liver oligometastases and HCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a potential for SABR to be cost-effective for patients with liver oligometastases and HCC.

32712,ACL reconstruction for all is not cost-effective after acute ACL rupture,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost-utility analysis for two commonly used treatment strategies for patients after ACL rupture; early ACL reconstruction (index) versus rehabilitation plus an optional reconstruction in case of persistent instability (comparator). METHODS: Patients aged between 18 and 65 years of age with a recent ACL rupture (<2 months) were randomised between either an early ACL reconstruction (index) or a rehabilitation plus an optional reconstruction in case of persistent instability (comparator) after 3 months of rehabilitation. A cost-utility analysis was performed to compare both treatments over a 2-year follow-up. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, using two perspectives: the healthcare system perspective and societal perspective. The uncertainty for costs and health effects was assessed by means of non-parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were included in the study, of which 85 were randomised to the early ACL reconstruction (index) group and 82 to the rehabilitation and optional reconstruction group (comparator). From the healthcare perspective it takes 48 460 € and from a societal perspective 78 179 €, to gain a QALY when performing early surgery compared with rehabilitation plus an optional reconstruction.

32714,The Cost-Effectiveness of Lenvatinib in the Treatment of Advanced or Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma from a Canadian Perspective,"Lenvatinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor indicated for the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). In the Phase III REFLECT trial, lenvatinib was noninferior in the primary endpoint of overall survival versus sorafenib, the only systemic therapy funded in Canada prior to the introduction of lenvatinib. Lenvatinib also demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to sorafenib in secondary endpoint progression-free survival, time to progression, and objective response rate. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib versus sorafenib for the first-line treatment of patients with uHCC from a Canadian perspective. A cost-utility analysis was conducted using partitioned survival modelling, with health states representing progression-free disease, progressed disease, and death. Health effects were measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were represented in Canadian dollars. Clinical inputs were derived from the REFLECT trial, with outcomes extrapolated using parametric survival models. EQ-5D data collected in REFLECT were used to determine health state utility values, and estimates of resource use came from a survey of clinicians. The model predicted incremental costs of-$5,021 and incremental QALYs of 0.17, making lenvatinib dominant over sorafenib. The model demonstrates lenvatinib to be a cost-effective use of resources versus sorafenib in Canada for the treatment of uHCC. Overall costs are lower compared with sorafenib, while health benefits are greater, with modelled progression-free and overall survival extended by 4.1 and 2.6 months in the lenvatinib arm, respectively.",2021-01-34358,33681090,Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Brandon M Meyers,2021,2021 /,8811018,No,33681090,"Brandon M Meyers; Arndt Vogel; Paul Marotta; Petr Kavan; Laveena Kamboj; Janice Pan; Marc Geadah; David Trueman; Suthakar Sabapathy; The Cost-Effectiveness of Lenvatinib in the Treatment of Advanced or Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma from a Canadian Perspective, Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2021; 2021():2291-2797; 8811018",QALY,Canada,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Pharmaceutical,lenvatinib vs. sorafenib,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,10 Years,1.50,1.50,-29535.29,Canada,2019,-23590.9
32715,Comparison of Drug-Eluting Embolics versus Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization for the Treatment of Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of using doxorubicin-loaded drug-eluting embolic (DEE) transarterial chemoembolization versus that of using conventional transarterial chemoembolization for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analysis model was constructed over the lifespan of a payer''s perspective. The model simulated the clinical course, including periprocedural complications, additional transarterial chemoembolization or other treatments (ablation, radioembolization, or systemic treatment), palliative care, and death, of patients with unresectable HCC. All clinical parameters were derived from the literature. Base case calculations, probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and multiple two-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case calculations for patients with a median age of 67 years (range for conventional transarterial chemoembolization: 28-88 years, range for DEE-transarterial chemoembolization: 16-93 years), conventional transarterial chemoembolization yielded a health benefit of 2.11 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at a cost of $125,324, whereas DEE-transarterial chemoembolization yielded 1.71 QALY for $144,816. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, conventional transarterial chemoembolization continued to be a more cost-effective strategy. conventional transarterial chemoembolization was cost-effective when the complication risks for both the procedures were simultaneously varied from 0% to 30%. DEE-transarterial chemoembolization became cost-effective if the conventional transarterial chemoembolization mortality exceeded that of DEE-transarterial chemoembolization by 17% in absolute values. The two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that conventional transarterial chemoembolization was cost-effective until the risk of disease progression was >0.4% of that for DEE-transarterial chemoembolization in absolute values. Our analysis showed that DEE-transarterial chemoembolization would be more cost-effective if it offered >2.5% higher overall survival benefit than conventional transarterial chemoembolization in absolute values. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with DEE-transarterial chemoembolization, conventional transarterial chemoembolization yielded a higher number of QALY at a lower cost, making it the more cost-effective of the 2 modalities.",2021-01-34359,33160827,J Vasc Interv Radiol,Xiao Wu,2021,32 / 1,2-12.e1,No,33160827,"Xiao Wu; Julius Chapiro; Ajay Malhotra; Nishita Kothary; Comparison of Drug-Eluting Embolics versus Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization for the Treatment of Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, J Vasc Interv Radiol, 2021 Jan; 32(1):1051-0443; 2-12.e1",QALY,United States of America,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",doxorubicin-loaded drug-eluting embolic transarterial chemoembolization vs. conventional transarterial chemoembolization,Not Stated,93 Years,16 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-48730,United States,2019,-51648.76
32716,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for operable non-small cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) over open thoracotomy (OT) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the perspective of Chinese healthcare payer. METHODS: The Markov decision model was developed to assess the 5-year costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of RATS versus OT and VATS for operable NSCLC patients. The propensity-matched cohorts were generated from our clinical center to determine the surgical costs and complication rates. An individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted to estimate model probabilities of progression and survival risks. Other model inputs were abstracted from available studies. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: RATS contributed to an incremental 0.28 QALYs at an additional cost of $3,104.82, making for an ICER of $10,967.41 per QALY versus OT. Robotic approach harvested an incremental 0.05 QALYs at an additional cost of $4006.86, making for an ICER of $80324.98 per QALY over VATS. RATS shown a same cost-effectiveness probability (0.50) versus OT and VATS at a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $12,000 per QALY and $75,800 per QALY, respectively.

METHODS: The Markov decision model was developed to assess the 5-year costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of RATS versus OT and VATS for operable NSCLC patients. The propensity-matched cohorts were generated from our clinical center to determine the surgical costs and complication rates. An individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted to estimate model probabilities of progression and survival risks. Other model inputs were abstracted from available studies. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: RATS contributed to an incremental 0.28 QALYs at an additional cost of $3,104.82, making for an ICER of $10,967.41 per QALY versus OT. Robotic approach harvested an incremental 0.05 QALYs at an additional cost of $4006.86, making for an ICER of $80324.98 per QALY over VATS. RATS shown a same cost-effectiveness probability (0.50) versus OT and VATS at a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $12,000 per QALY and $75,800 per QALY, respectively. The probabilities of cost-effectiveness for RATS were 0.64 and 0.21 at a presupposed WTP threshold of $ 30,000 per QALY versus OT and VATS, respectively.

32718,Is SABR Cost-Effective in Oligometastatic Cancer? An Economic Analysis of the SABR-COMET Randomized Trial,"PURPOSE: The phase 2 randomized study SABR-COMET demonstrated that in patients with controlled primary tumors and 1 to 5 oligometastatic lesions, SABR was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with standard of care (SoC), but with higher costs and treatment-related toxicities. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SABR versus SoC in this setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to perform a cost-utility analysis from the Canadian health care system perspective. Utility values and transition probabilities were derived from individual-level data from the SABR-COMET trial. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Costs were expressed in 2018 CAD. A separate analysis based on US payer''s perspective was performed. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, SABR was cost-effective at an ICER of $37,157 per QALY gained. This finding was most sensitive to the number of metastatic lesions treated with SABR (ICER: $28,066 per QALY for 2, increasing to $64,429 per QALY for 5), difference in chemotherapy use (ICER: $27,173-$53,738 per QALY), and PFS hazard ratio (HR) between strategies (ICER: $31,548-$53,273 per QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that SABR was cost-effective in 97% of all iterations. Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between the number of lesions and the PFS HR. To maintain cost-effectiveness for each additional metastasis, the HR must decrease by approximately 0.047. The US cost analysis yielded similar results, with an ICER of $54,564 (2018 USD per QALY) for SABR. CONCLUSIONS: SABR is cost-effective for patients with 1 to 5 oligometastatic lesions compared with SoC.",2021-01-34362,33309977,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,X Melody Qu,2021,109 / 5,1176-1184,No,33309977,"X Melody Qu; Yujie Chen; Gregory S Zaric; Suresh Senan; Robert A Olson; Stephen Harrow; Ava John-Baptiste; Stewart Gaede; Liam A Mulroy; Devin Schellenberg; Sashendra Senthi; Anand Swaminath; Neil Kopek; Mitchell Liu; Andrew Warner; George B Rodrigues; David A Palma; Alexander V Louie; Is SABR Cost-Effective in Oligometastatic Cancer?

32721,Economic analysis for national immunization program planning: A case of rotavirus vaccines in Burundi,"BACKGROUND: In Burundi, diarrhea is the third leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age. This study conducted an economic analysis of rotavirus vaccination program in Burundi. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate clinical and economic outcomes for the 2019 birth cohort for a period of 5 years. Empirical costing data were collected. ICER per episode averted, ICER per death averted, ICER per DALY averted, net present value, and budget impact were estimated for 4 brands of WHO pre-qualified rotavirus vaccines. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis as well as threshold analysis were performed. RESULTS: For the base case, while all four WHO pre-qualified rotavirus vaccines were cost-effective (ICER < 3 GDP per capita), three of them (i.e. Rotarix, Rotavac and Rotasiil) were very cost-effective (ICER <1 GDP per capita) from both the provider and societal perspectives. The vaccines were still very cost-effective at a price increase of up to US$ 5.09, US$ 3.16, US$ 3.89, and US$ 2.69 for Rotarix, RotaTeq, Rotavac, and Rotasiil, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that vaccination programs with Rotarix, RotaTeq, Rotavac, and Rotasiil are cost-effective at a probability of 93.8%, 27%, 99.1%, and 92.7%, respectively. All vaccination programs were cost-beneficial with a net present value in the range of US$ 5,214,912 and US$ 11,135,997.The budget required to run the vaccination program, estimated with break-even prices, ranged between US$ 42,249,498 and US$ 53,487,935 for a 5-year time period.

32729,Patient Healthcare Trajectory and its Impact on the Cost-Effectiveness of Fracture Liaison Services,"This study aimed to assess the cost-utility of a Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) with a systematic follow-up according to patients'' follow-up compliance trajectories. The Lucky Bone™ FLS is a prospective cohort study conducted on women and men (=40?years) with fragility fractures. Dedicated personnel of the program identified fractures, investigated, treated, and followed patients systematically over 2?years. Groups of follow-up compliance trajectories were identified, and Markov decision models were used to assess the cost-utility of each follow-up trajectory group compared to usual care. A lifetime horizon from the perspective of the healthcare payer was modeled. Costs were converted to 2018 Canadian dollars and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were measured. Costs and benefits were discounted at 1.5%. A total of 532 participants were followed in the FLS (86% women, mean age of 63?years). Three trajectories were predicted and interpreted; the high followers (HFs, 48.4%), intermediate followers (IFs, 28.1%), and low followers (LFs, 23.5%). The costs of the interventions per patient varied between $300 and $446 for 2?years, according to the follow-up trajectory. The FLS had higher investigation, treatment, and persistence rates compared to usual care. Compared to usual care, the ICURs for the HF, IF, and LF trajectory groups were $4250, $21,900, and $72,800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, respectively ($9000 per QALY gained for the overall FLS). Sensitivity analyses showed that the HF and IF trajectory groups, as well as the entire FLS, were cost-effective in >67% of simulations with respect to usual care.

32733,Cost-effectiveness of duloxetine for knee OA subjects: the role of pain severity,"OBJECTIVE: Establish the impact of pain severity on the cost-effectiveness of generic duloxetine for knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the United States. DESIGN: We used a validated computer simulation of knee OA to compare usual care (UC) - intra-articular injections, opioids, and total knee replacement (TKR) - to UC preceded by duloxetine in those no longer achieving pain relief from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We considered cohorts with mean ages 57-75 years and Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain 25-55 (0-100, 100-worst). We derived inputs from published data. We discounted costs and benefits 3% annually. We conducted sensitivity analyses of duloxetine efficacy, duration of pain relief, toxicity, and costs. RESULTS: Among younger subjects with severe pain (WOMAC pain = 55), duloxetine led to an additional 9.6 QALYs per 1,000 subjects (ICER = $88,500/QALY). The likelihood of duloxetine being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY was 40% and 54%. Offering duloxetine to older patients with severe pain led to ICERs >$150,000/QALY. Offering duloxetine to subjects with moderate pain (pain = 25) led to ICERs <$50,000/QALY, regardless of age. Among knee OA subjects with severe pain (pain = 55) who are unwilling or unable to undergo TKR, ICERs were <$50,600/QALY, regardless of age. CONCLUSIONS: Duloxetine is a cost-effective addition to knee OA UC for subjects with moderate pain or those with severe pain unable or unwilling to undergo TKR.

32734,Cost-effectiveness of MR-mammography vs. conventional mammography in screening patients at intermediate risk of breast cancer - A model-based economic evaluation,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of screening patients of intermediate risk of breast cancer with MR-Mammography (MRM) versus conventional mammography (XM). METHOD: A decision model for both diagnostic modalities and a subsequent markov model for the simulation of follow-up costs and outcomes was developed. Input parameters were acquired from published literature for this markov modelling study. The expected cumulative costs and outcomes were calculated for both modalities in a 30-year timeframe in US-dollar ($) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A deterministic sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis incorporating 30,000 Monte Carlo iterations were performed to investigate the model stability. RESULTS: In total, XM with its consecutive treatments resulted in total costs of $ 5,492.68 and an average cumulative quality of life of 18.87 QALYs, compared to MRM with costs of $ 5,878.66 and 18.92 QALYs. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for MRM was $ 8,797.60 per QALY - distinctly below international willingness-to-pay thresholds for cost-effectiveness. The results were confirmed within the limits of the sensitivity analyses.

We compared the benefits and costs of different smoking cessation interventions to help screening programs select specific cessation approaches. METHODS: We conducted a societal-perspective cost-effectiveness analysis using a Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) model simulating individuals born in 1960 over their lifetimes. Model inputs were derived from Medicare, national cancer registries, published studies, and micro-costing of cessation interventions. We modeled annual lung cancer screening following 2014?US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines +/- cessation interventions offered to current smokers at first screen, including pharmacotherapy only or pharmacotherapy with electronic/web-based, telephone, individual, or group counseling. Outcomes included lung cancer cases and deaths, life-years saved (LYS), quality-adjusted life-years saved (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Compared to screening alone, all cessation interventions decreased cases of and deaths from lung cancer. Compared incrementally, efficient cessation strategies included pharmacotherapy with either web-based cessation ($555 per QALY), telephone counseling ($7,562 per QALY), or individual counseling ($35,531 per QALY).

32743,Cost-Effectiveness and Value of Information of Cabozantinib Treatment for Patients with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma After Failure of Prior Therapy in South Korea,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and value of information of cabozantinib compared to nivolumab in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, who previously failed treatment from a societal perspective in South Korea. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was used to evaluate the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of cabozantinib versus nivolumab. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) curves were obtained from a network meta-analysis that included METEOR and CheckMate 025 trial results. Utility values for health states and adverse events were estimated based on the EQ-5D-5L data of METEOR trial with a Korean-specific tariff. Costs were estimated by a micro-costing approach using healthcare claims data and expert consultation. The impact of uncertainties in the model were explored by scenario analyses, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was estimated to assess the value of future research to decrease decision uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared to nivolumab, cabozantinib was associated with improved OS, PFS, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at greater cost. The ICUR was $34,445 per QALY. In sensitivity analysis, drug costs had the greatest influence on the ICUR. Cabozantinib had a 68.0% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of 2 times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The population EVPI was $82.6 million at 2 GDP threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib was found to be cost-effective for advanced RCC patients after failure of prior therapy at a 2 GDP threshold.

32744,First-Line Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab versus Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The IMbrave 150 trial revealed that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezo-bev) improves survival in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1 year survival rate: 67.2% vs. 54.6%). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of atezo-bev vs. sorafenib as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable HCC from the US payer perspective. METHODS: Using data from the IMbrave 150, we developed a Markov model to compare the lifetime cost and efficacy of atezo-bev as first-line systemic therapy in HCC with those of sorafenib. The main outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Atezo-bev demonstrated a gain of 0.44 QALYs, with an additional cost of USD 79,074. The ICER of atezo-bev was USD 179,729 per QALY when compared with sorafenib. The model was most sensitive to the overall survival hazard ratio and body weight. If we assumed that all patients at the end of the IMbrave 150 trial were cured of HCC, atezo-bev was cost-effective (ICER USD 53,854 per QALY). However, if all patients followed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, the ICER of atezo-bev was USD 385,857 per QALY. Reducing the price of atezo-bev by 20% and 29% would satisfy the USD 150,000/QALY and 100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. Moreover, capping the duration of therapy to =12 months or reducing the dosage of bev to =10 mg/kg would render atezo-bev cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term effectiveness of atezo-bev is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost-effectiveness. Price reduction would favorably influence cost-effectiveness, even if long-term clinical outcomes were modest.

32748,"Maximizing maternal health and value for money in postpartum depression screening: a cost-effectiveness analysis using the All Our Families cohort and administrative data in Alberta, Canada","BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 10-15% of women, is costly and debilitating, yet often remains undiagnosed. Within Alberta, Canada, screening is conducted at public health well child clinics using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. If screened high-risk, women are offered referral to their family physicians for follow up diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We developed a decision tree to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PPD screening versus not screening in Alberta over a two-year time horizon using a public healthcare payer perspective. Both the current practice (51% attending referral) and a scenario analysis (100% attending referral) are presented. RESULTS: Current practice results suggest screening leads to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $17,644 USD per quality adjusted life year (QALY). At a population-level, this resulted in an annual 813 (11%) additional cases diagnosed, 120 additional QALYs gained, and an additional cost of $2.1 million relative to not screening. With 100% attending referral, the ICER fell to $13,908 per QALY, resulting in an annual 1997 (27%) additional cases diagnosed, 249 additional QALYs gained, and an additional cost of $3.5 million relative to not screening. LIMITATIONS: We were unable to explore the cost-effectiveness of PPD screening versus not screening for secondary populations, including children. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest screening may be most valuable when participation and compliance are maximized, where all women screened high-risk attend referral. This leads to greater value for money and increased maternal health gains across the population.

32749,Cost-effectiveness of azacitidine and venetoclax in unfit patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia,"The phase 3 VIALE-A trial reported that venetoclax in combination with azacitidine significantly improved response rates and overall survival compared with azacitidine alone in older, unfit patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the cost-effectiveness of azacitidine-venetoclax in this clinical setting is unknown. In this study, we constructed a partitioned survival model to compare the cost and effectiveness of azacitidine-venetoclax with azacitidine alone in previously untreated AML. Event-free and overall survival curves for each treatment strategy were derived from the VIALE-A trial using parametric survival modeling. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of azacitidine-venetoclax from a US-payer perspective. Azacitidine-venetoclax was associated with an improvement of 0.61 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with azacitidine alone. However, the combination led to significantly higher lifetime health care costs (incremental cost, $159?595), resulting in an ICER of $260?343 per QALY gained. The price of venetoclax would need to decrease by 60% for azacitidine-venetoclax to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150?000 per QALY. These data suggest that use of azacitidine-venetoclax for previously untreated AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy is unlikely to be cost-effective under current pricing.

32798,Cost-Effectiveness of Mechanical Thrombectomy for Treatment of Nonminor Ischemic Stroke Across Europe,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been recommended for the treatment of nonminor ischemic stroke by national and international guidelines, but cost-effectiveness evidence has been generated for only a few countries using heterogeneous evaluation methods. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT across 32 European countries. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT compared with standard care over a 5-year time horizon. Patients with ischemic stroke eligible for MT were identified from 2017 country-specific incidence data. A societal perspective was adopted, including health, social, and informal care costs, and productivity losses. Model outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings. RESULTS: We identified 267 514 ischemic stroke cases that were eligible for MT treatment across 32 European countries. MT was found to be more effective and cheaper than standard care in two-thirds of the countries (21/32) and cost-effective in all but one country (Bulgaria). Across Europe, the intervention was estimated to produce over 101 327 additional quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval, 65 180-149 085) and cost savings of $981 million (€868 million, 95% uncertainty interval, -1544 to 2564) and of $1.7 billion (€1.5 billion, 95% uncertainty interval, -1.2 to 3.6) in health and social care and societal costs, respectively.
