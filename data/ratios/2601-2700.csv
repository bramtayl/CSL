2601,Cost utility of prenatal diagnosis and the risk-based threshold,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal testing guidelines recommend offering amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling to women aged 35 years or older, or who have been found by screening to be at a similarly high risk of giving birth to an infant with Down""s syndrome or another chromosomal abnormality. This threshold was chosen, in part, because 35 was the approximate age at which amniocentesis was cost beneficial when testing guidelines were developed in the USA in the 1970s. We aimed to assess the economic validity of thresholds based on age or risk for offering invasive prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: We did a cost-utility analysis of chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis versus no invasive testing using data from randomised trials, case registries, and a utility assessment of 534 diverse pregnant women aged 16-47 years. FINDINGS: In the USA, compared with no diagnostic testing, amniocentesis costs less than US15000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained for women of all ages and risk levels. The results do not depend on maternal age or risk of Down""s syndrome-affected birth. The cost-utility ratio for any individual woman depends on her preferences for reassurance about the chromosomal status of her fetus, and, to a lesser extent, for miscarriage. INTERPRETATION: Prenatal diagnostic testing can be cost effective at any age or risk level. Current guidelines should be changed to offer testing to all pregnant women, not just those whose risk of carrying an affected fetus exceeds a specified threshold.",2004-01-00450,14751700,Lancet,Ryan A Harris,2004,363 / 9405,276-82,No,14751700,"Ryan A Harris; A Eugene Washington; Robert F Nease; Miriam Kuppermann; A Eugene Washington; Robert F Nease; Miriam Kuppermann; Cost utility of prenatal diagnosis and the risk-based threshold, Lancet, 2004-Jan-24; 363(9405):0140-6736; 276-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Amniocentesis vs. No testing,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,12600,United States,2003,17722.93

2603,Randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation of a chest pain observation unit compared with routine care,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of providing care in a chest pain observation unit compared with routine care for patients with acute, undifferentiated chest pain. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial, with 442 days randomised to the chest pain observation unit or routine care, and cost effectiveness analysis from a health service costing perspective. SETTING: The emergency department at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 972 patients with acute, undifferentiated chest pain (479 attending on days when care was delivered in the chest pain observation unit, 493 on days of routine care) followed up until six months after initial attendance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of participants admitted to hospital, the proportion with acute coronary syndrome sent home inappropriately, major adverse cardiac events over six months, health utility, hospital reattendance and readmission, and costs per patient to the health service. RESULTS: Use of a chest pain observation unit reduced the proportion of patients admitted from 54% to 37% (difference 17%, odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.65, P < 0.001) and the proportion discharged with acute coronary syndrome from 14% to 6% (8%, -7% to 23%, P = 0.264). Rates of cardiac event were unchanged. Care in the chest pain observation unit was associated with improved health utility during follow up (0.0137 quality adjusted life years gained, 95% confidence interval 0.0030 to 0.0254, P = 0.022) and a saving of pound 78 per patient (- pound 56 to pound 210, P = 0.252).

2604,Using clopidogrel in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients: a cost-utility analysis in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel, administered for 1 year after hospital admission for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome in the Spanish public health network. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. A Markov decision tree was constructed for modeling the long-term cardiovascular events according to the probabilities of the CURE study, the Framingham study, and the Spanish age-sex-specific mortality rates. The costs of the therapy were calculated mainly using the cost per diagnosis-related group in the Spanish National Health System. The utilities of the various states were estimated using data from published studies. A 3% discount rate was used for both the costs and the utilities. An expected value sensitivity analysis and a Monte Carlo microsimulation probabilistic analysis were performed. RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved owing to clopidogrel in the base case was about Euros 12000. This expected cost-effectiveness ratio was very sensitive to the age of the patient, the base risk of cardiovascular events, and the precision of the estimated effectiveness of clopidogrel. The cost per QALY ranged between some Euros 5000 for a high-risk, 40-year-old patient and Euros 30000 for a low-risk, 80-year-old patient. According to the accepted threshold for Spanish society, the probability that clopidogrel was cost-effective in the base analysis case was 85.3%.

2608,Cost-effectiveness of postexposure prophylaxis after sexual or injection-drug exposure to human immunodeficiency virus,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of interventions that provide human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to individuals after sexual or injection-drug use exposures depends on the distribution of exposure routes, prevalence of infection among source partners, adherence to PEP regimens, medical care costs, and prevailing epidemiologic contexts, among other factors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive program to prevent HIV infection after sexual or injection-drug use exposure for 401 persons seeking PEP in an urban community. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cost analysis to evaluate the cost of the PEP intervention, then combined this information with model-based effectiveness estimates to determine the PEP program""s ""cost-utility ratio,"" which is the ratio of net program costs to the total number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved by the program. RESULTS: The average cost of the PEP regimen was $1222, and the total cost of the program was $450 970. The PEP program prevented an estimated 1.26 HIV infections, saved 11.74 QALYs, and averted $281 323 in future HIV-related medical care costs. The overall cost-utility ratio was $14 449 per QALY saved. When analysis was restricted to men reporting receptive anal intercourse, the savings in averted HIV-related medical care costs exceeded the cost of the program. The results were generally robust to changes in key parameter values but were sensitive to assumptions about the HIV transmission probability for receptive anal intercourse. CONCLUSIONS: For this study population, HIV PEP was cost-effective by conventional standards and cost-saving for persons seeking PEP after male-male receptive anal intercourse.",2004-01-00468,14718321,Arch Intern Med,Steven D Pinkerton,2004,164 / 1,46-54,No,14718321,"Steven D Pinkerton; Jeffrey N Martin; Michelle E Roland; Mitchell H Katz; Thomas J Coates; James O Kahn; Jeffrey N Martin; Michelle E Roland; Mitchell H Katz; Thomas J Coates; James O Kahn; Cost-effectiveness of postexposure prophylaxis after sexual or injection-drug exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, Arch Intern Med, 2004-Jan-12; 164(1):0003-9926; 46-54",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Counseling, HIV testing, therapy, and follow-up vs. No intervention",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,14449,United States,2000,21716.38

PARTICIPANTS: 1346 women requiring a hysterectomy for reasons other than malignancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: One year costs estimated from NHS perspective. Health outcomes expressed in terms of QALYs based on women""s responses to the EQ-5D at baseline and at three points during up to 52 weeks"" follow up. RESULTS: Laparoscopic hysterectomy cost an average of 401 pounds sterling (708 dollars; 571 euros) more (95% confidence interval 271 pounds sterling to 542 pounds sterling) than vaginal hysterectomy but produced little difference in mean QALYs (0.0015, -0.015 to 0.018). Mean differences in cost and QALYs generated an incremental cost per QALY gained of 267 333 pounds sterling (471 789 dollars; 380 437 euros). The probability that laparoscopic hysterectomy is cost effective was below 50% for a large range of values of willingness to pay for an additional QALY. Laparoscopic hysterectomy cost an average of 186 pounds sterling (328 dollars; 265 euros) more than abdominal hysterectomy, although 95% confidence intervals crossed zero (-26 pounds sterling to 375 pounds sterling); there was little difference in mean QALYs (0.007, -0.008 to 0.023), resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of 26 571 pounds sterling (46 893 dollars; 37 813 euros).

Other outcomes were the marginal costs per hospital survivor and per year of life saved generated by using linezolid. Model estimates were derived from prospective trials of linezolid for ventilator-associated pneumonia and from other studies describing the costs and outcomes for ventilator-associated pneumonia. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: In the model, patients received either linezolid or vancomycin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of linezolid was calculated as the additional quality-adjusted life-years resulting from therapy with linezolid divided by the sum of the incremental costs arising because of use of linezolid (e.g., higher direct costs for linezolid, costs per in-hospital care of survivors, and posthospitalization costs). Despite its higher cost, linezolid was cost-effective for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year equals approximately 30,000 dollars. The model was moderately sensitive to the estimated efficacy of linezolid over vancomycin. Nonetheless, even with all inputs simultaneously skewed against, linezolid remains a cost-effective option (cost per quality-adjusted life-year approximately 100,000 dollars). Based on Monte Carlo simulation, the results of our analysis are robust across a range of model inputs and assumptions (95% confidence interval for cost per quality-adjusted life-year ranges from 23,637 dollars to 42,785 dollars). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid is a cost-effective alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia.",2004-01-00472,14707572,Crit Care Med,Andrew F Shorr,2004,32 / 1,137-43,No,14707572,"Andrew F Shorr; Gregory M Susla; Marin H Kollef; Gregory M Susla; Marin H Kollef; Linezolid for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a cost-effective alternative to vancomycin, Crit Care Med, 2004-Jan; 32(1):0090-3493; 137-43",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Linezolid therapy vs. Vancomycin therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,29945,United States,2001,43761.13
2614,Cost-effectiveness of uterine artery embolization and hysterectomy for uterine fibroids,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of uterine artery embolization (UAE) with that of hysterectomy for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors developed a decision model to compare the costs and effectiveness of UAE and hysterectomy. In the model, a cohort of women aged 40 years with a diagnosis of uterine fibroids and no desire for future pregnancy was followed up until menopause. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective, including all costs and effects, regardless of who incurs them. Transition probability and quality-of-life estimates were obtained from the literature and a gynecologist, whereas costs (in 1999 U.S. dollars) were estimated by using rates of Medicare reimbursement for hospital costs and physician fees. Sensitivity analyses of key estimates were performed. Results were expressed in costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: UAE was more effective (8.29 vs 8.18 QALYs) and less expensive (US dollars 6916 vs US dollars 7847) than hysterectomy. Cost-effectiveness results, with the exception of quality-of-life data, were robust to changes in most model assumptions. When the quality-of-life adjustment was eliminated, the two procedures were equally effective.

2616,Alternative strategies for stroke care: cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from a prospective randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although stroke units reduce mortality and institutionalization, their comparative cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: Healthcare, social services, and informal care costs were compared for 447 acute stroke patients randomly assigned to stroke unit, stroke team, or domiciliary stroke care. Prospective and retrospective methods were used to identify resource use over 12 months after stroke onset. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Mean healthcare and social care costs over 12 months were 11 450 pounds sterling for stroke unit, 9527 pounds sterling for stroke team, and 6840 pounds sterling for domiciliary care. More than half the costs were for the initial episode of care. Institutionalization was a large proportion of follow-up costs. Inclusion of informal care increased costs considerably. When informal care was excluded, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per percentage point in deaths or institutionalizations avoided in the first year was 496 pounds sterling for the stroke unit over domiciliary care; incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year quality-adjusted life year gained was 64 097 pounds sterling between these 2 groups. The stroke team was dominated by domiciliary care. CONCLUSIONS: Cost perspectives, especially those related to long-term and informal care, are important when stroke services are evaluated.

2617,TNF inhibitors in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in clinical practice: costs and outcomes in a follow up study of patients with RA treated with etanercept or infliximab in southern Sweden,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate costs, benefits, and cost effectiveness of tumour necrosis factor inhibitor treatment over one year in routine clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At four rheumatology units in southern Sweden treatment of 160 consecutive patients with RA was started with either etanercept or infliximab. The economic analysis was based on 116 patients with complete data who received treatment for at least one year. Details on drug treatment, functional capacity, disease activity, and laboratory values were available during the entire treatment. Information on resource use and QoL was collected at baseline and throughout the first year. The cost effectiveness analysis was based on changes in outcome and costs compared with the year before treatment. Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated for the entire sample and for patients with different levels of functional disability. RESULTS: During the first treatment year direct costs were reduced by 40%, but indirect costs did not change substantially. Patients"" QoL improved on treatment-utility increased from an average of 0.28 to 0.65. Assuming that improvement occurred after three months"" treatment, the cost per QALY gained is estimated as euro;43 500. If it occurs after six weeks, in parallel with clinical measures, the cost per QALY is euro;36 900. Sensitivity analysis, including all 160 patients, gave an estimated cost per QALY of euro;53 600. The cost per QALY increases for patient groups with less severe disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a Markov model to project the clinical and economic outcomes of preoperative radiotherapy. Data on local recurrence rates, quality of life, and costs were obtained from the patients of a multicenter randomized clinical trial. In this trial, 1,861 patients with resectable rectal cancer from 108 hospitals were randomly assigned for TME surgery with or without preoperative radiotherapy. Outcome measures of the model were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs per patient, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The base case model estimates that the loss of quality of life due to preoperative radiotherapy is outweighed by the gain in life expectancy. Life expectancy increases by 0.67 years; quality-adjusted life expectancy, by 0.39 years; and costs, by $9,800 per patient. The corresponding cost-effectiveness ratio is $25,100 per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the cost-effectiveness ratio remains acceptable under a wide range of assumptions.

2622,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of etanercept in adults with rheumatoid arthritis in the UK,"OBJECTIVES: This model examines the cost-effectiveness of etanercept monotherapy under British Society for Rheumatology guidelines, i.e. adults previously failing two disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). It compares a DMARD sequence with etanercept third line against the same sequence excluding etanercept. METHOD: The 6-monthly trend in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability score is simulated for 10 000 patients"" lifetimes using clinical trial data and published literature. Switching to the next treatment is triggered by lack of response, loss of efficacy or adverse events. Patient mortality depends on rheumatoid arthritis life-tables and on epidemiological evidence relating reduced risk to HAQ improvement. Regression of HAQ/EuroQol (EQ-5D) utility provides quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. Primary analysis includes drug costs, monitoring and hospitalizations. RESULTS: The central estimate cost per QALY is pound 16 330. Sensitivity analyses ( pound 7800 to pound 42 000) showed long-term HAQ progression (etanercept, DMARDs, non-responders) as most sensitive variables. The inclusion of potential avoided nursing home admissions and indirect costs/lost employment further improves the cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: For adults in the UK, the results suggest that etanercept is cost-effective when compared with non-biologic agents. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has accepted that etanercept is cost-effective and recommended its availability for use in patients who have failed at least two DMARDs. This model was an important component of that decision.

2623,Benefit and projected cost-effectiveness of anastrozole versus tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for patients with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Women who have estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease with postmenopausal onset and who receive tamoxifen as standard adjuvant treatment constitute the largest subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Recent data from the ATAC ('Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination') randomized trial indicate that anastrozole significantly reduces breast cancer recurrence rates but does not provide any advantage in terms of survival at 4 years posttreatment. Furthermore, anastrozole and tamoxifen were found to have different toxicity profiles. The goals of the current study were to estimate the disease-free survival (DFS) rates and potential survival benefits associated with anastrozole use and to determine whether the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICE) was low enough to warrant an immediate switch to the use of this agent, as the long-term conclusions of the ATAC trial will not be available for several years. METHODS: A computer simulation model assessed the outcomes of 64-year-old women with ER-positive breast cancer who subsequently received either anastrozole or tamoxifen for 5 years. Daily recurrence risks, as well as the relative risks associated with various treatment-related events, were calculated using data from the ATAC trial. Study endpoints included breast cancer recurrence-free survival, anticipated survival resulting from an anastrozole-induced decrease in systemic disease recurrence rates, and survival adjusted for quality of life and for hip fracture risk over periods of 4, 12, and 20 years. RESULTS: After 4 years, the projected DFS benefit associated with anastrozole was 14 days, with an ICE of $167,500 per year. Projected 12 and 20 years into the future, DFS benefits increased to 2.9 months and 5.3 months, respectively. The corresponding benefits in terms of overall survival were 0.9 months and 2.0 months, respectively, with the ICE becoming < $100,000 per life year once the projection horizon exceeded 12 years. The inclusion of quality-of-life weightings for nonfatal outcomes modestly favored anastrozole in the short term; however, if anastrozole use is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, then the long-term benefit associated with this agent is reduced by approximately 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant anastrozole is projected to result in a substantial improvement in DFS for patients with breast cancer. If this DFS benefit were to ultimately lead to a survival benefit, then the ICE of anastrozole use would be acceptable for patients expected to live longer than 12 years.

2625,Benefit and projected cost-effectiveness of anastrozole versus tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for patients with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Women who have estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease with postmenopausal onset and who receive tamoxifen as standard adjuvant treatment constitute the largest subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Recent data from the ATAC ('Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination') randomized trial indicate that anastrozole significantly reduces breast cancer recurrence rates but does not provide any advantage in terms of survival at 4 years posttreatment. Furthermore, anastrozole and tamoxifen were found to have different toxicity profiles. The goals of the current study were to estimate the disease-free survival (DFS) rates and potential survival benefits associated with anastrozole use and to determine whether the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICE) was low enough to warrant an immediate switch to the use of this agent, as the long-term conclusions of the ATAC trial will not be available for several years. METHODS: A computer simulation model assessed the outcomes of 64-year-old women with ER-positive breast cancer who subsequently received either anastrozole or tamoxifen for 5 years. Daily recurrence risks, as well as the relative risks associated with various treatment-related events, were calculated using data from the ATAC trial. Study endpoints included breast cancer recurrence-free survival, anticipated survival resulting from an anastrozole-induced decrease in systemic disease recurrence rates, and survival adjusted for quality of life and for hip fracture risk over periods of 4, 12, and 20 years. RESULTS: After 4 years, the projected DFS benefit associated with anastrozole was 14 days, with an ICE of $167,500 per year. Projected 12 and 20 years into the future, DFS benefits increased to 2.9 months and 5.3 months, respectively. The corresponding benefits in terms of overall survival were 0.9 months and 2.0 months, respectively, with the ICE becoming < $100,000 per life year once the projection horizon exceeded 12 years. The inclusion of quality-of-life weightings for nonfatal outcomes modestly favored anastrozole in the short term; however, if anastrozole use is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, then the long-term benefit associated with this agent is reduced by approximately 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant anastrozole is projected to result in a substantial improvement in DFS for patients with breast cancer. If this DFS benefit were to ultimately lead to a survival benefit, then the ICE of anastrozole use would be acceptable for patients expected to live longer than 12 years.

2631,Meningococcal C vaccines: the Canadian experience,"BACKGROUND: Several outbreaks caused by virulent strains of serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis were observed in several Canadian provinces in the early 1990s. In an attempt to control these outbreaks, local immunization programs, with polysaccharide vaccines, directed at school age children and adolescents were initiated. In Quebec, however, the incidence of serogroup C meningococcal disease remained high among unvaccinated groups, and clusters appeared in previously unaffected areas. As a result, a 1-dose immunization campaign was initiated, targeting all 1.9 million people between 6 months and 20 years of age for vaccination with the polysaccharide vaccine. This campaign was effective in controlling the epidemic, but there was no evidence of vaccine effectiveness among children <2 years of age and protection was short-lived among older individuals. A second series of serogroup C meningococcal disease outbreaks were observed in several Canadian provinces from 1999 to 2001, and a mass immunization campaign with glycoconjugate vaccines against serogroup C meningococcal disease was implemented in the autumn of 2001. METHODS: Evaluation of the effects of the glycoconjugate vaccination campaign was made with data on confirmed cases of serogroup C disease reported to the regional health authorities between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002. A cost effectiveness analysis of different glycoconjugate vaccine immunization strategies was also performed. CONCLUSIONS: The 1999-2001 glycoconjugate vaccine mass immunization campaign was effective in reducing disease incidence among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.

2633,Radiotherapy is a cost-effective palliative treatment for patients with bone metastasis from prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the various treatments for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer with bone metastases using a Markov model. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The base case to be evaluated was of a man with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The evaluated palliative treatments were pain medication only, chemotherapy consisting of mitoxantrone and prednisone, and single- and multifraction radiotherapy (RT). A literature search was used to generate the transition probabilities and patient utilities. Modeling was used to generate the cost estimates. Expert opinion was used to generate utilities and cost estimates in the absence of literature data. Second-order Monte Carlo simulation produced incremental cost-effectiveness scatterplots and 95% confidence ellipses. RESULTS: Pain medication had the least expected mean cost of all the treatment options at 11,700 US dollars but also the second lowest quality-adjusted survival at 5.75 quality-adjusted life months. Chemotherapy had the highest expected mean cost, 15,300 US dollars, but the lowest quality-adjusted life months (4.93). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that single-fraction RT was the most cost-effective treatment, with a cost of 6,857 US dollars/quality-adjusted life year; multifraction RT had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 36,000 US dollars/quality-adjusted life year.

Hip protectors have been advocated as an effective method to prevent hip fractures in high-risk individuals. This study models the cost-effectiveness of hip protectors in the prevention of osteoporosis related hip fractures in elderly nursing home residents. METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing hip protectors to ""no treatment"" and to ""calcium and vitamin D supplements."" The study population was a hypothetical cohort of 1000 nursing home residents. A societal perspective, with a lifetime time horizon, was adopted. Data regarding costs, effectiveness, and quality of life measures were collected from the current literature and from Peace Arch Hospital, a community hospital in White Rock, British Columbia, Canada. Sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: Hip protector use was found to be a dominant strategy compared to no treatment and to calcium and vitamin D supplements. Dominance implies lower cost and higher effect, generating cost-effectiveness ratios less than zero.

2638,Effect of influenza treatment with oseltamivir on health outcome and costs in otherwise healthy children,"To evaluate the effect of treating children with influenza with oseltamivir on health outcomes and costs to healthcare payers.Health outcome data from the oseltamivir paediatric clinical development programme plus data from the literature were used in an economic model developed to predict morbidity and mortality due to influenza and its specified complications. Published data on the cost of care in the UK were used to compare oseltamivir with usual care in children aged 1-12 and 1-5 years by estimating cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios.Oseltamivir reduced median time to return to normal health and activity by almost 2 days (40% reduction, 67.1 vs 111.7 hours; p < 0.0001) versus placebo. In children aged 1-5 years, a 48% reduction (63.5 vs 121.3 hours; p = 0.0003) was observed. Oseltamivir-treated children who developed otitis media returned to normal health and activity 30% faster (99.6 vs 141.5 hours; p = 0.0517) than the placebo group. In the economic model, oseltamivir in the base-case analysis (assuming 60% diagnostic accuracy, full compliance, and 100% receive and start treatment within 48 hours, standard discounting according to the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines) resulted in favourable cost-utility ratios in children aged both 1-12 and 1-5 years, with incremental cost-utility rates of ?11 173/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and oseltamivir being dominant compared with usual care, respectively (year of costing, 2002). Even in conservative scenarios, most cost-utility ratios remained <?30 000/QALY.Oseltamivir is an effective treatment for children with influenza, allowing faster return to normal health and activity compared with usual care.

2647,Cost-utility analysis of the GC versus MVAC regimens for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer,"A cost-utility analysis was conducted to compare the gemcitabine (Gemzar)/cisplatin and methotrexate/vinblastine(Velban)/doxorubicin (Doxil)/cisplatin regimens in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. The analysis combined the results of a cost analysis of a head-to-head Phase III clinical trial with those from a cross-sectional utility study. The analysis was performed from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. Medical resource use was obtained from the clinical trial database, from which patient-level cost streams were estimated for each treatment group. Unit costs for each resource utilization component were sought from the latest UK cost sources available at the time of analysis (2001). The distribution of the mean total and incremental costs for each group was simulated via bias-adjusted bootstrapping. Time trade-off utilities were derived from the utility study, which aimed to value the superior toxicity profile associated with gemcitabine/cisplatin, given comparable efficacy, in a discrete choice model assessing toxicity attributes and risks. The mean incremental cost of gemcitabine/cisplatin over methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin was estimated to be approximately pound sterling 2976 per patient, based on a mean of 4.65 cycles per patient treated with gemcitabine/cisplatin compared with a mean of 3.92 cycles per methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin patient. When combined with the utility estimates, this resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately pound sterling 22,925 per quality-adjusted life year gained associated with the choice of gemcitabine/cisplatin over methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin. A 95% confidence interval for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to range from pound sterling 12,911 to 33,589 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The incremental cost of gemcitabine/cisplatin is primarily due to the direct costs of chemotherapy given minimal cost offsets. However, an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ratio in the range of pound sterling 20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained suggested that the regimen is reasonable value for money in England and Wales.",2004-01-13962,19807333,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,Paul Robinson,2004,4 / 1,27-38,No,19807333,"Paul Robinson; Hans von der Maase; Shkun Bhalla; Adrian Kielhorn; Michael Aristides; Alissa Brown; Dominic Tilden; Cost-utility analysis of the GC versus MVAC regimens for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res, ; 4(1):1744-8379; 27-38",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Gemcitabine, cisplatin (GC) 28-day cycle- Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m^2) and cisplatin (70 mg/m^2) vs. Methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (MVAC) 28-day cycle- Methotrexate (30 mg/m^2), vinblastine (3 mg/m^2), doxorubicin (30 mg/m^2), cisplatin (70 mg/m^2)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,60 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,22925,United Kingdom,2001,48231.4

The purpose of this investigation was to assess not only the economic consequences of SCS treatment (cost-utility analysis) but also altered quality of life in SCS patients. The retrospective study includes 18 consecutive patients, six women and 12 men, with an average age of 56.5?years (range 50-68), submitted to implantation of a SCS system at Odense University Hospital. Before implantation of the SCS system, the patients were in a transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment 2-11?months. At the submission all patients were in New York Heart Association functional group III/IV. The results are based on cost data from the year prior to start of TENS treatment compared with the year after implantation of the SCS system. Medical records of the patients were examined and data concerning use of general practitioners and emergency services were collected from a nationwide database. Quality of life data were collected using identical questionnaires (perception of pain, mobility, function in daily life, and physical activity) related to the period immediately before start of the TENS treatment and one year after SCS implant. Savings were found at hospital level (reduction in number of admissions) and for non-hospital related expenses (such as medication and visits at general practitioners). In addition, improvements were registered in all respects which constituted assessment of the quality of life of the patients. The study is a repetition of a similar analysis with identical results made in 1990 and including the 16 first angina pectoris patients treated with SCS at Odense University Hospital. SCS is effective in reducing hospital and non-hospital related expenses and improving quality of life of the patients. SCS is a simple treatment for the patient to use. The implantation technique is not more invasive than permanent cardiac pacing. The decisive part of the procedure is the insertion of the electrode and follow-up with support and adjustments of the stimulation.",2004-01-13966,22151189,Neuromodulation,Malene Bladt Rasmussen,2004,7 / 2,89-96,No,22151189,"Malene Bladt Rasmussen; Peter Hole; Claus Andersen; Electric Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) in the Treatment of Angina Pectoris: A Cost-Utility Analysis, Neuromodulation, ; 7(2):1525-1403; 89-96",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Spinal cord stimulation vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,5.00,5.00,-61881.13,Denmark,1999,-13771.3
2669,A methodological guide to performing a cost-utility study comparing surgical techniques,"When recommending the adoption of a new surgical intervention as opposed to maintaining an old one, surgeons need to consider the opportunity cost, which is the value of the forgone benefits. To inform these decisions, surgeons can use economic analyses of surgical practices. Unfortunately, economic analyses conducted alongside randomized controlled trials in surgery are rare.The objective of the present study was to use data from a small randomized controlled trial to illustrate the methodology for a cost-utility analysis comparing two techniques of carpal tunnel release: open release without ('usual' technique) and with ('novel' technique) ligament reconstruction.Eighteen eligible patients were entered into this prospective study. Fifteen were followed to six weeks postoperatively. One day preoperatively, and five days, three weeks and six weeks postoperatively, patients completed a self-administered Health Utilities Index Mark 2-3 questionnaire (utilities) and a case report form from which resource utilization (cost) was collected. Utilities were expressed as quality-adjusted life weeks, a fraction of quality-adjusted life years.The mean total cost of the usual technique was lower than the novel technique, and the mean quality-adjusted life week was higher, favouring the usual technique. Indirect costs were four to nine times higher than direct costs in both techniques.The novel technique was more costly and less effective, and fell in the 'lose-lose' quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane; it was rejected in favour of the usual technique. This methodology should be applied when deciding whether to adopt novel surgical techniques in plastic surgery to optimize scarce health care resources.",2004-01-13968,24115893,Can J Plast Surg,Achilleas Thoma,2004,12 / 4,179-87,No,24115893,"Achilleas Thoma; Ted Haines; Karen Veltri; Charlie H Goldsmith; Bernie J O'Brien; Caroline Quartly; A methodological guide to performing a cost-utility study comparing surgical techniques, Can J Plast Surg, ; 12(4):1195-2199; 179-87",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Open release with ligament reconstruction vs. Open release without ligament reconstruction (usual technique),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-336.13,Canada,1999,-351.51
2671,Cost-Effectiveness of Eplerenone Compared With Placebo in Patients With Myocardial Infarction Complicated by Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Heart Failure,"BACKGROUND: In the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS), aldosterone blockade with eplerenone decreased mortality in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. The present study was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of eplerenone compared with placebo in these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 6632 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction were randomized to eplerenone or placebo and followed up for a mean of 16 months. The coprimary end points were all-cause mortality and the composite of cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalization. The evaluation of resource use included hospitalizations, outpatient services, and medications. Eplerenone was priced at the average wholesale price, $3.60 per day. Survival beyond the trial period was estimated from data from the Framingham Heart Study, the Saskatchewan Health database, and the Worcester Heart Attack Registry. The incremental cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with placebo was estimated. The number of life-years gained with eplerenone was 0.1014 based on Framingham (95% CI, 0.0306 to 0.1740), 0.0636 with Saskatchewan (95% CI, 0.0229 to 0.1038), and 0.1337 with Worcester (95% CI, 0.0438 to 0.2252) data. Cost was $1391 higher over the trial period in the eplerenone arm (95% CI, 656 to 2165) because of drug cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $13 718 per life-year gained with Framingham (96.7% under $50 000 per life-year gained), $21 876 with Saskatchewan, and $10 402 with Worcester.

2672,Cost effectiveness of nurse led secondary prevention clinics for coronary heart disease in primary care: follow up of a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the cost effectiveness of nurse led secondary prevention clinics for coronary heart disease based on four years"" follow up of a randomised controlled trial. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis. SETTING: 19 general practices in north east Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 1343 patients (673 in intervention group and 670 in control group, as originally randomised) aged under 80 years with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease but without terminal illness or dementia and not housebound. INTERVENTION: Nurse led clinics to promote medical and lifestyle components of secondary prevention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of clinics; overall costs to health service; and cost per life year and per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, expressed as incremental gain in intervention group compared with control group. RESULTS: The cost of the intervention (clinics and drugs) was pound136 ($254; 195 euros) per patient higher (1998-9 prices) in the intervention group, but the difference in other NHS costs, although lower for the intervention group, was not statistically significant.

2673,A cost-effectiveness analysis of combination antiplatelet therapy for high-risk acute coronary syndromes: clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone,"BACKGROUND: Although clopidogrel plus aspirin is more effective than aspirin alone in preventing subsequent vascular events in patients with unstable angina, the cost-effectiveness of this combination has yet to be examined in this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with unstable angina and electrocardiographic changes or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. time horizon: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Combination therapy with clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, plus aspirin, 325 mg/d, for 1 year, followed by aspirin monotherapy, was compared with lifelong aspirin therapy, 325 mg/d. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime costs, life expectancy in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Patients treated with aspirin alone lived 9.51 QALYs after their initial event and incurred expenses of 127,700 dollars; the addition of clopidogrel increased life expectancy to 9.61 QALYs and costs to 129,300 dollars. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone was 15,400 dollars per QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The analysis of 1 year of therapy was robust to all sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, fewer than 3% of simulations resulted in cost-effectiveness ratios over 50,000 dollars per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of longer combination therapy depends critically on the balance of thrombotic event rates, durable efficacy, and the increased bleeding rate in patients taking clopidogrel. LIMITATIONS: This analysis may not apply to patients with severe heart failure, those undergoing long-term anticoagulant therapy, those recently managed with revascularization, or those undergoing short-term treatment with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with high-risk acute coronary syndromes, 1 year of therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin results in greater life expectancy than aspirin alone, at a cost within the traditional limits of cost-effectiveness. The durable efficacy of clopidogrel relative to the risk for hemorrhage should be further explored before more protracted therapy can be recommended.",2005-01-00008,15710958,Ann Intern Med,Mark D Schleinitz,2005,142 / 4,251-9,No,15710958,"Mark D Schleinitz; Paul A Heidenreich; Paul A Heidenreich; A cost-effectiveness analysis of combination antiplatelet therapy for high-risk acute coronary syndromes: clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone, Ann Intern Med, ; 142(4):1539-3704; 251-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clopidogrel therapy plus aspirin (1 year) then aspirin alone vs. Aspirin therapy alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15400,United States,2002,22155.03
2674,Cost effectiveness of etanercept (Enbrel) in combination with methotrexate in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis based on the TEMPO trial,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of combination treatment with etanercept plus methotrexate versus monotherapies in patients with active disease using a new model that incorporates both functional status and disease activity. METHODS: Effectiveness data were based on a 2-year trial in 682 patients with active RA (TEMPO). Data on resource consumption and utility related to function and disease activity were obtained from a survey in 616 patients in Sweden. A Markov model was constructed with 5 states according to functional status (HAQ) sub-divided into high and low disease activity. The cost per quality- adjusted life year gained is estimated using MonteCarlo simulation. RESULTS: Disease activity had a highly significant effect on utilities, independent of HAQ. For resource consumption, only HAQ was a significant predictor, with the exception of sick leave. Compared to methotrexate alone, etanercept plus methotrexate over 2 years increased total costs by 14,221 and led to a QALY gain of 0.38. When treatment is continued for 10 years, incremental costs are 42,148 for a QALY gain of 0.91. The cost per QALY gained is 37,331 and 46,494, respectively.

2677,Expanded screening for HIV in the United States--an analysis of cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend routine HIV counseling, testing, and referral (HIVCTR) in settings with at least a 1 percent prevalence of HIV, roughly 280,000 Americans are unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The effect of expanded screening for HIV is unknown in the era of effective antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: We developed a computer simulation model of HIV screening and treatment to compare routine, voluntary HIVCTR with current practice in three target populations: ""high-risk"" (3.0 percent prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection; 1.2 percent annual incidence); ""CDC threshold"" (1.0 percent and 0.12 percent, respectively); and ""U.S. general"" (0.1 percent and 0.01 percent). Input data were derived from clinical trials and observational cohorts. Outcomes included quality-adjusted survival, cost, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In the high-risk population, the addition of one-time screening for HIV antibodies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to current practice was associated with earlier diagnosis of HIV (mean CD4 cell count at diagnosis, 210 vs. 154 per cubic millimeter). One-time screening also improved average survival time among HIV-infected patients (quality-adjusted survival, 220.7 months vs. 219.8 months). The incremental cost-effectiveness was 36,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Testing every five years cost 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and testing every three years cost 63,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the CDC threshold population, the cost-effectiveness ratio for one-time screening with ELISA was 38,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, whereas testing every five years cost 71,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and testing every three years cost 85,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the U.S. general population, one-time screening cost 113,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

METHODS: We developed a Markov model of costs, quality of life, and survival associated with an HIV-screening program as compared with current practice. In both strategies, symptomatic patients were identified through symptom-based case finding. Identified patients started treatment when their CD4 count dropped to 350 cells per cubic millimeter. Disease progression was defined on the basis of CD4 levels and viral load. The likelihood of sexual transmission was based on viral load, knowledge of HIV status, and efficacy of counseling. RESULTS: Given a 1 percent prevalence of unidentified HIV infection, screening increased life expectancy by 5.48 days, or 4.70 quality-adjusted days, at an estimated cost of 194 dollars per screened patient, for a cost-effectiveness ratio of 15,078 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year.

Screening cost less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year if the prevalence of unidentified HIV infection exceeded 0.05 percent. Excluding HIV transmission, the cost-effectiveness of screening was 41,736 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. Screening every five years, as compared with a one-time screening program, cost 57,138 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year, but was more attractive in settings with a high incidence of infection. Our results were sensitive to the efficacy of behavior modification, the benefit of early identification and therapy, and the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of routine HIV screening in health care settings, even in relatively low-prevalence populations, is similar to that of commonly accepted interventions, and such programs should be expanded.",2005-01-00013,15703422,N Engl J Med,Gillian D Sanders,2004,352 / 6,570-85,No,15703422,"Gillian D Sanders; Ahmed M Bayoumi; Vandana Sundaram; S Pinar Bilir; Christopher P Neukermans; Chara E Rydzak; Lena R Douglass; Laura C Lazzeroni; Mark Holodniy; Douglas K Owens; Ahmed M Bayoumi; Vandana Sundaram; S Pinar Bilir; Christopher P Neukermans; Chara E Rydzak; Lena R Douglass; Laura C Lazzeroni; Mark Holodniy; Douglas K Owens; Cost-effectiveness of screening for HIV in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, N Engl J Med, 2005-Feb-10; 352(6):1533-4406; 570-85",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Voluntary HIV-screening, assumed recurrent screening (every 5 years) and no benefit from reduced transmission to partners. vs. Voluntary HIV-screening, assumed one-time screening and no benefit from reduced transmission to partners.",Not Stated,43 Years,43 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,123614,United States,2004,169362.96
2684,Costs and effectiveness of ximelagatran for stroke prophylaxis in chronic atrial fibrillation,"CONTEXT: Recent trials have found that ximelagatran and warfarin are equally effective in stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation. Because ximelagatran can be taken in a fixed, oral dose without international normalized ratio monitoring and may have a lower risk of hemorrhage, it might improve quality-adjusted survival compared with dose-adjusted warfarin. OBJECTIVE: To compare quality-adjusted survival and cost among 3 alternative therapies for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation: ximelagatran, warfarin, and aspirin. DESIGN: Semi-Markov decision model. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, varying risk of stroke, and no contraindications to anticoagulation therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs in US dollars. RESULTS: For patients with atrial fibrillation but no additional risk factors for stroke, both ximelagatran and warfarin cost more than 50,000 dollars per QALY compared with aspirin. For patients with additional stroke risk factors and low hemorrhage risk, ximelagatran modestly increased quality-adjusted survival (0.12 QALY) at a substantial cost (116,000 dollars per QALY) compared with warfarin.

2687,"Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses of a long-term, high-intensity exercise program compared with conventional physical therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost utility and cost effectiveness of long-term, high-intensity exercise classes compared with usual care in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: RA patients (n = 300) were randomly assigned to either exercise classes or UC; followup lasted for 2 years. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) according to the EuroQol (EQ-5D), Short Form 6D (SF-6D), and a transformed visual analog scale (VAS) rating personal health; functional ability according to the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and McMaster Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Interview (MACTAR); and societal costs. RESULTS: QALYs in both randomization groups were similar according to the EQ-5D and SF-6D, but were in favor of usual care according to the VAS (annual difference 0.037 QALY; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.002, 0.069). Functional ability was similar according to the HAQ, but in favor of the exercise classes according to the MACTAR (annual difference 2.9 QALY; 95% CI 0.9, 4.9). Annual medical costs of the exercise program were estimated at 780 per participating patient (1 approximately $1.05). The increase per patient in total medical costs of physical therapy was estimated at 430 (95% CI 318, 577), and the increase in total societal costs at 602 (95% CI -490, 1,664). For societal willingness-to-pay equal to 50,000 per QALY, usual care had better cost utility than exercise classes, and significantly so according to the VAS. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective and without taking possible preventive health effects into account, long-term, high-intensity exercise classes provide insufficient improvement in the valuation of health to justify the additional costs.",2005-01-00017,15696568,Arthritis Rheum,Wilbert B van den Hout,2005,53 / 1,39-47,No,15696568,"Wilbert B van den Hout; Zuzana de Jong; Marten Munneke; Johanna M W Hazes; Ferdinand C Breedveld; Theodora P M Vliet Vlieland; Zuzana de Jong; Marten Munneke; Johanna M W Hazes; Ferdinand C Breedveld; Theodora P M Vliet Vlieland; Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses of a long-term, high-intensity exercise program compared with conventional physical therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Arthritis Rheum, 2005-Feb-15; 53(1):0004-3591; 39-47",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,High intensity exercise program vs. Conventional physical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,67000,Euro,2002,91124.43
2688,The evaluation of rectal bleeding in adults. A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing four diagnostic strategies,"BACKGROUND: Though primary care patients commonly present with rectal bleeding, the optimal evaluation strategy remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of four diagnostic strategies in the evaluation of rectal bleeding. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov decision model. DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of the literature, Medicare reimbursement data, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Cancer Registry. TARGET POPULATION: Patients over age 40 with otherwise asymptomatic rectal bleeding. TIME HORIZON: The patient""s lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal perspective. INTERVENTIONS: Watchful waiting, flexible sigmoidoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy followed by air contrast barium enema (FS+ACBE), and colonoscopy.

Cost-effectiveness of rituximab (MabThera(R)) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the Netherlands. Eur J Haematol 2005: 74: 194-202. (c) Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.Abstract: Objective: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) vs. CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients in the Netherlands. Methods: A state transition model was developed to estimate the clinical course, costs and quality of life of patients with stage II, III or IV DLBCL receiving initial treatment with CHOP or R-CHOP to arrive at the ICER. The base year for the cost analysis was 2002 and was performed from the societal perspective. Only direct medical costs were included. The time horizon of the model was 15 yr and both costs and effects were discounted at 4%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of varying base-line assumptions of the model. Results: The incremental gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) was 0.88 in both the younger and the older patient groups. The costs were 12 343 higher in the younger group of patients and 15 860 in the older patients. This resulted in an ICER of 13 983 for the younger and 17 933 for the older patients per QALY gained. These results were sensitive to the time horizon of the model, other variations had a marginal impact on the outcome.

2695,A randomised trial of the cost effectiveness of buprenorphine as an alternative to methadone maintenance treatment for heroin dependence in a primary care setting,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Buprenorphine offers an alternative to methadone in the treatment of heroin dependence, and has the advantage of allowing alternate-day dosing. This study is the first to examine the cost effectiveness of buprenorphine as maintenance treatment for heroin dependence in a primary care setting using economic and clinical data collected within a randomised trial. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a randomised, open-label, 12-month trial of 139 heroin-dependent patients in a community setting receiving individualised treatment regimens of buprenorphine or methadone. Those who were currently on a methadone program (n = 57; continuing therapy subgroup) were analysed separately from new treatment recipients (n = 82; initial therapy subgroup). The study took a broad societal perspective and included health, crime and personal costs. Data on resource use and outcomes were a combination of clinical records and self report at interview. The main outcomes were incremental cost per additional day free of heroin use and per QALY. An analysis of uncertainty calculated the likelihood of net benefits for a range of acceptable money values of outcomes. All costs were in 1999 Australian dollars ($A). RESULTS: The estimated mean number of heroin-free days did not differ significantly between those randomised to methadone (225 [95% CI 91, 266]), or buprenorphine (222 [95% CI 194, 250]) over the year of the trial. Buprenorphine was associated with an average 0.03 greater QALYs over 52 weeks (not significant). The total cost was $A17 736 (95% CI -$A2981, $A38 364) with methadone and $A11 916 (95% CI $A7697, $A16 135) with buprenorphine; costs excluding crime were $A4513 (95% CI $A3495, $A5531) and $A5651 (95% CI $A4202, $A7100). With additional heroin-free days as the outcome, and crime costs included buprenorphine has a lower cost but less heroin-free days. If crime costs are excluded buprenorphine has a higher cost and worse outcome than methadone. With additional QALYs as the outcome, the cost effectiveness of buprenorphine is $A39 404 if crime is excluded, but buprenorphine is dominant if crime is included. CONCLUSIONS: The trial found no significant differences in costs or outcomes between methadone and buprenorphine maintenance in this particular setting. Although some of the results suggest that methadone may have a cost advantage, it is difficult to infer from the trial data that offering buprenorphine as an alternative would have a significant effect on total costs or outcomes. The point estimates of costs and outcomes suggest that buprenorphine may have an advantage in those initiating therapy. The confidence intervals were wide, however, and the likelihood of net benefits from substituting one treatment for another was close to 50%.",2005-01-00020,15693730,Pharmacoeconomics,Anthony H Harris,2005,23 / 1,77-91,Yes,15693730,"Anthony H Harris; Elena Gospodarevskaya; Alison J Ritter; Elena Gospodarevskaya; Alison J Ritter; A randomised trial of the cost effectiveness of buprenorphine as an alternative to methadone maintenance treatment for heroin dependence in a primary care setting, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(1):1179-2027; 77-91",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Buprenorphine vs. Methadone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-194000,Australia,1999,-194493.96
2696,Economic evaluation of sirolimus-eluting stents,"BACKGROUND: Sirolimus-eluting stents have recently been shown to reduce the risk of restenosis among patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Given that sirolimus-eluting stents cost about 4 times as much as conventional stents, and considering the volume of PCI procedures, the decision to use sirolimus-eluting stents has large economic implications. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation comparing treatment with sirolimus-eluting and conventional stents in patients undergoing PCI and in subgroups based on age and diabetes mellitus status. The probabilities of transition between clinical states and estimates of resource use and health-related quality of life were derived from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) database. Information on effectiveness was based on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing sirolimus-eluting and conventional stents. RESULTS: Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the baseline analysis was Can$58 721. Sirolimus-eluting stents were more cost-effective in patients with diabetes and in those over 75 years of age, the costs per QALY gained being $44 135 and $40 129, respectively. The results were sensitive to plausible variations in the cost of stents, the estimate of the effectiveness of sirolimus-eluting stents and the assumption that sirolimus-eluting stents would prevent the need for cardiac catheterizations in the subsequent year when no revascularization procedure was performed to treat restenosis. INTERPRETATION: The use of sirolimus-eluting stents is associated with a cost per QALY that is similar to or higher than that of other accepted medical forms of therapy and is associated with a significant incremental cost. Sirolimus-eluting stents are more economically attractive for patients who are at higher risk of restenosis or at a high risk of death if a second revascularization procedure were to be required.",2005-01-00022,15684117,CMAJ,Fiona M Shrive,2005,172 / 3,345-51,No,15684117,"Fiona M Shrive; Braden J Manns; P Diane Galbraith; Merril L Knudtson; William A Ghali; Braden J Manns; P Diane Galbraith; Merril L Knudtson; William A Ghali; Economic evaluation of sirolimus-eluting stents, CMAJ, 2005-Feb-01; 172(3):1488-2329; 345-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sirolimus-eluting stents vs. Conventional stents,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,58721,Canada,2002,53805.84
