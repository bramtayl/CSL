1701,Cost-effectiveness of newer treatment strategies for influenza,"PURPOSE: Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of influenza, such as rapid testing and neuraminidase inhibitor therapy, are available, but their place in clinical practice and their cost-effectiveness have not been determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of these newer interventions, we used a decision model that compared several influenza management strategies: no testing or treatment, amantadine or rimantadine treatment without testing, testing then amantadine or rimantadine treatment, neuraminidase inhibitor treatment without testing, or testing then neuraminidase inhibitor treatment. Antiviral therapy began within 48 hours in febrile patients with characteristic symptoms of influenza. We assumed that antiviral treatment did not change rates of influenza complication or mortality, and chose parameter values in the baseline analysis to bias slightly against antiviral treatment and toward testing strategies. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, testing strategies are more expensive and less effective than treatment strategies. Amantadine costs $9.06 per illness day avoided or $11.60 per quality-adjusted day gained. Compared with amantadine, zanamivir costs $198 per illness day avoided or $185 per quality-adjusted day gained, whereas oseltamivir costs $252 per illness day avoided or $235 per quality-adjusted day gained. In elderly patients who require reduced dosage, rimantadine costs $128 per quality-adjusted day gained compared with amantadine. In younger patients, amantadine is favored if the likelihood of influenza A is >67%; otherwise, neuraminidase inhibitors are favored. Testing strategies are more costly and less effective when the influenza probability is >30%. No testing or treatment is favored if the influenza probability is <32% and the influenza utility is >0.77. In elderly patients, amantadine is favored over rimantadine if the utility of medication side effects is >0.94. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral treatment of influenza without rapid testing is reasonable economically in febrile patients with typical symptoms during influenza season. The choice of antiviral agent depends on age, the likelihood of influenza A, and the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted day gained.",2002-01-00927,12361816,Am J Med,Kenneth J Smith,2002,113 / 4,300-7,No,12361816,"Kenneth J Smith; Mark S Roberts; Cost-effectiveness of newer treatment strategies for influenza, Am J Med, 2002-Sep; 113(4):0002-9343; 300-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Test then treat with zanamivir vs. No test and treat with amantadine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,362,United States,2000,544.07

1707,Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of stress myocardial SPECT and stress echocardiography in suspected coronary artery disease considering the prognostic value of false-negative results,"BACKGROUND: The prognoses of patients with false-negative test results by myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and by stress echocardiography are known to be different; the prognosis with false-negative SPECT is better in suspected and proven coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Three strategies by which to diagnose CAD were compared for their cost-effectiveness when considering the prognostic value of false-negative results: (1) stress myocardial SPECT by dipyridamole or adenosine followed by coronary angiography (CAG), (2) exercise stress echocardiography followed by CAG, and (3) dobutamine stress echocardiography followed by CAG. Delta quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for the three strategies separately when annual mortality and infarction rates were 0.5% and 0.5% for myocardial SPECT and 2% and 2% for stress echocardiography, respectively. Costs were estimated and costs per DeltaQALY were calculated according to the pretest likelihood of CAD (pCAD). The myocardial SPECT followed by CAG strategy was the most cost-effective in the patients with a pCAD of 0.3 or greater, and the dobutamine echocardiography followed by CAG strategy was the most cost-effective in patients with a pCAD of 0.2 or lower. This was the case when we assumed that the nondiagnostic test rate of dobutamine echocardiography was 9% (in contrast to 0% by myocardial SPECT and 18% by exercise echocardiography). Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of dobutamine echocardiography followed by CAG was best only if the prognosis of false-negative results of dobutamine echocardiography was better. The cost-effectiveness of exercise echocardiography was dubious because of the high nondiagnostic rate with inadequate exercise. CONCLUSIONS: When the lower event rates of (false) negative SPECT were considered, the relatively expensive myocardial SPECT strategy was more cost-effective than the cheaper stress echocardiography strategy in patients with a pCAD of 0.3 or greater. According to sensitivity analysis, the prognostic value of false-negative results and the nondiagnostic test rate were important determinants of stress myocardial study cost-effectiveness.",2002-01-00929,12360132,J Nucl Cardiol,Dong Soo Lee,2002,9 / 5,515-22,No,12360132,"Dong Soo Lee; Myoung Jin Jang; Gi Jeong Cheon; June-Key Chung; Myung Chul Lee; Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of stress myocardial SPECT and stress echocardiography in suspected coronary artery disease considering the prognostic value of false-negative results, J Nucl Cardiol, 2002 Sep-Oct; 9(5):1071-3581; 515-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) followed by coronary angiography vs. *,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,Not Stated,5.00,Not Stated,United States,2000,Not Stated

1711,Cost-effectiveness of screening for the possible development of cancer in patients with oral lichen planus,"INTRODUCTION: Several authors have expressed the view that patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) are at increased risk of developing oral cancer. Since OLP cannot be effectively treated, regular screening for the possible development of oral cancer might be considered. OBJECTIVES: (i) To calculate costs and effectiveness of screening for oral cancer in OLP patients with a decision model; (ii) to compare the cost-effectiveness of different screening scenarios; and (iii) to perform a sensitivity analysis of several variables used in this model. METHODS: Costs and effectiveness of a population of 100,000 OLP patients, being either screened or not screened for oral cancer, were calculated for the period of 1 year. Health gain was expressed as quality adjusted live years (QALY""s) and equivalent lives saved (ELS). Cost-effectiveness was expressed as extra costs (costs of screening minus costs of no screening) per ELS. Then, the outcome was compared with the cost-effectiveness of a different screening scenario. Finally, the effect of varying the variables: (i) costs of cancer treatment; (ii) annual malignant transformation rate (MTR); (iii) sensitivity and specificity of an oral examination; and (iv) proportion of cancers found in stage I on extra costs per ELS were assessed in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The health gain from screening was 592 QALY""s or the equivalent of 23.68 lives saved, costing 1,265,229 dollars, meaning that one ELS costed 53,430 dollars. Increase of cancer-treatment costs will significantly decrease the costs per ELS. When the MTR is lower than 0.4% per year, extra costs per ELS will increase exponentially. The effect of sensitivity and specificity of an oral examination in detecting oral cancer on cost-effectiveness seems to be substantial. When the proportion of cancers found in stage I can be increased from 40% (without screening) up to at least 60% after screening, extra costs per ELS will decrease exponentially. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for oral cancer in OLP patients, based on the presently used model, seems attractive. However, varying the several variables in the decision model has a significant impact on the final costs and effectiveness. Only, when additional information about these variables will become available, a more precise and realistic calculation can be performed.",2002-01-00943,12236825,Community Dent Oral Epidemiol,E H van der Meij,2002,30 / 5,342-51,No,12236825,"E H van der Meij; P D Bezemer; I van der Waal; Cost-effectiveness of screening for the possible development of cancer in patients with oral lichen planus, Community Dent Oral Epidemiol, 2002-Oct; 30(5):0301-5661; 342-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening by a dental specialist vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,2137.21,United States,2000,3212.16
1712,Effect of risk stratification on cost-effectiveness of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) effectively prevent sudden cardiac death, but selection of appropriate patients for implantation is complex. We evaluated whether risk stratification based on risk of sudden cardiac death alone was sufficient to predict the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the ICD. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICD implantation compared with empiric amiodarone treatment. The model incorporated mortality rates from sudden and nonsudden cardiac death, noncardiac death and costs for each treatment strategy. We based our model inputs on data from randomized clinical trials, registries, and meta-analyses. We assumed that the ICD reduced total mortality rates by 25%, relative to use of amiodarone. RESULTS: The relationship between cost-effectiveness of the ICD and the total annual cardiac mortality rate is U-shaped; cost-effectiveness becomes unfavorable at both low and high total cardiac mortality rates. If the annual total cardiac mortality rate is 12%, the cost-effectiveness of the ICD varies from $36,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained when the ratio of sudden cardiac death to nonsudden cardiac death is 4 to $116,000 per QALY gained when the ratio is 0.25. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of ICD use relative to amiodarone depends on total cardiac mortality rates as well as the ratio of sudden to nonsudden cardiac death. Studies of candidate diagnostic tests for risk stratification should distinguish patients who die suddenly from those who die nonsuddenly, not just patients who die suddenly from those who live.",2002-01-00946,12228780,Am Heart J,Douglas K Owens,2002,144 / 3,440-8,No,12228780,"Douglas K Owens; Gillian D Sanders; Paul A Heidenreich; Kathryn M McDonald; Mark A Hlatky; Effect of risk stratification on cost-effectiveness of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator, Am Heart J, 2002-Sep; 144(3):1097-6744; 440-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Implantation of an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) vs. Treatment with amiodarone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,54700,United States,1999,84975.76
1713,The detection and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important cause of death in Canada, and about 80% of the deaths are due to ruptured aneurysm. METHOD: To determine the most cost-effective way of controlling AAA in terms of early detection and clinical management, a cohort analysis was undertaken beginning at age 50 years, using a multistate life-table model with parameters derived from published articles. The model was used to determine (a) the optimum size for elective surgery and (b) the optimum rate of detection of intact AAA. Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was used to measure outcome. RESULTS: The most cost-effective diameter for repair of an intact AAA increases with age between the limits of 55 and 70 mm. The predominant size for repair is 60 mm. The most cost-effective rate at which latent AAA should be detected is 20% per year, corresponding to a screening interval of 5 years. Selective screening by sex or smoking status, or both, does not improve cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care patients aged 50 years and over should be offered abdominal ultrasonography every 5 years.

Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial. We designed this study to determine whether selected population screening with a brief ""quick-screen"" ultrasound could be cost-effective. METHODS: A series of 25 patients with risk factors for AAA were evaluated in a blinded fashion by a quick-screen ultrasound and a full conventional study. Times and accuracy for the 2 approaches were compared. An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of screening for AAA was then performed using a Markov model. We determined the long-term survival in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old males undergoing either AAA screening or not. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER). RESULTS: The average time for a quick screen was one-sixth that of a conventional study (4 vs 24 minutes). The accuracy of the quick screen was 100%. In our base-case analysis, screening for AAA was cost-effective with a CER of $11,215. Society usually is willing to pay for interventions with CER of less than $60,000 (eg, CER for coronary artery bypass grafting, $9500; breast cancer screening, $16,000). In sensitivity analysis, reducing the cost of screening from $259 (approximate Medicare reimbursement) to $40 (the quick screen) improved the CER to $6850. Moreover, screening populations with increased prevalence of AAA (eg, male with family history [18%]) further improved the CER. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that ultrasound screening for AAA should be offered to all males above the age of 60. Widespread screening for AAA should be adopted and reimbursed by Medicare and other insurers.",2002-01-00950,12219041,Surgery,Thomas Y Lee,2002,132 / 2,399-407,No,12219041,"Thomas Y Lee; Peter Korn; Jennifer A Heller; Sashi Kilaru; Frederick P Beavers; Harry L Bush; K Craig Kent; The cost-effectiveness of a ""quick-screen"" program for abdominal aortic aneurysms, Surgery, 2002-Aug; 132(2):0039-6060; 399-407",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quick screen ultrasound exam vs. No screen,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11215,United States,2000,16855.78
1715,Cost-utility analysis of primary prophylaxis versus treatment on-demand for individuals with severe haemophilia,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of primary prophylaxis with clotting factor instead of treatment following a bleed (on-demand) for individuals with severe haemophilia. DESIGN: Different data sources on the clinical effects and costs of treatments were combined using a Markov model. SETTING: English treatment centres. PERSPECTIVE: UK societal. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of 100 individuals with severe haemophilia A or B or severe von Willebrands disease. INTERVENTIONS: Primary prophylaxis treatment on-demand with clotting factor. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY in UK pounds ( pound, 1999/2000 values). RESULTS: The baseline results showed that treating individuals with severe haemophilia A/severe von Willebrands disease or severe haemophilia B with primary prophylaxis instead of treatment on-demand cost an additional pound 46500 and pound 8600 per QALY gained, respectively. However, the results were extremely sensitive to a number of factors including the clotting factor unit cost, the time between prophylactic doses and the discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high costs of treatment, primary prophylaxis was cost effective compared with treatment on-demand in some scenarios.

1717,The cost-effectiveness of treatment for congenital diaphragmatic hernia,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The cost-effectiveness of medical interventions is becoming an important issue for decision makers. Until recently, evidence of the cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery was largely lacking. The authors analyzed the cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery and subsequent treatment for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). METHODS: Both costs incurred inside and outside the health care sector (eg, out-of-pocket expenses and productivity losses) were included. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire. Descriptive quality-of-life data were collected using a disease-specific questionnaire. Both costs and effects basically were measured in a life-time setting. RESULTS: Total costs of treatment average euro 42,658, mainly consisting of costs of the initial hospitalization. Productivity losses in both the patients and their caregivers appear to be minor. Treated CDH patients, even adults, suffer from respiratory difficulties and stomach aches. According to the EQ-5D, however, their quality of life does not differ from the general population, suggesting that these symptoms barely affect overall quality of life. Treatment results in a gain of 17.5 QALYs. Costs per QALY amount to euro 2,434. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for CDH has favorable cost-effectiveness. Considering the growing importance of cost-effective medicine, these are important and encouraging results. Health economics outlines the inevitability of making choices that directly affect patient care and places relative values on different health care programs. The results of this study provide convincing evidence that treatment for CDH is indeed cost effective.",2002-01-00963,12194111,J Pediatr Surg,Marten J Poley,2002,37 / 9,1245-52,No,12194111,"Marten J Poley; E A Stolk; Dick Tibboel; Jan C Molenaar; J J V Busschbach; The cost-effectiveness of treatment for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, J Pediatr Surg, 2002-Sep; 37(9):1531-5037; 1245-52",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Emergency surgery followed by post-operative stabilization and delayed repair; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in selected cases vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,45 Years,5.00,5.00,2434,ECU,1998,4337.57
1718,Using cost-effectiveness analysis to define a breast cancer benefits package for the uninsured,"OBJECTIVES: In 1999, California was considering legislation to fund breast cancer treatment for its uninsured. We sought to define the most cost-effective breast cancer benefits package in order to inform this debate. METHODS: We use cost-effectiveness analysis to calculate the additional costs and benefits of various adjuvant therapy strategies, radiation after breast conserving surgery, and reconstruction compared to those of surgery alone in order to define the most cost-effective breast cancer benefits package for uninsured women. RESULTS: Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we define a Minimum Breast Cancer Benefits Package that includes only the most cost-effective life-saving breast cancer treatments. To provide these benefits for an estimated 550 breast cancer patients will cost $10,200,000. We present two options that each cost an additional $1,700,000 - to expand the benefits to these patients to include post-mastectomy radiation and breast reconstruction; or to provide the Minimum Package to an additional 93 uninsured women.

We present two options that each cost an additional $1,700,000 - to expand the benefits to these patients to include post-mastectomy radiation and breast reconstruction; or to provide the Minimum Package to an additional 93 uninsured women. CONCLUSIONS: California legislators must decide whether to offer comprehensive benefits to a limited number of breast cancer patients or to provide only the most life-saving treatments to a greater number of women.",2002-01-00965,12186375,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Jennifer L Malin,2002,74 / 2,143-53,No,12186375,"Jennifer L Malin; Emmett Keeler; Chenxi Wang; Robert Brook; Using cost-effectiveness analysis to define a breast cancer benefits package for the uninsured, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2002-Jul; 74(2):0167-6806; 143-53",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) plus surgery vs. Surgery alone,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2636,United States,1999,4094.99
1730,Impact of cochlear implants on the functional health status of older adults,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of cochlear implantation on quality of life changes in older adults aged 50 years and above. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study by questionnaire and chart review. METHODS: Forty-seven patients aged 50 to 80 years (mean age, 63.4 y [SD = 8.6 y]), who have multiple-channel cochlear implants received at The Listening Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital, completed the Ontario Health Utilities Index Mark 3 survey and a questionnaire on quality of life changes. Health utility scores before and after cochlear implantation were measured, and audiologic data before implantation and at 6 months and 1 year after implantation were analyzed. RESULTS: Cochlear implantation in older adults is associated with a mean gain in health utility(P <.0001) of 0.24 (SD = 0.33), which corresponds to a favorable cost-utility of $9530 per quality-adjusted life-year. Improvements in hearing and emotional health attributes were primarily responsible for this increase in health-related quality of life measure. There was a significant increase in speech perception scores at 6 months after surgery (P <.0001 for both CID sentence and monosyllabic word tests) and a strong correlation between the magnitude of health utility gains and the postoperative increase in speech perception scores (r = 0.45, P <.05).

1737,Medical or surgical therapy for erosive reflux esophagitis: cost-utility analysis using a Markov model,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost and utility of healing and maintenance regimens of omeprazole and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) in the framework of the Canadian medical system. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors for endoscopically proven reflux esophagitis is a safe and effective treatment option. Of late, the surgical treatment of choice for this disease has become LNF. METHODS: The authors"" base case was a 45-year-old man with erosive reflux esophagitis refractory to H2-blockers. A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing the two strategies. A two-stage Markov model (healing and maintenance phases) was used to estimate costs and utilities with a time horizon of 5 years. Discounted direct costs were estimated from the perspective of a provincial health ministry, and discounted quality-of-life estimates were derived from the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model to the authors"" assumptions and to determine thresholds. A Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 patients was used to estimate variances and 95% interpercentile ranges. RESULTS: For the 5-year period studied, LNF was less expensive than omeprazole (3519.89 dollars vs. 5464.87 dollars per patient) and became the more cost-effective option at 3.3 years of follow-up. The authors found that 20 mg/day omeprazole would have to cost less than 38.60 dollars per month before medical therapy became cost effective; conversely, the cost of LNF would have to be more than 5,273.70 dollars or the length of stay more than 4.2 days for medical therapy to be cost effective. Estimates of quality-adjusted life-years did not differ significantly between the two treatment options, and the incremental cost for medical therapy was 129,665 dollars per quality-adjusted life-years gained. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe esophagitis, LNF is a cost-effective alternative to long-term maintenance therapy with proton pump inhibitors.",2002-01-00972,12170024,Ann Surg,Joseph Romagnuolo,2002,236 / 2,191-202,No,12170024,"Joseph Romagnuolo; Michael A Meier; Daniel C Sadowski; Medical or surgical therapy for erosive reflux esophagitis: cost-utility analysis using a Markov model, Ann Surg, 2002-Aug; 236(2):0003-4932; 191-202",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Medical treatment (omeprazole) vs. Surgery (laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication),Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Male,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,129665,Canada,2000,131233.13

DESIGN: A randomized trial. SETTING: Two government-subsidized apartment complexes. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-three culturally diverse volunteers aged 60 and older. INTERVENTION: An OT group, a social activity group (active control), and a nontreatment group (passive control). MEASUREMENTS: Use of healthcare services was determined by telephone interview during and after the treatment phase.

1741,Economic evaluation for hepatitis C,"This paper describes the methods used in economic evaluation and illustrates the challenges of assessing the cost-effectiveness of new interventions in Hepatitis C (HCV), where the impact of interventions needs to be assessed over the patient""s lifetime. This paper provides an example of an economic evaluation in HCV using a model estimating the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy (CMB) for patients with mild HCV. The preliminary results from the model suggested that for 1000 cases with mild disease CMB lead to 55 fewer deaths from liver disease compared to no treatment, an average gain of 1.2 life years. Although CMB lead to additional costs of 14,882 EURO""s, the cost-effectiveness ratio was 8,490 EURO""s per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY), which suggests the intervention is relatively cost-effective. The sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to the effectiveness of the intervention, and the progression rates between mild disease and cirrhosis. A large UK study is collecting data on the effectiveness of CMB for patients with mild disease, and the costs and quality of life for patients at different stages of HCV. These data will be used to improve the projections of the model. In general, economic evaluations can provide information to help decide where priorities lie both in HCV, and other disease areas.",2002-01-00977,12148430,Acta Gastroenterol Belg,R Grieve,2002,65 / 2,104-9,No,12148430,"R Grieve; Jennifer Roberts; Economic evaluation for hepatitis C, Acta Gastroenterol Belg, 2002 Apr-Jun; 65(2):0001-5644; 104-9",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combination therapy (CMB) with alpha interferon and ribavirin vs. No treatment,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,8490,Euro,2000,11779.99
1742,"Cost effectiveness of treatment of Parkinson""s disease with entacapone in the United States","OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of adjunctive therapy with entacapone versus standard treatment (levodopa) without entacapone for patients in the US with Parkinson""s disease (PD) who experience ""off-time"" (re-emergence of the symptoms of PD) while receiving levodopa. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was used to estimate 5-year costs and effectiveness of standard treatment with and without entacapone. METHODS: Probabilities, unit costs, resource utilisation data and utilities were obtained from published literature, clinical trial reports, a national database, and clinical experts. PD disability was measured using the daily proportion of off-time and Hoehn and Yahr scale scores. The analysis measured costs from a societal and third-party payer perspective, and effectiveness as gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and years without progression to >25% off-time. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, entacapone therapy resulted in an incremental cost of US dollars 9327 per QALY gained compared with standard treatment. Treatment with entacapone also provided an additional 7.6 months with < or =25% off-time/day compared with standard treatment. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the model is sensitive to changes in rates of improvement/deterioration of off-time, and to the number of doses per day of levodopa with adjunctive entacapone. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of entacapone to standard treatment for patients receiving levodopa who experience off-time provides additional QALYs and gain in time with minimal fluctuations.

1743,Cost effectiveness of tinzaparin sodium versus unfractionated heparin in the treatment of proximal deep vein thrombosis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate economic and health implications of tinzaparin sodium, a once a day low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from a US healthcare payer perspective. STUDY DESIGN: An economic model, composed of two submodules, was created: A short-term module based on clinical trial data covering the first 3 months and a long-term module that projects trial results based on published data for up to 50 years. METHODS: Clinical trial results were combined with data from long-term follow-up studies of DVT in a model that estimates the health and economic consequences of treatment. Both short- and long-term costs with tinzaparin sodium were compared with UFH, as were health outcomes and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Patients treated with tinzaparin sodium are estimated to live a mean of 0.9 years longer on average (0.6 discounted), resulting in an increase of 0.8 QALYs (0.5 discounted). At the same time, lifetime savings are US dollars 621 per patient (1999 values), even when all patients receiving tinzapirin sodium are treated as inpatients. Early discharge of patients receiving tinzaparin sodium, or outpatient treatment, would save between US dollars 3000 and US dollars 5000 per patient.

We constructed a Markov cost-effectiveness model comparing Botox injection, pneumatic balloon dilation, and laparoscopic esophagomyotomy as initial treatments of achalasia. Costs and probabilities were derived from the published literature. The utility for symptomatic achalasia was derived from a sample of patients with achalasia. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Over a five-year time horizon, pneumatic dilation was the most cost-effective treatment strategy for achalasia, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1348 per quality-adjusted life-year compared to Botox. Although laparoscopic esophagomyotomy was more effective than the other treatment options, it was not cost-effective because of its high initial cost. In conclusion, pneumatic dilation is the most cost-effective treatment option for adults with achalasia.

1746,An economic evaluation of early versus delayed operative treatment in patients with closed tibial shaft fractures,"There are few reports examining the effect of surgical delay on outcomes following operative treatment of lower extremity fractures. Delays in the surgery for closed tibial shaft fractures have been reported to increase the overall complication rate, postoperative hospital stays and crude costs to the health care system. Our purpose was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility associated with the adoption of a programme of early operative treatment of all closed tibial shaft fractures. We performed cost analyses based upon data obtained from an observational study. A cohort of patients with closed tibial shaft fractures was identified at a university-affiliated level I trauma centre. Patients were divided into an early surgical group (within 12 h) and delayed surgical group (longer than 12 h). Study outcomes included time to fracture union (weeks), direct inpatient and outpatient costs associated with each intervention, loss of productivity costs, and utilities (patient health perception) as determined from content experts. Sixteen patients were operated on within 12 h of injury and 19 patients were treated later than 12 h after their fracture. These groups were similar for all baseline variables. The average time to fracture union was 28.2 weeks (SD 9.4) and 44.2 weeks (SD 7.4) for the early surgical group and the delayed surgical group, respectively ( p<0.01). When the costs associated with productivity losses were included in the cost-effectiveness analysis, savings were noted of 7,330 CD dollars per patient and of 458 CD dollars for each week that a fracture healed more quickly with early treatment. However, when the loss of patient productivity was not included, there was a cost per week of 67 CD dollars. A difference of 0.09 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in favour of the early surgery was found, which yielded a savings of 81,444 CD dollars per QALY gained when the productivity losses were included and a cost per QALY of 11,922 CD dollars when the productivity losses were not included. Both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were robust. Early plate fixation of closed tibial shaft fractures results in significantly shorter time to fracture union, fewer postoperative complications, significant cost effectiveness and greater QALYs gained when compared with delayed treatment. Inferences from this study are strengthened by the comprehensive abstraction of cost data and detailed cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses.",2002-01-00987,12136294,Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,Sheila Sprague,2002,122 / 6,315-23,No,12136294,"Sheila Sprague; Mohit Bhandari; An economic evaluation of early versus delayed operative treatment in patients with closed tibial shaft fractures, Arch Orthop Trauma Surg, 2002-Jul; 122(6):0936-8051; 315-23",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early plate fixation surgery (within 12 hours of injury) vs. Delayed plate fixation surgery (more than 12 hours after injury),Not Stated,Not Stated,17 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-81444,Canada,2000,-82428.96

The cost effectiveness and cost utility of this new therapeutic modality were determined as part of a Canadian prospective, randomized, 1-year, open-label, multicentered trial. Design: A total of 255 patients were randomized to 'Appropriate care with hylan G-F 20' (AC+H) or 'Appropriate care without hylan G-F 20' (AC). Costs (1999 Canadian dollars) were collected from the societal viewpoint and included all costs related to OA of the knee and OA in all joints. Patients completed a number of outcomes questionnaires including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). Data were collected at clinic visits (baseline, 12 months) and by telephone (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months). Results: The AC+H group over the year had higher costs ($2125-$1415=$710, P< 0.05), more patients improved (69%-40%=29%,P =0.0001), greater increases in HUI3 (0.13-0.03=0.10, P< 0.0001) and increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.071, P< 0.05). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $2505/patient improved. The incremental cost-utility ratio was $10000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses and a second cost perspective gave similar results. Conclusion: The cost-utility ratio is below the suggested Canadian adoption threshold.

1748,The benefits of switching smoking cessation drugs to over-the-counter status,"This paper provides an analysis of the benefits to society from the conversion of nicotine replacement drugs (nicotine patches and gum) in 1996 from sale by prescription only in the United States to over-the-counter (OTC) sales. To estimate these benefits, we first estimate statistical demand functions for nicotine patches and gum. Second, we calculate the effects of OTC conversion on sales of each type of nicotine replacement drug. Third, we survey the literature on the effects of nicotine replacement drugs on total quits of cigarette smoking. Fourth, we survey the literature on the effects of quits achieved on expected lifespan, and on the estimated monetary value of longer lives from smoking cessation. Finally, we use all this evidence to calculate the value of the social benefits of the OTC conversion to the US. As a result of the OTC conversion, consumption of nicotine replacement drugs has increased substantially, by 78-92% for nicotine patches and 180% for nicotine gum. We estimate that the resulting increase in smoking cessation generated annual net social benefits of the order of magnitude of 1.8-2 billion dollars, based on conservative estimates both of the number of quits achieved and the value of added quality-adjusted life years from the reduced smoking.",2002-01-00992,12112489,Health Econ,Theodore E Keeler,2002,11 / 5,389-402,No,12112489,"Theodore E Keeler; Teh-Wei Hu; Alison Keith; Richard Manning; Martin D Marciniak; Michael Ong; Hai-Yen Sung; The benefits of switching smoking cessation drugs to over-the-counter status, Health Econ, 2002-Jul; 11(5):1879-1646; 389-402",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Over-the-counter nicotine patches and gum vs. Prescription nicotine patches and gum,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,13438,United States,1995,22820.88
1749,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of long-term management strategies for heartburn,"Objectives: To compare the expected costs and outcomes of seven alternative long-term primary care strategies for the management of patients with moderate-to-severe heartburn over a 1-year period. Methods: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate costs and effects (weeks with heartburn symptoms and quality adjusted life years QALYs]) for each strategy. Meta-analyses were used to synthesize acute treatment and maintenance studies and physician surveys to collect information on patient management. The impact of uncertainty on the base case results was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Probability distributions were defined for key model parameters and techniques of Monte Carlo simulation were used to draw values from these distributions. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) conditional on the monetary value decision makers are willing to pay for a symptom-free day or QALY were created for each strategy. Results: In the base case, no strategy was strictly dominated by any other strategy. However, two strategies (maintenance H2-receptor antagonists H2RA] and step-down proton pump inhibitor PPI]) were dominated through principles of extended dominance. The least costly and least effective strategy was intermittent H2RA, while maintenance PPI was the most costly and most effective. Conclusions: This analysis showed that the best way of managing patients with heartburn depends on how much society is willing to pay to achieve health improvements.

Costs were calculated for nonfatal hospitalizations, ambulatory care, spironolactone therapy, and death. The primary health outcome was quality-adjusted life-years saved (QALYS). Outcomes were evaluated for the first 35 months of observation in RALES. RESULTS: Spironolactone therapy during the first 35 months of follow-up in RALES increased quality-adjusted survival time (0.13 QALYS, 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.18) without increasing costs ($713 savings, 95% CI, $2,123 savings to $783 in costs). Spironolactone therapy either dominated placebo or had a ratio of cost per QALYS that was unlikely to exceed $20,300. These results were robust in both one-way and multiway sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Even after implementation of current clinical guidelines, addition of spironolactone therapy provides an opportunity to further reduce the large clinical and economic burden of patients with heart failure.",2002-01-01004,12085979,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,Henry A Glick,2002,16 / 1,53-9,No,12085979,"Henry A Glick; Sean M Orzol; Joseph F Tooley; Willem J Remme; Shigetake Sasayama; Bertram Pitt; Economic evaluation of the randomized aldactone evaluation study (RALES): treatment of patients with severe heart failure, Cardiovasc Drugs Ther, 2002-Jan; 16(1):0920-3206; 53-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"25 mg/day spironolactone vs. Standard therapy: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a loop duretic, and in some cases, digoxin",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,-5484.62,United States,1999,-8520.28
1759,Children with suspected craniosynostosis: a cost-effectiveness analysis of diagnostic strategies,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of three evaluation strategies in children at different risks of craniosynostosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model was constructed to compare three evaluation in strategies in children with suspected synostosis: no imaging, radiography (if abnormal, followed by three-dimensional CT [3D CT]), and 3D CT. Three risk groups were analyzed on the basis of the prevalence (pretest probability) of disease: low (completly healthy children; prevalence, 34/100,000), intermediate (healthy children with head deformity; prevalence, 1/115), and high risk (children with syndromic craniofacial disorders [i.e., Crouzon""s syndrome or Apert""s syndrome]; prevalence, 9-10/10). Test performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the evaluation strategies was obtained from the literature. Costs (not charge) estimates were obtained from the hospital cost-accounting database and from the Medicaid fee schedule. RESULTS: In the low-risk group, the radiographic and 3D CT strategies resulted in a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of more than $560,000. In the intermediate-risk group, the radiographic strategy resulted in a cost per QALY gained of $54,600. Three-dimensional CT was more effective than the two other strategies but at a higher cost-hence, with a cost per QALY gained of $374,200. In the high-risk group, 3D CT was the most effective strategy with a cost per QALY gained of $33,800. Less experienced radiologists and poor-quality studies increased the evaluation cost per QALY gained for all of the risk groups because of decreased effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Radiologic screening of completely healthy children (low risk) for synostosis is not warranted because of the high cost per QALY gained of the radiographic and 3D CT strategies. In healthy children with head deformity (intermediate risk), the radiographic strategy had a reasonable cost per QALY gained. Three-dimensional CT was more effective but had a high cost per QALY gained. In children with syndromic craniofacial disorders (high risk), 3D CT was the most effective strategy and had a reasonable cost per QALY gained.

1764,Cost effectiveness of aggressive care for patients with nontraumatic coma,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of aggressive care for patients with nontraumatic coma. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Five academic medical centers. PATIENTS: Patients with nontraumatic coma enrolled in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT). Patients with reversible metabolic causes of coma such as diabetic ketoacidosis or uremia were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: We calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of continuing aggressive care vs. withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and ventilatory support after day 3 of coma. We estimated life expectancy based on up to 4.6 yrs of follow-up. Utilities (quality-of-life weights) were estimated using time-tradeoff questions. Costs were based on hospital fiscal data and Medicare data. Separate analyses were conducted for two prognostic groups based on five risk factors assessed on day 3 of coma: age > or = 70 yrs, abnormal brainstem response, absent verbal response, absent withdrawal to pain, and serum creatinine > or = 132.6 micromol/L (1.5 mg/dL). RESULTS: For the 596 patients studied, the median (25th, 75th percentile) age was 67 yrs (range, 55-77), and 52% were female. By 2 months after enrollment, 69% had died, 19% were severely disabled, 7% had survived without severe disability, and 4% had survived with unknown functional status. The incremental cost effectiveness of the more aggressive care strategy was $140,000 (1998 dollars) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for high-risk patients (3-5 risk factors, 93% 2-month mortality) and $87,000/QALY for low-risk patients (0-2 risk factors, 49% mortality). In sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost per QALY did not fall below $50,000/QALY, even with wide variation in our baseline estimates.

1766,Functional benefits and cost/benefit analysis of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion for the management of severe spasticity,"OBJECT: Intrathecally delivered baclofen has been used as a treatment for severe spasticity since 1984. Despite this, there are uncertainties surrounding the benefits of treatment and the costs involved. The authors assessed the evidence of benefits and identified costs and the cost/benefit ratio for continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion in the treatment of severe spasticity. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to estimate the effect of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion on function and quality-of-life (QOL) measures in patients with severe spasticity. Outcomes were related to standard QOL scores to estimate potential gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Information on the costs of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion was obtained from hospitals in the United Kingdom. This information was combined to estimate the cost/benefit ratio for the use of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion in patients with different levels of disability from severe spasticity. Studies indicate that bedbound patients are likely to improve their mobility and become able to sit out of bed. Patients with severe spasm-related pain are likely to have major improvement or complete resolution of this pain. Many other benefits are also reported. Such benefits are related to costs per QALY in the range of 6,900 pounds to 12,800 pounds ($10,550-$19,570 US).

METHODS: We used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, a computer simulation of the U.S. population, to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness (in dollars per quality-adjusted years of life gained) of four strategies in patients over 35 years of age with coronary disease from 2003 to 2027: aspirin for all eligible patients (i.e., those who were not allergic to or intolerant of aspirin), aspirin for all eligible patients plus clopidogrel for patients who were ineligible for aspirin, clopidogrel for all patients, and the combination of aspirin for all eligible patients plus clopidogrel for all patients. RESULTS: The extension of aspirin therapy from the current levels of use to all eligible patients for 25 years would have an estimated cost-effectiveness ratio of about $11,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. The addition of clopidogrel for the 5 percent of patients who are ineligible for aspirin would cost about $31,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. Clopidogrel alone in all patients or in routine combination with aspirin had an incremental cost of more than $130,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained and remained financially unattractive across a wide range of assumptions. However, clopidogrel alone or in combination with aspirin would cost less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained if its price were reduced by 70 to 82 percent, to $1.00 and $0.60 per day, respectively.

1774,Decision-analytic model and cost-effectiveness evaluation of postmastectomy radiation therapy in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients,"PURPOSE: To present a decision model that describes the clinical and economic outcomes of node-positive breast cancer with and without postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). METHODS: A Markov process was constructed to project the natural history of breast cancer following mastectomy in premenopausal node-positive women. Biannual hazards of local and distant recurrence without PMRT were derived from a large meta-analysis of adjuvant systemic therapy trials for breast cancer. The addition of PMRT reduced the risk of disease relapse by an odds ratio of 0.69. Costs of PMRT ($11,600) and recurrent breast cancer ($4,250 to 16,200/year) were estimated from available literature. The model projected number of recurrences, relapse-free and overall survival, and costs to 15 years, using a discount rate of 3%. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated per incremental year of life and quality-adjusted year of life gained. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of results to clinical and economic assumptions. RESULTS: The model projected 15-year relapse-free survival of 52% and 43% with and without PMRT, respectively. Overall survival was increased from 48% to 55% with PMRT, resulting in an incremental 0.29 years of life gained per subject. PMRT increased 15-year costs from $40,800 to $48,100. Cost per year of life gained was $24,900, or $22,600 when survival was adjusted for quality of life. Results of the model were relatively sensitive to radiation therapy cost and breast cancer relapse risk. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that PMRT offers substantial clinical benefits achieved in a cost-effective manner, with an average cost per year of life gained of $24,900.

1775,Deciding on anticoagulating the oldest old with atrial fibrillation: insights from cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To better understand the tradeoffs between the efficacy of anticoagulation with warfarin and its side effects in the oldest old with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF). DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Published literature, including meta-analyses when available, and web-based sources. PARTICIPANTS: Those aged 65 to 100 with AF. INTERVENTION: Anticoagulation with warfarin. MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life expectancy and cost. RESULTS: Anticoagulation is not effective in persons with AF who do not have other risk factors, even in the oldest old. The best argument for its use (prolongation of life at an acceptable cost) can be made in those at major risk for stroke because of previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but poor quality of life before anticoagulation and comorbidities that carry their own risks of dying diminish benefits. The decision to anticoagulate the oldest old with AF must take into consideration the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and of death from hemorrhagic stroke that existed before anticoagulation, the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke and of death from hemorrhagic stroke while anticoagulated, and the efficacy of anticoagulation. Cost-effectiveness is also influenced by the cost of warfarin, the risk of major extracranial bleeding, the risk (natural and anticoagulated) of death from hemorrhagic stroke, the rate of ischemic stroke, the cost of major extracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes, the cost of nursing home care, and the fraction of patients with stroke who need nursing home care. CONCLUSION: There is no compelling evidence to date that anticoagulation prolongs quality-adjusted life expectancy in the oldest old with nonrheumatic AF. More studies that better estimate the risk of intracranial bleeding with and without anticoagulation in the oldest old are needed before recommendations can be made.

1777,Why insurers should reimburse for compression stockings in patients with chronic venous stasis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic venous stasis ulcers produce substantial morbidity rates and result in a significant expense to society. Fortunately, compression stockings (CS) have been found to reduce the rate of recurrence in patients with previous ulceration. Surprisingly, Medicare and other insurers do not reimburse the expense associated with CS or with patient education (Ed), which is essential to ensure compliance. METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was used for analysis of the cost-effectiveness of a strategy of reimbursement for CS and Ed (prophylaxis) versus one that does not supply these resources in a 55-year-old patient with prior venous stasis ulceration. The mean time to ulcer recurrence (53 months with CS+Ed; 18.7 months without prophylaxis), the mean time for ulcer healing (4.6 months), the probabilities of hospitalization (12%) and amputation (0.4%) after the development of an ulcer, and quality-adjustment factors (0.80 during ulcer treatment) were derived from the literature. The cost of CS ($300/year) and Ed ($93 for initial evaluation; $58/year; $40/recurrence) and the medical cost of ulcer treatment (average cost, $1621/recurrence) were calculated from our hospital cost accounting system. RESULTS: A strategy of CS and Ed was cost saving, with 0.37 quality-adjusted life years and $5904 saved, compared with a strategy that does not provide these resources. The inclusion of loss of revenue related to absence from work in the analysis increased cost savings to $17,080 during the patient""s lifetime. With sensitivity analysis, CS and Ed remained cost-effective (lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life year saved, <$60,000) if amputations and the cost of ulcer treatment were eliminated or if the cost of prophylaxis was increased to 600% of the base-case. The mean time to recurrence in patients with CS and Ed needed to be reduced from 53 months to 21.1 months before this strategy was no longer cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic CS and Ed in patients with prior venous stasis ulceration are cost saving, even with the most conservative of assumptions.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of intensive glycemic control (relative to conventional control), intensified hypertension control, and reduction in serum cholesterol level for patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a hypothetical cohort of individuals living in the United States, aged 25 years or older, who were newly diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes. The results of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and other studies were used to create a model of disease progression and treatment patterns.

RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for intensive glycemic control is $41 384 per QALY; this ratio increased with age at diagnosis from $9614 per QALY for patients aged 25 to 34 years to $2.1 million for patients aged 85 to 94 years. For intensified hypertension control the cost-effectiveness ratio is -$1959 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratio for reduction in serum cholesterol level is $51 889 per QALY; this ratio varied by age at diagnosis and is lowest for patients diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 84 years. CONCLUSIONS: Intensified hypertension control reduces costs and improves health outcomes relative to moderate hypertension control. Intensive glycemic control and reduction in serum cholesterol level increase costs and improve health outcomes. The cost-effectiveness ratios for these 2 interventions are comparable with those of several other frequently adopted health care interventions.",2002-01-01032,12020335,JAMA,Group Author,2002,287 / 19,2542-51,No,12020335,"Group Author; Cost-effectiveness of intensive glycemic control, intensified hypertension control, and serum cholesterol level reduction for type 2 diabetes, JAMA, 2002-May-15; 287(19):1538-3598; 2542-51",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with pravastatin vs. Standard treatment to control serum cholesterol level,Not Stated,Not Stated,25 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,51889,United States,1997,83672.55
1781,Will genetic testing alter the management of disease caused by infectious agents? A cost-effectiveness analysis of gene-testing strategies for prevention of rheumatic Fever,"Cost-effectiveness analysis was done to evaluate the potential health and economic effects of a genetic screening program to identify individuals at risk for rheumatic fever (RF). The current RF prevention strategy was compared with a new, primary prevention strategy involving early genetic testing and intensive prophylaxis to prevent a first attack among individuals at high risk for RF. When analysis of a hypothetical 2000 birth cohort was done from a societal perspective, the prevention strategy involving genetic screening and prophylaxis for high-risk persons reduced the number of RF cases and increased life span at an estimated discounted cost of $7900 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Genetic screening became the preferred (least expensive) strategy if the test specificity was >/=98%, the annual cost of prophylaxis was <$550, or the annual cost of caring for an individual with severe rheumatic heart disease increased to >$32,000. When used with available antibiotic prophylaxis, genetic testing has the potential to provide a cost-effective strategy for the primary prevention of RF and its sequelae.",2002-01-01033,12015696,Clin Infect Dis,Charles H King,2002,34 / 11,1491-9,No,12015696,"Charles H King; Diana F Fischler; Richard D Gerkin; Will genetic testing alter the management of disease caused by infectious agents?

1782,Condom distribution: a cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the cost-effectiveness of a condom distribution programme. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis of a social marketing campaign in which over 33 million condoms were made freely available throughout Louisiana. Surveys among 275,000 African Americans showed that condom use increased by 30%. Based on the estimated cost of the intervention and costs of HIV/AIDS-associated medical treatment, we estimated the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and number of HIV infections averted by the programme. RESULTS: The programme was estimated to prevent 170 HIV infections and save 1909 QALYs. Over $33 million in medical care costs were estimated to be averted, resulting in cost savings. Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were quite stable over a range of estimates for the main parameters. Condom increases as small as 2.7% were still cost-saving. CONCLUSION: Condom distribution is a community-level HIV prevention intervention that has the potential to reach large segments of the general population, thereby averting significant numbers of HIV infections and associated medical costs.

1785,Biliary stents in malignant obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Obstructive jaundice frequently complicates pancreatic carcinoma and is associated with complications such as malabsorption, coagulopathy, progressive hepatocellular dysfunction, and cholangitis in addition to disabling pruritus, which greatly interferes with terminal patients"" quality of life. Endoscopic placement of biliary stents decreases the risk of these complications and is considered the procedure of choice for palliation for patients with unresectable tumors. We used decision analysis with Markov modeling to compare the cost-effectivenesses of plastic stents and metal stents in patients with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma. METHODS: A model of the natural history of unresectable pancreatic carcinoma was constructed using probabilities derived from the literature. Cost estimates were obtained from Medicare reimbursement rates and supplemented by the literature. Two strategies were evaluated: 1) initial endoscopic plastic stent placement and 2) initial endoscopic metal stent placement. We compared total costs and performed cost-effectiveness analysis in these strategies. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted life months. Sensitivity analyses were performed on selected variables. RESULTS: Our baseline analysis showed that initial plastic stent placement was associated with a total cost of $13,879/patient and 1.799 quality-adjusted life months. Initial placement of a metal stent cost $13,466/patient and conferred 1.832 quality-adjusted life months. Among the variables examined, expected patient survival was demonstrated by sensitivity analyses to have the most influence on the results of the model. CONCLUSION: Initial endoscopic placement of a metal stent is a cost-saving strategy compared to initial plastic stent placement, particularly in patients expected to survive longer than 6 months.",2002-01-01039,12003425,Am J Gastroenterol,Miguel R Arguedas,2002,97 / 4,898-904,No,12003425,"Miguel R Arguedas; Gustavo H Heudebert; Aaron A Stinnett; C Mel Wilcox; Biliary stents in malignant obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Am J Gastroenterol, 2002-Apr; 97(4):0002-9270; 898-904",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Initial endocopic placement of a metal billiary stent vs. Initial endocopic placement of a plastic billiary stent,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-154642.86,United States,1999,-240235.73
1786,Cost-effectiveness of alternative triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance,"CONTEXT: Every year approximately 2 million US women are diagnosed as having a cervical cytological result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). OBJECTIVE: To determine the most efficient and cost-effective management strategy for women in the United States diagnosed as having ASC-US. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical trials, prospective studies, and other published literature. A computer-based model was used to compare 4 management strategies for a cytological result of ASC-US: immediate colposcopy; human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, which includes colposcopy if high-risk HPV types are detected; repeat cytology, which includes follow-up cytology at 6 and 12 months and referral for colposcopy if a repeat abnormal result occurs; and reclassifying ASC-US as normal in which a cytological result of ASC-US is ignored. Reflex HPV DNA testing uses either residual liquid-based cytological specimens or samples co-collected at the time of the initial screening for conventional cytology. Another method, referred to as the 2-visit HPV DNA triage, requires a woman with an ASC-US result to return within 1 month to provide another speciman sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Years of life saved (YLS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The least costly strategy for biennial screening was to reclassify ASC-US as normal, resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 75% for conventional cytology and 84% for liquid-based cytology compared with no screening. The next least costly strategy was HPV DNA testing resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 86% for conventional cytology and 90% for liquid-based cytology, followed by immediate colposcopy with a reduction of 87% and 91%, respectively. Compared with reflex HPV DNA testing, a strategy of repeat cervical cytology or delayed HPV testing costs more but is less effective. When all strategies were compared simultaneously, varying frequency and type of cytological test, biennial (vs every 3 years) liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing had a cost of $174 200 per YLS. In a similar comparison, liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing conducted every 3 years (vs every 5 years) had a cost of $59 600 per YLS and was more effective and less costly than a strategy of conventional cytology incorporating repeat cytology or immediate colposcopy conducted biennially.

1792,Cost-effectiveness of alternative triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance,"CONTEXT: Every year approximately 2 million US women are diagnosed as having a cervical cytological result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). OBJECTIVE: To determine the most efficient and cost-effective management strategy for women in the United States diagnosed as having ASC-US. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical trials, prospective studies, and other published literature. A computer-based model was used to compare 4 management strategies for a cytological result of ASC-US: immediate colposcopy; human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, which includes colposcopy if high-risk HPV types are detected; repeat cytology, which includes follow-up cytology at 6 and 12 months and referral for colposcopy if a repeat abnormal result occurs; and reclassifying ASC-US as normal in which a cytological result of ASC-US is ignored. Reflex HPV DNA testing uses either residual liquid-based cytological specimens or samples co-collected at the time of the initial screening for conventional cytology. Another method, referred to as the 2-visit HPV DNA triage, requires a woman with an ASC-US result to return within 1 month to provide another speciman sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Years of life saved (YLS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The least costly strategy for biennial screening was to reclassify ASC-US as normal, resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 75% for conventional cytology and 84% for liquid-based cytology compared with no screening. The next least costly strategy was HPV DNA testing resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 86% for conventional cytology and 90% for liquid-based cytology, followed by immediate colposcopy with a reduction of 87% and 91%, respectively. Compared with reflex HPV DNA testing, a strategy of repeat cervical cytology or delayed HPV testing costs more but is less effective.

1797,Benefits and costs of using HPV testing to screen for cervical cancer,"CONTEXT: Despite quality assurance standards, Papanicolaou (Pap) test characteristics remain less than optimal. OBJECTIVE: To compare the societal costs and benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, Pap testing, and their combination to screen for cervical cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A simulation model of neoplasia natural history was used to estimate the societal costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with 18 different general population screening strategies: Pap plus HPV testing, Pap testing alone, and HPV testing alone every 2 or 3 years among hypothetical longitudinal cohorts of US women beginning at age 20 years and continuing to 65 years, 75 years, or death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved of each screening strategy. RESULTS: Maximal savings in lives were achieved by screening every 2 years until death with combined HPV and Pap testing at an incremental cost of $76 183 per QALY compared with Pap testing alone every 2 years. Stopping biennial screening with HPV and Pap testing at age 75 years captures 97.8% of the benefits of lifetime screening at a cost of $70 347 per QALY. Combined biennial HPV and Pap testing to age 65 years captures 86.6% of the benefits achievable by continuing to screen until age 75 years. Human papillomavirus screening alone was equally effective as Pap testing alone at any given screening interval or age of screening cessation but was more costly and therefore was dominated. In sensitivity analyses, HPV testing would be more effective and less costly than Pap testing at a cost threshold of $5 for an HPV test.
