16601,Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pilot study of prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy,"BACKGROUND: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is increasingly used prophylactically following surgery despite limited evidence of clinical or cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether NPWT is cost-effective compared to standard care, for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) in obese women undergoing elective caesarean section, and inform development of a larger trial. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a pilot randomised controlled trial at one Australian hospital, in which women were randomised to NPWT (n = 44) or standard care (n = 43). A public health care provider perspective and time horizon to four weeks post-discharge was adopted. Cost-effectiveness assessment was based on incremental cost per SSI prevented and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Patients receiving NPWT each received health care costing AU$5887 (+/-1038) and reported 0.069 (+/-0.010) QALYs compared to AU$5754 (+/-1484) and 0.066 (+/-0.010) QALYs for patients receiving standard care. NPWT may be slightly more costly and more effective than standard care, with estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of AU$1347 (95%CI dominant- $41,873) per SSI prevented and AU$42,340 (95%CI dominant- $884,019) per QALY gained. However, there was considerable uncertainty around these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: NPWT may be cost-effective in the prophylactic treatment of surgical wounds following elective caesarean section in obese women. Larger trials could clarify the cost-effectiveness of NPWT as a prophylactic treatment for SSI. Sensitive capture of QALYs and cost offsets will be important given the high level of uncertainty around the point estimate cost-effectiveness ratio which was close to conventional thresholds.

16602,Cost-effectiveness analysis of catch-up hepatitis A vaccination among unvaccinated/partially-vaccinated children,"BACKGROUND: Since 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended hepatitis A (HepA) vaccination routinely for children aged 12-23months to prevent hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. However, a substantial proportion of US children are unvaccinated and susceptible to infection. We present results of economic modeling to assess whether a one-time catch-up HepA vaccination recommendation would be cost-effective. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of HAV infection that followed a single cohort from birth through death (birth to age 95years). The model compared the health and economic outcomes from catch-up vaccination interventions for children at target ages from two through 17years vs. outcomes resulting from maintaining the current recommendation of routine vaccination at age one year with no catch-up intervention. RESULTS: Over the lifetime of the cohort, catch-up vaccination would reduce the total number of infections relative to the baseline by 741 while increasing doses of vaccine by 556,989. Catch-up vaccination would increase net costs by $10.2million, or $2.38 per person. The incremental cost of HepA vaccine catch-up intervention at age 10years, the midpoint of the ages modeled, was $452,239 per QALY gained. Across age-cohorts, the cost-effectiveness of catch-up vaccination is most favorable at age 12years, resulting in an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of $189,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low baseline of HAV disease incidence achieved by current vaccination recommendations, our economic model suggests that a catch-up vaccination recommendation would be less cost-effective than many other vaccine interventions, and that HepA catch-up vaccination would become cost effective at a threshold of $50,000 per QALY only when incidence of HAV rises about 5.0 cases per 100,000 population.",2016-01-22735,27317459,Vaccine,Abigail Hankin-Wei,2016,34 / 35,4243-9,Yes,27317459,"Abigail Hankin-Wei; David B Rein; Alfonso Hernandez-Romieu; Mallory J Kennedy; Lisa Bulkow; Eli Rosenberg; Monica Trigg; Noele P Nelson; Cost-effectiveness analysis of catch-up hepatitis A vaccination among unvaccinated/partially-vaccinated children, Vaccine, 2016 Jul 29; 34(35):1873-2518; 4243-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adding a one-time catch up HepA vaccination to the current routine vaccination (one vaccination at year one) vs. Standard/Usual Care- current recommendation of routine hepatitis A (HepA) vaccination at age one year with no catch-up intervention,Not Stated,17 Years,2 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,432159,United States,2015,471896.54
16603,Cost-effectiveness of precision medicine in the fourth-line treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma: An early decision analytic model of multiplex targeted sequencing,"OBJECTIVES: To identify parameters that drive the cost-effectiveness of precision medicine by comparing the use of multiplex targeted sequencing (MTS) to select targeted therapy based on tumour genomic profiles to either no further testing with chemotherapy or no further testing with best supportive care in the fourth-line treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A combined decision tree and Markov model to compare costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years over a ten-year time horizon from an Australian healthcare payer perspective. Data sources included the published literature and a population-based molecular cohort study (Cancer 2015). Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic sensitivity analyses and quantified by estimating expected value of perfect/partial perfect information. Uncertainty due to technological/scientific advancement was assessed through a number of plausible future scenario analyses. RESULTS: Point estimate incremental cost-effective ratios indicate that MTS is not cost-effective for selecting fourth-line treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Lower mortality rates during testing and for true positive patients, lower health state utility values for progressive disease, and targeted therapy resulting in reductions in inpatient visits, however, all resulted in more favourable cost-effectiveness estimates for MTS. The expected value to decision makers of removing all current decision uncertainty was estimated to be between AUD 5,962,843 and AUD 13,196,451, indicating that additional research to reduce uncertainty may be a worthwhile investment. Plausible future scenarios analyses revealed limited improvements in cost-effectiveness under scenarios of improved test performance, decreased costs of testing/interpretation, and no biopsy costs/adverse events. Reductions in off-label targeted therapy costs, when considered together with the other scenarios did, however, indicate more favourable cost-effectiveness of MTS.

16605,Comparative Effectiveness and Cost Effectiveness of a Multitarget Stool DNA Test to Screen for Colorectal Neoplasia,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed a model to determine whether a multitarget stool DNA (MT-sDNA) test that detects colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyps with higher sensitivity and lower specificity, but at a higher cost, than the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) can be used in screening. METHODS: We used a Markov model of average-risk CRC screening to compare the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening with the MT-sDNA test vs FIT or colonoscopy. We accounted for the complex longitudinal participation patterns observed in organized programs vs opportunistic screening, as well as organized programs'' patient support costs and differential payment rates by commercial insurers vs Medicare. RESULTS: With optimal adherence, yearly FIT and colonoscopy every 10 years were dominant (more effective and less costly) than MT-sDNA every 3 years. Compared with successful organized FIT programs (50% consistent and 27% intermittent participation; patient support costs, $153/cycle), the patient support program for the MT-sDNA test would need 68% of subjects to participate consistently and 32% to participate intermittently every 3 years, or the MT-sDNA test would need to cost 60% less than in the base case ($260 commercial payment and $197 Medicare payment), for the MT-sDNA test to be preferred over FIT at a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with opportunistic yearly FIT screening (15% consistent and 30% intermittent participation), performing the MT-sDNA test every 3 years would cost less than $100,000 per QALY gained if the MT-sDNA test achieved a participation rate more than 1.7-fold that of FIT. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Assuming equal participation across strategies and a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained, FIT was preferred in 99.3% of iterations in Monte Carlo simulation. CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model, we found FIT and colonoscopy to be more effective and less costly than the MT-sDNA test when participation rates were equal for all strategies.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a Markov decision model to estimate lifetime quality-adjusted survival, costs, and cost effectiveness of LAA closure with Watchman, compared directly with warfarin and indirectly with dabigatran, using data from the long-term (mean 3.8 year) follow-up of Percutaneous Closure of the Left Atrial Appendage Versus Warfarin Therapy for Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) and Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PREVAIL) randomized trials. Using data from PROTECT AF, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with warfarin and dabigatran were $20 486 and $23 422 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Using data from PREVAIL, LAA closure was dominated by warfarin and dabigatran, meaning that it was less effective (8.44, 8.54, and 8.59 quality-adjusted life years, respectively) and more costly. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year, LAA closure was cost effective 90% and 9% of the time under PROTECT AF and PREVAIL assumptions, respectively. These results were sensitive to the rates of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage for LAA closure and medical anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Using data from the PROTECT AF trial, LAA closure with the Watchman device was cost effective; using PREVAIL trial data, Watchman was more costly and less effective than warfarin and dabigatran.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic impact of older age (65 years of age and older), using a cost-utility analysis, in the context of acute surgical management and rehabilitation of traumatic cervical SCI, given the paucity of economic studies involving elderly individuals with SCI. METHODS: The cost-utility analysis was performed from the perspective of a public health care insurer. A time horizon of 6 months from SCI onset was used. Costs were estimated in 2014 US dollars. Utilities were generated from the Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury study. RESULTS: The baseline analysis indicated that surgical and rehabilitative management of acute cervical SCI in the elderly (n = 17) is costlier, but similarly effective, than that in younger adults (n = 47). When considering acute spinal surgical management and rehabilitation of younger adults with SCI as the baseline, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis revealed an additional cost of $5 655 557 per quality-adjusted life-year gained when managing elderly patients with traumatic cervical SCI. The probabilistic analysis confirmed that spinal surgery in the elderly is costlier, but similarly effective, in younger adults after SCI, even though there is no definitive dominance. CONCLUSION: This economic analysis indicates that surgical management and rehabilitation of acute traumatic cervical SCI in the elderly are costlier but similarly effective compared with younger adults with similar impairment.

Method.: The Dutch Early Detection and Intervention randomized controlled trial was used, comparing routine care (RC; n = 101) with routine care plus CBT for UHR (here called CBTuhr; n = 95). A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted with treatment response (defined as proportion of averted transitions to psychosis) as an outcome and a cost-utility analysis with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as a secondary outcome. Results.: The proportion of averted transitions to psychosis was significantly higher in the CBTuhr condition (with a risk difference of 0.122; b = 1.324, SEb = 0.017, z = 7.99, P < 0.001). CBTuhr showed an 83% probability of being more effective and less costly than RC by -US$ 5777 (savings) per participant. In addition, over the 4-year follow-up period, cumulative QALY health gains were marginally (but not significantly) higher in CBTuhr than for RC (2.63 vs. 2.46) and the CBTuhr intervention had a 75% probability of being the superior treatment (more QALY gains at lower costs) and a 92% probability of being cost-effective compared with RC at the Dutch threshold value (US$ 24 560; euro20 000 per QALY). Conclusions.: Add-on preventive CBTuhr had a high likelihood (83%) of resulting in more averted transitions to psychosis and lower costs as compared with RC.

16623,Cost-Effectiveness of Group and Internet Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Adolescents: Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate cost-effectiveness of adolescent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) in group- and Internet-delivered formats, from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 1 y. METHODS: Costs and effects data up to 1-y follow-up were obtained from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Internet CBTI to face-to-face group CBTI. The study was conducted at the laboratory of the Research Institute of Child Development and Education at the University of Amsterdam, and the academic youth mental health care center UvAMinds in Amsterdam. Sixty-two participants meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria for insomnia were randomized to face-to-face group CBTI (GT; n = 31, age = 15.6 y +/- 1.8, 71.0% girls) or individual Internet CBTI (IT; n = 31, age = 15.4 y +/- 1.5, 83.9% girls). The intervention consisted of six weekly sessions and a 2-mo follow up booster-session of CBTI, consisting of psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, restriction of time in bed, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relaxation techniques. GT sessions were held in groups of six to eight adolescents guided by two trained sleep therapists. IT consisted of individual Internet therapy with preprogrammed content similar to GT, and guided by trained sleep therapists. RESULTS: Outcome measures were subjective sleep efficiency (SE) >/= 85%, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Analyses were conducted from a societal perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using bootstrap sampling, and presented in cost-effectiveness planes. Primary analysis showed costs over 1 y were higher for GT but effects were similar for IT and GT. Bootstrapped ICERs demonstrated there is a high probability of IT being cost-effective compared to GT. Secondary analyses confirmed robustness of results. CONCLUSIONS: Internet CBTI is a cost-effective treatment compared to group CBTI for adolescents, although effects were largely similar for both formats. Further studies in a clinical setting are warranted.

16624,Individualized Physical Therapy Is Cost-Effective Compared With Guideline-Based Advice for People With Low Back Disorders,"STUDY DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis within a randomized controlled trial was conducted from the health care perspective. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether individualized physical therapy incorporating advice is cost-effective relative to guideline-based advice alone for people with low back pain and/or referred leg pain (>/=6 weeks, </=6 months duration of symptoms). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Low back disorders are a burdensome and costly condition across the world. Cost-effective treatments are needed to address the global burden attributable to this condition. METHODS: Three hundred participants were randomly allocated to receive either two sessions of guideline-based advice alone (n = 144), or 10 sessions of individualized physical therapy targeting pathoanatomical, psychosocial and neurophysiological factors, and incorporating advice (n = 156). Data relating to health care costs, health benefits (EuroQol-5D) and work absence were obtained from participants via questionnaires at 5, 10, 26, and 52-week follow-ups. RESULTS: Total health care costs were similar for both groups: mean difference $27.03 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): -200.29 to 254.35]. Health benefits across the 12-month follow-up were significantly greater with individualized physical therapy: incremental quality-adjusted life years = 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.10). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $422 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The probability that individualized physical therapy was cost-effective reached 90% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $36,000. A saving of $1995.51 (95% CI: 143.98-3847.03) per worker in income was realized in the individualized physical therapy group relative to the advice group. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses all revealed a dominant position for individualized physical therapy; hence, the base case analysis was the most conservative. CONCLUSION: Ten sessions of individualized physical therapy incorporating advice is cost-effective compared with two sessions of guideline-based advice alone for people with low back disorders.

16625,Long-Term Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Metformin Combined with Liraglutide or Exenatide for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Based on the CORE Diabetes Model Study,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with beta cell impairment. Agonists of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor (such as liraglutide and exenatide) can increase the number of pancreatic beta cells and improve cell function. These drugs contribute to the long-term control of T2DM. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of metformin combined with liraglutide or exenatide in Chinese patient with T2DM. METHODS: Patients with T2DM from the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University were treated with oral metformin combined with liraglutide (0.6 mg/day, could be increased by 0.6 mg weekly until 1.2 or 1.8 mg) or exenatide (5 mug bid for four weeks, increased to 10 mug bid). The computer simulation model CORE was used to calculate the 30-year expected life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), direct costs, HbA1c levels, body mass index (BMI), and the incidence of cardiovascular, renal, and ocular complications of T2DM. Patients were followed up for 52 weeks. Medication costs were calculated according to retail prices in China. A 3% annual discount was adopted in this study. RESULTS: The 30-year simulation showed that the total direct medical costs were lower using liraglutide compared to exenatide by 2130 RMB/QALY yearly, while the expected life expectancy and QALY were increased by 0.471 years and 0.388, respectively, using liraglutide with an incremental cost-effectiveness of -11,550 RMB/QALYs.

16626,"Cost Effectiveness of Eplerenone for the Treatment of Systolic Heart Failure with Mild Symptoms in Alberta, Canada","BACKGROUND: Eplerenone has been demonstrated as being cost effective for the treatment of patients with systolic heart failure (HF) and mild symptoms in several jurisdictions; however, its cost effectiveness is unknown in the context of Alberta, Canada. METHODS: We used a discrete-event simulation model to compare costs and outcomes between standard care and standard care plus eplerenone for the treatment of HF with mild symptoms. We used Alberta data (whenever possible) together with a healthcare perspective, a lifetime horizon, and 3 % annual discount rate for analyses. RESULTS: Clinically, eplerenone prevented HF hospitalizations, atrial fibrillations, and cardiovascular (CV) deaths, but incurred more adverse events and device implantations than standard care. The remaining life of patients receiving eplerenone was 7.08 versus 5.83 years for those receiving standard care. Eplerenone gained 1.25 life-years and 1.18 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with an incremental cost of $Can7200. Therefore, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $Can5700 per life-year gained and $Can6100 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Given the most cited ICER threshold is $Can50,000, the use of eplerenone as an adjunct to standard care for treating patients with systolic HF and mild symptoms is cost effective in the context of Alberta. Eplerenone would cost the Alberta health system about $Can4.6 million a year in drug costs. Incorporating reductions in health services utilization associated with eplerenone, the budget impact is smaller. For the first year, the use of eplerenone is cost saving and for 5 years the cost is approximately $Can6 million.",2016-01-22762,27300508,Am J Cardiovasc Drugs,Nguyen X Thanh,2016,16 / 5,365-76,No,27300508,"Nguyen X Thanh; Justin A Ezekowitz; Dat T Tran; Padma Kaul; Cost Effectiveness of Eplerenone for the Treatment of Systolic Heart Failure with Mild Symptoms in Alberta, Canada, Am J Cardiovasc Drugs, 2016 Oct; 16(5):1175-3277; 365-76",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eplerenone as an adjunct to standard care vs. Standard/Usual Care,Systolic Heart Failure with Mild Symptoms,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,6091,Canada,2014,6032.73
16627,"Novel Three-Day, Community-Based, Nonpharmacological Group Intervention for Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain (COPERS): A Randomised Clinical Trial","BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for chronic pain is often limited, and there is growing concern about the adverse effects of these treatments, including opioid dependence. Nonpharmacological approaches to chronic pain may be an attractive alternative or adjunctive treatment. We describe the effectiveness of a novel, theoretically based group pain management support intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) trial across 27 general practices and community musculoskeletal services in the UK. We recruited 703 adults with musculoskeletal pain of at least 3 mo duration between August 1, 2011, and July 31, 2012, and randomised participants 1.33:1 to intervention (403) or control (300). Intervention participants were offered a participative group intervention (COPERS) delivered over three alternate days with a follow-up session at 2 wk. The intervention introduced cognitive behavioural approaches and was designed to promote self-efficacy to manage chronic pain. Controls received usual care and a relaxation CD. The primary outcome was pain-related disability at 12 mo (Chronic Pain Grade [CPG] disability subscale); secondary outcomes included the CPG disability subscale at 6 mo and the following measured at 6 and 12 mo: anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), pain acceptance (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire), social integration (Health Education Impact Questionnaire social integration and support subscale), pain-related self-efficacy (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), pain intensity (CPG pain intensity subscale), the census global health question (2011 census for England and Wales), health utility (EQ-5D-3L), and health care resource use. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle, accounted for clustering by course in the intervention arm, and used multiple imputation for missing or incomplete primary outcome data. The mean age of participants was 59.9 y, with 81% white, 67% female, 23% employed, 85% with pain for at least 3 y, and 23% on strong opioids. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were common (baseline mean HADS scores 7.4 [standard deviation 4.1] and 9.2 [4.6], respectively). Overall, 282 (70%) intervention participants met the predefined intervention adherence criterion. Primary outcome data were obtained from 88% of participants. There was no significant difference between groups in pain-related disability at 6 or 12 mo (12 mo: difference -1.0, intervention versus control, 95% CI -4.9 to 3.0), pain intensity, or the census global health question. Anxiety, depression, pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, and social integration were better in the intervention group at 6 mo; at 12 mo, these differences remained statistically significant only for depression (-0.7, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.2) and social integration (0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.2). Intervention participants received more analgesics than the controls across the 12 mo. The total cost of the course per person was pound145 (US$214). The cost-utility analysis showed there to be a small benefit in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.0325, 95% CI -0.0074 to 0.0724), and on the cost side the intervention was a little more expensive than usual care (i.e., pound188 [US$277], 95% CI - pound125 [-US$184] to pound501 [US$738]), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound5,786 (US$8,521) per QALY. Limitations include the fact that the intervention was relatively brief and did not include any physical activity components. CONCLUSIONS: While the COPERS intervention was brief, safe, and inexpensive, with a low attrition rate, it was not effective for reducing pain-related disability over 12 mo (primary outcome). For secondary outcomes, we found sustained benefits on depression and social integration at 6 and 12 mo, but there was no effect on anxiety, pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, pain intensity, or the census global health question at 12 mo. There was some evidence that the intervention may be cost-effective based on a modest difference in QALYs between groups.

METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation was conducted for lifetime with a hypothetical cohort of postmenopausal women with osteopenia and without prior fractures. They were assumed to receive calcium/vitamin D supplements only or drug therapy (i.e., raloxifene or risedronate) along with calcium/vitamin D for 5 years. The Markov model includes fracture-specific and non-fracture specific health states (i.e. breast cancer and venous thromboembolism), and all-cause death.

Local data were used to estimate the baseline incidence rates of fracture in those with osteopenia and the costs associated with each health state. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the base cases that had T-scores between -2.0 and -2.4 and began drug therapy at the age of 55, 60, or 65 years were $16,472, $6,741, and -$13,982 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses for medication compliance, risk of death following vertebral fracture, and relaxing definition of osteopenia resulted in ICERs reached to $24,227 per QALY gained.

16631,A five-year model to assess the early cost-effectiveness of new diagnostic tests in the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of information about the sensitivity, specificity and costs new diagnostic tests should have to improve early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our objective was to explore the early cost-effectiveness of various new diagnostic test strategies in the workup of patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) at risk of having RA. METHODS: A decision tree followed by a patient-level state transition model, using data from published literature, cohorts and trials, was used to evaluate diagnostic test strategies. Alternative tests were assessed as add-on to or replacement of the ACR/EULAR 2010 RA classification criteria for all patients and for intermediate-risk patients. Tests included B-cell gene expression (sensitivity 0.60, specificity 0.90, costs euro150), MRI (sensitivity 0.90, specificity 0.60, costs euro756), IL-6 serum level (sensitivity 0.70, specificity 0.53, costs euro50) and genetic assay (sensitivity 0.40, specificity 0.85, costs euro750). Patients with IA at risk of RA were followed for 5 years using a societal perspective.

The outcome was expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (euro2014 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) and headroom. RESULTS: The B-cell test was the least expensive strategy when used as an add-on and as replacement in intermediate-risk patients, making it the dominant strategy, as it has better health outcomes and lower costs. As add-on for all patients, the B-cell test was also the most cost-effective test strategy.

When performing univariate sensitivity analysis for intermediate-risk patients, specificity and DAS28 in the B-cell add-on strategy, and DAS28 and sensitivity in the MRI add-on strategy had the largest impact on the cost-effectiveness.

16635,Diagnostic Imaging Strategies for Occult Hip Fractures: A Decision and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Hip fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. Determining the optimal diagnostic strategy for the subset of patients with potential occult hip fracture remains challenging. We determined the most cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of occult hip fractures from the choices of performing only computed tomography (CT), performing only magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performing CT and if negative performing MRI (MRI-selective strategy) or discharging the patient without advanced imaging. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare outcomes and costs of different diagnostic strategies for the diagnosis of an occult hip fracture from a societal perspective. Model inputs were derived from charge data, Medicare reimbursements, and the literature. Strategies with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were considered cost-effective. We tested the robustness of our results using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Compared to a CT strategy, MRI provides an additional 0.05 QALY at an incremental cost of $1,227 and ICER of $25,438/QALY. For facilities without MRI capability, if the cost of transfer is below $1,228, transferring the patient to a MRI-capable facility is the most cost-effective strategy. Above this cost, employing a CT and if negative transfer to a MRI-capable facility strategy was more cost-effective. When the cost of a transfer reached more than $4,039, it became more cost-effective to only obtain a CT. CONCLUSION: MRI is a cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of an occult hip fracture.

16637,Cost-effectiveness of edoxaban versus rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in the US,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the value of new anticoagulation therapies compared with existing therapies is of paramount importance in today''s cost-conscious and efficiency-driven health care environment. Edoxaban and rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with CHADS2 scores >/=2 have been evaluated in pivotal trials versus warfarin. The relative value of edoxaban versus rivaroxaban would be of interest to health care stakeholders and patients who prefer a once-daily treatment option for long-term stroke prevention in NVAF. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of two once-daily regimens of novel oral anticoagulation therapy - edoxaban (60 mg/30 mg dose-reduced) versus rivaroxaban (20 mg/15 mg dose-reduced) - for stroke prevention in NVAF patients from a US health-plan perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model simulated lifetime risk and treatment of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death in NVAF patients treated with edoxaban or rivaroxaban. Efficacy and safety data were derived from a network meta-analysis that utilized data from patients enrolled in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and ROCKET-AF. Health care cost and utility data were obtained from published sources. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of <US$50,000, $50,000-$150,000, and >$150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were used as thresholds for ""highly cost-effective"", ""cost-effective"", and ""not cost-effective"" treatment options, respectively, as per American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. RESULTS: Edoxaban was dominant relative to rivaroxaban, such that it was associated with lower total health care costs and better effectiveness in terms of QALYs in the base-case analysis. Results were supported by probabilistic sensitivity analyses that showed edoxaban as either dominant or a highly cost-effective alternative (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000) to rivaroxaban in 88.4% of 10,000 simulations. CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that the once-daily edoxaban (60 mg/30 mg dose-reduced) regimen is a cost-saving or highly cost-effective treatment relative to rivaroxaban (20 mg/15 mg dose-reduced) for stroke prevention in NVAF patients with CHADS2 >/=2.",2016-01-22787,27284259,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Jeffrey D Miller,2016,8 /,215-26,No,27284259,"Jeffrey D Miller; Xin Ye; Gregory M Lenhart; Amanda M Farr; Oth V Tran; W Jackie Kwong; Elizabeth A Magnuson; William S Weintraub; Cost-effectiveness of edoxaban versus rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in the US, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2016; 8():1178-6981; 215-26",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Edoxaban vs. Rivaroxaban,"Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients, high risk of stroke",72 Years,72 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-67434.75,United States,2014,-73722.86

A recent randomized clinical trial comparing anti-VEGF agents for patients with decreased vision from DME found that at 1 year aflibercept (2.0 mg) achieved better visual outcomes than repackaged (compounded) bevacizumab (1.25 mg) or ranibizumab (0.3 mg); the worse the starting vision, the greater the treatment benefit with aflibercept. However, aflibercept and ranibizumab, respectively, are approximately 31 and 20 times more expensive than bevacizumab. OBJECTIVE: To examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab for the treatment of DME. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Post hoc analysis of efficacy, safety, and resource utilization data at 1-year follow-up from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Comparative Effectiveness Trial. Patients were enrolled from August 22, 2012, through August 28, 2013, and analysis was performed from August 21, 2014, through November 7, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The ICERs for all trial participants and subgroups with baseline vision of approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 to 20/40 (better vision) and baseline vision of approximate Snellen equivalent 20/50 or worse (worse vision). One-year trial data were used to calculate cost-effectiveness for 1 year for the 3 anti-VEGF agents; mathematical modeling was then used to project 10-year cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: The study included 624 participants (mean [SD] age, 60.6 [10.5] years; 45.7% female; 65.5% white), 209 in the aflibercept group, 207 in the bevacizumab group, and 208 in the ranibizumab group. For all participants, during 1 year, the ICERs of aflibercept and ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab were $1110000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $1730000 per QALY, respectively. During 10 years, they were $349000 per QALY and $603000 per QALY, respectively. Compared with ranibizumab, aflibercept''s ICER was $648000 per QALY at 1 year and $203000 per QALY at 10 years. For the subgroup with worse baseline vision, the 10-year ICERs of aflibercept and ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab were $287000 per QALY and $817000 per QALY, respectively. In eyes with decreased vision from DME, treatment costs of aflibercept and ranibizumab would need to decrease by 69% and 80%, respectively, to reach a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100000 per QALY compared with bevacizumab during a 10-year horizon; for the subgroup with worse baseline vision, the costs would need to decrease by 62% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Aflibercept (2.0 mg) and ranibizumab (0.3 mg) are not cost-effective relative to bevacizumab for treatment of DME unless their prices decrease substantially.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The ICERs for all trial participants and subgroups with baseline vision of approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 to 20/40 (better vision) and baseline vision of approximate Snellen equivalent 20/50 or worse (worse vision). One-year trial data were used to calculate cost-effectiveness for 1 year for the 3 anti-VEGF agents; mathematical modeling was then used to project 10-year cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: The study included 624 participants (mean [SD] age, 60.6 [10.5] years; 45.7% female; 65.5% white), 209 in the aflibercept group, 207 in the bevacizumab group, and 208 in the ranibizumab group. For all participants, during 1 year, the ICERs of aflibercept and ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab were $1110000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $1730000 per QALY, respectively. During 10 years, they were $349000 per QALY and $603000 per QALY, respectively. Compared with ranibizumab, aflibercept''s ICER was $648000 per QALY at 1 year and $203000 per QALY at 10 years. For the subgroup with worse baseline vision, the 10-year ICERs of aflibercept and ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab were $287000 per QALY and $817000 per QALY, respectively. In eyes with decreased vision from DME, treatment costs of aflibercept and ranibizumab would need to decrease by 69% and 80%, respectively, to reach a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100000 per QALY compared with bevacizumab during a 10-year horizon; for the subgroup with worse baseline vision, the costs would need to decrease by 62% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Aflibercept (2.0 mg) and ranibizumab (0.3 mg) are not cost-effective relative to bevacizumab for treatment of DME unless their prices decrease substantially. These results highlight the challenges that physicians, patients, and policymakers face when safety and efficacy results are at odds with cost-effectiveness results.",2016-01-22793,27280850,JAMA Ophthalmol,Eric L Ross,2016,134 / 8,888-96,No,27280850,"Eric L Ross; David W Hutton; Joshua D Stein; Neil M Bressler; Lee M Jampol; Adam R Glassman; Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Re; Cost-effectiveness of Aflibercept, Bevacizumab, and Ranibizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema Treatment: Analysis From the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Comparative Effectiveness Trial, JAMA Ophthalmol, 2016 Aug 01; 134(8):2168-6173; 888-96",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aflibercept vs. Ranibizumab,Patients with one study eye with visual acuity (Snellen equivalent) of 20/32 to 20/320 attributable to diabetic macular edema,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"10 Years, 1 year",3.00,3.00,203000,United States,2015,221666.1

METHODS: It was a Single-center, parallel-group, randomized, clinical trial (Trial Registration: NCT01889095). One hundred and seventy four T2DM patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c >/= 8 % (63.9 mmol/mol)) were randomly assigned to trial arms (BIAsp 30 and NPH/Reg) and were followed up for 48 weeks. BIAsp 30 was started at an initial dose of 0.2-0.6 IU/Kg in two divided doses and was titrated according to the glycemic status of the patient. Similarly, NPH/Reg insulin was initiated at a dose of 0.2-0.6 IU/Kg with a 2:1 ratio and was subsequently titrated. Level of glycemic control, hypoglycemic events, direct and indirect costs, quality adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio have been assessed. RESULTS: HbA1c, Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and two-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) were improved in both groups during the study (P < 0.05 for all analyses). Lower frequencies of minor, major, and nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes were observed with BIAsp 30 (P < 0.05). Additionally, BIAsp 30 was associated with less weight gain and also higher QALYs (P < 0.05). Total medical and non-medical costs were significantly lower with BIAsp 30 as compared with NPH/Reg (930.55 +/- 81.43 USD vs. 1101.24 +/- 165.49 USD, P = 0.004). Moreover, BIAsp 30 showed lower ICER as a dominant alternative. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being more expensive, BIAsp 30 offers the same glycemic control as to NPH/Reg dose-dependently and also appears to cause fewer hypoglycemic events and to be more cost-effective in Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes.",2016-01-22796,27278922,BMC Endocr Disord,Amir Farshchi,2016,16 / 1,35,No,27278922,"Amir Farshchi; Rokhsareh Aghili; Maryam Oskuee; Marjan Rashed; Sina Noshad; Abbas Kebriaeezadeh; Maryam Kia; Alireza Esteghamati; Biphasic insulin Aspart 30 vs. NPH plus regular human insulin in type 2 diabetes patients; a cost-effectiveness study, BMC Endocr Disord, 2016; 16(1):1472-6823; 35",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biphasic insulin Aspart 30 vs. Standard/Usual Care- NPH plus regular human insulin,Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with HbA1c > 80% despite oral glucose lowering drugs and lifestyle modification,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,48 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2133.63,United States,2012,-2405.14
16642,Will Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir (Harvoni) Be Cost-Effective and Affordable for Chinese Patients Infected with Hepatitis C Virus? An Economic Analysis Using Real-World Data,"BACKGROUND: Little is known on the cost-effectiveness of novel regimens for hepatitis C virus (HCV) compared with standard-of-care with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy in developing countries. We evaluated cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for 12 weeks compared with a 48-week pegIFN-RBV regimen in Chinese patients with genotype 1b HCV infection by economic regions. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was developed to estimate quality-adjusted-life-years, lifetime cost of HCV infection and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). SVR rates and direct medical costs were obtained from real-world data. Parameter uncertainty was assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Threshold analysis was conducted to estimate the price which can make the regimen cost-effective and affordable. RESULTS: Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir was cost-effective in treatment-experienced patients with an ICER of US$21,612. It varied by economic regions. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 18% and 47% for treatment-naive and experienced patients, and it ranged from 15% in treatment-naive patients in Central-China to 64% in treatment-experienced patients in Eastern-China. The price of 12-week sofosbuvir/ledipasvir treatment needs to be reduced by at least 81% to US$18,185 to make the regimen cost-effective in all patients at WTP of one time GDP per capita.

16649,A cost-effectiveness analysis of over-the-counter statins,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the costs and benefits of over-the-counter (OTC) statins under the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: A 10-year cost-effectiveness model using a health system perspective was developed to analyze the impact of making an OTC statin drug available. METHODS: We calibrated the model by using nationally representative survey data on statin use and cardiovascular risk, data from clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of statins, and data from a study on consumer decisions to use an OTC statin. RESULTS: We estimated that OTC statins would result in 252,359 fewer major coronary events, 41,133 fewer strokes, and 135,299 fewer coronary revascularization procedures over 10 years, as well as reduce coronary heart disease- and stroke-related deaths by 68,534 over the same time frame. These averted events would save more than $10.8 billion in healthcare costs while the costs of drug therapy would increase by $28.3 billion. Increased statin utilization is estimated to cause 3864 more cases of rhabdomyolysis-a very rare but severe side effect of statins. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of OTC statins was $5667 per quality-adjusted life-year, and the 95% CI of the ICER was $1384 to $12,701.

16656,Cost-effectiveness of doxorubicin-eluting beads versus conventional trans-arterial chemo-embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin-loaded drug-eluting beads TACE (DEB-TACE) has been developed to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of conventional trans-catheter arterial chemo-embolization (cTACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, its cost-effectiveness (CE) still needs to be assessed. AIMS: To investigate the CE of DEB-TACE versus cTACE. METHODS: Results from a meta-analysis of the pertinent literature were used to construct a CE Markov simulation model which followed a hypothetical cohort of HCC patients who underwent DEB-TACE or cTACE, covering the entire post-TACE lifespan until death. Costs were assessed from the health-care provider perspective. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 11 observational studies, including 1860 patients (883 DEB-TACE and 977 cTACE), were used for the construction of the model. Considering only survival rates from RCTs (heterogeneity: 0%), DEB-TACE returned 4.0 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and TACE returned 3.3 QALYs (effect size=1.288). Total costs of cTACE were euro10,389 and those of DEB-TACE were euro11,418 (effect size=0.791). DEB-TACE was found more cost-effective than cTACE when a minimum willingness-to-pay of about euro2000-3500/QALY was accepted, mainly depending on shorter in-hospital stay and better quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Direct incremental costs of DEB-TACE can be acceptable in respect to cTACE, relying on financial resources available from the payer perspective.",2016-01-22814,27263056,Dig Liver Dis,Alessandro Cucchetti,2016,48 / 7,798-805,No,27263056,"Alessandro Cucchetti; Franco Trevisani; Alberta Cappelli; Cristina Mosconi; Matteo Renzulli; Antonio Daniele Pinna; Rita Golfieri; Cost-effectiveness of doxorubicin-eluting beads versus conventional trans-arterial chemo-embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma, Dig Liver Dis, 2016 Jul; 48(7):1878-3562; 798-805",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Doxorubicin-loaded drug-eluting beads Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) vs. Conventional trans-catheter arterial chemo-embolization (cTACE),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2562.5,Euro,2014,3725
16657,Economic evaluation of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in combination with dexamethasone for the prevention of 'overall' nausea and vomiting following highly emetogenic chemotherapy in Chinese adult patients,"BACKGROUND: Two pivotal Phase III trials compared the efficacy of palonosetron, ondansetron and granisetron, combined with dexamethasone, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting following highly emetogenic chemotherapy. However, an economic evaluation of these three regimens in the real-world setting of Chinese adult patients has not been determined. OBJECTIVES: To estimate, from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, which of these frequently used strategies consisting of 0.25 mg palonosetron (0.25P), 16 mg ondansetron (Onda), and 3 mg granisetron (Gran), is the most cost-effective option in patients following highly emetogenic chemotherapy. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was developed. The health and economic outcomes of the three strategies; 0.25P, Onda, and Gran were investigated. The clinical and utility data were taken from published studies. The cost data were calculated according to current local Chinese practices. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of uncertainty regarding the results. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that the 0.25P strategy yielded maximum health benefits compared with the other two strategies. However, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the Gran strategy was the most cost-effective approach when the willingness-to-pay threshold was not more than US$22,515/quality-adjusted life year. Moreover, palonosetron is not cost-effective in preventing ''overall'' nausea and vomiting following highly emetogenic chemotherapy in Chinese patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on resource use and quality of life for 707 patients collected prospectively in the TRAPEZE 2 x 2 factorial randomised trial (ISRCTN 12808747) were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of i) zoledronic acid versus no zoledronic acid (ZA vs. no ZA), and ii) strontium-89 versus no strontium-89 (Sr89 vs. no Sr89). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service in the UK and included expenditures for trial treatments, concomitant medications, and use of related hospital and primary care services. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated according to patients'' responses to the generic EuroQol EQ-5D-3L instrument, which evaluates health status. Results are expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The per-patient cost for ZA was pound12 667, pound251 higher than the equivalent cost in the no ZA group. Patients in the ZA group had on average 0.03 QALYs more than their counterparts in no ZA group. The ICER for this comparison was pound8 005. Sr89 was associated with a cost of pound13 230, pound1365 higher than no Sr89, and a gain of 0.08 QALYs compared to no Sr89. The ICER for Sr89 was pound16 884. The probabilities of ZA and Sr89 being cost-effective were 0.64 and 0.60, respectively.

16661,Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Acting Injectable Paliperidone Palmitate Versus Haloperidol Decanoate in Maintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the relative cost-effectiveness of haloperidol decanoate (HD), a first-generation long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic, and paliperidone palmitate (PP), a second-generation LAI antipsychotic. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized 18-month clinical trial conducted at 22 clinical research sites in the United States compared the cost-effectiveness of HD and PP among 311 adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had been clinically assessed as likely to benefit from an LAI antipsychotic. Patients were randomly assigned to monthly intramuscular injections of HD (25-200 mg) or PP (39-234 mg) for up to 24 months. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured by a schizophrenia-specific algorithm based on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and side-effect assessments; total health care costs were assessed from the perspective of the health system. RESULTS: Mixed-model analysis showed that PP was associated with .0297 greater QALYs over 18 months (p=.03) and with $2,100 more in average costs per quarter for inpatient and outpatient services and medication compared with HD (p<.001). Bootstrap analysis with 5,000 replications showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PP of $508,241 per QALY (95% confidence interval=$122,390-$1,582,711). Net health benefits analysis showed a .98 probability of greater cost-effectiveness for HD compared with PP at an estimated value of $150,000 per QALY and a .50 probability of greater cost-effectiveness at $500,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: HD was more cost-effective than PP, suggesting that PP''s slightly greater benefits did not justify its markedly higher costs, which are likely to fall once the medication''s patent expires.",2016-01-22835,27247177,Psychiatr Serv,Robert A Rosenheck,2016,67 / 10,1124-1130,No,27247177,"Robert A Rosenheck; Douglas L Leslie; Kyaw J Sint; Haiqun Lin; Yue Li; Joseph P McEvoy; Matthew J Byerly; Robert M Hamer; Marvin S Swartz; T Scott Stroup; Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Acting Injectable Paliperidone Palmitate Versus Haloperidol Decanoate in Maintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia, Psychiatr Serv, 2016 Oct 01; 67(10):1075-2730; 1124-1130",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Long-Acting Injectable Paliperidone Palmitate vs. haloperidol decanoate,Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,70707.07,United States,2014,77300.32
16662,Routine Pediatric Enterovirus 71 Vaccination in China: a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: China accounted for 87% (9.8 million/11.3 million) of all hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases reported to WHO during 2010-2014. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is responsible for most of the severe HFMD cases. Three EV71 vaccines recently demonstrated good efficacy in children aged 6-71 mo. Here we assessed the cost-effectiveness of routine pediatric EV71 vaccination in China. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We characterized the economic and health burden of EV71-associated HFMD (EV71-HFMD) in China using (i) the national surveillance database, (ii) virological surveillance records from all provinces, and (iii) a caregiver survey on the household costs and health utility loss for 1,787 laboratory-confirmed pediatric cases. Using a static model parameterized with these data, we estimated the effective vaccine cost (EVC, defined as cost/efficacy or simply the cost of a 100% efficacious vaccine) below which routine pediatric vaccination would be considered cost-effective. We performed the base-case analysis from the societal perspective with a willingness-to-pay threshold of one times the gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) and an annual discount rate of 3%. We performed uncertainty analysis by (i) accounting for the uncertainty in the risk of EV71-HFMD due to missing laboratory data in the national database, (ii) excluding productivity loss of parents and caregivers, (iii) increasing the willingness-to-pay threshold to three times GDPpc, (iv) increasing the discount rate to 6%, and (v) accounting for the proportion of EV71-HFMD cases not registered by national surveillance. In each of these scenarios, we performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account for parametric uncertainty in our estimates of the risk of EV71-HFMD and the expected costs and health utility loss due to EV71-HFMD. Routine pediatric EV71 vaccination would be cost-saving if the all-inclusive EVC is below US$10.6 (95% CI US$9.7-US$11.5) and would remain cost-effective if EVC is below US$17.9 (95% CI US$16.9-US$18.8) in the base case, but these ceilings could be up to 66% higher if all the test-negative cases with missing laboratory data are EV71-HFMD. The EVC ceiling is (i) 10%-14% lower if productivity loss of parents/caregivers is excluded, (ii) 58%-84% higher if the willingness-to-pay threshold is increased to three times GDPpc, (iii) 14%-19% lower if the discount rate is increased to 6%, and (iv) 36% (95% CI 23%-50%) higher if the proportion of EV71-HFMD registered by national surveillance is the same as that observed in the three EV71 vaccine phase III trials. The validity of our results relies on the following assumptions: (i) self-reported hospital charges are a good proxy for the opportunity cost of care, (ii) the cost and health utility loss estimates based on laboratory-confirmed EV71-HFMD cases are representative of all EV71-HFMD cases, and (iii) the long-term average risk of EV71-HFMD in the future is similar to that registered by national surveillance during 2010-2013. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to no vaccination, routine pediatric EV71 vaccination would be very cost-effective in China if the cost of immunization (including all logistical, procurement, and administration costs needed to confer 5 y of vaccine protection) is below US$12.0-US$18.3, depending on the choice of vaccine among the three candidates. Given that the annual number of births in China has been around 16 million in recent years, the annual costs for routine pediatric EV71 vaccination at this cost range should not exceed US$192-US$293 million. Our results can be used to determine the optimal vaccine when the prices of the three vaccines are known.",2016-01-22860,26978565,PLoS Med,Joseph T Wu,2016,13 / 3,e1001975,No,26978565,"Joseph T Wu; Mark Jit; Yaming Zheng; Kathy Leung; Weijia Xing; Juan Yang; Qiaohong Liao; Benjamin J Cowling; Bingyi Yang; Eric H Y Lau; Saki Takahashi; Jeremy J Farrar; Bryan T Grenfell; Gabriel M Leung; Hongjie Yu; Routine Pediatric Enterovirus 71 Vaccination in China: a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, PLoS Med, 2016 Mar; 13(3):1549-1676; e1001975",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,enterovirus vacciation #1 vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,0 Weeks,3.00,3.00,98148.15,United States,2013,109040.81
16663,Cost-Effectiveness of Integrating a Clinical Decision Rule and Staged Imaging Protocol for Diagnosis of Appendicitis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic protocol for appendicitis in children, the use of a validated clinical decision rule (CDR) and a staged imaging protocol, compared with usual care. METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the three competing strategies using parameters from existing literature as well as a Markov model developed to simulate the effects of exposure to ionizing radiation from a single computed tomography (CT) study in the course of diagnosis. The simulation model was applied to a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 boys and girls, age 10 years, presenting with acute abdominal pain to emergency departments in the United States. RESULTS: The integrated strategy, the CDR followed by staged imaging, was found to be the most cost-effective approach. Cost savings accrued from the reduction in CT utilization for low-risk patients compared with the other two strategies. The addition of ultrasound (US) to the CDR strategy reduced CT utilization by an additional 10.9%, its main cost advantage, with negligible change in net health benefits from false-negative US results, and associated morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the integration of staged imaging with the CDR for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children is a cost-effective and cost-saving approach.

16667,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Smoking Cessation Interventions in Japan Using a Discrete-Event Simulation,"BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation medications have been shown to yield higher success rates and sustained abstinence than unassisted quit attempts. In Japan, the treatments available include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline; however, unassisted attempts to quit smoking remain common. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the health and economic consequences in Japan of using pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation with unassisted attempts and the current mix of strategies used. METHODS: A discrete-event simulation that models lifetime quitting behaviour and includes multiple quit attempts (MQAs) and relapses was adapted for these analyses. The risk of developing smoking-related diseases is estimated based on the duration of abstinence. Data collected from a survey conducted in Japan were used to determine the interventions selected by smokers initiating a quit attempt and the time between MQAs. Direct and indirect costs are assessed (expressed in 2014 Japanese Yen). RESULTS: Using pharmacotherapy (NRT or varenicline) to support quit attempts proved to be dominant when compared with unassisted attempts or the current mix of strategies (most are unassisted). The results of stratified analyses by age imply that smoking cessation improves health outcomes across all generations. Indirect costs due to premature death leading to lost wages are an important component of the total costs, exceeding the direct medical cost estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Increased utilisation of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to support quit attempts is predicted to lead to an increase in the number of smokers achieving abstinence, and provide improvements in health outcomes over a lifetime with no additional costs.",2016-01-22908,26597111,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Ataru Igarashi,2016,14 / 1,77-87,Yes,26597111,"Ataru Igarashi; Rei Goto; Kiyomi Suwa; Reiko Yoshikawa; Alexandra J Ward; Jorgen Moller; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Smoking Cessation Interventions in Japan Using a Discrete-Event Simulation, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2016 Feb; 14(1):1179-1896; 77-87",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Varenicline net vs. Standard/Usual Care- Market Mix,Not Stated,75 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-5661362.5,Japan,2014,-58692.84

16671,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Different Antiviral Medicine Regimens in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 Infection,"BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of new drug regimens with high effectiveness for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, especially in HCV genotype 1, no cost-effectiveness study on the selection of the superior drug strategy in Iran has been conducted yet. OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the three drug regimens of pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR), sofosbuvir (SOF) + PR and ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in patients with HCV genotype 1 in Iran in the year 2014. METHODS: A Markov micro-simulation model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three drug strategies for a cohort of 10000 patients. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were extracted from published studies. Cost data was estimated through the review of medical records and obtaining experts opinion. RESULTS: The results showed that the SOF + PR drug compared with PR had a lower cost and was more effective, but compared with the LDV/SOF, in spite of its lower cost, it was less efficient. The QALY values obtained for PR, SOF + PR and LDV/SOF, respectively, were 10.98, 12.08 and 12.28 and their costs were $ 41,741, $ 7,676 and $ 46,993.

16673,Comparative cost-effectiveness of focal and total salvage 125I brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after primary radiotherapy,"PURPOSE: Focal salvage (FS) iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy could be an effective treatment for locally radiorecurrent prostate cancer (PCa). Toxicity is often reduced compared to total salvage (TS) while cancer control can be maintained, which could increase cost-effectiveness. The current study estimates the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of FS compared to TS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was developed, which compares costs and QALYs associated with FS and TS. A 3-year time horizon was adopted with six month cycles, with a hospital perspective on costs. Probabilities for genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and their impact on health-related quality of life (SF-36) were derived from clinical studies in the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, was performed to quantify the joint decision uncertainty up to the recommended maximum willingness-to-pay threshold of euro80,000/QALY. RESULTS: Focal salvage dominates TS as it results in less severe toxicity and lower treatment costs. Decision uncertainty is small, with a 97-100% probability for FS to be cost-effective compared to TS (euro0-euro80,000/QALY). Half of the difference in costs between FS and TS was explained by higher treatment costs of TS, the other half by higher incidence of severe toxicity. One-way sensitivity analyses show that model outcomes are most sensitive to utilities and probabilities for severe toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Focal salvage 125I brachytherapy dominates TS, as it has lower treatment costs and leads to less toxicity in our center. Larger comparative studies with longer follow-up are necessary to assess the exact influence on (biochemical disease free) survival and toxicity.",2016-01-23934,28115953,J Contemp Brachytherapy,Max Peters,2016,8 / 6,484-491,No,28115953,"Max Peters; Marjanne A Piena; Lotte M G Steuten; Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp; Marinus A Moerland; Marco van Vulpen; Comparative cost-effectiveness of focal and total salvage 125I brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after primary radiotherapy, J Contemp Brachytherapy, 2016 Dec; 8(6):1689-832X; 484-491",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Focal salvage (FS) iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy vs. Total salvage iodine 125 brachytherapy,Recurrent prostate cancer after primary external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy,69 Years,69 Years,Male,Full,3 Years,4.00,1.50,-16340,Euro,2014,-23752.79
16674,Cost-effectiveness of the Decipher Genomic Classifier to Guide Individualized Decisions for Early Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of early adjuvant versus salvage radiation therapy after prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Estimates of prostate cancer progression from the Decipher genomic classifier (GC) could guide informed decision-making and improve the outcomes for patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with GC-based treatment decisions regarding adjuvant therapy after prostatectomy with those of 2 control strategies: usual care (determined from patterns of care studies) and the alternative of 100% adjuvant radiation therapy. Using the bootstrapping method of sampling with replacement, the cases of 10,000 patients were simulated during a 10-year time horizon, with each subject having individual estimates for cancer progression (according to GC findings) and noncancer mortality (according to age). RESULTS: GC-based care was more effective and less costly than 100% adjuvant radiation therapy and resulted in cost savings up to an assay cost of $11,402. Compared with usual care, GC-based care resulted in more QALYs. Assuming a $4000 assay cost, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $90,833 per QALY, assuming a 7% usage rate of adjuvant radiation therapy. GC-based care was also associated with a 16% reduction in the percentage of patients with distant metastasis at 5 years compared with usual care. CONCLUSION: The Decipher GC could be a cost-effective approach for genomics-driven cancer treatment decisions after prostatectomy, with improvements in estimated clinical outcomes compared with usual care.

RESULTS: GC-based care was more effective and less costly than 100% adjuvant radiation therapy and resulted in cost savings up to an assay cost of $11,402. Compared with usual care, GC-based care resulted in more QALYs. Assuming a $4000 assay cost, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $90,833 per QALY, assuming a 7% usage rate of adjuvant radiation therapy. GC-based care was also associated with a 16% reduction in the percentage of patients with distant metastasis at 5 years compared with usual care. CONCLUSION: The Decipher GC could be a cost-effective approach for genomics-driven cancer treatment decisions after prostatectomy, with improvements in estimated clinical outcomes compared with usual care. The individualized decision analytic framework applied in the present study offers a flexible approach to estimate the potential utility of genomic assays for personalized cancer medicine.",2016-01-23978,28089723,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,Jennifer M Lobo,2016,/,,No,28089723,"Jennifer M Lobo; Daniel M Trifiletti; Vanessa N Sturz; Adam P Dicker; Christine Buerki; Elai Davicioni; Matthew R Cooperberg; R Jeffrey Karnes; Robert B Jenkins; Robert B Den; Timothy N Showalter; Cost-effectiveness of the Decipher Genomic Classifier to Guide Individualized Decisions for Early Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2016 Aug 17; ():1535-4970",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Decipher genomic classifier (GC)- based treatment decisions regarding adjuvant therapy after prostatectomy vs. 100% Adjuvant Therapy,Men with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-52871.43,United States,2013,-58739.2
16676,Cost-Effectiveness of Different Population Screening Strategies for Hereditary Haemochromatosis in Australia,"INTRODUCTION: Amongst populations of northern European ancestry, HFE-associated haemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder characterised by iron overload. In the absence of treatment, excess iron is stored in parenchymal tissues, causing morbidity and mortality. Population screening programmes may increase early diagnosis and reduce associated disease. No contemporary health economic evaluation has been published for Australia. The objective of this study was to identify cost-effective screening strategies for haemochromatosis in the Australian setting. METHODS: A Markov model using probabilistic decision analysis was developed comparing four adult screening strategies: the status quo (cascade and incidental screening), genotyping with blood and buccal samples and transferrin saturation followed by genotyping (TfS). Target populations were males (30 years) and females (45 years) of northern European ancestry. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the government perspective over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: All strategies for males were cost-effective compared to the status quo. The incremental costs (standard deviation) associated with genotyping (blood) were AUD7 (56), TfS AUD15 (45) and genotyping (buccal) AUD63 (56), producing ICERs of AUD1673, 4103 and 15,233/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively. For females, only the TfS strategy was cost-effective, producing an ICER of AUD10,195/QALY gained. Approximately 3% of C282Y homozygotes were estimated to be identified with the status quo approach, compared with 40% with the proposed screening strategies. CONCLUSION: This model estimated that genotyping and TfS strategies are likely to be more cost-effective screening strategies than the status quo.",2016-01-24075,28035629,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Barbara de Graaff,2016,/,,Yes,28035629,"Barbara de Graaff; Amanda Neil; Lei Si; Kwang Chien Yee; Kristy Sanderson; Lyle Gurrin; Andrew J Palmer; Cost-Effectiveness of Different Population Screening Strategies for Hereditary Haemochromatosis in Australia, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2016 Dec 07; ():1179-1896",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genotype screening (blood) vs. Status quo,30-year-old males of northern European ancestry,30 Years,30 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,1673,Australia,2015,1374.11

16682,Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Upper Age Limits for Breast Cancer Screening in England and Wales,"BACKGROUND: Currently in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) Breast Screening Programme invites all women for triennial mammography between the ages of 47 and 73 years (the extension to 47-50 and 70-73 years is currently examined as part of a randomized controlled trial). The benefits and harms of screening in women 70 years and older, however, are less well documented. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether extending screening to women older than 70 years would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources and to identify the upper age limit at which screening mammography should be extended in England and Wales. METHODS: A mathematical model that allows the impact of screening policies on cancer diagnosis and subsequent management to be assessed was built. The model has two parts: a natural history model of the progression of breast cancer up to discovery and a postdiagnosis model of treatment, recurrence, and survival. The natural history model was calibrated to available data and compared against published literature. The management of breast cancer at diagnosis was taken from registry data and valued using official UK tariffs. RESULTS: The model estimated that screening would lead to overdiagnosis in 6.2% of screen-detected women at the age of 72 years, increasing up to 37.9% at the age of 90 years. Under commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United Kingdom, our study suggests that an extension to screening up to the age of 78 years represents a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides encouraging findings to support the extension of the screening program to older ages and suggests that further extension of the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme up to age 78 years beyond the current upper age limit of 73 years could be potentially cost-effective according to current NHS willingness-to-pay thresholds.",2016-01-24112,27325332,Value Health,Rachid Rafia,2016,19 / 4,404-12,Yes,27325332,"Rachid Rafia; Alan Brennan; Jason Madan; Karen Collins; Malcolm W R Reed; Gill Lawrence; Thompson Robinson; David Greenberg; Lynda Wyld; Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Upper Age Limits for Breast Cancer Screening in England and Wales, Value Health, 2016 Jun; 19(4):1098-3015; 404-12",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Strategy 1: One additional screening round for women aged 72 years vs. Strategy S0: The current NHSBSP, which is defined as a final invitation at age 69 years",Not Stated,Not Stated,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,6918,United Kingdom,2009,12083.92

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides encouraging findings to support the extension of the screening program to older ages and suggests that further extension of the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme up to age 78 years beyond the current upper age limit of 73 years could be potentially cost-effective according to current NHS willingness-to-pay thresholds.",2016-01-24112,27325332,Value Health,Rachid Rafia,2016,19 / 4,404-12,Yes,27325332,"Rachid Rafia; Alan Brennan; Jason Madan; Karen Collins; Malcolm W R Reed; Gill Lawrence; Thompson Robinson; David Greenberg; Lynda Wyld; Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Upper Age Limits for Breast Cancer Screening in England and Wales, Value Health, 2016 Jun; 19(4):1098-3015; 404-12",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Strategy 6: Two additional screening rounds for women aged 87 years vs. Strategy 5: Two additional screening rounds for women aged 84 years,Not Stated,Not Stated,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-645194.5,United Kingdom,2009,-1126984.73
16688,Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Upper Age Limits for Breast Cancer Screening in England and Wales,"BACKGROUND: Currently in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) Breast Screening Programme invites all women for triennial mammography between the ages of 47 and 73 years (the extension to 47-50 and 70-73 years is currently examined as part of a randomized controlled trial). The benefits and harms of screening in women 70 years and older, however, are less well documented. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether extending screening to women older than 70 years would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources and to identify the upper age limit at which screening mammography should be extended in England and Wales. METHODS: A mathematical model that allows the impact of screening policies on cancer diagnosis and subsequent management to be assessed was built. The model has two parts: a natural history model of the progression of breast cancer up to discovery and a postdiagnosis model of treatment, recurrence, and survival. The natural history model was calibrated to available data and compared against published literature. The management of breast cancer at diagnosis was taken from registry data and valued using official UK tariffs. RESULTS: The model estimated that screening would lead to overdiagnosis in 6.2% of screen-detected women at the age of 72 years, increasing up to 37.9% at the age of 90 years. Under commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United Kingdom, our study suggests that an extension to screening up to the age of 78 years represents a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides encouraging findings to support the extension of the screening program to older ages and suggests that further extension of the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme up to age 78 years beyond the current upper age limit of 73 years could be potentially cost-effective according to current NHS willingness-to-pay thresholds.",2016-01-24112,27325332,Value Health,Rachid Rafia,2016,19 / 4,404-12,Yes,27325332,"Rachid Rafia; Alan Brennan; Jason Madan; Karen Collins; Malcolm W R Reed; Gill Lawrence; Thompson Robinson; David Greenberg; Lynda Wyld; Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Upper Age Limits for Breast Cancer Screening in England and Wales, Value Health, 2016 Jun; 19(4):1098-3015; 404-12",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Strategy 7: Seven additional screening rounds for women aged 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, and 90 years vs. Strategy 6: Two additional screening rounds for women aged 87 years",Not Stated,Not Stated,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-105662.1,United Kingdom,2009,-184563.84
16689,OnabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of overactive bladder: a cost-effectiveness analysis versus best supportive care in England and Wales,"The cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX((R))) 100 U + best supportive care (BSC) was compared with BSC alone in the management of idiopathic overactive bladder in adult patients who are not adequately managed with anticholinergics. BSC included incontinence pads and, for a proportion of patients, anticholinergics and/or occasional clean intermittent catheterisation. A five-state Markov model was used to estimate total costs and outcomes over a 10-year period. The cohort was based on data from two placebo-controlled trials and a long-term extension study of onabotulinumtoxinA. After discontinuation of initial treatment, a proportion of patients progressed to downstream sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). Cost and resource use was estimated from a National Health Service perspective in England and Wales using relevant reference sources for 2012 or 2013. Results showed that onabotulinumtoxinA was associated with lower costs and greater health benefits than BSC in the base case, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicating an 89 % probability that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would fall below pound20,000. OnabotulinumtoxinA remained dominant over BSC in all but two scenarios tested; it was also economically dominant when compared directly with SNS therapy. In conclusion, onabotulinumtoxinA appears to be a cost-effective treatment for overactive bladder compared with BSC alone.",2016-01-24131,26482712,Eur J Health Econ,Nick Freemantle,2016,17 / 7,911-21,Yes,26482712,"Nick Freemantle; Kristin Khalaf; Clara Loveman; Sanja Stanisic; Dmitry Gultyaev; Johanna Lister; Marcus Drake; OnabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of overactive bladder: a cost-effectiveness analysis versus best supportive care in England and Wales, Eur J Health Econ, 2016 Sep; 17(7):1618-7598; 911-21",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,onabotulinumtoxinA + best supportive care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Best supportive care,Overactive bladder patients in England and Wales,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-6629.11,United Kingdom,2012,-11846.65
