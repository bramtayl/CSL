6801,Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for prevention of cervical cancer in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been shown to be a major risk factor for cervical cancer. Vaccines against HPV-16 and HPV-18 are highly effective in preventing type-specific HPV infections and related cervical lesions. There is, however, limited data available describing the health and economic impacts of HPV vaccination in Taiwan. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic HPV vaccination for the prevention of cervical cancer in Taiwan. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the health and economic outcomes of vaccinating preadolescent girls (at the age of 12 years) for the prevention of cervical cancer with current practice, including cervical cytological screening. Data were synthesized from published papers or reports, and whenever possible, those specific to Taiwan were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for important uncertainties and different vaccination scenarios. RESULTS: Under the assumption that the HPV vaccine could provide lifelong protection, the massive vaccination among preadolescent girls in Taiwan would lead to reduction in 73.3% of the total incident cervical cancer cases and would result in a life expectancy gain of 4.9 days or 8.7 quality-adjusted life days at a cost of US$324 as compared to the current practice. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$23,939 per life year gained or US$13,674 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained given the discount rate of 3%. Sensitivity analyses showed that this ICER would remain below US$30,000 per QALY under most conditions, even when vaccine efficacy was suboptimal or when vaccine-induced immunity required booster shots every 13 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although gains in life expectancy may be modest at the individual level, the results indicate that prophylactic HPV vaccination of preadolescent girls in Taiwan would result in substantial population benefits with a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. Nevertheless, we should not overlook the urgency to improve the compliance rate of cervical screening, particularly for older individuals.",2010-01-06187,20064239,BMC Health Serv Res,Pang-Hsiang Liu,2010,10 /,11,Yes,20064239,"Pang-Hsiang Liu; Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for prevention of cervical cancer in Taiwan, BMC Health Serv Res, 2010; 10():1472-6963; 11",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Human papilloma virus vaccination against HPV-16 and HPV-18 vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,13674,United States,2009,16495.9
6802,Cost-effectiveness of real-world infliximab use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Sweden,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of infliximab use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Swedish clinical practice, based on patient-level data from the Stockholm TNF-alpha follow-up registry (STURE). METHODS: Real-world patient-level data on infliximab use from the STURE registry were implemented in a Markov cohort model, in which health states of functional status were classified according to the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-five categories) and twenty-eight joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28). The transition probabilities between HAQ and DAS28 states during treatment, as well as discontinuation rates were modeled based on data from the registry for patients using infliximab as their first-line biological treatment. The transition probabilities in the comparator arm, that is, disease progression without biologic treatment, as well as mortality rates, costs, and utilities were based on published literature. The analysis had a societal cost perspective. RESULTS: Infliximab was associated with an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years of 1.02 and an incremental cost of 23,264 euros per patient compared with progression without biologic treatment, producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 22,830 euros (SEK211,136 or US$31,230). Sensitivity analyses of input parameters and model assumptions produced ICERs in the range from 18,000 euros to 47,000 euros. CONCLUSIONS: Results from base-case and sensitivity analyses fell well below established benchmarks for cost-effectiveness in Sweden. The results, therefore, indicated that infliximab treatment for RA has provided good societal value for money in Swedish clinical practice, compared with a scenario of no biological treatment.",2010-01-06196,20059781,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Ingrid Lekander,2010,26 / 1,54-61,No,20059781,"Ingrid Lekander; Cost-effectiveness of real-world infliximab use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Sweden, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2010-Jan; 26(1):0266-4623; 54-61",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Infliximab vs. Natural Progression; no care.,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,22830,Euro,2007,39071.38
6803,Cost-utility of a cardiovascular prevention program in highly educated adults: intermediate results of a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the costs and the effects of cardiovascular prevention programs targeted at medical and behavioral risk factors. The aim was to evaluate the cost-utility of a cardiovascular prevention program in a general sample of highly educated adults after 1 year of intervention. METHODS: The participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 208) and usual care conditions (n = 106). The intervention consisted of medical interventions and optional behavior-change interventions (e.g., a tailored Web site). Cost data were registered from a healthcare perspective, and questionnaires were used to determine effectiveness (e.g., quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]). A cost-utility analysis and sensitivity analyses using bootstrapping were performed on the intermediate results. RESULTS: When adjusting for baseline utility differences, the incremental cost was 433 euros and the incremental effectiveness was 0.016 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 26,910 euros per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was cost-effective compared with usual care in this sample of highly educated adults after 1 year of intervention.

6804,A cost-utility analysis of psychoanalysis versus psychoanalytic psychotherapy,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the considerable and growing body of research about the clinical effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic treatment, relatively little attention has been paid to economic evaluations, particularly with reference to the broader range of societal effects. In this cost-utility study, we examined the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of psychoanalysis versus psychoanalytic psychotherapy. METHODS: Incremental costs and effects were estimated by means of cross-sectional measurements in a cohort design (psychoanalysis, n = 78; psychoanalytic psychotherapy, n = 104). Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for each treatment strategy using the SF-6D. Total costs were calculated from a societal perspective (treatment costs plus other societal costs) and discounted at 4 percent. Psychoanalysis was more costly than psychoanalytic psychotherapy, but also more effective from a health-related quality of life perspective. The ICER--that is, the extra costs to gain one additional QALY by delivering psychoanalysis instead of psychoanalytic psychotherapy--was estimated at 52,384 euros per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the cost-utility ratio of psychoanalysis relative to psychoanalytic psychotherapy is within an acceptable range. More research is needed to find out whether cost-utility ratios vary with different types of patients. We also encourage cost-utility analyses comparing psychoanalytic treatment to other forms of (long-term) treatment.",2010-01-06200,20059775,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Caspar C Berghout,2010,26 / 1,3-10,No,20059775,"Caspar C Berghout; A cost-utility analysis of psychoanalysis versus psychoanalytic psychotherapy, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2010-Jan; 26(1):0266-4623; 3-10",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Psychoanalysis delivered by mental health workers in ambulatory mental health clinics vs. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy delivered by mental health workers in ambulatory mental health clinics,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,2 Years,4.00,Not Stated,52384,Euro,2006,84485.41
6805,Costs and consequences associated with newer medications for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: Newer medications offer more options for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. However, they come at considerable costs. We undertook a health economic analysis to better understand the value of adding two newer medications (exenatide and sitagliptin) as second-line therapy to glycemic control strategies for patients with new-onset diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis for the U.S. population aged 25-64. A lifetime analytic horizon and health care system perspective were used. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3% annually, and costs are presented in 2008 U.S. dollars. We compared three glycemic control strategies: 1) glyburide as a second-line agent, 2) exenatide as a second-line agent, and 3) sitagliptin as a second-line agent. Outcome measures included QALYs gained, incremental costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with each strategy. RESULTS: Exenatide and sitagliptin conferred 0.09 and 0.12 additional QALYs, respectively, relative to glyburide as second-line therapy. In base case analysis, exenatide was dominated (cost more and provided fewer QALYs than the next most expensive option), and sitagliptin was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 169,572 dollars per QALY saved. Results were sensitive to assumptions regarding medication costs, side effect duration, and side effect-associated disutilities.

6808,Cost effectiveness of varenicline versus bupropion and unaided cessation for smoking cessation in a cohort of Finnish adult smokers,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of varenicline compared with bupropion or unaided cessation for smoking cessation in Finnish adult smokers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The BENESCO (BENEfits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes) Markov model was used to follow a hypothetical cohort of smokers making a single quit attempt over a lifetime. Gender and age-specific data on the incidence and prevalence of five smoking-related diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], lung cancer, coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke and asthma exacerbations) were included in the model. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total treatment costs and the lifetime cumulative incidence of these parameters were the primary outcomes evaluated, and they were compared for varenicline versus bupropion and varenicline versus unaided cessation. The primary data were derived from Finnish publications and databases. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the base-case model. RESULTS: The treatment cohort comprised 229 301 smokers making a quit attempt. In the lifetime simulation, use of varenicline prevented 1965 and 5057 additional cases of smoking-related disease, and 1184 and 3047 deaths attributable to smoking, when compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. Compared with bupropion and unaided cessation varenicline treatment yielded 4392 and 11 303 additional LYs (4851 and 12 485 QALYs), respectively. Varenicline resulted in cost savings of 15 million and 43 million euros (euro) compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively.

6812,Cost-effectiveness of shared pharmaceutical care for older patients: RESPECT trial findings,"BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical care serves as a collaborative model for medication review. Its use is advocated for older patients, although its cost-effectiveness is unknown. Although the accompanying article on clinical effectiveness from the RESPECT (Randomised Evaluation of Shared Prescribing for Elderly people in the Community over Time) trial finds no statistically significant impact on prescribing for older patients undergoing pharmaceutical care, economic evaluations are based on an estimation, rather than hypothesis testing. AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical care for older people compared with usual care, according to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) reference case standards. METHODS: An economic evaluation was undertaken in which NICE reference case standards were applied to data collected in the RESPECT trial. RESULTS: On average, pharmaceutical care is estimated to cost an incremental 10 000 UK pounds per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY). If the NHS's cost-effectiveness threshold is between 20 000 and 30 000 UK pounds per extra QALY, then the results indicate that pharmaceutical care is cost-effective despite a lack of statistical significance to this effect. However, the statistical uncertainty surrounding the estimates implies that the probability that pharmaceutical care is not cost-effective lies between 0.22 and 0.19. Although results are not sensitive to assumptions about costs, they differ between subgroups: in patients aged >75 years pharmaceutical care appears more cost-effective for those who are younger or on fewer repeat medications.

6814,Health outcomes and costs of community mitigation strategies for an influenza pandemic in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The optimal community-level approach to control pandemic influenza is unknown. METHODS: We estimated the health outcomes and costs of combinations of 4 social distancing strategies and 2 antiviral medication strategies to mitigate an influenza pandemic for a demographically typical US community. We used a social network, agent-based model to estimate strategy effectiveness and an economic model to estimate health resource use and costs. We used data from the literature to estimate clinical outcomes and health care utilization. RESULTS: At 1% influenza mortality, moderate infectivity (R(o) of 2.1 or greater), and 60% population compliance, the preferred strategy is adult and child social distancing, school closure, and antiviral treatment and prophylaxis. This strategy reduces the prevalence of cases in the population from 35% to 10%, averts 2480 cases per 10,000 population, costs $2700 per case averted, and costs $31,300 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, compared with the same strategy without school closure. The addition of school closure to adult and child social distancing and antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, if available, is not cost-effective for viral strains with low infectivity (R(o) of 1.6 and below) and low case fatality rates (below 1%). High population compliance lowers costs to society substantially when the pandemic strain is severe (R(o) of 2.1 or greater).

6816,"A policy model to evaluate the benefits, risks and costs of warfarin pharmacogenomic testing","BACKGROUND: In 2007, the US FDA added information about pharmacogenomics to the warfarin label based on the influence of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes on anticoagulation-related outcomes. Payers will be facing increasing demand for coverage decisions regarding this technology, but the potential clinical and economic impacts of testing are not clear. OBJECTIVE: To develop a policy model to evaluate the potential outcomes of warfarin pharmacogenomic testing based on the most recently available data. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to assess the addition of genetic testing to anticoagulation clinic standard care for a hypothetical cohort of warfarin patients. The model was based on anticoagulation status (international normalized ratio), a common outcome measure in clinical trials that captures both the benefits and risks of warfarin therapy. Initial estimates of testing effects were derived from a recently completed randomized controlled trial (n = 200). Healthcare cost ($US, year 2007 values) and health-state utility data were obtained from the literature. The perspective was that of a US third-party payer. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the range of plausible results. RESULTS: The policy model included thromboembolic events (TEs) and bleeding events and was populated by data from the COUMAGEN trial. The rate of bleeding calculated for standard care approximated bleeding rates found in an independent cohort of warfarin patients. According to our model, pharmacogenomic testing provided an absolute reduction in the incidence of bleeds of 0.17%, but an absolute increase in the incidence of TEs of 0.03%. The improvement in QALYs was small, 0.003, with an increase in total cost of $US162 (year 2007 values). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranged from testing dominating to standard care dominating, and the ICER was <$US50,000 per QALY in 46% of simulations. Results were most sensitive to the cost of genotyping and the effect of genotyping.

6820,Cost effectiveness of intensive lipid-lowering treatment for patients with congestive heart failure and coronary heart disease in the US,"BACKGROUND: A recent study found fewer hospitalizations for congestive heart failure (CHF) patients receiving high-dose versus low-dose statin therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost effectiveness of high-dose versus low-dose statin therapy in CHF patients. METHODS: Two scenarios (literature-based [base-case scenario] vs trial-based post-event mortality [alternative scenario]) assessed the cost effectiveness of atorvastatin 80 mg/day (A80) versus atorvastatin 10 mg/day (A10) in patients with both CHF and coronary heart disease (CHD) [CHF/CHD], using a lifetime Markov model. The model predicts treatment-specific probabilities of major and minor cardiovascular events and death, based on clinical trial data. The quality of life and costs were literature based. Measures included costs per life-year saved (LYS) and QALY gained. Health consequences and costs were discounted at 3.0% annually. Analyses were conducted from the payer perspective and valued in $US, year 2006-7 values. RESULTS: Literature-based mortality estimates (base case) increased life-years and QALYs for A80 compared with A10 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs]: $US9600 per LYS; $US13 600 per QALY). At a willingness to pay of $US100 000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 80% of simulations. A10 dominated A80 when using trial-based mortality estimates (alternative scenario). At a willingness to pay of $US100 000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 48% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive A80 treatment may be cost effective versus A10 in cardiovascular prevention in CHF/CHD patients in the US, due to projected gains in life expectancy and health-related quality of life.

6822,Cost effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy in follicular lymphoma: long-term economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Rituximab maintenance therapy was shown to significantly extend overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) in the pivotal EORTC 20981 trial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term costs and cost effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy after induction therapy versus current standard practice (observation) from the French National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A lifetime transition model was developed comparing rituximab maintenance with observation. PFS and OS were obtained from the EORTC 20981 trial with a median follow-up of 28 months and extrapolated from 2-year Kaplan-Meier curves using a Weibull distribution. PFS and OS benefits of rituximab were conservatively assumed to last only 5 years. Utility data were obtained from a multicentre observational study using the EQ-5D questionnaire. Direct medical costs were obtained from French official sources. All costs are reported in euro, year 2006 values. RESULTS: The EORTC 20981 study demonstrated that rituximab maintenance was effective in the management of relapsed/refractory FL. The model results showed that life expectancy and QALYs were increased by 22% and 28%, respectively, in patients treated with rituximab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro 7612 per life-year gained and euro 8729 per QALY gained. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, most of the ICERs fell within the range of euro 7000-12,000. The results tend to show that rituximab maintenance therapy may be a cost-effective strategy in the management of relapsed/refractory FL in France, with ICERs below those observed for other therapies in the oncology field.

6823,18FDG-PET-CT in the follow-up of non-small cell lung cancer patients after radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy: an economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: The optimal follow-up strategy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after curative intent therapy is still not established. In a recent prospective study with 100 patients, we showed that a FDG-PET-CT 3 months after radiotherapy (RT) could identify progression amenable for curative treatment in 2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-7%) of patients, who were all asymptomatic. Here, we report on the economic evaluation of this study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed in which the long-term cost-effectiveness of 3 follow-up strategies was modelled with different imaging methods 3 months after therapy: a PET-CT scan; a chest CT scan; and conventional follow-up with a chest X-ray. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to account for uncertainty. Because the results of the prospective study indicated that the advantage seems to be confined to asymptomatic patients, we additionally examined a strategy where a PET-CT was applied only in the subgroup of asymptomatic patients. Cost-effectiveness of the different follow-up strategies was expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), calculating the incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Both PET-CT- and CT-based follow-up were more costly but also more effective than conventional follow-up. CT-based follow-up was only slightly more effective than conventional follow-up, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro 264.033 per QALY gained. For PET-CT-based follow-up, the ICER was euro 69.086 per QALY gained compared to conventional follow-up. The strategy in which a PET-CT was only performed in the asymptomatic subgroup resulted in an ICER of euro 42.265 per QALY gained as opposed to conventional follow-up. With this strategy, given a ceiling ratio of euro 80.000, PET-CT-based follow-up had the highest probability of being cost-effective (73%). CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation shows that a PET-CT scan 3 months after (chemo)radiotherapy with curative intent is a potentially cost-effective follow-up method, and is more cost-effective than CT alone. Applying a PET-CT scan only in asymptomatic patients is probably as effective and more cost-effective.

Applying a PET-CT scan only in asymptomatic patients is probably as effective and more cost-effective.

This study used the IMS-CORE Diabetes Model to project the long-term (40-year) cost-effectiveness of SMBG at once, twice, or three times per day (vs. no SMBG) for this population from national reimbursement system perspectives in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. METHODS: SMBG input costs (strips, lancets, meters, nurse training) were supplied by LifeScan in 2007 euro values and applied as appropriate for each country's reimbursement policy. Cohort characteristics and assumed Hb(A1c) effects came from a US Kaiser Permanente longitudinal analysis of new SMBG users. Country-specific estimations for use of screening programs and several concomitant medications, as well as mortality rates were used. Country-specific complication costs from published sources were inflated to 2007 euro. Base case outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum for France, Germany, and Italy; 6% for Spain. Sensitivity analyses varied time horizon and discount rates for each country. They also included a -0.036 dis-utility for SMBG in year 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included total direct costs, gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over 40 years. RESULTS: ICERs were largest in France (with meter costs included), and in Italy (with highest reimbursed costs for strips/lancets). ICERs for SMBG once, twice, and three times per day were 12,114 euros, 6282 euros, and 7958 euros (respectively) in France; and 12,694 euros, 11,934 euros, and 15,368 euros in Italy. ICERs for SMBG once or twice per day were <2000 euros in Germany and <4000 euros in Spain. ICERs for SMBG three times per day were <6000 euros/QALY in both countries. Results were most sensitive to the 5-year time horizon, although ICERs for SMBG once per day were below 50,000 euros/QALY in all countries but Italy (ICER = 77,064 euros). Five-year ICERs for SMBG twice per day were below 40,000 euros/QALY for all four countries, and those for SMBG three times per day were below 45,000 euros/QALY. With the SMBG dis-utility, ICERs increased modestly (321 euros- 2264 euros/QALY) in all scenarios except SMBG once per day in France (9578 euros increase) and Italy (5979 euros increase). Study limitations include the use of relatively short-term data from a single US observational study for SMBG clinical effects, unknown levels of patient adherence, and assumptions regarding the duration of clinical effects.

This study modeled the cost-effectiveness of SMBG at frequencies of once, twice, or three times per day for this population, and included those who had used SMBG in the prior year. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on clinical findings of a longitudinal Kaiser Permanente study, a validated model was used to project 40-year clinical and economic outcomes for SMBG at (averages of) once, twice, or three times per day versus no SMBG. Baseline HbA1c (7.6%), age and gender represented the Kaiser study 'prevalent' SMBG users cohort. Unit costs came primarily from a 2003 published article; inflated to US$2006. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, with sensitivity analyses on discount rates and time horizons. Analyses were conducted from a third-party payer perspective in the US, including only direct costs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were differences in total costs, cumulative incidence of complications, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: For patients using SMBG once, twice, or three times per day, relative risks over 40 years were lower for 14 of 16 complications and slightly higher for 2 complications. Compared to 'no SMBG,' QALYs increased with SMBG frequency: 0.047, 0.116, and 0.132 QALYs for SMBG once, twice, and three times per day, respectively. Some increased costs with SMBG were offset by reductions in costs for several diabetes-related complications. Corresponding ICERs were $26,206, $18,572 and $25,436/QALY gained. Results were most sensitive to time horizon, with SMBG not cost-effective over a 5-year simulation period. CONCLUSIONS: Study limitations include the use of relatively short-term observational data, unknown levels of patient adherence, and assumptions regarding the duration of clinical effects. Results showed that compared to no SMBG, base case ICERs for each of the three SMBG frequencies examined were below $30,000, and that a portion of the increased costs associated with SMBG were offset by reductions in complication costs, and by modest increases in QALYs.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was employed to evaluate the costs and health outcomes of the different therapies based on the cardiovascular events avoided. The model included Framingham risk equations, Finnish population characteristics, event rates, quality of life estimates, resource use and unit costs. The LDL-C lowering efficacies were gathered from a systematic literature review, based on a search of Medline carried out in June 2008 (no time limit). Main outcome measures: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and incremental cost per life year gained (LYG). RESULTS: The efficacy (LDL-C decrease) gained from switching S40 to S40 + EZ10 was consistent in the literature review, whereas the LDL-C decrease gained from switching S40 to A20/R10 was uncertain. The incremental cost per QALY gained from switching generic S40 was lowest for S40 + EZ10 (22,841 euros [24,017 euros] and 26,595 euros [46,686 euros] for diabetic and non-diabetic men [women], respectively).

The LDL-C lowering efficacies were gathered from a systematic literature review, based on a search of Medline carried out in June 2008 (no time limit). Main outcome measures: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and incremental cost per life year gained (LYG). RESULTS: The efficacy (LDL-C decrease) gained from switching S40 to S40 + EZ10 was consistent in the literature review, whereas the LDL-C decrease gained from switching S40 to A20/R10 was uncertain. The incremental cost per QALY gained from switching generic S40 was lowest for S40 + EZ10 (22,841 euros [24,017 euros] and 26,595 euros [46,686 euros] for diabetic and non-diabetic men [women], respectively). The respective incremental cost per QALY gained for S40 + EZ10 vs. A20 were 19,738 euros (21,405 euros) and 23,596 euros (40,087 euros). A20 dominated R10. Based on the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier with a willingness-to-pay value of 30,000 euros per QALY gained, the probability of cost-effectiveness for switching generic S40 to S40 + EZ10 was 100% for men and diabetic women. Sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust.

6840,Use of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma before liver transplantation: a cost-benefit analysis while awaiting data on sorafenib safety,"The role of bridging therapies for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT) remains controversial. There is strong evidence to support the effectiveness of sorafenib in extending the time to progression of HCC. Using a Markov model, we compared two strategies: one using sorafenib as neoadjuvant therapy before LT (Strategy A), and the other using no bridging therapy in the first 6 months (Strategy B). Reference case: T2 HCC patient with compensated cirrhosis. The benefit of sorafenib in delaying time to HCC progression was expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) and taken from recently published randomized trials. The endpoints considered were: survival benefit measured in quality-adjusted life days (QALDs), transplant probability, costs (C) in euro, willingness to pay (WTP), and net health benefit (NHB), where NHB = survival benefit - C/WTP. The calculated WTP of sorafenib in Italy was 346 euro per QALD. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a median survival benefit of 94 QALDs (10% percentile = 38, 90% percentile = 210). In the base-case scenario (HR = 0.47, monthly dropout probability = 5%, median time to LT = 3 months), the gain in LT probability due to sorafenib was 5% and it increased proportionally with increasing median times to LT and decreasing HR. In the cost-benefit analysis, the incremental NHB of Strategy A versus Strategy B was 37 QALDs; it increased as sorafenib HR decreased and when median times to LT were shorter than 6 months, whereas for longer times it gradually dropped, particularly when Strategy B included effective locoregional treatments. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib neoadjuvant therapy is cost-effective by comparison with no therapy for T2-HCC patients waiting for LT, particularly for median times to LT under 6 months.",2010-01-06243,19877181,Hepatology,Alessandro Vitale,2010,51 / 1,165-73,No,19877181,"Alessandro Vitale; Use of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma before liver transplantation: a cost-benefit analysis while awaiting data on sorafenib safety, Hepatology, 2010-Jan; 51(1):0270-9139; 165-73",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sorafenib as neoadjuvant therapy before liver transplant vs. No bridging therapy in the first 6 months,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,197,United States,2008,236.81
6841,Treatment of malignant pleural effusion: PleuRx catheter or talc pleurodesis? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) complicate many advanced malignancies and the median prognosis for those who develop MPEs is 6 months. These effusions lead patients to suffer from significant dyspnea, which may consequently impair mobility and lead to reduced quality of life. There are several treatment options for those with MPE. Thoracentesis may be quick and relatively easy to perform, but has a high recurrence rate; chest tube placement with talc slurry is quite effective at achieving pleurodesis, but this procedure can be quite painful and requires hospitalization. An alternative option is outpatient placement of the Pleurx catheter (Denver Biomedical Inc., Denver, CO) for home-based drainage of effusions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost effectiveness of treating MPE with talc pleurodesis versus placement of Pleurx catheter. METHODS: We used decision analysis to compare treatments for the management of MPE. Cost data for Pleurx and talc treatments were obtained using Medicare reimbursement data for 2008, and outcome data (probability of treatment success and/or complication, and utility of health states) were obtained through literature review. RESULTS: Under our base-case analysis, treatment with talc was less costly than Pleurx (talc, $8170.80; Pleurx, $9011.60) with similar effectiveness (talc, 0.281 quality adjusted life years [QALYs]; Pleurx, 0.276 QALYs). Pleurx became more cost effective (<$100K/QALY) when life expectancy was 6 weeks or less. CONCLUSION: The treatment choice (talc pleurodesis or Pleurx catheter) for those with an MPE and a prognosis of 6 months should be based on the clinical situation and patient preferences, as well as local expertise and success rates of the procedures. A prospective study specific to the palliative care population might help to clarify which treatment is more cost effective in this population in which optimizing quality of life is essential.",2010-01-06246,19839739,J Palliat Med,Aaron M Olden,2010,13 / 1,59-65,No,19839739,"Aaron M Olden; Treatment of malignant pleural effusion: PleuRx catheter or talc pleurodesis?

6842,Economic evaluation of duloxetine versus serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine XR in treating major depressive disorder in Scotland,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorders (MDD) are responsible for substantial direct and indirect health care costs. Despite the availability of numerous treatments, the need for effective pharmacotherapy remains. Duloxetine is a relatively balanced serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with favourable clinical and tolerability profile. The cost-effectiveness of duloxetine versus established SSRIs, venlafaxine XR and mirtazapine was estimated in the UK. METHODS: A decision analysis simulating clinical management of MDD was developed to estimate health and economic impacts of alternative treatments over one year. Patients on treatment experience remission, response without remission, no response, relapse or discontinue the initial regimen. Model outcomes were total treatment costs and quality-adjusted life years. Resource utilization data were derived from literature and practising UK psychiatrists and GPs. The robustness of findings with respect to modelling assumptions was assessed in extensive sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: With similar efficacy to venlafaxine XR but lower drug costs, duloxetine is less costly and marginally more effective than venlafaxine XR both in the overall MDD population and in a more severe subgroup. Duloxetine has a low cost-effectiveness ratio in primary care against SSRIs and mirtazapine, and was found cost-saving against mirtazapine in more severe patients. LIMITATIONS: Cost-effectiveness results are sensitive to changes in efficacy parameters and resource use data were collected from physician panel.

The cost-effectiveness of duloxetine versus established SSRIs, venlafaxine XR and mirtazapine was estimated in the UK. METHODS: A decision analysis simulating clinical management of MDD was developed to estimate health and economic impacts of alternative treatments over one year. Patients on treatment experience remission, response without remission, no response, relapse or discontinue the initial regimen. Model outcomes were total treatment costs and quality-adjusted life years. Resource utilization data were derived from literature and practising UK psychiatrists and GPs. The robustness of findings with respect to modelling assumptions was assessed in extensive sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: With similar efficacy to venlafaxine XR but lower drug costs, duloxetine is less costly and marginally more effective than venlafaxine XR both in the overall MDD population and in a more severe subgroup. Duloxetine has a low cost-effectiveness ratio in primary care against SSRIs and mirtazapine, and was found cost-saving against mirtazapine in more severe patients. LIMITATIONS: Cost-effectiveness results are sensitive to changes in efficacy parameters and resource use data were collected from physician panel. CONCLUSIONS: Duloxetine represents an important option in the treatment of MDD in the UK that can be recommended on economic grounds. With similar efficacy and different side-effect profile to venlafaxine XR it represents a valuable choice to MDD patients.",2010-01-06248,19497623,J Affect Disord,Agnes Benedict,2010,120 / 1-3,94-104,No,19497623,"Agnes Benedict; Economic evaluation of duloxetine versus serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine XR in treating major depressive disorder in Scotland, J Affect Disord, 2010-Jan; 120(1-3):0165-0327; 94-104",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Duloxetine vs. Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,48 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,6304,United Kingdom,2005,15207.47
6845,Accurate ECG Diagnosis of Atrial Tachyarrhythmias Using Quantitative Analysis: A Prospective Diagnostic and Cost-Effectiveness Study,"Quantitative ECG Analysis. Introduction: Optimal atrial tachyarrhythmia management is facilitated by accurate electrocardiogram interpretation, yet typical atrial flutter (AFl) may present without sawtooth F-waves or RR regularity, and atrial fibrillation (AF) may be difficult to separate from atypical AFl or rapid focal atrial tachycardia (AT). We analyzed whether improved diagnostic accuracy using a validated analysis tool significantly impacts costs and patient care. Methods and Results: We performed a prospective, blinded, multicenter study using a novel quantitative computerized algorithm to identify atrial tachyarrhythmia mechanism from the surface ECG in patients referred for electrophysiology study (EPS). In 122 consecutive patients (age 60 +/- 12 years) referred for EPS, 91 sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias were studied. ECGs were also interpreted by 9 physicians from 3 specialties for comparison and to allow healthcare system modeling. Diagnostic accuracy was compared to the diagnosis at EPS. A Markov model was used to estimate the impact of improved arrhythmia diagnosis. We found 13% of typical AFl ECGs had neither sawtooth flutter waves nor RR regularity, and were misdiagnosed by the majority of clinicians (0/6 correctly diagnosed by consensus visual interpretation) but correctly by quantitative analysis in 83% (5/6, P = 0.03). AF diagnosis was also improved through use of the algorithm (92%) versus visual interpretation (primary care: 76%, P < 0.01). Economically, we found that these improvements in diagnostic accuracy resulted in an average cost-savings of $1,303 and 0.007 quality-adjusted-life-years per patient. Conclusions: Typical AFl and AF are frequently misdiagnosed using visual criteria. Quantitative analysis improves diagnostic accuracy and results in improved healthcare costs and patient outcomes.",2010-01-06253,20522152,J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol,David E Krummen,2010,/,,No,20522152,"David E Krummen; Accurate ECG Diagnosis of Atrial Tachyarrhythmias Using Quantitative Analysis: A Prospective Diagnostic and Cost-Effectiveness Study, J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, 2010-May-28; ():1540-8167",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Computerized algorithm vs. Clinician diagnosis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-186142.84,United States,2006,-238967.34
6846,Glucosamine sulphate in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: cost-effectiveness comparison with paracetamol,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine sulphate (GS) compared with paracetamol and placebo (PBO) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. For this purpose, a 6-month time horizon and a health care perspective was used. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cost and effectiveness data were derived from Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index data of the Glucosamine Unum In Die (once-a-day) Efficacy trial study by Herrero-Beaumont et al. Clinical effectiveness was converted into utility scores to allow for the computation of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) For the three treatment arms Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio were calculated and statistical uncertainty was explored using a bootstrap simulation. RESULTS: In terms of mean utility score at baseline, 3 and 6 months, no statistically significant difference was observed between the three groups. When considering the mean utility score changes from baseline to 3 and 6 months, no difference was observed in the first case but there was a statistically significant difference from baseline to 6 months with a p-value of 0.047. When comparing GS with paracetamol, the mean baseline incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was dominant and the mean ICER after bootstrapping was -1376 euro/QALY indicating dominance (with 79% probability). When comparing GS with PBO, the mean baseline and after bootstrapping ICER were 3617.47 and 4285 euro/QALY, respectively.

6848,Cost-Effectiveness of Outpatient Cardiac Monitoring to Detect Atrial Fibrillation After Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extending the duration of continuous electrocardiography after ischemic stroke detects more new cases of atrial fibrillation, which is an important and treatable cause of stroke, but the cost-effectiveness of this approach is unknown. Therefore, we performed a cost-utility analysis of outpatient cardiac monitoring after ischemic stroke. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we determined the lifetime cost and utility of warfarin therapy in a hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, and no contraindication to warfarin therapy. Meta-analysis was used to determine the yield of outpatient cardiac monitoring. RESULTS: Outpatient cardiac monitoring would detect 44 new cases of atrial fibrillation for every 1000 patients monitored. This would result in a gain of 34 quality-adjusted life-years at a net cost of $440 000. Therefore, the cost-utility ratio of outpatient cardiac monitoring would be $13 000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Outpatient monitoring remained cost-effective throughout a wide range of model inputs in sensitivity analyses, including changes in the cost and yield of monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: By identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who will benefit from anticoagulation, outpatient cardiac monitoring is cost-effective after ischemic stroke over a wide range of model inputs.

6849,The economic consequences of non-adherence to lipid-lowering therapy: results from the Anglo-Scandinavian-Cardiac Outcomes Trial,"Summary Background: Adherence to lipid-lowering therapy in clinical practice is less than ideal. Analysis of registry data has indicated that this is associated with poor outcomes. The objective of the present analysis was to assess the impact of high adherence to drug (defined as > 80% of days covered), compared with low adherence to drug (< 50% of days covered) in terms of risk of events and long-term economic consequences. Design: Open-label follow up of a randomised placebo-controlled trial in hypertensive patients. Methods: Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models were used to assess the hazard ratio of patients with high adherence compared with low adherence while controlling for cardiovascular risk. A Markov model was used to predict the long-term costs and health outcomes associated with poor adherence during the follow-up period. Results: Both statistical models indicated that high adherence is associated with improved prognosis [Cox model: 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.98, Poisson model hazard ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.98]. Discounted at 3.5% per year, the Markov model predicts that as a consequence of higher adherence during the follow-up period, costs would be higher ( pound1689 per patient compared with pound1323 per patient) because of higher drug costs, but the projected survival and quality-adjusted survival (QALY) would also be longer (10.83 compared with 10.81 life years and 8.13 compared with 8.11 QALYs).

6850,Optimal screening strategy for familial intracranial aneurysms: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with a family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), defined as 2 or more affected first-degree relatives, have an increased risk of aneurysm formation and rupture. Screening such individuals for intracranial aneurysms is advocated, but its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are unknown, as are the optimal age ranges and interval for screening. METHODS: With a Markov model and Monte Carlo simulations we compared screening with no screening in individuals with a family history of SAH. We varied age ranges (starting screening at 20, 30, or 40 years old, ending screening at 60, 70, or 80 years old) and screening intervals (2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15-year interval), and analyzed the impact in costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: Screening individuals with a family history of SAH is cost-effective. The strategy with the lowest costs per QALY was to screen only twice, at 40 and 55 years old. Sequentially lengthening the screening period and decreasing the screening interval yielded additional health benefits at acceptable costs up to screening from age 20 to 80 every 7 years. More frequent screening within this age range still provided extra QALYs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio more favorable than 26,308/QALY ($38,410/QALY). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for recommendations to screen individuals with 2 or more first-degree relatives with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

6852,The cost-effectiveness of pathogen reduction technology as assessed using a multiple risk reduction model,"BACKGROUND: Pathogen reduction technology (PRT) for labile blood components has the potential to reduce the risk of many adverse events associated with transfusion. Because of the potential broad-spectrum risk reduction capability of PRT, the health economics of PRT could be an important consideration in decision making for this technology. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Decision analytic models comparing current blood safety screens and interventions to riboflavin-based whole blood PRT (currently in development) and separately to platelets (PLTs)-and-plasma PRT from the health care system perspective in Canada were used to assess the cost-utility of PRT in reducing the following adverse events: human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus, syphilis, West Nile virus, bacteria, Chikungunya virus, cytomegalovirus, Trypanosoma cruzi, graft-versus-host disease, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, and transfusion-related immunomodulation. PRT was modeled as an addition to rather than a replacement for current interventions. The potential of PRT to reduce the risk of an unknown pathogen was not assessed. RESULTS: Whole blood PRT was estimated to have a cost-effectiveness of $1,276,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY; 95% confidence interval [CI] approximation, 600,000-3,313,000) compared to current screens and interventions.

CONCLUSIONS: Because of the complexity of transfusion risks and practices, the cost-effectiveness of whole blood or PLTs-and-plasma PRT can be modeled provided that assumptions and simplifications are made.

6854,Cost-effectiveness of screening the US blood supply for Trypanosoma cruzi,"BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is a potential threat to transfusion recipients in the United States. The cost-effectiveness of seven testing strategies was evaluated against no testing and hierarchically in incremental analysis. Donor-specific strategies included testing donors born in endemic countries, testing all donors a specific number of times, or testing all donors every time. Component-specific strategies are based on screening platelet-containing donations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision analytic model simulated the lifetime cost (US dollars) and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) of two hypothetical cohorts of blood recipients, an all-ages and a younger subset, from a 2007 societal perspective. Model variable values were obtained from US screening data, Blood Systems Laboratory, the Health Care Utilization Project, and published literature. RESULTS: For the all-ages cohort, compared to no testing, the cost-effectiveness of testing all donors one time was $757,000 per QALY, all donors two times $970,000 per QALY, and universal testing $1.36 million per QALY. In the all-ages and the younger transfused populations, testing donors with geographical exposure was most cost-effective ($173,000 and $29,000/QALY, respectively).

Model variable values were obtained from US screening data, Blood Systems Laboratory, the Health Care Utilization Project, and published literature. RESULTS: For the all-ages cohort, compared to no testing, the cost-effectiveness of testing all donors one time was $757,000 per QALY, all donors two times $970,000 per QALY, and universal testing $1.36 million per QALY. In the all-ages and the younger transfused populations, testing donors with geographical exposure was most cost-effective ($173,000 and $29,000/QALY, respectively). The most influential variables in the model were related to characteristics of the transfused population: survival and health state utilities. With respect to T. cruzi variables, results were most sensitive to seroprevalence and transmissibility.

6861,Cost-Effectiveness of Targeting Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Therapy With Bivalirudin Versus Heparin Monotherapy According to Predicted Risk of Bleeding,"Background Although bivalirudin compared with unfractionated heparin with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduces bleeding and hospitalization costs in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), little is known about the economic impact of bivalirudin versus heparin alone and at what threshold of procedural bleeding risk bivalirudin would be considered cost-effective. Methods and Results A validated model was used to predict risk of major bleeding for 81 628 National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI Registry patients from 2004 to 2006 who received unfractionated heparin only. Costs were derived from multiple sources including wholesale acquisition costs (for drugs) and single-center data (for PCI-related complications). Based on ISAR-REACT 3, we assumed that bivalirudin would reduce the risk of major bleeding by 33% compared with unfractionated heparin alone. A Markov model was used to estimate lost life expectancy associated with a major bleed. Major bleeding was predicted to occur in 2.2% of patients. Bivalirudin for all patients was estimated to increase costs by $571 per patient, yielding cost-effectiveness ratios of $287 473 per bleeding event averted and $1 173 360 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Bivalirudin was cost saving for patients with a predicted bleeding risk >20% (0.16% of CathPCI population). At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50K and $100K per quality-adjusted life-year gained, bivalirudin was cost-effective for patients with a bleeding risk >/=8% (2.5% patients) and >/=5% (7.9% patients), respectively. Conclusions This decision-analytic modeling study demonstrates that for patients undergoing PCI, substitution of bivalirudin for unfractionated heparin monotherapy is projected to increase costs for virtually all patients and would be considered cost-effective for only a minority of patients with a high bleeding risk. From a policy standpoint, studies such as this, aimed at identifying the appropriate risk threshold for initiating treatment, may help in the development of informed guidelines for the use of expensive therapies.",2010-01-06286,20488917,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,Amit P Amin,2010,/,,No,20488917,"Amit P Amin; Cost-Effectiveness of Targeting Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Therapy With Bivalirudin Versus Heparin Monotherapy According to Predicted Risk of Bleeding, Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, 2010-May-20; ():1941-7705",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bivalirudin vs. Heparin monotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1173360,United States,2008,1410470.24
6862,Cost-effectiveness of fracture prevention in men who receive androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) increases the risk for fractures in patients with prostate cancer. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) before initiating ADT followed by alendronate therapy in men with localized prostate cancer. DESIGN: Markov state-transition model simulating the progression of prostate cancer and the incidence of hip fracture. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of men aged 70 years with locally advanced or high-risk localized prostate cancer starting a 2-year course of ADT after radiation therapy. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: No BMD test or alendronate therapy, a BMD test followed by selective alendronate therapy for patients with osteoporosis, or universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ICERs for the strategy of a BMD test and selective alendronate therapy for patients with osteoporosis and universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test were $66,800 per QALY gained and $178,700 per QALY gained, respectively. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The ICER for universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test decreased to $100,000 per QALY gained, assuming older age, a history of fractures, lower mean BMD before ADT, or a lower cost of alendronate. LIMITATIONS: No evidence shows that alendronate reduces actual fracture rates in patients with prostate cancer who receive ADT. The model predicted fracture rates by using data on the surrogate BMD end point. CONCLUSION: In patients starting adjuvant ADT for locally advanced or high-risk localized prostate cancer, a BMD test followed by selective alendronate for those with osteoporosis is a cost-effective use of resources.

6869,Estimates of the Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Bilateral Cochlear Implantation,"OBJECTIVES:: Objectives were, first, to estimate the additional number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by deaf children from bilateral compared with unilateral implantation (DeltaQ); second, to estimate the additional cost to the healthcare system in the United Kingdom for providing bilateral compared with unilateral implantation (DeltaC); and, third, to compare the values of incremental net benefit (INB), rDeltaQ - DeltaC, with criteria used by policy makers in deciding whether to adopt health technologies. In England and Wales, the healthcare policy-making body must be satisfied that the INB is positive for a maximum value of r of pound30,000 (the ""net-benefit"" criterion). Policy makers may also require the likelihood that the technology is cost-effective to exceed 0.8 (the ""likelihood"" criterion). DESIGN:: An opportunity sample of 180 informants, composed of clinicians/researchers, students, and parents, valued the quality of life of a hypothetical child born profoundly deaf. The child was described in written vignettes as achieving typical outcomes with no implant, a unilateral implant, a unilateral implant with benefit from a contralateral acoustic hearing aid, or bilateral implants. Valuations were made using the time trade-off (TTO) and a visual analog scale (VAS). A decision model was constructed to describe events related to implantation that could occur over a child's lifetime after the decision to implant. A cost and a probability were associated with each event. Monte Carlo simulations modeled the management of cohorts of 3000 children and estimated a value of DeltaC for each child. An increment in quality of life was sampled with replacement from the appropriate distribution of informants' valuations to estimate a value of DeltaQ for each child. The minimum value of r for which the average INB was positive was calculated to test the net-benefit criterion. The proportion of simulations for which the INB was positive when r was pound30,000 was calculated to test the likelihood criterion. RESULTS:: Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of unilateral implantation aligned closely with published estimates, giving credibility to analyses of bilateral implantation. Based on TTO data (VAS data in parentheses), bilateral implantation was associated with an increment in quality of life of +0.063 (+0.076), yielding 1.57 (1.87) additional QALYs at a cost of pound34,000. Net benefit was positive, provided that pound21,768 ( pound18,173) could be spent to gain a QALY. If pound30,000 could be spent, the probability that bilateral implantation is cost-effective was 0.480 (0.539). Thus, the net-benefit criterion, but not the likelihood criterion, was met in both analyses. The net-benefit criterion was also met in analyses based on data from the three groups of informants individually. CONCLUSIONS:: Groups of adults varying widely in age and life experience perceived sufficient additional quality of life from giving children two implants rather than one to mean that bilateral cochlear implantation is possibly a cost-effective use of healthcare resources in the UK. Wide variation in valuations within the groups of informants means that considerable uncertainty surrounds that conclusion. Further data on the costs and benefits of bilateral implantation are needed to resolve the uncertainty.",2010-01-06301,20473177,Ear Hear,A Quentin Summerfield,2010,/,,No,20473177,"A Quentin Summerfield; Estimates of the Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Bilateral Cochlear Implantation, Ear Hear, 2010-May-13; ():0196-0202",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bilateral implantation vs. Unilateral implantation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,21708.9,United Kingdom,2007,54249.67
6870,"Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial: Health-related quality of life outcomes, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND: The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial showed that survival in patients with severe lower limb ischemia (rest pain, tissue loss) who survived postintervention for >2 years after initial randomization to bypass surgery (BSX) vs balloon angioplasty (BAP) was associated with an improvement in subsequent amputation-free and overall survival of about 6 and 7 months, respectively. We now compare the effect on hospital costs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the BSX-first and BAP-first revascularization strategies using a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We measured HRQOL using the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire (VascuQol), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and the EuroQol (EQ-5D) health outcome measure up to 3 years from randomization. Hospital use was measured and valued using United Kingdom National Health Service hospital costs over 3 years. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Uncertainty was assessed using nonparametric bootstrapping of incremental costs and incremental effects. RESULTS: No significant differences in HRQOL emerged when the two treatment strategies were compared. During the first year from randomization, the mean cost of inpatient hospital treatment in patients allocated to BSX ($34,378) was estimated to be about $8469 (95% confidence interval, $2,417-$14,522) greater than that of patients allocated to BAP ($25,909). Owing to increased costs subsequently incurred by the BAP patients, this difference decreased at the end of follow-up to $5521 ($45,322 for BSX vs $39,801 for BAP) and was no longer significant. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a BSX-first strategy was $184,492 per QALY gained. The probability that BSX was more cost-effective than BAP was relatively low given the similar distributions in HRQOL, survival, and hospital costs. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a BSX-first strategy for patients with severe limb ischemia does result in a modest increase in hospital costs, with a small positive but insignificant gain in disease-specific and generic HRQOL. However, the real-world choice between BSX-first and BAP-first revascularization strategies for severe limb ischemia due to infrainguinal disease cannot depend on costs alone and will require a more comprehensive consideration of individual patient preferences conditioned by expectations of survival and other health outcomes.",2010-01-06308,20435261,J Vasc Surg,John F Forbes,2010,51 / 5 Suppl,43S-51S,No,20435261,"John F Forbes; Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial: Health-related quality of life outcomes, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness analysis, J Vasc Surg, 2010-May; 51(5 Suppl):0741-5214; 43S-51S",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,BSX ( Bypass surgery first revascularization) vs. BAP ( Ballon angioplasty first revasculization),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.50,3.50,184492,United States,2006,236848.01
6871,Use of outcomes to evaluate surveillance systems for bioterrorist attacks,"BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance systems can potentially be used to detect a bioterrorist attack earlier than traditional surveillance, by virtue of their near real-time analysis of relevant data. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the area under the curve (AUC) as a comparison metric has been recommended as a practical evaluation tool for syndromic surveillance systems, yet traditional ROC curves do not account for timeliness of detection or subsequent time-dependent health outcomes. METHODS: Using a decision-analytic approach, we predicted outcomes, measured in lives, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs, for a series of simulated bioterrorist attacks. We then evaluated seven detection algorithms applied to syndromic surveillance data using outcomes-weighted ROC curves compared to simple ROC curves and timeliness-weighted ROC curves. We performed sensitivity analyses by varying the model inputs between best and worst case scenarios and by applying different methods of AUC calculation. RESULTS: The decision analytic model results indicate that if a surveillance system was successful in detecting an attack, and measures were immediately taken to deliver treatment to the population, the lives, QALYs and dollars lost could be reduced considerably. The ROC curve analysis shows that the incorporation of outcomes into the evaluation metric has an important effect on the apparent performance of the surveillance systems. The relative order of performance is also heavily dependent on the choice of AUC calculation method. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for mortality, morbidity and costs in the evaluation of syndromic surveillance systems. Incorporating these outcomes into the ROC curve analysis allows for more accurate identification of the optimal method for signaling a possible bioterrorist attack. In addition, the parameters used to construct an ROC curve should be given careful consideration.",2010-01-06314,20459679,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,Kerry McBrien,2010,10 /,25,No,20459679,"Kerry McBrien; Use of outcomes to evaluate surveillance systems for bioterrorist attacks, BMC Med Inform Decis Mak, 2010; 10():1472-6947; 25",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Syndromic surveillance system vs. Do nothing strategy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,3.00,-360000,United States,2006,-462162.5
6872,Cost-utility of molecular adsorbent recirculating system treatment in acute liver failure,"AIM: To determine the short-term cost-utility of molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) treatment in acute liver failure (ALF). METHODS: A controlled retrospective study was conducted with 90 ALF patients treated with MARS from 2001 to 2005. Comparisons were made with a historical control group of 17 ALF patients treated from 2000 to 2001 in the same intensive care unit (ICU) specializing in liver diseases. The 3-year outcomes and number of liver transplantations were recorded. All direct liver disease-related medical expenses from 6 mo before to 3 years after ICU treatment were determined for 31 MARS patients and 16 control patients. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) before MARS treatment was estimated by a panel of ICU doctors and after MARS using a mailed 15D (15-dimensional generic health-related quality of life instrument) questionnaire. The HRQoL, cost, and survival data were combined and the incremental cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was calculated. RESULTS: In surviving ALF patients, the health-related quality of life after treatment was generally high and comparable to the age- and gender-matched general Finnish population. Compared to the controls, the average cost per QALY was considerably lower in the MARS group (64,732 euros vs 133,858 euros) within a timeframe of 3.5 years. The incremental cost of standard medical treatment alone compared to MARS was 10,928 euros, and the incremental number of QALYs gained by MARS was 0.66.

Methods: Cost and outcome data were taken from the Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment (SUIT) study, a 12-month, prospective, observational, naturalistic, multicenter, multicountry study. Costs were assessed in UK pound and outcomes in quality adjusted life years using responses to the EuroQol (EQ-5D); numbers of urine leaks were also estimated. Potential selection bias was countered using multivariate regression and propensity score analysis. Results: Duloxetine alone, duloxetine in combination with conservative treatment, and conservative treatment alone were associated with roughly two fewer leaks per week compared with no treatment.

6879,Cost-Utility Analysis of von Willebrand Disease Screening in Adolescents with Menorrhagia,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a decision analysis model to evaluate the cost utility of von Willebrand disease (VWD) testing in adolescents with menorrhagia. STUDY DESIGN: A 20-year Markov decision analytic model was constructed to evaluate the cost utility of two strategies: testing or not testing for VWD. The model includes probabilities of remaining well, suffering an acute menorrhagia bleeding event, surgical complications, oral contraceptive pill complications, or dying. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from published literature. The prevalence of type 1 VWD in adolescent females with menorrhagia was estimated at 13%. RESULTS: The cost of testing adolescents with menorrhagia for VWD was $1790, versus $1251 for not testing for VWD. The effectiveness of not testing in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (14.237 QALYs) was similar to the VWD testing strategy (14.246 QALYs).

To estimate the cost effectiveness of LTRAs compared with long-acting beta2 agonists as add-on therapy for patients whose asthma symptoms are not controlled on low-dose ICS. An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 2-year, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial set in 53 primary-care practices in the UK. Patients aged 12-80 years with asthma insufficiently controlled with ICS (n = 361) were randomly assigned to add-on LTRAs (n = 176) or long-acting beta2 agonists (n = 185). The main outcome measures were the incremental cost per point improvement in the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ), per point improvement in the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and per QALY gained from perspectives of the UK NHS and society. Over 2 years, the societal cost per patient receiving LTRAs was pound1157 versus pound952 for long-acting beta2 agonists, a (significant, adjusted) increase of pound214 (95% CI 2, 411) [year 2005 values]. Patients receiving LTRAs experienced a non-significant incremental gain of 0.009 QALYs (95% CI -0.077, 0.103).

6882,Trastuzumab beyond progression: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: The continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression in combination with capecitabine as secondary chemotherapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) prolongs progression-free survival without a substantial increase in toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation was used to follow the clinical course of typical patients with MBC. Information on response rates and major adverse effects was derived, and transition probabilities were estimated, based on the results of the Breast International Group 03-05 clinical trial. Direct costs were assessed from the perspective of the Swiss health care system. RESULTS: The addition of trastuzumab to capecitabine is estimated to cost on average an additional of euro33 980 and to yield a gain of 0.35 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro98 329/QALYs gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the willingness-to-pay threshold of euro60 000/QALY was reached in 12% of cases.

6887,A health economic model for evaluating a vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia in the UK,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A live-attenuated vaccine aimed at preventing herpes zoster (HZ) and its main complication, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is available in Europe for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and more. The study objective is to assess the cost effectiveness of a vaccination program for this population in the UK. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model has been developed to simulate the natural history of HZ and PHN and to estimate the lifetime effects of vaccination in the UK. Several health states are defined including good health, HZ, PHN, and death. HZ and PHN health states are further divided to reflect pain severity. RESULTS: The model predicts that a vaccination strategy for those aged over 50 years would lead to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound13,077 per QALY gained from the NHS perspective, when compared to the current strategy of no vaccination. Age-group analyses show that the lowest ICERs ( pound10,984 and pound10,275 for NHS) are observed when vaccinating people between 60-64 and 65-69 years of age. Sensitivity analyses showed that results are sensitive to the duration of vaccine protection, discount rate, utility decrements and pain severity split used. CONCLUSIONS: Using the commonly accepted threshold of pound30,000 per QALY gained in the UK, most scenarios of vaccination programmes preventing HZ and PHN, including the potential use of a repeat dose, may be considered cost-effective by the NHS, especially within the 60 to 69 age-groups.",2010-01-06341,20433704,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Lee Moore,2010,8 /,7,Yes,20433704,"Lee Moore; A health economic model for evaluating a vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia in the UK, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2010; 8():1478-7547; 7",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Herpes zoster virus vaccination vs. No Vaccination,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,11417,United Kingdom,2005,27541.83

6889,Cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance of gastric ulcers to improve survival,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance of presumed-benign gastric ulcers may detect missed malignancy, but its impact on long-term outcomes is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of follow-up surveillance. DESIGN: State-transition model. SETTING: To simulate the clinical course of presumed-benign gastric ulcers, we estimated prevalence and incidence of undetected gastric cancer, surveillance effectiveness, stage-specific disease mortality rates, and costs from clinical studies and databases. PATIENTS: This study involved 60-year-old men diagnosed with presumed-benign gastric ulcers. INTERVENTION: Follow-up endoscopic surveillance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime gastric cancer risk, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: For a cohort of 60-year-old men with presumed-benign gastric ulcers and a 2.6% prevalence of undetected malignancy, the lifetime gastric cancer risk was 4.4%. Surveillance improved (undiscounted) life expectancy by 10.0 days and increased discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 3.4 days at a cost of $146,700 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Surveillance cost less than $50,000 per QALY if the undetected gastric cancer prevalence was 6.5%, and it cost less than $100,000 per QALY if the prevalence was greater than 3.5%, endoscopy costs were 40% lower, or the disutility associated with gastric cancer was 30% lower. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY, the probability that surveillance was cost effective was 25.2%.

6891,Cost-effectiveness analysis of protected carotid artery stent placement versus endarterectomy in high-risk patients,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of carotid angioplasty with stent placement (CAS) under emboli protection versus carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with severe carotid stenosis considered to be at high surgical risk for CEA. METHODS: The probabilities of various outcomes were adopted from the SAPPHIRE trial results. The quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) associated with each treatment modality were estimated by using the frequencies of various quality-adjusted outcomes (QALY weights of ipsilateral stroke, myocardial infarction, and death). Total cost associated with each intervention was computed using the frequency of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death in each group. Costs are expressed in 2006 US$. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for a 1-year postprocedure period. RESULTS: The mean (range) estimated net costs at 1 year for patients treated with CAS and CEA were $12,782 ($12,205-$13,563) and $8,916 ($8,267-$9,766), respectively. Overall QALYs for the CAS and CEA groups were 0.753 and 0.701 [within a range of 0.0 (meaning death) to 0.815 (meaning no adverse events)]. The mean cost per QALY gained for CAS was $16,223 ($15,315-$17,474) and the mean cost per QALY gained for CEA was $12,745 ($11,372-$14,605). The estimated median ICER for CAS versus CEA treatment was $67,891 (-$129,372 to $379,661).

6892,Cost-effectiveness analysis of endovascular versus open surgical repair of acute abdominal aortic aneurysms based on worldwide experience,"PURPOSE: To present an economic evaluation of endovascular versus open surgical repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). METHODS: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is currently being appraised by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. To aid in this appraisal, a health economic model developed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of EVAR for elective treatment of non-ruptured AAAs versus OSR was used for an analysis in the emergency setting. The base case data on 730 patients undergoing EVAR was extracted from our recently published 22-study meta-analysis of 7040 patients presenting with acute AAA (ruptured or symptomatic) treated with either emergency EVAR or OSR. These data reflected a patient population with an average age of 70 years. The base case model, which assumed a time horizon of 30 years and applied all-cause mortality rates, was subjected to a number of 1-way sensitivity analyses. A multivariate analysis was undertaken using 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations. RESULTS: EVAR dominated OSR in the base case analysis, with a mean cumulative cost/patient of pound17,422 ($26,133) for EVAR and pound18,930 ($28,395) for OSR [- pound1508 ($2262) difference]. The mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)/patient was 3.09 for EVAR versus 2.49 for OSR (0.64 difference). EVAR was cost-effective compared with OSR at a threshold value of pound20,000 to pound30,000 ($30,000-$45,000)/QALY. In no single combination tested did open surgical repair provide the patient with more QALYs than EVAR. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results were most sensitive to length of hospital and intensive care stays, use of blood products, and the cost of the evar device, which were the main cost drivers. CONCLUSION: While the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence does not set an absolute limit at which treatments would not be funded, pound30,000 ($45,000) is generally regarded as the upper limit of acceptability. At this level, there is almost a 100% probability that EVAR is a cost-effective treatment for ruptured AAA.",2010-01-06347,20426633,J Endovasc Ther,P D Hayes,2010,17 / 2,174-82,No,20426633,"P D Hayes; Cost-effectiveness analysis of endovascular versus open surgical repair of acute abdominal aortic aneurysms based on worldwide experience, J Endovasc Ther, 2010-Apr; 17(2):1526-6028; 174-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carotid Angioplasty with stent placement (CAS) under emboli protection vs. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,67891,United States,2006,87157.43
6893,Enoxaparin is a cost-effective adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in contemporary practice,"INTRODUCTION: In patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), adjunct treatment with enoxaparin has been shown to provide superior net clinical benefit compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ExTRACT-TIMI) 25 study. The objective of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of enoxaparin and UFH strategies. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a two-stage model: (1) A 30-day decision tree analytical model for the acute treatment phase, and (2) a lifetime Markov model (from 30 days post-STEMI until death) populated using patient survival data. RESULTS: Assuming treatment continuation for 7 days, the mean day 1-30 incremental cost associated with enoxaparin was pound 49 per patient, and mean lifetime incremental cost was pound 592 per patient ( pound 91,091 vs. pound 90,499, respectively). Given an additional 0.048 life years gained per patient with enoxaparin, the cost per life year saved was pound 12,353, and given an additional 0.038 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) per patient with enoxaparin, the cost per QALY was pound 15,413. In an alternative scenario, reflecting contemporary practice assuming early treatment discontinuation at 48 hours, for example following urgent revascularization, the incremental cost per QALY was pound 13,556.

6894,Cost-effectiveness analysis of recurrence score-guided treatment using a 21-gene assay in early breast cancer,"PURPOSE: Most guidelines for hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer recommend addition of adjuvant chemotherapy for most women, leading to overtreatment, which causes considerable morbidity and cost. There has been recent incorporation of gene expression analysis in aiding decision making. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of recurrence score (RS)-guided treatment using 21-gene assay as compared with treatment guided by the Adjuvant! Online program (AOL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment guided either by 21-gene assay or by AOL in a 50-year-old woman with lymph node-negative HR-positive breast cancer over a lifetime horizon. We assumed that women classified to be at high risk all received chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen and those classified to be at low risk received tamoxifen only. The model took a health care payer's perspective with results reported in 2008 Canadian dollars ($). Event rates, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. Both costs and benefits were discounted at 5%. Outcome measures were life years gained, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: For a 50-year-old woman, RS-guided treatment was associated with an incremental lifetime cost of $4,102 and a gain in 0.065 QALY, with an ICER of $63,064 per QALY compared with AOL-guided treatment. ICER increased with increasing cost of 21-gene assay and increasing age of patients. Results were most sensitive to probabilities relating to risk categorization and recurrence rate.

This study determined ""real-life"" alteration in treatment decision and economic implications of Oncotype DX use in women with ER+ LN- ESBC. Methods: Clalit Health Services (CHS, Tel Aviv, Israel), determined the proportion of women in low, intermediate and high-risk groups in the first 368 Oncotype DX assays performed, the change of adjuvant therapy recommendation following the recurrence (RS) results from Oncotype DX use, and associated chemotherapy costs. The risk of recurrence-free survival was derived from prespecified statistical protocols of NCI-sponsored trials conducted by NSABP (B-14 and B-20). Utilities were literature based. A 3% discount rate was employed. Results: Oncotype DX altered recommendations of 40% of patients, 84% of whom were changed from hormone + chemotherapy to hormonal therapy alone. Among high-risk women, 8% switched actual treatment from hormonal therapy to hormone + chemotherapy. By reducing the chemotherapy disutility, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) increased 0.170 years. Use of Oncotype DX costs $10,770 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses revealed that risk reduction in the low-risk population, the cost of adverse events, and the relative risk reduction of recurrence were the most influential variables. Conclusion: Oncotype DX resulted in net QALY gain and increased overall costs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,770. For CHS, Oncotype DX represents an effective and affordable approach to favorably affect the lives of women with ESBC.",2010-01-06356,20412544,Value Health,Shmuel H Klang,2010,/,,Yes,20412544,"Shmuel H Klang; Economic Implications of 21-Gene Breast Cancer Risk Assay from the Perspective of an Israeli-Managed Health-Care Organization, Value Health, 2010-Apr-15; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oncotype DX assay and recommendations for adjuvant treatment vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,10770,United States,2008,12946.38
6896,Economic evaluation of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of hypertension in Greece,"OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. This study evaluates irbesartan in relation to commonly used alternative hypertension therapies losartan and valsartan given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in the general hypertensive population in Greece. METHODS: A Markov model with eight states of health was constructed: hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), post-MI, angina, stroke, poststroke, heart failure, and death. The model has an annual cycle and estimates mean quality-adjusted survival and treatment cost, which reflect the hypertension treatment and managing cardiovascular events. Risk functions were used to conduct extrapolations. Data on treatment effectiveness, quality of life (QOL) and epidemiology were obtained from published clinical trials and studies. The database of the main Greek National Social Insurance Institute (IKA) was analyzed to estimate the cost of events. The analysis was done from a payer perspective. All outcomes were discounted, and prices correspond to 2008. RESULTS: The estimated patient cost per annum was stable angina <euro>2,252, unstable angina <euro>2,572, myocardial infarction <euro>2,473, post-MI <euro>1,677, stroke <euro>12,233, poststroke <euro>1,240, heart failure <euro>2,655, coronary angiography <euro>1,544, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty <euro>6,511, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery <euro>11,514. For the baseline group (age 57 years, systolic blood pressure 147 mmHg, cholesterol 6.00 mmol/L, body mass index 29) of men with mild to moderate hypertension, for irbesartan, the total treatment cost was <euro>15,146, for losartan <euro>15,696 and for valsartan <euro>15,613; the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were irbesartan 12.67, losartan 12.63 and valsartan 12.64. For the baseline group of women with mild to moderate hypertension, the total treatment cost was <euro>12,945 for irbesartan, <euro>13,424 for losartan and <euro>13,379 for valsartan; QALYs were 14.29 for irbesartan, 14.27 for losartan and 14.27 for valsartan. For men with severe hypertension, for irbesartan and losartan, the total treatment cost was <euro>18,679 and <euro>21,488 and QALYs 12.47 and 12.37, respectively. For women, the total treatment cost was <euro>16,202 and <euro>19,099 and QALYs 14.16 and 14.09, respectively.
