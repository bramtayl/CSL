23701,Identification of Abusive Head Trauma in High-Risk Infants: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abusive head trauma detection strategies in emergency department (ED) settings with and without rapid magnetic resonance imaging (rMRI) availability. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov decision model estimated outcomes in well-appearing infants with high-risk chief complaints. In an ED without rMRI, we considered 3 strategies: clinical judgment, universal head computed tomography (CT), or Pittsburgh Infant Brain Injury Score (PIBIS) with CT. In an ED with rMRI for brain availability, we considered additional strategies: universal rMRI, universal rMRI with CT, PIBIS with rMRI, and PIBIS with rMRI followed by CT . Correct diagnosis eliminated future risk; missed AHT led to re-injury risk with associated poor outcomes. Cohorts were followed for one year from a healthcare perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Main outcomes evaluated in this study were AHT correctly identified and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: Without rMRI availability, PIBIS followed by CT was the most cost-effective strategy. Results were sensitive to variation of CT-induced cancer parameters and AHT prevalence. When rMRI was available, universal rMRI followed by confirmatory CT cost $25,791 to gain one additional quality-adjusted life-year compared with PIBIS followed by rMRI with confirmatory CT. In both models, clinical judgement was less effective than alternative strategies. CONCLUSIONS: By applying CT to a more targeted population, PIBIS decreases radiation exposure and is more effective for AHT identification compared with clinical judgment. When rMRI is available, universal rMRI with CT is more effective than PIBIS and is economically favorable. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

23708,Cost-utility analysis of inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia from the perspective of Taiwan's health care system,"OBJECTIVES: We conduct a cost-utility analysis of inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) versus chemotherapy as the standard of care (SOC) for adults with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: A Markov model incorporating transition probabilities between health states was applied to simulate disease progression. The model inputs, including overall survival, progression-free survival, and utility parameters, were obtained from the INO-VATE ALL trial and literatures. The Taiwan Cancer Registry Database and the Health and Welfare Database were utilized to identify the patient cohort and medical costs from the perspective of National Health Insurance Administration. The lifetime medical costs (in 2017 US dollars), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were the main study outcomes. RESULTS: The lifetime medical costs for INO and SOC were $176,795 and $69,496, and the QALYs gained were 2.25 and 0.84, respectively. The ICER for INO versus SOC was $76,044 per QALY gained, which is slightly more than three times Taiwan''s gross domestic product per capita (i.e., $73,224). Favorable economic results for INO versus SOC were found with an increased time horizon for model simulation, less discounting for the future benefit, and higher stem cell transplantation (SCT) rate after INO treatment; and among patients aged less than 55 years, with no SCT history, or in the first salvage treatment. CONCLUSIONS: INO versus SOC has higher costs but is more effective. The use of INO is favorable for patients in the early treatment course and when more future benefit associated with INO is considered.",2020-01-33424,0,Int.

23709,Cost-effectiveness of a specialist smoking cessation package compared with standard smoking cessation services for people with severe mental illness in England: a trial-based economic evaluation from the SCIMITAR+ study,"AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a specialist smoking cessation package for people with severe mental illness DESIGN: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective over a 12-month time horizon. Total costs, including smoking cessation, health-care and social services costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), derived from the five-level EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D-5 L), collected from a randomized controlled trial, were used as outcome measures. The bootstrap technique was employed to assess the uncertainty. SETTING: Sixteen primary care and 21 secondary care mental health sites in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adult smokers with bipolar affective disorder, schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia and related illnesses (n = 526). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: A bespoke smoking cessation (BSC) package for people with severe mental illness offered up to 12 individual sessions with a mental health smoking cessation practitioner versus usual care (UC). Of the participants who were randomized, 261 were in UC group and 265 were in BSC group. MEASUREMENTS: BSC intervention cost was estimated from the treatment log. Costs of UC, health-care and social services and EQ-5D-5 L were collected at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Incremental costs and incremental QLAYs were estimated using regression adjusting for respective baseline values and other baseline covariates. FINDINGS: The mean total cost in the BSC group was 270 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -1690 to 1424] lower than in the UC group, while the mean QALYs were 0.013 (95% CI = -0.008 to 0.045) higher, leading to BSC dominating UC (76% probability of cost-effective at 20 000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: A bespoke smoking cessation package for people with severe mental illness is likely to be cost-effective over 12 months compared with usual care provided by the UK''s National Health Service and personal social services.

23710,"Combining vascularized lymph node transfer with autologous breast reconstruction: A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database cost-utility analysis","BACKGROUND: The cost effectiveness of combining vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) with autologous breast reconstruction has not been established. Herein we describe the use of Markov modeling to evaluate the cost utility of VLNT with delayed autologous breast reconstruction for patients with breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL). METHODS: We conducted a cost effectiveness analysis using a Markov model with microsimulation. The characteristics and associated life expectancy of the hypothetical patients were derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Costs of were derived from the publicly available sources and health economics literature. The utilities were based on the best available literature. The relative effectiveness of VLNT was derived from a meta-analysis of the literature. A specific strategy is considered attractive if the estimate of incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) is less than the amount decision makers are willing to pay for an additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain. A baseline willingness to pay of $50,000 USD per additional QALY was used for analysis. RESULTS: The base case situation demonstrated an overall ICER of $13898.76/QALY for adding VLNT to delayed autologous abdominally based breast reconstruction in the situation where lymphedema is already present, which suggests it is cost-effective at the chosen willingness to pay. DISCUSSION: This cost-utility simulation demonstrates that it is cost effective to combine delayed breast reconstruction with VLNT in patients with existing lymphedema. This could have implications for the application of the evolving technique of VLNT in the treatment of different subpopulations of breast cancer patients, and future clinical research.

23711,Changing the Health Behavior of Patients With Cardiovascular Disease Through an Electronic Health Intervention in Three Different Countries: Cost-Effectiveness Study in the Do Cardiac Health: Advanced New Generation Ecosystem (Do CHANGE) 2 Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: During the last few decades, preventing the development of cardiovascular disease has become a mainstay for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It has been suggested that interventions should focus more on committed approaches of self-care, such as electronic health techniques. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide evidence to understand the financial consequences of implementing the ""Do Cardiac Health: Advanced New Generation Ecosystem"" (Do CHANGE 2) intervention, which was evaluated in a multisite randomized controlled trial to change the health behavior of patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis of the Do CHANGE 2 intervention was performed with the Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing tool, based on a Markov model of five health states. The following two types of costs were considered for both study groups: (1) health care costs (ie, costs associated with the time spent by health care professionals on service provision, including consultations, and associated unplanned hospitalizations, etc) and (2) societal costs (ie, costs attributed to the time spent by patients and informal caregivers on care activities). RESULTS: The Do CHANGE 2 intervention was less costly in Spain (incremental cost was -2514.90) and more costly in the Netherlands and Taiwan (incremental costs were 1373.59 and 1062.54, respectively). Compared with treatment as usual, the effectiveness of the Do CHANGE 2 program in terms of an increase in quality-adjusted life-year gains was slightly higher in the Netherlands and lower in Spain and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: In general, we found that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio strongly varied depending on the country where the intervention was applied. The Do CHANGE 2 intervention showed a positive cost-effectiveness ratio only when implemented in Spain, indicating that it saved financial costs in relation to the effect of the intervention.

The following two types of costs were considered for both study groups: (1) health care costs (ie, costs associated with the time spent by health care professionals on service provision, including consultations, and associated unplanned hospitalizations, etc) and (2) societal costs (ie, costs attributed to the time spent by patients and informal caregivers on care activities). RESULTS: The Do CHANGE 2 intervention was less costly in Spain (incremental cost was -2514.90) and more costly in the Netherlands and Taiwan (incremental costs were 1373.59 and 1062.54, respectively). Compared with treatment as usual, the effectiveness of the Do CHANGE 2 program in terms of an increase in quality-adjusted life-year gains was slightly higher in the Netherlands and lower in Spain and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: In general, we found that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio strongly varied depending on the country where the intervention was applied. The Do CHANGE 2 intervention showed a positive cost-effectiveness ratio only when implemented in Spain, indicating that it saved financial costs in relation to the effect of the intervention.

23714,Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis of a clinical medication review focused on personal goals in older persons with polypharmacy compared to usual care: Economic evaluation of the DREAMeR study,"AIMS: The ageing society may lead to increasing healthcare expenditure. A clinical medication review (CMR) could potentially reduce costs. The aim of this study is to perform a cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective of a patient-centred CMR. METHODS: A trial-based cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed as part of the DREAMeR study, a pragmatic controlled trial that randomised patients aged >=70 years using at least seven drugs to either CMR or usual care. Over six months, healthcare consumption and drug use were collected to estimate costs, and effects were collected in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) measured with EQ-5D-5 L and EQ-VAS and as reduced health-related complaints with impact on patients'' daily lives. RESULTS: The total mean costs per patient (n = 588) over six months were 4,189 +/- 6,596 for the control group (n = 294) and 4,008 +/- 6,678 for the intervention group (n = 294), including estimated intervention costs of 199 +/- 67, which resulted in a mean incremental total cost savings of 181 for the intervention group compared to the control group. Compared to the control group, for the intervention group, the mean incremental QALYs over six months were: -0.00217 measured with EQ-5D and 0.003 measured with EQ-VAS. The incremental effect of reduced health-related complaints with impact was -0.34. There was a likelihood of >90% that the intervention was cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of a patient-centred CMR were inconsistent with no benefits on HR-QoL measured with EQ-5D-5 L and small benefits on HR-QoL measured with EQ-VAS and health-related complaints with impact on patients'' daily lives. Additionally, a CMR could potentially be cost saving from a societal perspective. Copyright © 2020 The British Pharmacological Society.",2020-01-33435,0,Int. J. Med. Rob. Comput.

23716,The cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy or atezolizumab as second-line therapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma in the United States,"Aims: Pembrolizumab demonstrated significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) vs. chemotherapy in the Phase III KEYNOTE-045 trial, and is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Using longer follow-up and individual patient-data from KEYNOTE-045, this study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy or atezolizumab from a US payer perspective. Materials and methods: A partitioned-survival model was developed over a 20-year time horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were extrapolated using a piecewise modelling approach, where patient-level data from KEYNOTE-045 were used for the initial period followed by parametric distributions. OS of atezolizumab was estimated by indirect treatment comparisons based on KEYNOTE-045 and IMvigor211. Different scenarios were explored in the absence of indirect comparisons on PFS and time-on-treatment (ToT) between pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Drug acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse events, and terminal care costs were considered. Results: Compared with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 1.33 life-years and 1.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an incremental cost of $106,299, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $93,481/QALY gained. Pembrolizumab dominated atezolizumab in extending patients'' life by 0.89 years and 0.76 QALYs, while reducing costs by $26,458. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness included survival extrapolation, OS hazard ratio of pembrolizumab vs. atezolizumab, and time horizon. Pembrolizumab had a 66% and 100% probability of being cost-effective vs. chemotherapy and atezolizumab, respectively, at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Limitations and conclusions: Uncertainties remain with extrapolated PFS and OS for pembrolizumab, OS indirect comparison, and ToT for atezolizumab. Despite these limitations, the model used robust methods to estimate key clinical endpoints with patient-level data from longer follow-up of KEYNOTE-045.

23718,Cost-Effectiveness and Net Monetary Benefit of olaparib Maintenance Therapy Versus No Maintenance Therapy After First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Advanced BRCA1/2-Mutated Ovarian Cancer in the Italian National Health Service,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and net monetary benefit of olaparib maintenance therapy compared with no maintenance therapy after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in newly diagnosed advanced BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective. METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model in which a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed advanced BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer was assigned to receive either olaparib maintenance therapy or active surveillance (Italian standard of care) after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy to compare cost-effectiveness and net monetary benefit of the 2 strategies. Data on clinical outcomes were obtained from related clinical trial literature and extrapolated using parametric survival analyses. Data on costs were derived from Italian official sources and relevant real-world studies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) were computed and compared against an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of 16,372 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. We used deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to assess how uncertainty affects results; we also performed scenario analyses to compare results under different pricing settings. FINDINGS: In the base-case scenario, during a 50-year time horizon, the total costs for patients treated with olaparib therapy and active surveillance were 124,359 and 97,043, respectively, and QALYs gained were 7.29 and 4.88, respectively, with an ICER of 9,515 per life-year gained, an ICUR of 11,345 per QALY gained, and an INMB of 12,104. In scenario analyses, considering maximum selling prices for all other drugs, ICUR decreased to 11,311 per QALY and 7,498 per QALY when a 10% and 20% discount, respectively, was applied to the olaparib official price, and the INMB increased to 12,186 and 21,366, respectively. DSA found that the model results were most sensitive to the proportion of patients with relapsing disease in response to platinum-based chemotherapy, time receiving olaparib first-line maintenance treatment, and subsequent treatments price. According to PSAresults, olaparib was associated with a probability of being cost-effective at a 16,372 per QALY WTP threshold ranging from 70% to 100% in the scenarios examined. IMPLICATIONS: Our analysis indicates that olaparib maintenance therapy may deliver a significant health benefit with a contained upfront cost during a 50-year time horizon, from the Italian NHS perspective, providing value in a setting with curative intent.

23719,Cost-Effectiveness of Low-Dose Colchicine after Myocardial Infarction in the Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT),"AIMS: In the randomized, placebo-controlled Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT) of 4745 patients enrolled within 30 days after myocardial infarction, low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once daily) reduced the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization. To assess the in-trial period and lifetime cost-effectiveness of low-dose colchicine therapy compared to placebo in post-MI patients on standard-of-care therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multistate Markov model was developed incorporating the primary efficacy and safety results from COLCOT, as well as healthcare costs and utilities from the Canadian healthcare system perspective. All components of the primary outcome, non-cardiovascular deaths, and pneumonia were included as health states in the model as both primary and recurrent events. In the main analysis, a deterministic approach was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the trial period (24 months) and lifetime (20 years). Over the in-trial period, the addition of colchicine to post-MI standard-of-care treatment decreased the mean overall per patient costs by 47%, from $502 to $265 CAD, and increased the quality adjusted life years (QALYs) from 1.30 to 1.34. The lifetime per patient costs were further reduced (69%) and QALYs increased with colchicine therapy (from 8.82 to 11.68). As a result, both in-trial and lifetime ICERs indicated colchicine therapy was a dominant strategy. CONCLUSION: Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that the addition of colchicine to standard-of-care therapy after myocardial infarction is economically dominant and therefore generates cost savings.

23721,Cost effectiveness of surgery for drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy in the US,"OBJECTIVE: Surgery is an effective but costly treatment for many patients with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (DR-TLE). We aim to evaluate whether, in the United States, 1) surgery is cost-effective compared to medical management for patients deemed surgical candidates, 2) surgical evaluation is cost-effective for DR-TLE patients in general. METHODS: We use a semi-Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of surgery and surgical evaluation over a lifetime horizon. We use 2nd order Monte Carlo simulations to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analyses to estimate variation in model output. We adopt both healthcare and societal perspectives, including direct healthcare costs (e.g. surgery, AEDs) and indirect costs (e.g. lost earnings by patients and care providers.) We compare incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to societal willingness-to-pay (~$100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year) to determine whether surgery is cost-effective. RESULTS: Epilepsy surgery is cost effective compared to medical management in surgically eligible patients by virtue of being cost saving ($328K vs. 423K) and more effective (16.6 QALY vs. 13.6 QALY) than medical management in the long run. Surgical evaluation is cost-effective in DR-TLE patients even if the probability of being deemed a surgical candidate is only 5%. From a societal perspective, surgery becomes cost effective within 3 years and 89% of simulations favor surgery over the lifetime horizon. CONCLUSION: For surgically eligible DR-TLE patients, surgery is cost-effective. For DR-TLE patients in general, referral for surgical evaluation (and possible subsequent surgery) is cost-effective.

We aim to evaluate whether, in the United States, 1) surgery is cost-effective compared to medical management for patients deemed surgical candidates, 2) surgical evaluation is cost-effective for DR-TLE patients in general. METHODS: We use a semi-Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of surgery and surgical evaluation over a lifetime horizon. We use 2nd order Monte Carlo simulations to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analyses to estimate variation in model output. We adopt both healthcare and societal perspectives, including direct healthcare costs (e.g. surgery, AEDs) and indirect costs (e.g. lost earnings by patients and care providers.) We compare incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to societal willingness-to-pay (~$100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year) to determine whether surgery is cost-effective. RESULTS: Epilepsy surgery is cost effective compared to medical management in surgically eligible patients by virtue of being cost saving ($328K vs. 423K) and more effective (16.6 QALY vs. 13.6 QALY) than medical management in the long run. Surgical evaluation is cost-effective in DR-TLE patients even if the probability of being deemed a surgical candidate is only 5%. From a societal perspective, surgery becomes cost effective within 3 years and 89% of simulations favor surgery over the lifetime horizon. CONCLUSION: For surgically eligible DR-TLE patients, surgery is cost-effective. For DR-TLE patients in general, referral for surgical evaluation (and possible subsequent surgery) is cost-effective. DR-TLE patients should be referred for surgical evaluation without hesitation on cost-effectiveness grounds. Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Neurology.",2020-01-33442,0,Can. Urol. Assoc.

23725,"Model-Based Cost-Effectiveness of State-level Latent Tuberculosis Interventions in California, Florida, New York and Texas","BACKGROUND: Targeted testing and treatment (TTT) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a recommended strategy to accelerate TB reductions and further tuberculosis elimination in the United States (US). Evidence on cost-effectiveness of TTT for key populations can help advance this goal. METHODS: We used a model of TB transmission to estimate the numbers of individuals who could be tested by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and treated for LTBI with three months of self-administered rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP) under various TTT scenarios. Specifically, we considered rapidly scaling up TTT among people who are non-US-born, diabetic, HIV-positive, homeless or incarcerated in California, Florida, New York, and Texas - states where more than half of US TB cases occur. We projected costs (from the healthcare system perspective, in 2018 dollars), thirty-year reductions in TB incidence, and incremental cost effectiveness (cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) for TTT in each modeled population. RESULTS: The projected cost effectiveness of TTT differed substantially by state and population, while the health impact (number of TB cases averted) was consistently greatest among the non-US-born. TTT was most cost-effective among persons living with HIV (from $2,828/QALY gained in Florida to $11,265/QALY gained in New York) and least cost-effective among people with diabetes (from $223,041/QALY gained in California to $817,753 /QALY in New York). CONCLUSIONS: The modeled cost-effectiveness of TTT for LTBI varies across states but was consistently greatest among people living with HIV, moderate among people who are non-US-born, incarcerated, or homeless, and least cost-effective among people living with diabetes.

23736,"Model-Based Cost-Effectiveness of State-level Latent Tuberculosis Interventions in California, Florida, New York and Texas","BACKGROUND: Targeted testing and treatment (TTT) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a recommended strategy to accelerate TB reductions and further tuberculosis elimination in the United States (US). Evidence on cost-effectiveness of TTT for key populations can help advance this goal. METHODS: We used a model of TB transmission to estimate the numbers of individuals who could be tested by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and treated for LTBI with three months of self-administered rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP) under various TTT scenarios. Specifically, we considered rapidly scaling up TTT among people who are non-US-born, diabetic, HIV-positive, homeless or incarcerated in California, Florida, New York, and Texas - states where more than half of US TB cases occur. We projected costs (from the healthcare system perspective, in 2018 dollars), thirty-year reductions in TB incidence, and incremental cost effectiveness (cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) for TTT in each modeled population. RESULTS: The projected cost effectiveness of TTT differed substantially by state and population, while the health impact (number of TB cases averted) was consistently greatest among the non-US-born. TTT was most cost-effective among persons living with HIV (from $2,828/QALY gained in Florida to $11,265/QALY gained in New York) and least cost-effective among people with diabetes (from $223,041/QALY gained in California to $817,753 /QALY in New York). CONCLUSIONS: The modeled cost-effectiveness of TTT for LTBI varies across states but was consistently greatest among people living with HIV, moderate among people who are non-US-born, incarcerated, or homeless, and least cost-effective among people living with diabetes.

23744,Cost-effectiveness of a Stepwise Approach vs Standard Care for Diabetes Prevention in India,"Importance: A stepwise approach that includes screening and lifestyle modification followed by the addition of metformin for individuals with high risk of diabetes is recommended to delay progression to diabetes; however, there is scant evidence regarding whether this approach is cost-effective. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation study included 578 adults with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or both. Participants were enrolled in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program, a randomized clinical trial with 3-year follow-up conducted at a diabetes care and research center in Chennai, India. Interventions: The intervention group underwent a 6-month lifestyle modification curriculum plus stepwise addition of metformin; the control group received standard lifestyle advice. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cost, health benefits, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated from multipayer (including direct medical costs) and societal (including direct medical and nonmedical costs) perspectives. Costs and ICERs were reported in 2019 Indian rupees (INR) and purchasing power parity-adjusted international dollars (INT $). Results: The mean (SD) age of the 578 participants was 44.4 (9.3) years, and 364 (63.2%) were men. Mean (SD) body mass index was 27.9 (3.7), and the mean (SD) glycated hemoglobin level was 6.0% (0.5). Implementing lifestyle modification and metformin was associated with INR 10549 (95% CI, INR 10134-10964) (INT $803 [95% CI, INT $771-834]) higher direct costs; INR 5194 (95% CI, INR 3187-INR 7201) (INT $395; 95% CI, INT $65-147) higher direct nonmedical costs, an absolute diabetes risk reduction of 10.2% (95% CI, 1.9% to 18.5%), and an incremental gain of 0.099 (95% CI, 0.018 to 0.179) quality-adjusted life-years per participant. From a multipayer perspective (including screening costs), mean ICERs were INR 1912 (INT $145) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, INR 191090 (INT $14539) per diabetes case prevented and/or delayed, and INR 196960 (INT $14986) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the scenario of a 50% increase or decrease in screening and intervention costs, the mean ICERs varied from INR 855 (INT $65) to INR 2968 (INT $226) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, from INR 85495 (INT $6505) to INR 296681 (INT $22574) per diabetes case prevented, and from INR 88121 (INT $6705) to INR 305798 (INT $23267) per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

We used 12% subclinical cellular rejection and 3% subclinical antibody-mediated rejection (SC-ABMR) for the base-case cohort. Results favored 1-time screening at peak SCR incidence rather than repeated screening. Screening 2 or 3 times was favored only with age <35 years and with high SC-ABMR incidence. Compared to biomarkers, protocol biopsy yielded more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at lower cost. A 12-month biopsy cost $13 318/QALY for the base-case cohort. Screening for cellular rejection in the absence of SC-ABMR was less cost effective with 12-month biopsy costing $46 370/QALY. Screening was less cost effective in patients >60 years. Using biomarker twice or thrice was cost effective only if biomarker cost was <$700. In conclusion, in KT, screening for SCR more than once during the first year is not economically reasonable.

23756,Economic analysis of screening for subclinical rejection in kidney transplantation using protocol biopsies and noninvasive biomarkers,"Subclinical rejection (SCR) screening in kidney transplantation (KT) using protocol biopsies and noninvasive biomarkers has not been evaluated from an economic perspective. We assessed cost-effectiveness from the health sector perspective of SCR screening in the first year after KT using a Markov model that compared no screening with screening using protocol biopsy or biomarker at 3 months, 12 months, 3 and 12 months, or 3, 6, and 12 months. We used 12% subclinical cellular rejection and 3% subclinical antibody-mediated rejection (SC-ABMR) for the base-case cohort. Results favored 1-time screening at peak SCR incidence rather than repeated screening. Screening 2 or 3 times was favored only with age <35 years and with high SC-ABMR incidence. Compared to biomarkers, protocol biopsy yielded more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at lower cost. A 12-month biopsy cost $13 318/QALY for the base-case cohort. Screening for cellular rejection in the absence of SC-ABMR was less cost effective with 12-month biopsy costing $46 370/QALY. Screening was less cost effective in patients >60 years. Using biomarker twice or thrice was cost effective only if biomarker cost was <$700. In conclusion, in KT, screening for SCR more than once during the first year is not economically reasonable.

23760,Cost-Effectiveness of Esketamine Nasal Spray for Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of esketamine, a novel intranasally dosed antidepressant, for patients in the United States with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: A decision-analytic model parameterized with efficacy data from phase 3 randomized trials of esketamine was used to simulate the effects of treatment with esketamine versus oral antidepressants over a 5-year horizon, from both societal and health care sector perspectives. Outcomes included remission and response of depression, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for esketamine. Value-based prices were calculated, defined as the per-dose price at which esketamine would become cost-effective given cost-effectiveness thresholds of $50,000/QALY, $100,000/QALY, and $150,000/QALY. Uncertainty in these outcomes was assessed with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Key model parameters included the efficacy of esketamine versus oral antidepressants (relative risk of 1.39 for remission; 1.32 for response) and the monthly cost of esketamine ($5,572 for month 1; $1,699-$2,244 thereafter). RESULTS: Over 5 years, esketamine was projected to increase time in remission from 25.3% to 31.1% of life-years, resulting in a gain of 0.07 QALYs. Esketamine increased societal costs by $16,617 and health care sector costs by $16,995. Base case ICERs were $237,111/QALY (societal) and $242,496/QALY (health care sector). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a greater than 95% likelihood that esketamine''s ICER would be above $150,000/QALY. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of $150,000/QALY, esketamine''s value-based price was approximately $140/dose (versus a current price of $240/dose). CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine is unlikely to be cost-effective for management of treatment-resistant depression in the United States unless its price falls by more than 40%.",2020-01-33452,0,Contemp. Clin.

23762,Cost-Effectiveness of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance: An Assessment of Benefits and Harms,"OBJECTIVES: The value of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is defined by the balance of benefits, i.e., early tumor detection, and potential harms, related to false positive and indeterminate results. Although physical harms can be observed in 15%-20% of patients with cirrhosis undergoing HCC surveillance, previous cost-effectiveness analyses have not incorporated costs of harms. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCC surveillance including both benefits and harms. DESIGN: We constructed a Markov model to compare surveillance strategies of ultrasound (US) alone, US and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and no surveillance in 1 million simulated patients with compensated cirrhosis. Harms included imaging and biopsy in patients undergoing surveillance for HCC. Model inputs were based on literature review, and costs were derived from the Medicare fee schedule, with all costs inflated to 2018 dollars. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per incremental quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, US with AFP was the dominant strategy over both US alone and no surveillance. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, US with AFP was the most cost-effective strategy in 80.1% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. In our threshold analyses, an HCC incidence >0.4% per year and surveillance adherence >19.5% biannually were necessary for US with AFP to be cost-effective compared with no surveillance.

23764,Comparative Cost-Utility Analysis of Regorafenib and Trifluridine/Tipiracil in The Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in Japan,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cost utility of regorafenib and trifluridine/tipiracil (T/T) compared with that of best supportive care (BSC) in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with, or not considered candidates for, available therapies, including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapies; anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents; and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agents, in Japan. METHODS: Efficacy data, utility values, and costs were extracted from published studies. The cost and effectiveness of regorafenib and of T/T were compared with those of BSC and examined between the 2 agents over a 5-year time horizon using a partitioned survival analysis. The health outcomes were life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The costs were year-2018 revisions to the drug prices and medical fees. The uncertainty and robustness of the model were verified by 1-way sensitivity analysis, probability sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis compared with different clinical studies. A 2% per-annum discount was applied to expenses and QALYs. The willingness-to-pay threshold used was 5 million Japanese yen (JPY). FINDINGS: Regorafenib and T/T had incremental costs of 11,898,982 JPY (107,781 US dollars [USD]) and 5,000,141 JPY (45,291 USD), incremental effects of 0.249 QALYs (0.280 LYs) and 0.344 QALYs (0.421 LYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 47,773,791 JPY (432,734 USD) and 14,550,577 JPY (131,799 USD) per QALY, respectively. Results of sensitivity analyses all exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of 15 million JPY. In the comparison of the 2 agents, T/T was a dominant alternative over regorafenib. IMPLICATIONS: As a third-line or later treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in Japan, T/T is cost-effective compared with BSC, whereas regorafenib is not. It is necessary to adjust the price of regorafenib based on the results of this analysis, with the improvement of clinical parameters such as survival time and adverse events.

23768,Cost-effectiveness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the detection of endovascular aneurysm repair-related endoleaks requiring treatment,"OBJECTIVE: Follow-up after endovascular aneurysm repair is necessary to detect potentially life-threatening complications such as endoleaks. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is often used as standard of care for follow-up. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been shown to be a viable and fast real-time nonionizing imaging modality with equivalent diagnostic accuracy while also being superior to color Doppler ultrasound. The aim of this cost-utility analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this imaging method in comparison to others for the evaluation of endoleaks requiring treatment. METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with CTA, MRA, CEUS, and color Doppler ultrasound. Model input parameters were obtained from recent literature. The applied sensitivity and specificity values amounted to 90.5% and 100.0% for CTA, 96.0% and 100.0% for MRA, 94.0% and 95.0% for CEUS, and 82.0% and 93.0% for color Doppler ultrasound. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate uncertainty of model results. To evaluate cost-effectiveness, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were reported as a measure representing the economic value of a strategy compared with an alternative. The willingness to pay was set to $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario for a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY, CEUS was the most cost-effective of the four diagnostic strategies with estimated costs of $17,383 and effectiveness of 9.770 QALYs. CTA was estimated to result in lifetime costs of $17,679 with an expected effectiveness of 9.768 QALYs, whereas color Doppler ultrasound showed expected costs of $17,287 with 9.763 QALYs. Expected costs and effectiveness of MRA amounted to $17,945 and 9.771 QALYs each. Base-case estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for CEUS vs color Doppler ultrasound equaled $14,173.52/QALY.

23771,Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment regimens with obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy in Japan for untreated follicular lymphoma patients,"AIMS: Obinutuzumab (GA101; G) is a new treatment for follicular lymphoma (FL) that is anticipated to have greater efficacy than the current treatment, rituximab (R). The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of G plus chemotherapy (G + Chemo) against that of R plus chemotherapy (R + Chemo) for patients in Japan with previously untreated FL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We localized a previously reported cost-effectiveness model using the Japanese cost data. For estimating costs adapted in the model, FL patients treated with R were identified from Japanese hospital-based claims database and classified into three treatment regimen groups according to chemotherapies used with R: CHOP, CVP, and bendamustine (B). Based on services per patient and cost items, parameters determining the cost amounts were derived using a multivariate generalized linear mixed model to estimate the direct medical costs for each treatment regimen group for G and R. For the utility, same values in the previous model were used. Lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated under the payer''s perspective. RESULTS: The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in million JPY per QALY for G-CHOP vs. R-CHOP, G-CVP vs. R-CVP, and G-B vs. R-B were 5.4, 4.3, and 4.8, respectively. ICERs were lower than 7.5 million JPY per QALY, which is the cost-effectiveness threshold for cancer treatments, and showed that G + Chemo is a cost-effective treatment regimen for Japanese patients with previously untreated FL. Lifetime direct medical costs were lowest in the R-B group because hospitalization costs that accounted for most of the total cost were lowest in this group. Limitations and conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of G + Chemo is acceptable in Japan.

23774,Comparative Cost-effectiveness of Aflibercept and Ramucirumab in Combination with Irinotecan and Fluorouracil-based Therapy for the Second-line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in Japan,"PURPOSE: The addition of aflibercept (AFL) or ramucirumab (RAM) to folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) prolongs overall survival and progression-free survival compared with FOLFIRI alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as second-line therapy. Although these combination regimens are recommended among the standard therapies, significant additional cost is a concern. The comparative cost-effectiveness of AFL and RAM was examined from the perspective of the Japanese health care payer. METHODS: A partitioned survival analysis was constructed. The data sources were the VELOUR (Aflibercept Versus Placebo in Combination With Irinotecan and 5-FU in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer After Failure of an Oxaliplatin Based Regimen) and RAISE (Ramucirumab Versus Placebo in Combination With Second-Line FOLFIRI in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma That Progressed During or After First-Line Therapy With Bevacizumab, Oxaliplatin, and a Fluoropyrimidine) trials, which compared FOLFIRI alone with AFL or RAM in second-line treatment for mCRC. The cost and effectiveness of the combination of AFL or RAM with FOLFIRI were compared with those of FOLFIRI alone and examined between both agents in a 10-year time horizon. The health outcomes were life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The costs were 2019 revisions to the drug prices and medical fees. The robustness of the model was verified by 1-way sensitivity analyses and a probability sensitivity analysis. A 2% annual discount was applied to the expenses and QALYs. A willingness-to-pay threshold of 7.5 million was used. FINDINGS: Compared with FOLFIRI alone, combination AFL or RAM with FOLFIRI had incremental effects of 0.173 QALYs (0.253 LYs) and 0.137 QALYs (0.197 LYs), incremental costs of 3,423,481 (US $31,010) and 5,766,106 (US $52,229), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 19, 836, 504 (US $179,678) and 41, 947, 989 (US $379,964) per QALY, respectively. Results of 1-way sensitivity analyses and probability sensitivity analysis all exceeded a willingness-to-pay threshold of 7.5 million. In the comparison of the 2 agents, AFL was a dominant over RAM. IMPLICATIONS: Adding AFL or RAM to FOLFIRI in the second line of mCRC treatment was not cost-effective in the Japanese health care system. On the basis of the results of this study, in the treatment of mCRC, it will be necessary to adjust the prices of AFL and RAM with the improvement of clinical parameters, such as survival time and adverse events.

23776,Frontline BRAF Testing-Guided Treatment for Advanced Melanoma in the Era of Immunotherapies: A Cost-Utility Analysis Based on Long-term Survival Data,"Importance: The effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and BRAF and MEK inhibitors has improved advanced melanoma recovery. However, it is unknown whether these novel therapies are cost-effective for newly diagnosed advanced melanoma with unknown BRAF status. Objective: To compare the cost-utility of these novel agents and their combinations with or without BRAF gene testing guidance for treating newly diagnosed advanced melanoma with unknown BRAF status. Design and Setting: A decision-analytic model was adopted to project the outcomes of 8 strategies containing different ICIs and BRAF and MEK inhibitors for newly diagnosed advanced melanoma with unknown BRAF pathogenic variant status. The key clinical data were derived from the CheckMate 067, KEYNOTE-006, COMBI-d, and COMBI-v trials, and the cost and health preference data were derived from the literature. Costs were estimated from the US payer perspective. Main Outcomes and Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental net health benefits were calculated. Subgroup, 1-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Of the 8 competing strategies, nivolumab plus ipilimumab without patient selection based on BRAF pathogenic variant testing yielded the most significant health outcome, and the nivolumab strategy was the cheapest option. The nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab strategies formed the cost-effective frontier, which showed the ordered ICURs were $8593 (SD, $592995)/QALY for pembrolizumab vs nivolumab and $125593 (SD, $5751223)/QALY for nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs pembrolizumab. Other strategies, including the BRAF testing-guided strategies (BRAF pathogenic variant testing followed by corresponding regimens for BRAF wild and pathogenic variant tumors), were dominated or extended dominated. The most influential parameters were the treatment efficacy of these new regimens. Conclusions and Relevance: For newly diagnosed advanced melanoma with unknown BRAF pathogenic variant status, nivolumab plus ipilimumab and pembrolizumab strategies are likely to be the most cost-effective options.

23778,Robotic Arm-assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty is More Cost-Effective Than Manual Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Markov Model Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the benchmark surgical treatment of advanced and symptomatic hip osteoarthritis. Preliminary evidence suggests that the robotic arm-assisted (RAA) technology yields more accurate and reproducible acetabular cup placement, which may improve survival rate and clinical results, but economic considerations are less well-defined. The purpose of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of the RAA THA with manual THA (mTHA) modalities, considering direct medical costs and utilities from a payer''s perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to analyze two potential interventions for hip osteoarthritis and degenerative joint disorder: RAA THA and mTHA. Potential outcomes of THA were categorized into the transition states: infection, dislocation, no major complications, or revision. Cumulative costs and utilities were assessed using a cycle length of 1 year over a time horizon of 5 years. RESULTS: RAA THA cohort was cost effective relative to mTHA cohort for cumulative Medicare and cumulative private payer insurance costs over the 5-year period. RAA THA cost saving had an average differential of $945 for Medicare and $1,810 for private insurance relative to mTHA while generating slightly more utility (0.04 quality-adjusted life year). The preferred treatment was sensitive to the utilities generated by successful RAA THA and mTHA. Microsimulations indicated that RAA THA was cost effective in 99.4% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the Medicare and private payer scenarios, RAA THA is more cost effective than conventional mTHA when considering direct medical costs from a payer''s perspective.

23780,Economic Evaluation of Cisplatin Plus Gemcitabine Versus Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine for the Treatment of First-Line Advanced Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in China: Using Markov Model and Partitioned Survival Model,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cisplatin plus gemcitabine vs. paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in China. METHODS: The Markov model and partitioned survival (PS) model were used, and the study included three health states over the period of a lifetime. Transition probabilities and safety data were derived from the CBCSG006 trial (cisplatin plus gemcitabine vs. paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients who had acquired metastatic triple-negative breast cancer). Cost and utility values were derived from previous studies, the Chinese Drug Bidding Database, and healthcare documents. Sensitivity analyses were performed to observe model stability. RESULTS: In the Markov model, compared with paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus gemcitabine yielded an additional 0.15 QALYs, with an incremental cost of 1976.33 USD. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was 12,826.98 USD/QALY (quality-adjusted life year). In the PS model, cisplatin plus gemcitabine yielded an additional 0.17 QALYs with an incremental cost of 2384.63 USD; the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was 13,867.7 USD/QALY. In the first scenario analysis, in which the 3-year time horizon was used in both arms, the total QALYs in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group were larger and the costs were lower, indicating that cisplatin plus gemcitabine was superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. In the second scenario, in which the progression-free (PF) utility (during chemotherapy) was 0.76, the PF utility was 0.96, and the post-progression (PP) utility was 0.55, the result obtained with the Markov model showed that the ICUR was 11,063.68 USD/QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) on the Markov model, the probabilities that cisplatin plus gemcitabine would be cost-effective were 48.94-78.72% if the willingness-to-pay threshold was 9776.8 to 29,330.4 USD/QALY.

23785,Cost-effectiveness of HPV-based cervical screening based on first year results in the Netherlands: a modelling study,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare the cost-effectiveness of the old cytology programme with the new high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening programme, using performance indicators from the new Dutch hrHPV screening programme. DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: The Netherlands. POPULATION: Dutch 30-year-old unvaccinated females followed up lifelong. METHODS: We updated the microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model using the most recent epidemiological and screening data from the Netherlands. We simulated both screening programmes, using the screening behaviour and costs observed in each programme. Sensitivity analyses were performed on screening behaviour, utility losses and discount rates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates, number of screening tests and repeat tests, colposcopy referrals by lesion grade, costs from a societal perspective, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The new Dutch cervical cancer screening programme decreased the cervical cancer mortality by 4% and the incidence by 1% compared with the old programme. Colposcopy referrals of women without cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse, increased by 172%, but 13% more QALYs were still achieved. Total costs were reduced by 21%, mainly due to fewer screening tests. Per QALY gained, the hrHPV programme cost 46% less (12,225) than the cytology programme (22,678), and hrHPV-based screening remained more cost-effective in all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The hrHPV-based screening programme was found to be more effective and cost-effective than the cytology programme. Alternatives for the current triage strategy should be considered to lower the number of unnecessary referrals.

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis METHODS: Average and incremental reference case analyses with ophthalmic and societal cost perspectives. Patient utilities, bilateral outcomes, 2018 U.S. dollars, vision-related mortality, a Medicare Fee Schedule, and CATT Study, VIEW trial, and Cochrane data were employed. SETTING: Center for Value-Based Medicine R PATIENT/STUDY POPULATION: : Patients with NVAMD INTERVENTION: : Analyses using published data. Data-modeled 10-year vision outcomes were modeled forward to year 11. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): cost-utility ratios (CURs), costs, and QALY (quality-adjusted life-year) gained, $100,00/QALY was considered the U.S. cost-effectiveness upper limit. RESULTS: Bevacizumab and ranibizumab each conferred an 11-year, 1.339 QALY gain versus observation. Aflibercept conferred a 1.380 QALY gain. Aflibercept dominated (conferred greater QALY gain for less cost) ranibizumab but was not cost-effective versus bevacizumab ($1,151,451/QALY incremental cost-utility ratio). Average, ophthalmic cost perspective, cost-utility ratios were bevacizumab=$11,033/QALY, ranibizumab=$79,600/QALY, and aflibercept=$44,801/QALY. Eleven-year therapies saved a 1.0 year-of-life loss without treatment from the 11.0-year life expectancy. Early treatment was 138%-149% more cost-effective than late treatment. Two-year therapy prevented a one-month-of-life loss, and revealed bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept, respectively, conferred 0.141, 0.141 and 0.164 QALY gains with corresponding average CURs of $40,371/QALY, $335,726/QALY and $168,006/QALY.

23793,Cost and quality-of-life impacts of community treatment orders (CTOs) for patients with psychosis: economic evaluation of the OCTET trial,"PURPOSE: Current RCT and meta-analyses have not found any effect of community treatment orders (CTOs) on hospital or social outcomes. Assumed positive impacts of CTOs on quality-of-life outcomes and reduced hospital costs are potentially in conflict with patient autonomy. Therefore, an analysis of the cost and quality-of-life consequences of CTOs was conducted within the OCTET trial. METHODS: The economic evaluation was carried out comparing patients (n = 328) with psychosis discharged from involuntary hospitalisation either to treatment under a CTO (CTO group) or voluntary status via Section 17 leave (non-CTO group) from the health and social care and broader societal perspectives (including cost implication of informal family care and legal procedures). Differences in costs and outcomes defined as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the EQ-5D-3L or capability-weighted life years (CWLYs) based on the OxCAP-MH were assessed over 12 months (, 2012/13 tariffs). RESULTS: Mean total costs from the health and social care perspective [CTO: 35,595 (SD: 44,886); non-CTO: 36,003 (SD: 41,406)] were not statistically significantly different in any of the analyses or cost categories. Mental health hospitalisation costs contributed to more than 85% of annual health and social care costs. Informal care costs were significantly higher in the CTO group, in which there were also significantly more manager hearings and tribunals. No difference in health-related quality of life or capability wellbeing was found between the groups. CONCLUSION: CTOs are unlikely to be cost-effective. No evidence supports the hypothesis that CTOs decrease hospitalisation costs or improve quality of life. Future decisions should consider impacts outside the healthcare sector such as higher informal care costs and legal procedure burden of CTOs.",2020-01-33472,0,JAMA Oncol.,J Simon,2020,/,,No,Not Stated,"J Simon; S Mayer; A Laszewska; J Rugkasa; K Yeeles; T Burns; A Gray; Cost and quality-of-life impacts of community treatment orders (CTOs) for patients with psychosis: economic evaluation of the OCTET trial, JAMA Oncol., 2020; ():",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Other",hospital discharge on community treatment order vs. Standard/Usual Care- non-hospital discharge on community treatment order,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,1550820,United Kingdom,2013,2694957.34
23794,A cost-effectiveness analysis of vaginal carbon dioxide laser therapy compared with standard medical therapies for genitourinary syndrome of menopause-associated dyspareunia,"BACKGROUND: Topical vaginal estrogen therapy is considered the gold standard treatment for genitourinary syndrome of menopause-associated dyspareunia, but early investigations of energy-based devices show promise for patients with contraindications or those who are refractory to vaginal estrogen cream therapy. Although evaluating safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes for novel technologies is critically important when new technologies become available to treat unmet healthcare needs, evaluation of the costs of these new technologies compared with existing therapies is also critically important but often understudied. OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of 3 therapies for genitourinary syndrome of menopause, including vaginal estrogen therapy, oral ospemifene therapy, and vaginal CO2 laser therapy and determine if vaginal laser therapy is a cost-effective treatment strategy for dyspareunia associated with genitourinary syndrome of menopause. STUDY DESIGN: An institutional review board-exempt cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by constructing a decision tree using decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro; TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown, MA) using integrated empirical data from the published literature. Tornado plots and 1-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess how changes in the model''s input parameters altered the overall outcome of the cost-effectiveness analysis model. RESULTS: All 3 treatment methods were found to be cost-effective below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000.00 per quality-adjusted life year for moderate dyspareunia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for vaginal CO2 laser therapy was $16,372.01 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ospemifene therapy was $5711.14. Although all 3 treatment strategies were on the efficient frontier, vaginal CO2 laser therapy was the optimal treatment strategy with the highest effectiveness. In a 1-way sensitivity analysis of treatment adherence, vaginal CO2 laser therapy was no longer cost-effective when the adherence fell below 38.8%. Vaginal estrogen cream and ospemifene therapies remained cost-effective treatment strategies at all ranges of adherence. When varying the adherence to 100% for all strategies, oral ospemifene therapy was ""dominated"" by both vaginal CO2 laser therapy and vaginal estrogen cream therapy. In a 2-way sensitivity analysis of vaginal CO2 laser therapy adherence and vaginal CO2 laser therapy cost, vaginal CO2 laser therapy still remained the optimal treatment strategy at 200% of its current cost ($5554.00) when the adherence was >55%. When the cost fell to 20% of its current cost ($555.40), it was the optimal treatment strategy at all adherence values above 29%. CONCLUSION: This study showed that vaginal fractional CO2 laser therapy is a cost-effective treatment strategy for dyspareunia associated with GSM, as are both vaginal estrogen and oral ospemifene therapies. In our model, vaginal CO2 laser therapy is the optimal cost-effective treatment strategy, and insurance coverage should be considered for this treatment option if it is proven to be safe and effective in FDA trials.

23798,Is Reconstruction of Unstable Midfoot Charcot Neuroarthropathy Cost Effective from a US Payer's Perspective?,"BACKGROUND: Charcot neuroarthropathy is a morbid and expensive complication of diabetes that can lead to lower extremity amputation. Current treatment of unstable midfoot deformity includes lifetime limb bracing, primary transtibial amputation, or surgical reconstruction of the deformity. In the absence of a widely adopted treatment algorithm, the decision to pursue more costly attempts at reconstruction in the United States continues to be driven by surgeon preference. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To examine the cost effectiveness (defined by lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) of surgical reconstruction and its alternatives (primary transtibial amputation and lifetime bracing) for adults with diabetes and unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy using previously published cost data. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare Charcot reconstruction and its alternatives in three progressively worsening clinical scenarios: no foot ulcer, uncomplicated (or uninfected) ulcer, and infected ulcer. Our base case scenario was a 50-year-old adult with diabetes and unstable midfoot deformity. Patients were placed into health states based on their disease stage. Transitions between health states occurred annually using probabilities estimated from the evidence obtained after systematic review. The time horizon was 50 cycles. Data regarding costs were obtained from a systematic review. Costs were converted to 2019 USD using the Consumer Price Index. The primary outcomes included the long-term costs and QALYs, which were combined to form ICERs. Willingness-to-pay was set at USD 100,000/QALY. Multiple sensitivity analyses and probabilistic analyses were performed to measure model uncertainty. RESULTS: The most effective strategy for patients without foot ulcers was Charcot reconstruction, which resulted in an additional 1.63 QALYs gained and an ICER of USD 14,340 per QALY gained compared with lifetime bracing. Reconstruction was also the most effective strategy for patients with uninfected foot ulcers, resulting in an additional 1.04 QALYs gained, and an ICER of USD 26,220 per QALY gained compared with bracing. On the other hand, bracing was cost effective in all scenarios and was the only cost-effective strategy for patents with infected foot ulcers; it resulted in 6.32 QALYs gained and an ICER of USD 15,010 per QALY gained compared with transtibial amputation. As unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy progressed to deep infection, reconstruction lost its value (ICER USD 193,240 per QALY gained) compared with bracing. This was driven by the increasing costs associated with staged surgeries, combined with a higher frequency of complications and shorter patient life expectancies in the infected ulcer cohort. The findings in the no ulcer and uncomplicated ulcer cohorts were both unchanged after multiple sensitivity analyses; however, threshold effects were identified in the infected ulcer cohort during the sensitivity analysis. When the cost of surgery dropped below USD 40,000 or the frequency of postoperative complications dropped below 50%, surgical reconstruction became cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons aiming to offer both clinically effective and cost-effective care would do well to discuss surgical reconstruction early with patients who have unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy, and they should favor lifetime bracing only after deep infection develops. Future clinical studies should focus on methods of minimizing surgical complications and/or reducing operative costs in patients with infected foot ulcers.

23799,Is Reconstruction of Unstable Midfoot Charcot Neuroarthropathy Cost Effective from a US Payer's Perspective?,"BACKGROUND: Charcot neuroarthropathy is a morbid and expensive complication of diabetes that can lead to lower extremity amputation. Current treatment of unstable midfoot deformity includes lifetime limb bracing, primary transtibial amputation, or surgical reconstruction of the deformity. In the absence of a widely adopted treatment algorithm, the decision to pursue more costly attempts at reconstruction in the United States continues to be driven by surgeon preference. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To examine the cost effectiveness (defined by lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) of surgical reconstruction and its alternatives (primary transtibial amputation and lifetime bracing) for adults with diabetes and unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy using previously published cost data. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare Charcot reconstruction and its alternatives in three progressively worsening clinical scenarios: no foot ulcer, uncomplicated (or uninfected) ulcer, and infected ulcer. Our base case scenario was a 50-year-old adult with diabetes and unstable midfoot deformity. Patients were placed into health states based on their disease stage. Transitions between health states occurred annually using probabilities estimated from the evidence obtained after systematic review. The time horizon was 50 cycles. Data regarding costs were obtained from a systematic review. Costs were converted to 2019 USD using the Consumer Price Index. The primary outcomes included the long-term costs and QALYs, which were combined to form ICERs. Willingness-to-pay was set at USD 100,000/QALY. Multiple sensitivity analyses and probabilistic analyses were performed to measure model uncertainty. RESULTS: The most effective strategy for patients without foot ulcers was Charcot reconstruction, which resulted in an additional 1.63 QALYs gained and an ICER of USD 14,340 per QALY gained compared with lifetime bracing. Reconstruction was also the most effective strategy for patients with uninfected foot ulcers, resulting in an additional 1.04 QALYs gained, and an ICER of USD 26,220 per QALY gained compared with bracing. On the other hand, bracing was cost effective in all scenarios and was the only cost-effective strategy for patents with infected foot ulcers; it resulted in 6.32 QALYs gained and an ICER of USD 15,010 per QALY gained compared with transtibial amputation. As unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy progressed to deep infection, reconstruction lost its value (ICER USD 193,240 per QALY gained) compared with bracing. This was driven by the increasing costs associated with staged surgeries, combined with a higher frequency of complications and shorter patient life expectancies in the infected ulcer cohort. The findings in the no ulcer and uncomplicated ulcer cohorts were both unchanged after multiple sensitivity analyses; however, threshold effects were identified in the infected ulcer cohort during the sensitivity analysis. When the cost of surgery dropped below USD 40,000 or the frequency of postoperative complications dropped below 50%, surgical reconstruction became cost effective.
