14801,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Insulin Detemir Compared to Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Spain,"INTRODUCTION: An Excel(R) (Microsoft Corporation) model was adapted to estimate the short-term (1-year) cost effectiveness of insulin detemir (IDet) versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in patients initiating insulin treatment with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Spain. METHODS: Clinical benefits included the non-severe hypoglycemia rate for T1DM and T2DM, and weight change for T2DM. Three scenarios were included with different hypoglycemia rates estimated on the basis of clinical trials and observational studies. Costs, estimated from perspective of the Spanish Public Healthcare System (Euros 2014), included insulin treatment and non-severe hypoglycemia management costs. Non-severe hypoglycemia, defined as a self-managed event, implied the use of extra glucose testing strips and a general practitioner visit during the week following the event for 25% of patients. An average disutility value was associated to non-severe hypoglycemia events and, for T2DM, to one body mass index unit gain to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: For the three scenarios a range of 0.025-0.076 QALYs for T1DM and 0.014-0.051 QALYs for T2DM were gained for IDet versus NPH due to non-severe hypoglycemia and weight gain avoidance, in return of an incremental cost of euro145-192 for T1DM and euro128-206 for T2DM. This resulted in the IDet versus NPH incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging between euro1910/QALY and euro7682/QALY for T1DM and euro2522/QALY and euro15,009/QALY for T2DM. CONCLUSION: IDet was a cost-effective alternative to NPH insulin in the first year of treatment of patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM in Spain, with ICERs under the threshold value commonly accepted in Spain (euro30,000/QALY).

14802,Fractional flow reserve (FFR) versus angiography in guiding management to optimise outcomes in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (FAMOUS-NSTEMI) developmental trial: cost-effectiveness using a mixed trial- and model-based methods,"BACKGROUND: In the Fractional flow reserve (FFR) versus angiography in guiding management to optimise outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (FAMOUS) clinical trial, FFR was shown to significantly reduce coronary revascularisation, compared to visual interpretation of standard coronary angiography without FFR. We estimated the cost-effectiveness from a UK National Health Service perspective, based on the results of FAMOUS. METHODS: A mixed trial- and model-based approach using decision and statistical modelling was used. Within-trial (1-year) costs and QALYs were assembled at the individual level and then modelled on subsequent management strategy [coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical therapy (MT)] and major adverse coronary events (death, MI, stroke and revascularisation). One-year resource uses included: material, hospitalisation, medical, health professional service use and events. Utilities were derived from individual EQ5D responses. Unit costs were derived from the literature. Outcomes were extended to a lifetime on the basis of MACE during the 1st year. Costs and QALYs were modelled using generalized linear models whilst MACE was modelled using logistic regression. The analysis adopted a payer perspective. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5 %. RESULTS: Costs were related to the subsequent management strategy and MACE whilst QALYs were not. FFR led to a modest cost increase, albeit an imprecise increase, over both the trial [ pound112 (- pound129 to pound357)] and lifetime horizons [ pound133 (- pound199 to pound499)]. FFR led to a small, albeit imprecise, increase in QALYs over both the trial [0.02 (-0.03 to 0.06)] and lifetime horizons [0.03 (-0.21 to 0.28)]. The mean ICER was pound7516/QALY and pound4290/QALY over the trial and lifetime horizons, respectively. Decision remained high; FFR had 64 and 59 % probability of cost-effectiveness over trial and lifetime horizons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FFR was cost-effective at the mean, albeit with considerable decision uncertainty. Uncertainty can be reduced with more information on long-term health events.",2015-01-20675,26578850,Int J Cardiol,Julian Nam,2015,13 /,19,No,26578850,"Julian Nam; Andrew Briggs; Jamie Layland; Keith G Oldroyd; Nick Curzen; Arvind Sood; Kanarath Balachandran; Raj Das; Shahid Junejo; Hany Eteiba; Mark C Petrie; Mitchell Lindsay; Stuart Watkins; Simon Corbett; Brian O'Rourke; Anna O'Donnell; Andrew Stewart; Andrew Hannah; Alex McConnachie; Robert Henderson; Colin Berry; Fractional flow reserve (FFR) versus angiography in guiding management to optimise outcomes in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (FAMOUS-NSTEMI) developmental trial: cost-effectiveness using a mixed trial- and model-based methods, Int J Cardiol, 2015; 13():1874-1754; 19",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fractional flow reserve (FFR) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Angiography,Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 1 year",3.50,3.50,4290,United Kingdom,2014,7731.21

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of HD, CAPD and APD over the 10-year time horizon from the societal perspective, using clinical data from an observational study and the national renal registry, utilities from published studies and costs from dialysis services providers. The base-case analysis was for a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old non-diabetic ESRD patients. A high-risk group of 60-year-old diabetic ESRD patients was also studied. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 3.27 with CAPD, 3.48 with APD and 4.69 with HD. The total costs were Singapore dollar $169 872 for CAPD, $201 509 for APD and $306 827 for HD. CAPD and HD had extended dominance over APD. The ICER of HD versus CAPD was $96 447 (US$69 121) per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were most sensitive to the utility of HD. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that CAPD had the maximum probability of being cost-effective among treatments under evaluation at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $60 000 (US$43 000) per QALY. The high-risk group analyses showed similar results. The ICER of HD versus CAPD was $106 281 (US$76 168) per QALY and the probability of CAPD being optimal was the highest using the same WTP threshold.

METHODS: Previously published cost and health benefit data for islet transplantation were utilized to perform the cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: It was determined that, over a 9-year time horizon, islet transplantation would become cost saving and 'dominate' the comparator. Over a 20-year time horizon, islet transplantation would incur significant cost savings over the comparator (GB pound59,000). Finally, assuming a similar cost of goods to islet transplantation and a lack of requirement for immunosuppression, a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived beta-cell therapy would dominate the comparator over an 8-year time horizon.",2015-01-20702,26563421,Regen Med,Peter R T Archibald,2015,10 / 8,959-73,No,26563421,"Peter R T Archibald; David J Williams; Using the cost-effectiveness of allogeneic islet transplantation to inform induced pluripotent stem cell-derived beta-cell therapy reimbursement, Regen Med, 2015 Nov; 10(8):1746-076X; 959-73",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Allogeneic islet transplantation vs. Insulin therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"20 Years, 5 years; 9 years",1.30,1.30,-59444.29,United Kingdom,2014,-107127.38

14827,Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Primary Aldosteronism and Subtype Diagnosis in the Resistant Hypertensive Patients,"BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common and underdiagnosed disease with significant morbidity potentially cured by surgery. We aim to assess if the long-term cardiovascular benefits of identifying and treating surgically correctable PA outweigh the upfront increased costs in patients at the time patients are diagnosed with resistant hypertension (RH). METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision-analytic model compares aggregate costs and systolic blood pressure changes of 6 recommended or implemented diagnostic strategies for PA in a simulated population of at-risk RH patients. We also evaluate a 7th ""treat all"" strategy wherein all patients with RH are treated with a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist without further testing at RH diagnosis. Changes in systolic blood pressure are subsequently converted into gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by applying National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data on concomitant risk factors to an existing cardiovascular disease simulation model. QALYs and lifetime costs were then used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the competing strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the strategy of computerized tomography (CT) followed by adrenal venous sampling (AVS) was $82,000/QALY compared with treat all. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for CT alone and AVS alone were $200,000/QALY and $492,000/QALY; the other strategies were more costly and less effective.

14830,A cost-effectiveness model for evaluating new diagnostic tests in the work-up of patients with inflammatory arthritis at risk of having Rheumatoid Arthritis,"New opportunities have emerged for early diagnosis with the arrival of new technologies that assess the impact of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and cytomics on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk. OBJECTIVE: This early Health Technology Assessment study assesses the short term cost-effectiveness of 4 add-on diagnostic tests in early inflammatory arthritis patients at risk of RA. METHODS: We modeled four diagnostic add-on tests to the ACR/EULAR 2010 RA classification criteria covering the first year after diagnosis, using REACH data. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and costs were assigned to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hands and feet (Se 0.90;Sp 0.60;euro756), IL6 serum level test (Se 0.70;Sp 0.53;euro50), B-cell related gene expression (Se 0.60;Sp 0.90;euro150,) and gene assay for RA (Se 0.40;Sp 0.85;euro750), based on literature and expert opinion. Outcomes were evaluated using the unweighted diagnostic Net Benefit (udNB) and the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained (ICER) in all patients (n=552), intermediate risk patients (n=263) and seronegative patients (n=329). RESULTS: The highest udNB was found when using B-cell assay in intermediate risk patients (43%; ICER euro5,314), while the IL6 test in seronegative patients resulted in the lowest udNB (-11.4%; ICER euro7,650). If a threshold of euro20,000 is applied, the B-cell assay would be preferred over the other alternatives with a probability of being cost-effective of 78% for intermediate risk patients, 57% for all patients and 73% for seronegative patients. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic add-on tests favoring specificity over sensitivity with a headroom less than euro370 per test are cost-effective, with the largest diagnostic benefit occurring in intermediate risk patients.

Outcomes were evaluated using the unweighted diagnostic Net Benefit (udNB) and the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained (ICER) in all patients (n=552), intermediate risk patients (n=263) and seronegative patients (n=329). RESULTS: The highest udNB was found when using B-cell assay in intermediate risk patients (43%; ICER euro5,314), while the IL6 test in seronegative patients resulted in the lowest udNB (-11.4%; ICER euro7,650). If a threshold of euro20,000 is applied, the B-cell assay would be preferred over the other alternatives with a probability of being cost-effective of 78% for intermediate risk patients, 57% for all patients and 73% for seronegative patients. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic add-on tests favoring specificity over sensitivity with a headroom less than euro370 per test are cost-effective, with the largest diagnostic benefit occurring in intermediate risk patients.

14847,Partner Notification for Reduction of HIV-1 Transmission and Related Costs among Men Who Have Sex with Men: A Mathematical Modeling Study,"BACKGROUND: Earlier antiretroviral treatment initiation prevents new HIV infections. A key problem in HIV prevention and care is the high number of patients diagnosed late, as these undiagnosed patients can continue forward HIV transmission. We modeled the impact on the Dutch men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) HIV epidemic and cost-effectiveness of an existing partner notification process for earlier identification of HIV-infected individuals to reduce HIV transmission. METHODS: Reduction in new infections and cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained for the use of partner notification to identify 5% of all new diagnoses (Scenario 1) and 20% of all new diagnoses (Scenario 2), versus no partner notification. Costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were assigned to each disease state and calculated over 5 year increments for a 20 year period. RESULTS: Partner notification is predicted to avert 18-69 infections (interquartile range [IQR] 13-24; 51-93) over the course of 5 years countrywide to 221-830 (IQR 140-299; 530-1,127) over 20 years for Scenario 1 and 2 respectively.

A key problem in HIV prevention and care is the high number of patients diagnosed late, as these undiagnosed patients can continue forward HIV transmission. We modeled the impact on the Dutch men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) HIV epidemic and cost-effectiveness of an existing partner notification process for earlier identification of HIV-infected individuals to reduce HIV transmission. METHODS: Reduction in new infections and cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained for the use of partner notification to identify 5% of all new diagnoses (Scenario 1) and 20% of all new diagnoses (Scenario 2), versus no partner notification.

14851,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention versus bypass surgery from a Dutch perspective,"AIMS: Recent cost-effectiveness analyses of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have been limited by a short time horizon or were restricted to the US healthcare perspective. We, therefore, used individual patient-level data from the SYNTAX trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus CABG from a European (Dutch) perspective. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2007, 1800 patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease were randomised to either CABG (n=897) or PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES; n=903). Costs were estimated for all patients based on observed healthcare resource usage over 5 years of follow-up. Health state utilities were evaluated with the EuroQOL questionnaire. A patient-level microsimulation model based on Dutch life-tables was used to extrapolate the 5-year in-trial data to a lifetime horizon. Although initial procedural costs were lower for CABG, total initial hospitalisation costs per patient were higher (euro17 506 vs euro14 037, p<0.001). PCI was more costly during the next 5 years of follow-up, due to more frequent hospitalisations, repeat revascularisation procedures and higher medication costs. Nevertheless, total 5-year costs remained euro2465/patient higher with CABG. When the in-trial results were extrapolated to a lifetime horizon, CABG was projected to be economically attractive relative to DES-PCI, with gains in both life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (euro5390/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) was favourable and remained <euro80 000/QALY in >90% of the bootstrap replicates. Outcomes were similar when incorporating the prognostic impact of non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as across a broad range of assumptions regarding the effect of CABG on post-trial survival and costs. However, DES-PCI was economically dominant compared with CABG in patients with a SYNTAX Score </=22 or in those with left main disease. In patients for whom the SYNTAX Score II favoured PCI based on lower predicted 4-year mortality, PCI was also economically dominant, whereas in those patients for whom the SYNTAX Score II favoured surgery, CABG was highly economically attractive (ICER range, euro2967 to euro3737/QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: For the broad population with three-vessel or left main disease who are candidates for either CABG or PCI, we found that CABG is a clinically and economically attractive revascularisation strategy compared with DES-PCI from a Dutch healthcare perspective. The cost-effectiveness of CABG versus PCI differed according to several anatomic factors, however. The newly developed SYNTAX Score II provides enhanced prognostic discrimination in this population, and may be a useful tool to guide resource allocation as well.

14852,A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Low-Dose Aspirin Prophylaxis for the Prevention of Preeclampsia in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision model to evaluate the risks, benefits, and costs of different approaches to aspirin prophylaxis for the approximately 4 million pregnant women in the United States annually. METHODS: We created a decision model to evaluate four approaches to aspirin prophylaxis in the United States: no prophylaxis, prophylaxis per American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the College) recommendations, prophylaxis per U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, and universal prophylaxis. We included the costs associated with aspirin, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and potential aspirin-associated adverse effects. TreeAge Pro 2011 was used to perform the analysis. RESULTS: The estimated rate of preeclampsia would be 4.18% without prophylaxis compared with 4.17% with the College approach in which 0.35% (n=14,000) of women receive aspirin, 3.83% with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force approach in which 23.5% (n=940,800) receive aspirin, and 3.81% with universal prophylaxis. Compared with no prophylaxis, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force approach would save $377.4 million in direct medical care costs annually, and universal prophylaxis would save $365 million assuming 4 million births each year.

14855,Cost-effectiveness of edoxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism based on the Hokusai-VTE study,"OBJECTIVE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with almost 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer an alternative to warfarin-based therapy without monitoring requirements and with fewer drug and food interactions. Edoxaban, a direct Xa inhibitor, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based upon results of the Hokusai-VTE Phase 3 trial. The trial demonstrated that edoxaban administered once daily after initial treatment with heparin was non-inferior in reducing the risk of VTE recurrence and caused significantly less major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding compared to warfarin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban versus warfarin for the treatment of adults with VTE. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using patient-level data from the Hokusai-VTE trial, clinical event costs from real-world databases, and drug acquisition costs for warfarin of $0.36 and edoxaban of $9.24 per tablet. RESULTS: From a U.S. health-care delivery system perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $22,057 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that edoxaban had an ICER <$50,000 per QALY gained relative to warfarin in 67% of model simulations. The result was robust to variation in key model parameters including the cost and disutility of warfarin monitoring.

14856,Nationwide expansion of a financial incentive program on fruit and vegetable purchases among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"High prices remain a formidable barrier for many people, especially those of low socioeconomic status, to adopt a healthier diet. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 mandated the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to conduct a pilot study to assess the impact of making fruits and vegetables more affordable for households in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Based on the USDA final report of the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP), a large-scale randomized trial in 2011-2012 that provided 30% rebate on targeted fruits and vegetables to 7500 study participants enrolled in the SNAP, we constructed a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an expansion of the HIP to all SNAP households nationwide. The estimated life-time per capita costs of the HIP to the Federal government is $1323 in 2012 U.S. dollars, and the average gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy to a SNAP participant is 0.082 quality-adjusted life year (QALY), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $16,172 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations indicates a 94.4% and 99.6% probability that the estimated ICER would be lower than the cost-effective threshold of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Moreover, the estimated ICER of the HIP expansion tends to be competitive in comparison to other interventions that aimed at promoting fruit/vegetable intake among adult population. Findings from this study suggest that a nationwide expansion of the HIP is likely to nudge SNAP households towards purchasing and consuming more targeted fruits and vegetables. However, diet behavior modification is proportional to price change. When people's actual eating behaviors and what dietary guidelines recommend differ by several folds, even a 30% rebate closes just a small fraction of that gap and has limited beneficial impact on participants' weight management, disease prevention, and health-related quality of life.",2015-01-20743,26547363,Soc Sci Med,Ruopeng An,2015,147 /,80-8,No,26547363,"Ruopeng An; Nationwide expansion of a financial incentive program on fruit and vegetable purchases among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants: A cost-effectiveness analysis, Soc Sci Med, 2015 Dec; 147():0277-9536; 80-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Expanding Healthy Incentives Pilot vs. None,Families enrolled in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,16172,United States,2012,18229.97
14857,Ranolazine for the treatment of chronic stable angina: a cost-effectiveness analysis from the UK perspective,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine when added to standard-of-care (SoC) antianginals compared with SoC alone in patients with stable coronary disease experiencing >/=3 attacks/week. SETTING: An economic model utilising a UK health system perspective, a 1-month cycle-length and a 1-year time horizon. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with stable coronary disease experiencing >/=3 attacks/week starting in 1 of 4 angina frequency health states based on Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency (SAQAF) scores (100=no; 61-99=monthly; 31-60=weekly; 0-30=daily angina). INTERVENTION: Ranolazine added to SoC or SoC alone. Patients were allowed to transition between SAQAF states (first cycle only) or death (any cycle) based on probabilities derived from the randomised, controlled Efficacy of Ranolazine in Chronic Angina trial and other studies. Patients not responding to ranolazine in month 1 (not improving >/=1 SAQAF health state) discontinued ranolazine and were assumed to behave like SoC patients. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: Costs ( pound2014) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for patients receiving and not receiving ranolazine. RESULTS: Ranolazine patients lived a mean of 0.701 QALYs at a cost of pound5208. Those not receiving ranolazine lived 0.662 QALYs at a cost of pound5318. The addition of ranolazine to SoC was therefore a dominant economic strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to ranolazine cost; exceeding pound20,000/QALY when ranolazine's cost was > pound203/month. Ranolazine remained a dominant strategy when indirect costs were included and mortality rates were assumed to increase with worsening severity of SAQAF health states. Monte Carlo simulation found ranolazine to be a dominant strategy in approximately 71% of 10,000 iterations.

14858,Cost Effectiveness of Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir Versus Peginterferon/Ribavirin and Protease Inhibitors for the Treatment of Hepatitis c Genotype 1b Naive Patients in Chile,"INTRODUCTION: Daclatasvir and Asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) have recently been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In association, they are more effective and safer than previous available treatments, but more expensive. It is unclear if paying for the additional costs is an efficient strategy considering limited resources. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the expected costs in Chilean pesos (CL$) and converted to US dollars (US$) and benefits in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in a hypothetic cohort of naive patients receiving DCV/ASV compared to protease inhibitors (PIs) and Peginterferon plus Ribavirin (PR). Efficacy was obtained from a mixed-treatment comparison study and costs were estimated from local sources. Utilities were obtained applying the EQ-5D survey to local patients and then valued with the Chilean tariff. A time horizon of 46 years and a discount rate of 3% for costs and outcomes was considered. The ICERs were estimated for a range of DCV/ASV prices. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: PIs were extendedly dominated by DCV/ASV. The ICER of DCV/ASV compared to PR was US$ 16,635/QALY at a total treatment price of US$ 77,419; US$11,581 /QALY at a price of US$ 58,065; US$ 6,375/QALY at a price of US$ 38,710; and US$ 1,364 /QALY at a price of US$ 19,355. The probability of cost-effectiveness at a price of US$ 38,710 was 91.6% while there is a 21.43% probability that DCV/ASV dominates PR if the total treatment price was US$ 19,355. Although the results are sensitive to certain parameters, the ICER did not increase above the suggested threshold of 1 GDP per capita.

14859,Cost Effectiveness of Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir Versus Peginterferon/Ribavirin and Protease Inhibitors for the Treatment of Hepatitis c Genotype 1b Naive Patients in Chile,"INTRODUCTION: Daclatasvir and Asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) have recently been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In association, they are more effective and safer than previous available treatments, but more expensive. It is unclear if paying for the additional costs is an efficient strategy considering limited resources. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the expected costs in Chilean pesos (CL$) and converted to US dollars (US$) and benefits in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in a hypothetic cohort of naive patients receiving DCV/ASV compared to protease inhibitors (PIs) and Peginterferon plus Ribavirin (PR). Efficacy was obtained from a mixed-treatment comparison study and costs were estimated from local sources. Utilities were obtained applying the EQ-5D survey to local patients and then valued with the Chilean tariff. A time horizon of 46 years and a discount rate of 3% for costs and outcomes was considered. The ICERs were estimated for a range of DCV/ASV prices. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: PIs were extendedly dominated by DCV/ASV. The ICER of DCV/ASV compared to PR was US$ 16,635/QALY at a total treatment price of US$ 77,419; US$11,581 /QALY at a price of US$ 58,065; US$ 6,375/QALY at a price of US$ 38,710; and US$ 1,364 /QALY at a price of US$ 19,355. The probability of cost-effectiveness at a price of US$ 38,710 was 91.6% while there is a 21.43% probability that DCV/ASV dominates PR if the total treatment price was US$ 19,355. Although the results are sensitive to certain parameters, the ICER did not increase above the suggested threshold of 1 GDP per capita. CONCLUSIONS: DCV/ASV can be considered cost-effective at any price of the range studied.

14860,Cost and effectiveness of image-guided radiotherapy for non-operated localized lung cancer: a population-based propensity score-matched analysis,"BACKGROUND: Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) is a novel technology to enhance RT delivery accuracy. However, the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are less clear. The aim of our study is to compare the cost and effectiveness of conventional fractionated RT for non-operated localized lung cancer delivered with vs. without IGRT via this population-based propensity score (PS) matched analysis. METHODS: We identified eligible patients diagnosed within 2007-2010 through a comprehensive population-based database containing cancer, death registries, and reimbursement data in Taiwan. The primary duration of interest (DOI) was 2 years within diagnosis. Effectiveness was measured as survival whereas direct medical cost was measured from the payers' perspective. In supplementary analysis (SA), we estimated the cost-effectiveness in consider of out-of-pocket (OOP) payment and 4 years as DOI. RESULTS: Our study population constituted 124 patients. Within 2 years, both the mean cost (2014 USD) and survival (life-year, LY) were higher for IGRT ($60,774 vs. $60,554; 1.43 vs. 1.37). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) when IGRT was compared to non-IGRT was 3,667 (USD/LY). The chance for IGRT to be cost-effective was around 68% & 70% at willingness-to-pay threshold 50,000 USD/LY and 150,000 USD/LY respectively. IGRT remained cost-effective in SA.

14861,Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus DPP-4 inhibitors as an add-on to Metformin in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus from a UK Healthcare System Perspective,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, progressive condition where the primary treatment goal is to maintain control of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). In order for healthcare decision makers to ensure patients receive the highest standard of care within the available budget, the clinical benefits of each treatment option must be balanced against the economic consequences. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, the first-in-class sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, compared with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), when added to metformin for the treatment of patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin alone. METHODS: The previously published and validated Cardiff diabetes model was used as the basis for this economic evaluation, with treatment effect parameters sourced from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Costs, derived from a UK healthcare system perspective, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), were used to present the final outcome as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a lifetime horizon. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were carried out to assess uncertainty in the model results. RESULTS: Compared with DPP-4i, dapagliflozin was associated with a mean incremental benefit of 0.032 QALYs (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.022, 0.140) and with an incremental cost of pound216 (95% CI: pound-258, pound795). This resulted in an ICER point estimate of pound6,761 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis determined incremental costs to be insensitive to variation in most parameters, with only the treatment effect on weight having a notable impact on the incremental QALYs; however, there were no scenarios which raised the ICER above pound15,000 per QALY. The PSA estimated that dapagliflozin had an 85% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin in combination with metformin was shown to be a cost-effective treatment option from a UK healthcare system perspective for patients with T2DM who are inadequately controlled on metformin alone.",2015-01-20761,26541516,BMC Health Serv Res,M Charokopou,2015,15 /,496,Yes,26541516,"M Charokopou; P McEwan; S Lister; L Callan; K Bergenheim; K Tolley; R Postema; R Townsend; M Roudaut; Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus DPP-4 inhibitors as an add-on to Metformin in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus from a UK Healthcare System Perspective, BMC Health Serv Res, 2015; 15():1472-6963; 496",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dapagliflozin + Metformin vs. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) + Metformin,Patients who failed to achieve adequate control on prior metformin monotherapy,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,6761,United Kingdom,2013,11749.01
14862,The cost-effectiveness of telestroke in the Pacific Northwest region of the USA,"INTRODUCTION: Using real-world data from the Providence Oregon Telestroke Network, we examined the cost-effectiveness of telestroke from both the spoke and hub perspectives by level of financial responsibility for these costs and by patient stroke severity. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model using patient-level clinical and financial data from before and after telestroke implementation. Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and was combined with cost per patient outcomes to calculate incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Outcomes were generated (a) overall; (b) by stroke severity, via the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at time of arrival, defined as low (<5), medium (5-14) and high (>15); and (c) by percentage of implementation costs paid by spokes (0%, 50%, 100%). RESULTS: Data for 864 patients, 98 pre- and 766 post-implementation, were used to parameterize our model. From the spoke perspective, telestroke had ICERs of US$1322/QALY, US$25,991/QALY and US$50,687/QALY when responsible for 0%, 50%, and 100% of these costs, respectively. Overall, the ICER ranged from US$22,363/QALY to US$71,703/QALY from the hub perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previous models showing good value, overall.

14866,Cost-Effectiveness and Cost Thresholds of Generic and Brand Drugs in a National Chronic Hepatitis B Treatment Program in China,"Chronic liver disease and liver cancer associated with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are leading causes of death among adults in China. Although newborn hepatitis B immunization has successfully reduced the prevalence of CHB in children, about 100 million Chinese adults remain chronically infected. If left unmanaged, 15-25% will die from liver cancer or liver cirrhosis. Antiviral treatment is not necessary for all patients with CHB, but when it is indicated, good response to treatment would prevent disease progression and reduce disease mortality and morbidity, and costly complications. The aim of this study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of generic and brand antiviral drugs for CHB treatment in China, and assessing various thresholds at which a highly potent, low resistance antiviral drug would be cost-saving and/or cost-effective to introduce in a national treatment program. We developed a Markov simulation model of disease progression using effectiveness and cost data from the medical literature. We measured life-time costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and clinical outcomes. The no treatment strategy incurred the highest health care costs ($12,932-$25,293) per patient, and the worst health outcomes, compared to the antiviral treatment strategies. Monotherapy with either entecavir or tenofovir yielded the most QALYs (14.10-19.02) for both HBeAg-positive and negative patients, with or without cirrhosis.

14894,Managing incidental pancreatic cystic neoplasms with integrated molecular pathology is a cost-effective strategy,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Current guidelines recommend using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing and cytology to manage incidental pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN); however, studies suggest a strategy including integrated molecular pathology (IMP) of cyst fluid may further aid in predicting risk of malignancy. Here, we evaluate several strategies for diagnosing and managing asymptomatic PCN using healthcare economic modeling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A third-party-payer perspective Markov decision model examined four management strategies in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 asymptomatic patients incidentally found to have a 3 cm solitary pancreatic cystic lesion. Strategy I used cross-sectional imaging, recommended surgery only if symptoms or risk factors emerged. Strategy II considered patients for resection without initial EUS. Strategy III (EUS + CEA + Cytology) referred only those with mucinous cysts (CEA > 192 ng/mL) for resection. Strategy IV implemented IMP; a commercially available panel provided a ""Benign,"" ""Mucinous,"" or ""Aggressive"" classification based on the level of mutational change in cyst fluid. ""Benign"" and ""Mucinous"" patients were followed with surveillance; ""Aggressive"" patients were referred for resection. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), relative risk with 95 %CI, Number Needed to Treat (NNT), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Strategy IV provided the greatest increase in QALY at nearly identical cost to the cheapest approach, Strategy I. Relative risk of malignancy compared to the current standard of care and nearest competing strategy, Strategy III, was 0.18 (95 %CI 0.06 - 0.53) with an NNT of 56 (95 %CI 34 - 120).

14897,Cost-effectiveness of integrated COPD care: the RECODE cluster randomised trial,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease management (COPD-DM) programme in primary care, called RECODE, compared to usual care. DESIGN: A 2-year cluster-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 40 general practices in the western part of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 1086 patients with COPD according to GOLD (Global Initiative for COPD) criteria. Exclusion criteria were terminal illness, cognitive impairment, alcohol or drug misuse and inability to fill in Dutch questionnaires. Practices were included if they were willing to create a multidisciplinary COPD team. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team of caregivers was trained in motivational interviewing, setting up individual care plans, exacerbation management, implementing clinical guidelines and redesigning the care process. In addition, clinical decision-making was supported by feedback reports provided by an ICT programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated the impact on health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), Clinical COPD Questionnaire, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and exacerbations) and costs (healthcare and societal perspective). RESULTS: The intervention costs were euro324 per patient. Excluding these costs, the intervention group had euro584 (95% CI euro86 to euro1046) higher healthcare costs than did the usual care group and euro645 (95% CI euro28 to euro1190) higher costs from the societal perspective. Health outcomes were similar in both groups, except for 0.04 (95% CI -0.07 to -0.01) less QALYs in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: This integrated care programme for patients with COPD that mainly included professionally directed interventions was not cost-effective in primary care.

14898,Economic evaluation of a psychological intervention for high distress cancer patients and carers: costs and quality-adjusted life years,"OBJECTIVE: This study compared the cost-effectiveness of a psychologist-led, individualised cognitive behavioural intervention (PI) to a nurse-led, minimal contact self-management condition for highly distressed cancer patients and carers. METHODS: This was an economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised trial of highly distressed adult cancer patients and carers calling cancer helplines. Services used by participants were measured using a resource use questionnaire, and quality-adjusted life years were measured using the assessment of quality of life - eight-dimension - instrument collected through a computer-assisted telephone interview. The base case analysis stratified participants based on the baseline score on the Brief Symptom Inventory. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio confidence intervals were calculated with a nonparametric bootstrap to reflect sampling uncertainty. The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis by varying unit costs for resource use and the method for handling missing data. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in overall total costs or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between intervention groups. Bootstrapped data suggest the PI had a higher probability of lower cost and greater QALYs for both carers and patients with high distress at baseline. For patients with low levels of distress at baseline, the PI had a higher probability of greater QALYs but at additional cost. Sensitivity analysis showed the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: The PI may be cost-effective compared with the nurse-led, minimal contact self-management condition for highly distressed cancer patients and carers. More intensive psychological intervention for patients with greater levels of distress appears warranted. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
