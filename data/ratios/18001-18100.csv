18001,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy Compared with Circumferential Lumbar Fusion,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) relative to circumferential lumbar fusion with femoral ring allograft (FRA) in the United Kingdom. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Circumferential lumbar fusion is an established treatment for discogenic low back pain. However, IDET could be a cost-effective treatment alternative as it can be carried out as a day case. METHODS: Patient-level data were available for patients with discogenic low back pain treated with FRA (n = 37) in a randomized trial of FRA vs. titanium cage, and for patients recruited to a separate study evaluating the use of IDET (n = 85). Both studies were carried out at a single institution in the United Kingdom. Patients were followed-up for 24 months, with data collected on low back disability (Oswestry Disability Index), back and leg pain (visual analog scale), quality of life (Short Form 36), radiographic evaluations, and U.K. National Health Service (NHS) resource use. Cost-effectiveness was measured by the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Both treatments produced statistically significant improvements in outcome at 24-month follow-up. NHS costs were significantly lower with IDET due to a shorter mean procedure time (377.4 minutes vs. 49.9 minutes) and length of stay (7 days vs. 1.2 days). At a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY, the probability that IDET is cost effective is high. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments led to significant improvements in patient outcomes that were sustained for at least 24 months. Costs were lower with IDET, and for appropriate patients IDET is an effective and cost-effective treatment alternative.",2017-01-24686,28898530,Pain Pract,Eugena Stamuli,2017,/,,No,28898530,"Eugena Stamuli; Withawin Kesornsak; Michael P Grevitt; John Posnett; Karl Claxton; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy Compared with Circumferential Lumbar Fusion, Pain Pract, 2017 Sep 12; ():1533-2500",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Circumferential lumbar fusion with femoral ring allograft,Not Stated,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,24 Months,3.50,3.50,74200,United Kingdom,2006,175593.32

18003,The cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel compared to standard care in advanced Parkinson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson''s disease (PD) is an incurable, progressive neurological condition, with symptoms impacting movement, walking, and posture that eventually become severely disabling. Advanced PD (aPD) has a significant impact on quality-of-life (QoL) for patients and their caregivers/families. Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is indicated for the treatment of advanced levodopa-responsive PD with severe motor fluctuations and hyper-/dyskinesia when available combinations of therapy have not given satisfactory results. AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of LCIG vs standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of aPD patients. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate LCIG vs SoC in a hypothetical cohort of 100 aPD patients with severe motor fluctuations from an Irish healthcare perspective. Model health states were defined by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scale-combined with amount of time in OFF-time-and death. SoC comprised of standard oral therapy +/- subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and standard follow-up visits. Clinical efficacy, utilities, and transition probabilities were derived from published studies. Resource use was estimated from individual patient-level data from Adelphi 2012 UK dataset, using Irish costs, where possible. Time horizon was 20 years. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4%. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for LCIG vs SOC was euro26,944/quality adjusted life year (QALY) (total costs and QALYs for LCIG vs SoC: euro537,687 vs euro514,037 and 4.37 vs 3.49, respectively). LCIG is cost-effective at a payer threshold of euro45,000. The model was most sensitive to health state costs. CONCLUSION: LCIG is a cost-effective treatment option compared with SoC in patients with aPD.",2017-01-24690,28895769,J Med Econ,Julia Lowin,2017,20 / 11,1207-1215,Yes,28895769,"Julia Lowin; Kavita Sail; Rakhi Baj; Yash J Jalundhwala; Thomas S Marshall; Henrietta Konwea; K R Chaudhuri; The cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel compared to standard care in advanced Parkinson's disease, J Med Econ, 2017 Nov; 20(11):1369-6998; 1207-1215",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Levodopa/Carbidopa Intestinal Gel vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard oral therapy Â± subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and standard follow-up visits,"Patients with Advanced Parkinson's Disease with H&Y status III, IV, or V, experiencing severe motor fluctuations.",Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,4.00,4.00,26944,Euro,2012,39055.55
18004,"Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy Versus GnRH Analogue in the Adjuvant Treatment of Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients: Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Breast Cancer Outcome, Ovarian Cancer Prevention and Treatment","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is no available evidence to recommend gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue-based ovarian suppression versus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer, since the two approaches are considered equivalent in terms of oncologic outcome. The role of surgical ovarian ablation has been revitalized based on the advances of minimally invasive surgery, and a better understanding of clinical and molecular basis of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndromes. The aim of this study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic BSO and GnRH analogue administration in patients aged 40-49 years with hormone-sensitive breast cancer. METHODS: A probabilistic decision tree model was developed to evaluate costs and outcomes of ovarian ablation through laparoscopic BSO, or ovarian suppression through monthly injections of GnRH analogue. Results were expressed as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Laparoscopic BSO strategy was associated with a lower mean total cost per patient than GnRH treatment, and considering the difference in terms of QALYs, the incremental effectiveness did not demonstrate a notable difference between the two approaches. From the National Health Service perspective, and for a time horizon of 5 years, laparoscopic BSO was the dominant option compared to GnRH treatment; laparoscopic BSO was less expensive than GnRH, euro2385 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2044, 2753] vs euro7093 (95% CI = 3409, 12,105), respectively, and more effective. CONCLUSION: Surgical ovarian ablation is more cost-effective than GnRH administration in the adjuvant treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer patients aged 40-49 years, and the advantage of preventing ovarian cancer through laparoscopic BSO should be considered.",2017-01-24693,28895089,Clin Drug Investig,Gabriella Ferrandina,2017,37 / 11,1093-1102,Yes,28895089,"Gabriella Ferrandina; Giulia Amadio; Andrea Marcellusi; Elena Azzolini; Anna Puggina; Roberta Pastorino; Walter Ricciardi; Giovanni Scambia; Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy Versus GnRH Analogue in the Adjuvant Treatment of Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients: Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Breast Cancer Outcome, Ovarian Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Clin Drug Investig, 2017 Nov; 37(11):1173-2563; 1093-1102",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone,Pateints with hormone-sensitive Breast Cancer.,49 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-784666.67,Euro,2015,-950835.47
18005,Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging versus ultrasound for the detection of symptomatic full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound-based imaging strategies in the evaluation of a hypothetical population with a symptomatic full-thickness supraspinatus tendon (FTST) tear using formal cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A decision analytic model from the health care system perspective for 60-year-old patients with symptoms secondary to a suspected FTST tear was used to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 3 imaging strategies during a 2-year time horizon: MRI, ultrasound, and ultrasound followed by MRI. Comprehensive literature search and expert opinion provided data on cost, probability, and quality of life estimates. The primary effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) through 2 years, with a willingness-to-pay threshold set to $100,000/QALY gained (2016 U.S. dollars). Costs and health benefits were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Ultrasound was the least costly strategy ($1385). MRI was the most effective (1.332 QALYs). Ultrasound was the most cost-effective strategy but was not dominant. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for MRI was $22,756/QALY gained, below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that MRI was favored over the other imaging strategies over a wide range of reasonable costs. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, MRI was the preferred imaging strategy in 78% of the simulations. CONCLUSION: MRI and ultrasound represent cost-effective imaging options for evaluation of the patient thought to have a symptomatic FTST tear. The results indicate that MRI is the preferred strategy based on cost-effectiveness criteria, although the decision between MRI and ultrasound for an imaging center is likely to be dependent on additional factors, such as available resources and workflow.",2017-01-24695,28893546,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,Soterios Gyftopoulos,2017,26 / 12,2067-2077,No,28893546,"Soterios Gyftopoulos; Kip E Guja; Naveen Subhas; Mandeep S Virk; Heather T Gold; Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging versus ultrasound for the detection of symptomatic full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears, J Shoulder Elbow Surg, 2017 Dec; 26(12):1532-6500; 2067-2077",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ultrasound followed by Magnetic resonance imaging vs. Standard/Usual Care- Ultrasound,Patients who have undergone radiography and 12 weeks of non-operative treatment,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,50074,United States,2016,53997.18

18013,Cost-effectiveness and public health impact of alternative influenza vaccination strategies in high-risk adults,"PURPOSE: High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) or recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine (RIV) may increase influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in adults with conditions that place them at high risk for influenza complications. This analysis models the public health impact and cost-effectiveness (CE) of these vaccines for 50-64year-olds. METHODS: Markov model CE analysis compared 5 strategies in 50-64year-olds: no vaccination; only standard-dose IIV3 offered (SD-IIV3 only), only quadrivalent influenza vaccine offered (SD-IIV4 only); high-risk patients receiving HD-IIV3, others receiving SD-IIV3 (HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV3); and high-risk patients receiving HD-IIV3, others receiving SD-IIV4 (HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV4). In a secondary analysis, RIV replaced HD-IIV3. Parameters were obtained from U.S. databases, the medical literature and extrapolations from VE estimates. Effectiveness was measured as 3%/year discounted quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses avoided. RESULTS: The least expensive strategy was SD-IIV3 only, with total costs of $99.84/person. The SD-IIV4 only strategy cost an additional $0.91/person, or $37,700/QALY gained. The HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV4 strategy cost $1.06 more than SD-IIV4 only, or $71,500/QALY gained. No vaccination and HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV3 strategies were dominated. Results were sensitive to influenza incidence, vaccine cost, standard-dose VE in the entire population and high-dose VE in high-risk patients. The CE of RIV for high-risk patients was dependent on as yet unknown parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: Based on available data, using high-dose influenza vaccine or RIV in middle-aged, high-risk patients may be an economically favorable vaccination strategy with public health benefits.

18017,Surgery versus surveillance in ulcerative colitis patients with endoscopically invisible low-grade dysplasia: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is uncertainty regarding the optimal management of endoscopically invisible (flat) low-grade dysplasia in ulcerative colitis. Such a finding does not currently provide an automatic indication for colectomy; however, a recommendation of surveillance instead of surgery is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance versus colectomy for endoscopically invisible low-grade dysplasia of the colon in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the costs and health outcomes of surveillance and surgery over a 20-year timeframe. Outcomes evaluated were life years gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cohorts of patients aged 25 to 75 were modeled, including estimates from a validated surgical risk calculator and considering none, 1, or both of 2 key comorbidities: heart failure and obstructive airway disease. RESULTS: Surveillance is associated with more life years and QALYs compared with surgery from age 61 for those with no comorbidities, age 51 for those with 1 comorbidity and age 25 for those with 2 comorbidities. At the current United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of $25,800 per QALY, ongoing surveillance was cost-effective at age 65 in those without comorbidities and at age 60 in those with either 1 or more comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance can be recommended from age 65 for those with no comorbidities; however, in younger patients with typical postsurgical quality of life, colectomy may be more effective clinically and more cost-effective.

RESULTS: Surveillance is associated with more life years and QALYs compared with surgery from age 61 for those with no comorbidities, age 51 for those with 1 comorbidity and age 25 for those with 2 comorbidities. At the current United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of $25,800 per QALY, ongoing surveillance was cost-effective at age 65 in those without comorbidities and at age 60 in those with either 1 or more comorbidities.

18035,Cost-effectiveness analysis of PET-CT-guided management for locally advanced head and neck cancer,"BACKGROUND: A recent large United Kingdom (UK) clinical trial demonstrated that positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)-guided administration of neck dissection (ND) in patients with advanced head and neck cancer after primary chemo-radiotherapy treatment produces similar survival outcomes to planned ND (standard care) and is cost-effective over a short-term horizon. Further assessment of long-term outcomes is required to inform a robust adoption decision. Here we present results of a lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of PET-CT-guided management from a UK secondary care perspective. METHODS: Initial 6-month cost and health outcomes were derived from trial data; subsequent incidence of recurrence and mortality was simulated using a de novo Markov model. Health benefit was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs reported in 2015 British pounds. Model parameters were derived from trial data and published literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertainty and broader National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS) costs on the results. RESULTS: PET-CT management produced an average per-person lifetime cost saving of pound1485 and an additional 0.13 QALYs. At a pound20,000 willingness-to-pay per additional QALY threshold, there was a 75% probability that PET-CT was cost-effective, and the results remained cost-effective over the majority of sensitivity analyses. When adopting a broader NHS and PSS perspective, PET-CT management produced an average saving of pound700 and had an 81% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that PET-CT-guided management is cost-effective in the long-term and supports the case for wide-scale adoption.",2017-01-24725,28881249,Eur J Cancer,A F Smith,2017,85 /,6-14,No,28881249,"A F Smith; P S Hall; C T Hulme; J A Dunn; C C McConkey; J K Rahman; C McCabe; H Mehanna; Cost-effectiveness analysis of PET-CT-guided management for locally advanced head and neck cancer, Eur J Cancer, 2017 Nov; 85():0959-8049; 6-14",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Positronemission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Planned neck dissection,Patients with advanced disease after primary chemo-radiotherapy treatment,Not Stated,57 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-11423.08,United Kingdom,2015,-19065.71
18036,Cost-effectiveness of osimertinib in the UK for advanced EGFR-T790M non-small cell lung cancer,"AIM: This study presents the cost-utility analysis that was developed to inform the NICE health technology assessment of osimertinib vs platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (PDC) in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death) from a UK payer perspective and over lifetime (15 years) was developed. Direct costs included disease management, treatment-related (acquisition, administration, monitoring, adverse events), and T790M testing costs. Efficacy and safety data were taken from clinical trials AURA extension and AURA2 for osimertinib and IMPRESS for PDC. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison was applied to reduce the potential bias in the non-randomized comparison. Parametric functions were utilized to extrapolate survival beyond the observed period. Health state utility values were calculated from EQ-5D data collected in the trials and valued using UK tariffs. Resource use and costs were based on published sources. RESULTS: Osimertinib was associated with a gain of 1.541 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of pound64,283 vs PDC (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: pound41,705/QALY gained). Scenario analyses showed that none of the plausible scenarios produced an ICER above pound44,000 per QALY gained, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated a 63.4% probability that osimertinib will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound50,000. LIMITATIONS: The analysis is subject to some level of uncertainty inherent to phase 2 single-arm data and the immaturity of the currently available survival data for osimertinib. CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib may be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared with PDC in the second-line setting in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive NSCLC from a UK payer perspective.

18037,Cost-effectiveness of a chronic pain intervention for people living with HIV (PLWH),"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a common, disabling, and costly comorbidity, particularly in people living with HIV (PLWH). This study developed and pilot tested a pain self-management intervention for chronic pain tailored to PLWH called Skills TO Manage Pain (STOMP). OBJECTIVES: Given the additional resources needed to deliver STOMP in HIV clinical settings, an important objective of the pilot study was to assess not only STOMP''s preliminary efficacy, but also its cost-effectiveness. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The present study draws from a 44-participant, 2-arm randomized pilot trial of the STOMP intervention vs usual care among PLWH and at least moderate chronic pain (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02824562). Cost-effectiveness is presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs were considered from the clinic perspective over a 1-year time horizon using real costs from the pilot trial. It was conservatively assumed there would be no costs savings. The Standard Gamble (SG) method was used to directly measure utilities. RESULTS: Thirty-six participants met inclusion criteria for the present analyses. Mean age was 52 years; 61% were female and 86% were black. The total cost of STOMP was $483.83 per person. Using the SG method, the change in QALYs was 0.15, corresponding to an ICER of $3,225. CONCLUSIONS: STOMP''s cost/QALY is substantially lower than the $50,000 to $100,000/QALY benchmark often used to indicate cost-effectiveness. Although based on a pilot trial and, therefore, preliminary, these findings are promising, and suggest the importance of cost analyses in future STOMP trials.",2017-01-24729,28880698,J Med Econ,Jessica S Merlin,2017,/,1-5,Yes,28880698,"Jessica S Merlin; Andrew O Westfall; Mallory O Johnson; Robert D Kerns; Matthew J Bair; Stefan Kertesz; Janet M Turan; Olivio J Clay; Joanna L Starrels; Meredith Kilgore; Cost-effectiveness of a chronic pain intervention for people living with HIV (PLWH), J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-5",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Skills TO Manage Pain (STOMP) vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,3225,United States,2015,3521.54
18038,Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination in Germany,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in addition to the current cervical cancer screening programme in Germany using a dynamic transmission model. METHODS: Based on a mathematical model simulating the transmission dynamics and the natural history of HPV infection and associated diseases (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, and genital warts), we estimated the epidemiological and economic consequences of HPV vaccination with both the quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines. In our base case analysis, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 12-year-old girls with a 3-dose schedule. In sensitivity analysis, we also evaluated the use of a 2-dose schedule and assessed the impact of vaccinating boys. RESULTS: From a health care payer perspective, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of a 3-dose schedule were euro34,249 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for the bivalent and euro14,711 per QALY for the quadrivalent vaccine. Inclusion of indirect costs decreased ICERs by up to 40%. When adopting a health care payer perspective, ICERs of a 2-dose approach decreased to euro19,450 per QALY for the bivalent and to euro3645 per QALY for the quadrivalent vaccine. From a societal perspective, a 2-dose approach using the quadrivalent vaccine was a cost-saving strategy while using the bivalent vaccine resulted in an ICER of euro13,248 per QALY. Irrespective of the perspective adopted, additional vaccination of boys resulted in ICERs exceeding euro50,000 per QALY, except for scenarios with low coverage (20%) in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Our model results suggest that routine HPV vaccination of 12-year-old girls with three doses is likely to be cost-effective in Germany. Due to the additional impact on genital warts, the quadrivalent vaccine appeared to be more cost-effective than the bivalent vaccine. A 2-dose schedule of the quadrivalent vaccine might even lead to cost savings when adopting a societal perspective.

We conducted an economic evaluation to support England''s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in developing updated guidance on the use of immunosuppression, incorporating new immunosuppressive agents, and addressing changes in pricing and the evidence base. Methods: A discrete-time state transition model was developed to simulate adult kidney transplant patients over their lifetime. A total of 16 different regimens were modelled to assess the cost-effectiveness of basiliximab and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit ATG) as induction agents (with no antibody induction as a comparator) and immediate-release tacrolimus, prolonged-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate sodium, sirolimus, everolimus and belatacept as maintenance agents (with ciclosporin and azathioprine as comparators). Graft survival was extrapolated from acute rejection rates, graft function and post-transplant diabetes rates, all estimated at 12 months post-transplantation. National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services costs were included. Cost-effectiveness thresholds of pound20 000 and pound30 000 per quality-adjusted life year were used. Results: Basiliximab was predicted to be more effective and less costly than rabbit ATG and induction without antibodies. Immediate-release tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were cost-effective as maintenance therapies. Other therapies were either more expensive and less effective or would only be cost-effective if a threshold in excess of pound100 000 per quality-adjusted life year were used.

18043,Cost-effectiveness analysis of use of a polypill versus usual care or best practice for primary prevention in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials suggest that use of fixed-dose combination therapy (''polypills'') can improve adherence to medication and control of risk factors of people at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to usual care, but cost-effectiveness is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a polypill is cost-effective compared to usual care and optimal guideline-recommended treatment for primary prevention in people already on statins and/or blood pressure lowering therapy. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to perform a cost-utility analysis with a one year time cycle and a 10 year time horizon to compare the polypill with usual care and optimal implementation of NICE Guidelines, using patient level data from a retrospective cross-sectional study. The model was run for ten age (40 years+) and gender-specific sub-groups on treatment for raised CVD risk with no history of CVD. Published sources were used to estimate impact of different treatment strategies on risk of CVD events. RESULTS: A polypill strategy was potentially cost-effective compared to other strategies for most sub-groups ranging from dominance to up to pound18,811 per QALY depending on patient sub-group. Optimal implementation of guidelines was most cost-effective for women aged 40-49 and men aged 75+. Results were sensitive to polypill cost, and if the annual cost was less than pound150, this approach was cost-effective compared to the other strategies.

18063,The impact of asthma on the cost effectiveness of surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of asthma on the cost-effectiveness profile of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) compared to medical therapy for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). METHODS: The study design consisted of a cohort-style Markov decision-tree cost utility analysis with a 35-year time horizon. Matched cohorts of CRSwNP patients with (n = 95) and without (n = 95) asthma who underwent ESS were compared with cohorts of patients from the national Medical Expenditures Survey Panel (MEPS) database who underwent medical management for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Baseline, 1-year, and 2-year health utility values were calculated from responses to the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) instrument in both cohorts. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each cohort. RESULTS: The reference cases for CRSwNP patients with and without asthma yielded ICERs for ESS vs medical therapy alone of $12,066 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $7,369 per QALY, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the ICER scatter plots demonstrated 86% and 99% certainty that the ESS strategy was the most cost-effective option for CRSwNP patients with and without asthma, respectively. ESS was not significantly more cost effective for CRSwNP patients without asthma (p = 0.494).

18065,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pump Therapy with Automated Insulin Suspension Versus Standard Insulin Pump Therapy in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes in Sweden,"INTRODUCTION: In Sweden an estimated 10,000 people with type 1 diabetes use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) is associated with higher acquisition costs but provides additional clinical benefits (e.g. reduced rate of hypoglycemic events) over and above that of CSII alone. The aim of the analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SAP with automated insulin suspension relative to CSII alone in two different groups of patients with type 1 diabetes in Sweden. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using the QuintilesIMS CORE Diabetes Model, with clinical and economic input data derived from published literature. Separate analyses were performed for patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia and for patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline. Analyses were performed from a societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: SAP with automated insulin suspension was associated with an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy versus the CSII of 1.88 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients at high risk of hypoglycemia and of 1.07 QALYs in patients with uncontrolled HbA1c at baseline. Higher lifetime costs for SAP with automated insulin suspension resulted in projected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the SAP with automated insulin suspension versus CSII of Swedish Krona (SEK) 139,795 [euros (EUR) 14,648] per QALY gained for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia and SEK 251,896 (EUR 26,395) per QALY gained for patients with uncontrolled HbA1c. In both groups, SAP with automated insulin suspension also reduced the incidence of diabetes-related complications relative to CSII. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, SAP with automated insulin suspension likely represents a cost-effective treatment option relative to CSII for the management of patients with type 1 diabetes with a history of severe hypoglycemic events or patients who struggle to achieve good glycemic control despite the use of CSII.

18067,Cost analysis of bariatric surgery in Denmark made with a decision-analytic model,"INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery offers effective obesity treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in Denmark from a third-party payer perspective in the mid- (ten years) and long-term (lifetime). METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed in which patients may experience surgery, post-surgery complications, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases or die. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities were informed by the literature. Three types of surgery were included: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding. The impact of different surgical methods on BMI level was informed by the Danish Obesity Surgery Registry (Dansk Fedmekirurgiregister). RESULTS: In the ten-year base-case analysis, bariatric surgery led to a cost increment of 19,332 DKK and generated an additional 1.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In the course of a lifetime, surgery leads to savings of 36,403 DKK, an additional 0.7 life years and 2.9 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at ten years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 17,818 DKK per QALY and was dominant over conservative management in the course of a lifetime. Up to three years of delay in the provision of surgery resulted in a reduction of life years, a lower QALY gain and a minor decrease in healthcare costs.

18069,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Long-Term Intermittent Self-Catheterization with Hydrophilic-Coated and Uncoated Catheters in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury in Japan,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of disposable, hydrophilic-coated catheters in Japan. METHODS: A Markov decision model previously applied in a European study was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) with hydrophilic-coated catheters in Japanese spinal cord injury (SCI) patients suffering from chronic urinary retention from a lifetime perspective. To adjust the model to a Japanese setting, relevant Japanese data regarding the baseline risk of urinary tract infection (UTI), the average age at onset of SCI, costs, and general mortality were extracted from published literature, national statistics, or the opinions of Japanese experts. The direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years gained (LYG) were calculated from the payers'' perspective. An annual discount rate of 2% was applied to both the costs and the effects. RESULTS: The incremental cost of hydrophilic-coated catheters was 1 279 886 yen (US$ 10 578 at an exchange rate of US$ 1 = 121 yen) per SCI patient, but they yielded an additional 0.334 QALYs and 0.781 LYG compared with uncoated catheters. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of hydrophilic-coated catheters vs. uncoated catheters was 3 826 351 yen/QALY (US$ 31 623/QALY) gained and 1 639 562 yen/LYG (US$ 13 550/LYG). CONCLUSIONS: The ICER of 3.8 million yen (US$ 31 405) falls well within the Japanese societal willingness to pay per QALY gained; therefore, hydrophilic-coated catheters can be considered highly cost-effective in Japan compared with uncoated catheters.

18070,Dutch Economic Value of Radium-223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has changed with the introduction of radium-223, cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic skeletal-related event and safety data obtained from indirect treatment comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event data for cabazitaxel were conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A Markov model combined these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and costs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal perspective. Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon. RESULTS: Radium-223 resulted in euro6092 and euro4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal euro80,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and euro7390 lower costs, revealing a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, administration and adverse events.

Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon. RESULTS: Radium-223 resulted in euro6092 and euro4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal euro80,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and euro7390 lower costs, revealing a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, administration and adverse events. CONCLUSION: Radium-223 may be a less costly treatment strategy offering similar gains in health benefits compared with abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective.",2017-01-24755,28866822,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Michel L Peters,2017,/,,Yes,28866822,"Michel L Peters; Claudine de Meijer; Dirk Wyndaele; Walter Noordzij; Annemarie M Leliveld-Kors; Joan van den Bosch; Pieter H van den Berg; Agni Baka; Jennifer G Gaultney; Dutch Economic Value of Radium-223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2017 Apr 03; ():1179-1896",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radium-223 vs. Enzalutamide,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,5 Years,4.00,1.50,67181.82,Euro,2017,80159.27
18073,Cost-effectiveness analysis of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation using real-world evidence in elderly US Medicare beneficiaries,"OBJECTIVE: Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been approved by the US FDA to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients. Newly published real-world evidence based on the US population found that elderly Medicare patients with NVAF treated with rivaroxaban experienced statistically significant increases in intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and major extracranial bleeding, and statistically nonsignificant decreases in thromboembolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared with dabigatran. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban for the treatment of US Medicare NVAF patients. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted to compare dabigatran and rivaroxaban. The model considered thromboembolic stroke, bleeding events, and AMI based on the published real-world event risks. Model outputs included clinical event rates, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Dabigatran patients experienced fewer ICH and major extracranial bleeding events than rivaroxaban patients, but more stroke and AMI events. Dabigatran was found to yield lower costs and higher QALYs than rivaroxaban, with incremental costs of -$3534 and incremental QALYs of 0.004. Results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses, with a positive net monetary benefit (willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY) for dabigatran over rivaroxaban for all model inputs tested. CONCLUSIONS: In this study using US Medicare real-world data, dabigatran was found to dominate rivaroxaban.

18074,The projected public health and economic impact of vitamin D fortified dairy products for fracture prevention in France,"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research that projects the public health and economic impact of healthcare interventions in the future. In this study, we aimed to estimate the public health and economic impact of vitamin D fortified dairy products for the years 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050 and 2060. METHODS: We used a previously validated Markov microsimulation model that was designed to assess the public health and economic impact of dairy products for fracture prevention in the French general population aged over 60 years in the year 2015. RESULTS: The expected benefit (in terms of fractures prevented) of the recommended intake of dairy products compared to the absence of appropriate intake is expected to increase by 63% in 2040 and by 85% in 2060. The cost per quality-adjusted life years gained of the appropriate intake of dairy products is expected to decrease from euro58,244 in 2015 to euro42,616 in 2060.

This analysis aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of I-M pemetrexed with those of other I-M regimens used for the treatment of patients with advanced nsqNSCLC in the French health-care setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously developed global partitioned survival model was adapted to the France-only setting by restricting treatment sequences to include 12 I-M regimens most relevant to France, and incorporating French costs and resource-use data. Following a systematic literature review, network meta-analyses were performed to obtain hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) relative to gemcitabine + cisplatin (induction sequences) or best supportive care (BSC) (maintenance sequences). Modeled health-care benefits were expressed as life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) (estimated using French EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire tariffs). The study was conducted from the payer perspective (National Health Insurance). Cost- and benefit-model inputs were discounted at an annual rate of 4%. RESULTS: Base-case results showed pemetrexed + cisplatin induction followed by (-->) pemetrexed maintenance had the longest mean OS and PFS and highest LYs and QALYs. Costs ranged from euro12,762 for paclitaxel + carboplatin --> BSC to euro35,617 for pemetrexed + cisplatin --> pemetrexed (2015 values). Gemcitabine + cisplatin --> BSC, pemetrexed + cisplatin --> BSC, and pemetrexed + cisplatin --> pemetrexed were associated with fully incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of euro16,593, euro80,656, and euro102,179, respectively, per QALY gained versus paclitaxel + carboplatin --> BSC. All other treatment sequences were either dominated (ie, another sequence had lower costs and better/equivalent outcomes) or extendedly dominated (ie, the comparator had a higher ICER than a more effective comparator) in the model.

18088,Economic analysis and budget impact of clostridial collagenase ointment compared with medicinal honey for treatment of pressure ulcers in the US,"OBJECTIVES: Pressure ulcer (PU) treatment poses significant clinical and economic challenges to health-care systems. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of enzymatic debridement with clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO) compared with autolytic debridement with medicinal honey (MH) for PU treatment from a US payer/Medicare perspective in the hospital outpatient department setting. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was developed using a 1-week cycle length across a 1-year time horizon. The three health states were inflammation/senescence, granulation/proliferation (ie, patients achieving 100% granulation), and epithelialization. Data sources included the US Wound Registry, Medicare fee schedules, and other published clinical and cost studies about PU treatment. RESULTS: In the base case analysis over a 1-year time horizon, CCO was the economically dominant strategy (ie, simultaneously conferring greater benefit at less cost). Patients treated with CCO experienced 22.7 quality-adjusted life weeks (QALWs) at a cost of $6,161 over 1 year, whereas MH patients experienced 21.9 QALWs at a cost of $7,149. Patients treated with CCO achieved 11.5 granulation weeks and 6.0 epithelization weeks compared with 10.6 and 4.4 weeks for MH, respectively. The number of clinic visits was 40.1 for CCO vs 43.4 for MH, and the number of debridements was 12.3 for CCO compared with 17.6 for MH. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses determined CCO dominant in 72% of 10,000 iterations and cost-effective in 91%, assuming a benchmark willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year ($962/QALW). The budget impact analysis showed that for every 1% of patients shifted from MH to CCO, a cost savings of $9,883 over 1 year for a cohort of 1,000 patients was observed by the payer. CONCLUSION: The results of these economic analyses suggest that CCO is a cost-effective, economically dominant alternative to MH in the treatment of patients with PUs in the hospital outpatient department setting.",2017-01-24768,28860830,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Elizabeth S Mearns,2017,9 /,485-494,No,28860830,"Elizabeth S Mearns; Michael Liang; Brendan L Limone; Adrienne M Gilligan; Jeffrey D Miller; Kathleen D Schaum; Curtis R Waycaster; Economic analysis and budget impact of clostridial collagenase ointment compared with medicinal honey for treatment of pressure ulcers in the US, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2017; 9():1178-6981; 485-494",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clostridial Collagenase Ointment (CCO) vs. Medicinal honey,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1176.19,United States,2016,-1268.34
18089,A comparison of the cost-utility of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound and hysterectomy for adenomyosis: a retrospective study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) and open hysterectomy for adenomyosis. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis. SETTING: Gynaecological department in a single centre in China. POPULATION: Patients with symptomatic adenomyosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost difference between patients with adenomyosis treated with USgHIFU and open hysterectomy. METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-eight patients with adenomyosis were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 302 patients were treated with USgHIFU and 66 patients with open hysterectomy. All of them had 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow ups. The patients'' quality of life (QOL) was evaluated and the utility scores were obtained from a rating scale to conduct a cost-utility analysis (CUA). RESULTS: No significant differences were found at any follow-up time point in the QOL between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the QOL scores significantly increased in both groups (P < 0.05): the quality adjusted life year (QALY) for patients treated with USgHIFU was USUS$5256.48, whereas it was USUS$7510.03 for patients treated with open hysterectomy. Both incremental cost and sensitivity analysis showed that USgHIFU was less costly than open hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The QOL of patients with adenomyosis can be significantly improved by either USgHIFU or open hysterectomy, but USgHIFU is less costly. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: USgHIFU can safely be used to treat patients with adenomyosis and significantly improved the quality of life of patients after treatment.

18090,Transversus abdominis plane block with liposomal bupivacaine compared to oral opioids alone for acute postoperative pain after laparoscopic hysterectomy for early endometrial cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: To determine the cost-effectiveness of transversus abdominis plane block with liposomal bupivacaine (TAP) compared to oral opioids alone for acute postoperative pain after laparoscopic hysterectomy for early endometrial cancer. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree structure with a 30.5 day time-horizon was used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Base-case costs, probabilities, and QALY values were identified from recently published all-payer national database studies, 2017 Medicare fee-schedules, randomized trials, institutional case series, or assumed, when published values were not available. One-way, two-way and multiple probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The TAP strategy dominated the oral opioid-only strategy, with decreased costs and increased effectiveness. Specifically, the TAP strategy saved $235.90 under the base-case assumptions. Threshold analyses demonstrated that if the relative same-day discharge probability was >/= 12% higher in the TAP group, then TAP was cost-saving over oral opioids-alone. Similarly, TAP was cost-saving whenever the costs saved by same-day discharge compared to admission were >/= $1115.22. Cost-effectiveness of the TAP strategy was highly robust of a variety of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: TAP with liposomal bupivacaine was robustly cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds.

18091,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a universal mass vaccination program with a PHiD-CV 2+1 schedule in Malaysia,"BACKGROUND: Currently, two pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are available in the private market of Malaysia-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV). This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a universal mass vaccination program with a PHiD-CV 2+1 schedule versus no vaccination or with a PCV13 2+1 schedule in Malaysia. METHODS: A published Markov cohort model was adapted to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of programs with no vaccination, a PHiD-CV 2+1 schedule or a PCV13 2+1 schedule over a 10-year time horizon. Disease cases, deaths, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. Locally published epidemiology and cost data were used whenever possible. Vaccine effectiveness and disutility data were based on the best available published data. All data inputs and assumptions were validated by local clinical and health economics experts. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of the Malaysian government for a birth cohort of 508,774. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with no vaccination, a PHiD-CV 2+1 program was projected to prevent 1109 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 24,679 pneumonia and 72,940 acute otitis media (AOM) cases and 103 IPD/pneumonia deaths over 10 years, with additional costs and QALYs of United States dollars (USD) 30.9 million and 1084 QALYs, respectively, at an ICER of USD 28,497/QALY. Compared with a PCV13 2+1 program, PHiD-CV 2+1 was projected to result in similar reductions in IPD cases (40 cases more) but significantly fewer AOM cases (30,001 cases less), with cost savings and additional QALYs gained of USD 5.2 million and 116 QALYs, respectively, demonstrating dominance over PCV13. Results were robust to variations in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: A PHiD-CV 2+1 universal mass vaccination program could substantially reduce pneumococcal disease burden versus no vaccination, and was expected to be cost-effective in Malaysia.

18092,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a universal mass vaccination program with a PHiD-CV 2+1 schedule in Malaysia,"BACKGROUND: Currently, two pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are available in the private market of Malaysia-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV). This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a universal mass vaccination program with a PHiD-CV 2+1 schedule versus no vaccination or with a PCV13 2+1 schedule in Malaysia. METHODS: A published Markov cohort model was adapted to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of programs with no vaccination, a PHiD-CV 2+1 schedule or a PCV13 2+1 schedule over a 10-year time horizon. Disease cases, deaths, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. Locally published epidemiology and cost data were used whenever possible. Vaccine effectiveness and disutility data were based on the best available published data. All data inputs and assumptions were validated by local clinical and health economics experts. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of the Malaysian government for a birth cohort of 508,774. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with no vaccination, a PHiD-CV 2+1 program was projected to prevent 1109 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 24,679 pneumonia and 72,940 acute otitis media (AOM) cases and 103 IPD/pneumonia deaths over 10 years, with additional costs and QALYs of United States dollars (USD) 30.9 million and 1084 QALYs, respectively, at an ICER of USD 28,497/QALY.

18093,Model-based projection of health and economic effects of screening for hepatitis C in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Because most hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are asymptomatic and often unrecognized, screening for hepatitis C has been proposed as a plausible public health strategy. We examined the health and economic consequences of a selective one-time hepatitis C screening program for specific populations in the context of current treatment patterns. METHODS: We used a state-transition model to evaluate 2 general strategies: no screening, and screen and treat with direct-acting antiviral agents. We examined these strategies for 4 different target populations (scenarios): 1) asymptomatic people not at high risk for HCV infection, 2) immigrant populations with high prevalence, 3) a birth cohort of people aged 25-64 years and 4) a birth cohort of people aged 45-64 years of age. We obtained model data from the published literature and expert opinions. We used a payer perspective, a lifetime time horizon and a 5% discount rate. RESULTS: Screening would prevent 49.7%, 57.4%, 64.1% and 49.6% of HCV-related deaths over the lifetime of the cohort for scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Screening would produce incremental-cost-effectiveness ratios between $31468/quality-adjusted life-year and $50490/quality-adjusted life-year.

18097,Pharmacoeconomic analysis for pemetrexed as a maintenance therapy for NSCLC patients with patient assistance program in China,"OBJECTIVE: This study is to evaluate the costs, clinical efficacy, and social benefits of a patient assistance program (PAP) implemented by the China Primary Healthcare Foundation for the use of pemetrexed as a first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) maintenance therapy in China. METHODS: A survival analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 1,366 patients who participated in the PAP. The progression-free survival (PFS) and median maintenance treatment cycle of pemetrexed were analyzed. A 36-month Markov model from a payer''s perspective was constructed to analyze the cost and effectiveness associated with the PAP for pemetrexed. The inputs of the model were sourced from the PAP clinical database and published literature. The study estimated the incremental quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) (pemetrexed plus best supportive care [BSC] vs BSC only), the cost saving of the PAP, the impact on the percentage of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE), and poverty headcount ratio (HCR). RESULTS: The median of PFS and maintenance treatment cycles were 187 days and five cycles (total nine cycles, which included four cycles of induction therapy), respectively. The pemetrexed plus BSC treatment with PAP resulted in an additional 0.12 QALYs over BSC only. The total cost was $48,034.46 and $96,191.57 for the patients who had or had not joined the PAP in 3 years, respectively. Compared to the patients without PAP, the percentage of CHE and HCR with PAP was reduced from 98.39% to 19.91% and 66.98% to 4.89%, respectively, indicating that the PAP substantially decreased the number of patients who had CHE and fallen into poverty. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the pemetrexed PAP generated noticeable clinical and economic benefits to society and to patients.

A randomised controlled trial using mixed methods,"OBJECTIVES: Holistic needs assessment (HNA) and care planning are proposed to address unmet needs of people treated for cancer. We tested whether HNA and care planning by an allied health professional improved cancer-specific quality of life for women following curative treatment for stage I-III gynaecological cancer. METHODS: Consecutive women were invited to participate in a randomised controlled study (HNA and care planning vs usual care) at a UK cancer centre. Data were collected by questionnaire at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The outcomes were 6-month change in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (version 3), global score (primary) and, in EORTC subscales, generic quality of life and self-efficacy (secondary). The study was blinded for data management and analysis. Differences in outcomes were compared between groups. Health service utilisation and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (from Short Form-6) were gathered for a cost-effectiveness analysis. Thematic analysis was used to interpret data from an exit interview. RESULTS: 150 women consented (75 per group); 10 undertook interviews. For 124 participants (61 intervention, 63 controls) with complete data, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups in the primary endpoint. The majority of those interviewed reported important personal gains they attributed to the intervention, which reflected trends to improvement seen in EORTC functional and symptom scales. Economic analysis suggests a 62% probability of cost-effectiveness at a pound30 000/QALY threshold.

PURPOSE: This study sought to characterize factors affecting the long-term cost-effectiveness of such procedures using interspinous spacer devices (""spacers"") relative to decompression surgery as a case study. STUDY DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE: The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review database for the years 2005-2009 was used to model a group of 65-year-old patients with spinal stenosis who had no previous spine surgery and no contraindications to decompression surgery. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained were the outcome measures. METHODS: A Markov model tracked health utility and costs over 10 years for a 65-year-old cohort under three care strategies: conservative care, spacer surgery, and decompression surgery. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) reported as cost per QALY gained included direct medical costsfor surgery. Medicare claims data were used to estimate complication rates, reoperation, and related costs within 3 years. Utilities and long-term reoperation rates for decompression were derived frompublished studies. Spacer failure requiring reoperation beyond 3 years and post-spacer health utilities are uncertain and were evaluated through sensitivity analyses. In the base-case, the spacer failure rate was held constant for years 4-10 (cumulative failure: 47%). In a ""worst-case"" analysis, the 10-year cumulative reoperation rate was increased steeply (to 90%). Threshold analyses were performed to determine the impact of failure and post-spacer health utility on the cost-effectiveness of spacer surgery. RESULTS: The spacer strategy had an ICER of $89,500/QALY gained under base-case assumptions, and remained under $100,000 as long as the 10-year cumulative probability of reoperation did not exceed 54%. Under worst-case assumptions, the spacer ICER was $482,000/QALY and fell below $100,000 only if post-spacer utility was 0.01 greater than post-decompression utility or the cost of spacer surgery was $1,600 less than the cost of decompression surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Spacers may provide a reasonably cost-effective initial treatment option for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
