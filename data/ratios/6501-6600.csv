6501,The timing of influenza vaccination for older adults (65 years and older),"While studies have found influenza vaccination to be cost-effective in older adults (65 years or older), they have not looked at how the vaccine's economic value may vary with the timing of vaccine administration. We developed a set of computer simulation models to evaluate the economic impact of vaccinating older adults at different months. Our models delineated the costs and utility losses in delaying vaccination past October and suggest that policy makers and payors may consider structuring incentives (< or =$2.50 per patient) to vaccinate in October.

6505,The economic value of primary prophylaxis using pegfilgrastim compared with filgrastim in patients with breast cancer in the UK,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a serious adverse event associated with myelotoxic chemotherapy that predisposes patients to life-threatening bacterial infections. Prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) from the first cycle of chemotherapy is recommended by the 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2008 National Comprehensive Cancer Network and 2006 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines when the overall risk of FN is approximately 20% or higher. Once-per-cycle pegfilgrastim and daily filgrastim are two commonly used G-CSFs with different dosing schedules and associated costs.To evaluate the cost effectiveness of pegfilgrastim versus filgrastim primary prophylaxis in women with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy in the UK.A decision-analytic model was constructed from the UK NHS perspective with a lifetime study horizon. The model simulated three clinical scenarios: scenario 1 assumed that pegfilgrastim and filgrastim had differential impact on the risk of FN; scenario 2 assumed additional differential impact on FN-related mortality; and scenario 3 assumed additional differential impact on chemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) with long-term survival effects. The base-case population included 45-year-old women with stage II breast cancer receiving four chemotherapy cycles, with an FN risk of approximately 20% or higher. Model inputs, including FN risk, FN case-fatality, RDI, impact of RDI on survival and utility scores, were based on a review of the literature and expert panel validation. Using data from the literature, it was estimated that the absolute risk of FN associated with pegfilgrastim was 5.5% lower than with 11-day filgrastim (7% vs 12.5%), and 10.5% lower than with 6-day filgrastim (7% vs 17.5%). Costs were taken from official price lists or the literature and included drugs, drug administration, FN-related hospitalizations and subsequent medical costs. Breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality were obtained from official statistics. The main outcome measures were the costs ( pound, year 2006 values) per percentage decrease in (absolute) FN risk, per FN event avoided, per life-year gained (LYG), and per QALY gained. Model robustness was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Pegfilgrastim was cost saving compared with 11-day filgrastim ( pound 3196 vs pound 4315). Compared with 6-day filgrastim, pegfilgrastim was associated with a cost of pound 4200 per FN event avoided, or pound 42 per 1% decrease in absolute risk of FN, in scenario 1. In scenario 2, pegfilgrastim provided 0.055 more LYGs or 0.052 more QALYs at a minimal cost increase of pound 441 ( pound 3196 vs pound 2754) per person, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound 8075/LYG or pound 8526/QALY. In scenario 3, when all potential benefits of G-CSF were considered, the ICER became pound 3955/LYG or pound 4161/QALY. Results were most sensitive to the relative risk of FN for 6-day filgrastim versus pegfilgrastim.In this UK analysis, pegfilgrastim appears to dominate 11-day use of filgrastim. The value of pegfilgrastim versus 6-day filgrastim at pound 4161-8526/QALY was very favourable compared with the commonly used threshold in the UK.

6507,A cost-effectiveness model comparing rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate with enoxaparin sodium as thromboprophylaxis after total hip and total knee replacement in the irish healthcare setting,"It has been estimated that major orthopaedic surgery has the highest risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) when compared with other surgery. Two new orally active anticoagulants have recently become licensed in Ireland for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR). Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) is a prodrug of the active compound dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin.To evaluate the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate compared with enoxaparin sodium for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective THR and TKR in the Irish healthcare setting.The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health-payer perspective. A static decision-tree model was developed with a 180-day post-surgery time horizon. Separate models for the disease states THR and TKR were run to accommodate the different venous thromboembolism risks associated with each procedure. Outcome measures were QALYs and life-years gained (LYG). Costs were valued in euro, year 2008 values. One-way sensitivity analysis of all probabilities in the model was performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using second-order Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the probability of cost effectiveness at euro 45,000 per QALY threshold.In the THR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for dabigatran etexilate relative to enoxaparin were euro 23,934 per LYG and euro 17,835 per QALY. In the TKR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium. Dabigatran etexilate also dominated enoxaparin sodium. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the THR model was robust to all but four probability variations; the TKR model was robust to all variations. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of euro 45,000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy after THR was 39%, followed by dabigatran etexilate at 32% and enoxaparin sodium at 29%.

6512,A cost-effectiveness model comparing rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate with enoxaparin sodium as thromboprophylaxis after total hip and total knee replacement in the irish healthcare setting,"It has been estimated that major orthopaedic surgery has the highest risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) when compared with other surgery. Two new orally active anticoagulants have recently become licensed in Ireland for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR). Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) is a prodrug of the active compound dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin.To evaluate the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate compared with enoxaparin sodium for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective THR and TKR in the Irish healthcare setting.The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health-payer perspective. A static decision-tree model was developed with a 180-day post-surgery time horizon. Separate models for the disease states THR and TKR were run to accommodate the different venous thromboembolism risks associated with each procedure. Outcome measures were QALYs and life-years gained (LYG). Costs were valued in euro, year 2008 values. One-way sensitivity analysis of all probabilities in the model was performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using second-order Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the probability of cost effectiveness at euro 45,000 per QALY threshold.In the THR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium.

6513,An economic evaluation of docetaxel and paclitaxel regimens in metastatic breast cancer in the UK,"Paclitaxel and docetaxel have been available for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) since the 1990s. However, until very recently, comparisons between these two drugs have been difficult due to lack of direct comparative clinical evidence and differences in trial patient populations. To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing docetaxel with paclitaxel regimens in the treatment of MBC previously treated with an anthracycline from the perspective of the UK NHS. A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov model to compare taxanes in MBC patients who had progressed after treatment with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen: docetaxel 100 mg/m2 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion every 21 days versus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 3-hour IV infusion every 21 days (Pac3w). In parallel, additional analyses were performed versus paclitaxel administered in 1-weekly cycles (Pac1w), and a nano albumin-bound form of paclitaxel (Nab-P) given every 3 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events used in the model were derived from a randomized trial directly comparing docetaxel with Pac3w; the comparisons of docetaxel versus the other two paclitaxel regimens were indirect, using patient-level data from a trial comparing Pac3w with Pac1w, and from the published literature comparing Pac3w with Nab-P. Utility values for response, progression and adverse events were derived from the literature. Direct treatment costs related to progression, best supportive care and adverse events were estimated using clinical trials data, published literature, NHS reference costs and published drug prices. The estimated costs of growth colony-stimulating factors and blood transfusion were also included in the model. The model was used to predict the expected total costs ( pound, year 2005-6 values), QALYs gained, incremental cost/life-year gained (LY) and cost/QALY over a 10-year time period. In the base-case analysis, docetaxel improved QALYs by 0.33, 0.29 and 0.22 compared with Pac3w, Pac1w and Nab-P, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for docetaxel were pound 12 032/QALY versus Pac3w, pound 4583/QALY versus Pac1w and pound 14 ,694/QALY versus Nab-P. The ICER was sensitive to the hazard ratios for PFS and OS between the comparators, the drug cost of initial treatment and the treatment costs after progression. Taking into account parameter uncertainty, and comparing all four treatments simultaneously, at a willingness to pay of pound 20,000 per QALY gained, the probability of docetaxel being the most cost-effective treatment was around 70%. In the base-case scenario, docetaxel compared with Pac3w is estimated to have a cost-effectiveness ratio that falls within the acceptable threshold in the UK.

6516,Cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant therapy for operable breast cancer from a Chinese perspective: doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide versus docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide,"An oncology trial compared four cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) with four cycles of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (TC) in operable breast cancer patients (71% were diagnosed with hormone receptor positive and 48% with node-negative breast cancer). The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime cost effectiveness of AC versus TC, from a Chinese healthcare provider perspective, based on a clinical trial. A lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov model. Events rates and utilities in the Markov model were derived from published papers. Data on cost of breast cancer care were obtained from the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, PR China. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were undertaken. Cost estimates were valued in Chinese yuan (Y), year 2008 values. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Patients receiving TC gained 14.45 QALYs, 0.41 QALYs more than patients receiving AC. The lifetime costs of patients receiving TC were Y93 511, Y10 116 more than that of AC patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were Y26 742 per life-year gained ( pound 2719.8 per year) and Y24 305 per QALY gained ( pound2471.9 per QALY). The most sensitive parameter in the model was the cost of primary cancer treatments in the TC arm. At a threshold willingness to pay of Y86 514 per QALY, the probability of TC being cost effective was 90%.

6522,Cost effectiveness of palivizumab for RSV prevention in high-risk children in the Netherlands,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common pathogen that is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children. High-risk children are at risk of severe infection, which may require hospitalisation. RSV is also associated with a high risk for respiratory morbidity and mortality, which may have long-term clinical and economic consequences.To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting.A decision-tree model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, used as a preventative treatment against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, in high-risk groups of children in the Netherlands. The analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up period in order to capture the impact of palivizumab on long-term morbidity and mortality resulting from an RSV infection. Data sources included published literature, the palivizumab pivotal trials, official price/tariff lists and national population statistics.

6523,"Health state values during the first year of drug treatment in early-stage Parkinson's disease: a prospective, population-based, cohort study","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly that may lead to both motor and non-motor symptoms with consequent severe impairment of quality of life. PD also represents a substantial economic burden on society because of the patient's decreased ability to work, increased need for care and need for costly treatment. Evaluation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) is an important tool in cost-effectiveness analyses. To date, however, few data have become available about the utility gains or losses associated with the disease and its management.To evaluate the changes in health state values in patients with newly diagnosed PD during their first year of drug treatment, and to calculate the gain in QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for this patient group.In this prospective, population-based, cohort study, 199 patients with incident PD and 172 controls were followed over 1 year. Clinical data, drug use and utility scores obtained from the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) health state questionnaire were documented.Patients with PD had lower SF-6D utility scores than controls at baseline. Patients started on antiparkinsonian drugs had an improvement in mean utility scores of 0.039 from 0.667 to 0.706 (p < 0.05). The ICER was euros 45,259 (2007 values) per QALY, of which two-thirds consisted of the costs of drugs and one-third represented the costs of clinical consultations.Drug treatment in patients with early-stage PD increases health state values, but the ICER is high.

6532,Impact of chondroitin sulphate on health utility in patients with knee osteoarthritis: towards economic analysis,"The first objective was to assess the effect of the chondroitin 4 and 6 sulphate (CS) on health-related quality of life using utility values in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) during a 24-month treatment course. The second objective was, using these data, to conduct economic analyses.Data from the STOPP study was used. This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled trial of 2-year duration. In the STOPP study, authors assessed quality of life using the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). WOMAC scores were translated into Health Utility Index (HUI) scores using a specific formula. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated taking into account the cost of CS and its effect on HUI scores, compared to PL.At baseline, the mean (SD) HUI scores were 0.59 (0.17), and 0.59 (0.18) for the PL and CS groups, respectively (p=0.31 between the two groups). The mean (SD) HUI scores changes from baseline to 6 months were 0.02 (0.02), and 0.05 (0.01) for the PL and CS groups, respectively (p=0.03). After 24 months of follow-up, HUI score increases by 0.04 (0.02) in the PL group and by 0.05 (0.02) in the CS group (p=0.37). Using the price bracket of CS in Europe, ICER assessment always resulted in a cost below ?30,000 per QALY gained, after 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment.CS treatment increases health utilities in patients with knee OA compared to PL over the first 6 months of treatment. Economic evaluation based on these data suggests that CS treatment could be considered as cost-effective in patients with knee OA up to a period of 24 months.

The model was based on the epidemiology of cervical cancer in Iceland and its premalignant stages as well as the costs involved in the treatment of each stage, assuming that the vaccines only prevent infections caused by HPV 16/18 at an efficacy of 95% and participation rate of 90%, no catch-up vaccination, no vaccination of boys and no booster dose needed. All costs were calculated on the basis of the price level of mid-year 2006 with a 3% discount rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio calculations were performed and sensitivity analysis was carried out on factors most relevant for cost-effectiveness.Vaccination costs in excess of savings would be about euro313.000/year. Vaccination would reduce the number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer by almost 9, prevent the death of 1.7 women and result in 16.9 quality-adjusted life years gained annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to be about euro18.500/quality-adjusted life year saved.HPV vaccination seems to be cost-effective in Iceland, but this was sensitive to various parameters in the model, mainly the discount rate, the price of the vaccines and the need for a booster dose.",2009-01-13521,19900074,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,Kristjan Oddsson,2009,88 / 12,1411-6,No,19900074,"Kristjan Oddsson; Jakob Johannsson; Tinna Laufey Asgeirsdottir; Thorolfur Gudnason; Cost-effectiveness of human papilloma virus vaccination in Iceland, Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand, ; 88(12):1600-0412; 1411-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,18.55,Euro,2006,29.91

6543,Accounting for the development of antibacterial resistance in the cost effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of diabetic foot infections in the UK,"Increased antibacterial use is associated with a greater likelihood of reduced effectiveness as a result of resistance development in the future. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) from the UK NHS perspective, accounting for the development of antibacterial resistance over time.A decision-tree model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam at different timepoints in the 36 months following introduction of treatment. Development of antibacterial resistance was incorporated in the analysis using a previously published compartment (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model. The development of resistance was a function of the clearance rate of pathogens and the size of the proportion of the population prescribed the antibacterial. The microbiological clearance rate and clinical success rates were assumed to be related and were obtained from the SIDESTEP study. These data included resistant pathogens (either acquired or intrinsic resistance) such as Enterobacteriaceae, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Model outcomes over time included lifetime QALYs, direct medical costs (year 2006 values) and cost per QALY saved. Clinical efficacy of second-line treatment, direct medical costs and utilities were derived from other existing studies. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to estimate the uncertainty of model outcomes. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5% per annum.The model suggested savings of pound407 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] -337, 1501) per patient when DFIs were treated with ertapenem instead of piperacillin/tazobactam after 1 month's treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a 91% probability of the incremental cost per QALY saved being within a threshold for cost effectiveness of pound20,000. After 3 years it is expected that the antibacterial resistance profile with piperacillin/tazobactam would increase at a greater rate than with ertapenem. As a result, the cost savings with ertapenem are expected to increase to pound3465 (95% UI 2502, 4564), and ertapenem will additionally result in greater clinical success rates and lifetime QALY savings (1.16; 95% UI 0.46, 2.06).Ertapenem appears to be a cost-saving and possibly an economically dominant therapy over piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of patients with DFIs from the UK NHS perspective.",2009-01-13531,19908928,Pharmacoeconomics,Jeroen P Jansen,2009,27 / 12,1045-56,Yes,19908928,"Jeroen P Jansen; Ritesh Kumar; Yehuda Carmeli; Accounting for the development of antibacterial resistance in the cost effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of diabetic foot infections in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 27(12):1179-2027; 1045-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ertapenem vs. Piperacillin/tazobactam,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-2987.07,United Kingdom,2006,-7068.86
6544,An empiric estimate of the value of life: updating the renal dialysis cost-effectiveness standard,"Proposals to make decisions about coverage of new technology by comparing the technology's incremental cost-effectiveness with the traditional benchmark of dialysis imply that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dialysis is seen a proxy for the value of a statistical year of life. The frequently used ratio for dialysis has, however, not been updated to reflect more recently available data on dialysis.We developed a computer simulation model for the end-stage renal disease population and compared cost, life expectancy, and quality adjusted life expectancy of current dialysis practice relative to three less costly alternatives and to no dialysis. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for these alternatives relative to the next least costly alternative and no dialysis and analyzed the population distribution of the ratios. Model parameters and costs were estimated using data from the Medicare population and a large integrated health-care delivery system between 1996 and 2003. The sensitivity of results to model assumptions was tested using 38 scenarios of one-way sensitivity analysis, where parameters informing the cost, utility, mortality and morbidity, etc. components of the model were by perturbed +/-50%.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dialysis of current practice relative to the next least costly alternative is on average $129,090 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ($61,294 per year), but its distribution within the population is wide; the interquartile range is $71,890 per QALY, while the 1st and 99th percentiles are $65,496 and $488,360 per QALY, respectively.

6550,Results of a Markov model analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Korea: the Korean Individual-Microsimulation Model for Cardiovascular Health Interventions,"Although hyperlipidemia is well recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), there has been no appraisal of the economic impact of statin therapy in Korea.The aim of this model analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy versus no treatment for the primary prevention of CVD over a lifetime in Korea, from a health care system perspective.We developed the Korean Individual-Microsimulation Model for Cardiovascular Health Interventions (KIMCHI), an epidemiologic and economic Markov model of first-onset CVD in Korea in which all individuals began the simulation in the health state alive without CVD, and moved among the 4 health states (alive without CVD, alive with CVD, dead from CVD, and dead from non-CVD causes) in yearly cycles for any specified time horizon, up to 40 years. KIMCHI was populated with 372 subjects from the 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES) who were aged > or =45 years, did not have a history of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, and met current Korean reimbursement criteria for treatment with lipid-lowering medications. The probability of first-onset CVD was estimated for each study participant individually, based on an Asian population-specific risk equation that relied on an individual's sex, age, serum total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, current smoking status, diabetes mellitus status, and body mass index. Statin treatment was represented by a hybrid of atorvastatin and simvastatin (the most popular statins in Korea), the lipid-modifying effects of which were de rived from a published meta-analysis. Data regarding utilities and costs of CVD (both those covered and not covered by insurance) were derived from published local sources.In the base case, the estimated incremental costutility ratio was 15,134,284 Korean won (KRW) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 20,657,829 KRW per life-year gained (LYG) (1200 KRW approximately US $1). Based on a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30 million KRW per QALY saved, there was a 93.7% probability that statin therapy would be cost-effective. Given a WTP threshold of 20 million KRW per QALY, there was a 53.8% probability of being cost-effective. The probabilities at WTP thresholds of 30 and 20 million KRW per LYG were 62.4% and 25.8%, respectively.Based on this analysis using data from the 2005 KNHNES and the KIMCHI model, statin therapy is likely to be cost-effective for the primary prevention of CVD among Koreans aged > or =45 years. The probability of being cost-effective was greater at a threshold of 30 million KRW per QALY (93.7%) than at 20 million KRW per QALY (53.8%).",2009-01-13566,20110032,Clin Ther,Hye-Young Kang,2009,31 / 12,2919-30; discussion 2916-8,Yes,20110032,"Hye-Young Kang; Su-Kyoung Ko; Danny Liew; Results of a Markov model analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Korea: the Korean Individual-Microsimulation Model for Cardiovascular Health Interventions, Clin Ther, ; 31(12):1879-114X; 2919-30; discussion 2916-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Statins vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,5.00,5.00,15134284,South Korea,2008,16883.56
6551,Cost-effectiveness of pentostatin compared with cladribine in the management of hairy cell leukemia in the United Kingdom,"This article assesses the cost-effectiveness of pentostatin compared with cladribine in the management of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in the United Kingdom.A systematic literature search for papers on HCL was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and the Cochrane computerized database. Search terms were HCL plus 1 of the following: incidence, prevalence, epidemiology, cladribine, interferon, pentostatin, rituximab, splenectomy, utility, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, resource utilization, economic, or cost. Published clinical outcomes and estimates of health care resource use obtained from 10 consultant hematologists across the United Kingdom were used to construct a 5-year Markov model depicting the current management of HCL in the United Kingdom. Utilities for health states in the model were obtained from the general public using standard gamble, time tradeoff, and visual analog scale techniques. The model was used to consider the decision by a clinician to initially treat an HCL patient with either pentostatin or cladribine and to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of pentostatin over 5 years (at 2007/2008 prices) from the perspective of the UK's National Health Service (NHS).According to the model, 64% of all pentostatin-treated patients are expected to be in relapse-free remission at 5 years compared with 49% of cladribine-treated patients (P = 0.04). Repeat treatment of initial partial responders, nonresponders, and those who relapse during the 5 years is expected to result in complete remission in 92% of pentostatintreated patients and 90% of cladribine-treated patients at 5 years. Using pentostatin instead of cladribine is expected to lead to a minimal cost increase (from 21,325 pounds to 21,609 pounds) and an improvement in health status (from 3.64 to 3.77 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) over 5 years. Hence, the cost per QALY gained from using pentostatin is expected to be 5000 pounds. Moreover, pentostatin has a 0.90 probability of being cost-effective for a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY. Accordingly, using pentostatin as a first-line treatment for patients with HCL is an effective use of NHS resources.Based on current practice, this model predicts that pentostatin is a cost-effective treatment compared with cladribine in the management of HCL from the perspective of the UK's NHS.",2009-01-13567,20110049,Clin Ther,Julian F Guest,2009,31 Pt 2 /,2398-415,Yes,20110049,"Julian F Guest; Helen Smith; Erikas Sladkevicius; Graham Jackson; Cost-effectiveness of pentostatin compared with cladribine in the management of hairy cell leukemia in the United Kingdom, Clin Ther, ; 31 Pt 2():1879-114X; 2398-415",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pentostatin vs. Cladribine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,2180,United Kingdom,2008,4859.72

We compared differences through 4-year follow-up (1,440 days).Patients in both treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics. The use of Endeavor versus Driver reduced 4-year target vessel revascularization rates per 100 subjects (10.4 vs. 21.5; difference: -11.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -16.0 to -6.1; p < 0.001), with no difference in the rates per 100 subjects of death (5.0 vs. 5.2; difference: -0.2; 95% CI: -2.7 to 2.4; p = 0.90) or nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.2 vs. 4.4; difference: -1.2; 95% CI: -3.4 to 1.0; p = 0.29). After discounting at a 3% annual rate, there were no differences in quality-adjusted survival days (1,093 vs. 1,090; difference: 3; 95% CI: -13 to 19; p = 0.69) and total medical costs ($21,483 vs. $21,680; difference: -$198; 95% CI: -$1,608 to $1,207; p = 0.78).The use of Endeavor versus Driver was associated with a significant reduction in target vessel revascularization through 4-year follow-up with no difference in death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, quality-adjusted survival, or total medical costs. These results are comparable to those for other studies evaluating drug-eluting versus bare-metal stents.

After discounting at 3% per annum, total medical costs for ZES versus SES were similar ($23,353 vs. $21,657; difference, $1,696; 95% CI: -$1,089 to $4,482, p = 0.23), and the 3-year cost-effectiveness ratio was $57,002/quality-adjusted life year.Despite a reduction in death or myocardial infarction and no difference in total revascularizations, medical costs were not decreased due to increased CABG repeat revascularization procedures for subjects receiving ZES versus SES. If future trials observe similar differences, improved safety with no difference in medical costs, the use of ZES versus SES will be a clinically and economically attractive treatment strategy.

The ZES has shown encouraging results in clinical trials.The ENDEAVOR IV trial (Randomized, Controlled Trial of the Medtronic Endeavor Drug [ABT-578] Eluting Coronary Stent System Versus the Taxus Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System in De Novo Native Coronary Artery Lesions), a randomized (1:1), single-blind, controlled trial (n = 1,548) compared ZES versus PES in patients with single de novo coronary lesions. Two-year follow-up was obtained in 96.0% of ZES and 95.4% of PES patients. The primary end point was target vessel failure (TVF), and safety end points included Academic Research Consortium-defined stent thrombosis. Economic end points analyzed included quality-adjusted survival, medical costs, and relative cost-effectiveness of ZES and PES.The TVF at 2 years was similar in ZES and PES patients (11.1% vs. 13.1%, p = 0.232). There were fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs) in ZES patients (p = 0.022), due to fewer periprocedural non-Q-wave MIs and fewer late MIs between 1 and 2 years. Late MIs were associated with increased VLST (PES: 6 vs. ZES: 1; p = 0.069).

6555,Antiviral medications for pregnant women for pandemic and seasonal influenza: an economic computer model,"To estimate the economic value of administering antiviral medications to pregnant women who have come in contact with an infectious individual with influenza.A computer-simulation model was developed to predict the potential economic effect of antiviral use for postexposure prophylaxis among pregnant women in both seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza scenarios. The model allowed us to examine the effects of varying influenza exposure risk, antiviral efficacy, antiviral cost, and the probability of different influenza outcomes such as hospitalization, preterm delivery, and mortality.For a variety of pandemic influenza scenarios (attack rate 20% or more, probability of preterm birth for women with influenza 12% or more, mortality for a preterm neonate 2% or more, and probability of influenza-attributable hospitalization 4.8% or more), the postexposure prophylactic use of antiviral medications was strongly cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Antiviral prophylaxis became an economically dominant strategy (that is, less costly and more effective) when the influenza attack rate is 20% or more and preterm birth rate is 36% or more, and when attack rate is 30% or more and preterm birth rate is 24% or more.

Direct hospital costs were obtained from a patient administration database and were examined from the perspective of secondary care provider.After SVS, the HRQoL score improved in 71% of the patients, and the mean score increased from 0.919 (on a 0-1 scale) preoperatively to 0.933 postoperatively at 6 months (p < 0.001). Patients with a clinically important result from SVS (> or = 0.03 increase in the HRQoL score) had significantly worse HRQoL at baseline. At 6 months postoperatively, the mean (SD) hospital costs were 1637 euros (693) and the mean quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain 0.504 (1.674), respectively.

6560,Modeling the cost-effectiveness of galantamine for mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease in Korea,"The aim of the study was to determine the cost-effectiveness, from the third-party payer viewpoint, of galantamine compared with usual care in the treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (AD).An existing Markov model was adapted to Korea to predict long-term outcomes over a 5-year time horizon and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of galantamine for the treatment of AD. The model structure is informed by a review of national and international literature on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of galantamine and on the costs and outcomes associated with treatment for AD. The main outcome measure used was the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. All costs were indexed to US$ (2007 value). Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis were undertaken to assess uncertainty in the results.The study findings indicate that the clinical benefits on AD progression from galantamine treatment resulted in an incremental cost per QALY gained of US$4939 over 5 years (vs. usual care). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve suggest that the probability of galantamine treatment having an incremental cost per QALY over US$6740 is zero. Incremental cost per QALY gained according to scenario analyses ranged from US$2271 to US$8335.These findings suggest that the use of galantamine may be a cost-effective use of Korean national health-care resources, considering the gross domestic product per capita of US$21,695 in 2007.",2009-01-13590,20586982,Value Health,Guk-Hee Suh,2009,12 Suppl 3 /,S49-54,Yes,20586982,"Guk-Hee Suh; Modeling the cost-effectiveness of galantamine for mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease in Korea, Value Health, ; 12 Suppl 3():1098-3015; S49-54",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Galantamine plus usual care vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,6.00,1.50,4939,United States,2007,6165.02

Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, incidence of complications, direct medical costs, and cost-effectiveness. Analyses were performed from a third-party payer perspective over a 30-year time horizon. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 5% per annum. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Switching patients uncontrolled on HI to BIAsp 30 was projected to increase discounted mean life expectancy by 0.15 +/- 0.18 years per patient (8.62 +/- 0.13 years vs. 8.47 +/- 0.13 years) and improve discounted mean quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.30 +/- 0.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient (5.68 +/- 0.09 QALYs vs. 5.38 +/- 0.09 QALYs). Conversion to BIAsp 30 was associated with a mean increase in direct costs of South Korean Won (KRW) 1,777,323 +/- 359,209 over patient lifetimes. BIAsp 30 was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of KRW5,916,758 per QALY gained versus HI.Switching patients uncontrolled on HI to BIAsp 30 was projected to improve life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy.

6562,Cost-effectiveness analysis of oseltamivir for influenza treatment considering the virus emerging resistant to the drug in Japan,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir for influenza in Japan considering the complications and the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant virus.Study design is a cost-effectiveness analysis in decision analytic modeling based on previously published evidence. Outcome measures included costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY).In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of oseltamivir during influenza and complications was JPY398,571 ($3320) per QALY without productivity loss, which implied oseltamivir is evidently cost-effective. Furthermore, considering the productivity loss, the ICER for oseltamivir turned to be negative, which means simply dominant. When the prevalence was in the low range of 10% to 38%, oseltamivir became less cost-effective than conventional treatment. Regarding potential emergence of the drug-resistant virus, we found the dominance of oseltamivir will vanish if the emerging rate becomes larger than 27%. The two-way sensitivity analysis also suggested that if the resistant virus rate becomes less and the prevalence higher, then oseltamivir becomes more advantageous. The analysis for uncertainty, using cost-effectiveness acceptability curve by Monte Carlo simulation, resulted in the estimate of about 80% chance that oseltamivir could be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay level of JPY6,000,000 ($50,000), which is commonly accepted as an affordable threshold.",2009-01-13592,20586984,Value Health,Hiroko Nagase,2009,12 Suppl 3 /,S62-5,Yes,20586984,"Hiroko Nagase; Kensuke Moriwaki; Maki Kamae; Shinichiro Yanagisawa; Isao Kamae; Cost-effectiveness analysis of oseltamivir for influenza treatment considering the virus emerging resistant to the drug in Japan, Value Health, ; 12 Suppl 3():1098-3015; S62-5",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oseltamivir vs. Conventional treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,8 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,398571,Japan,2007,4228.93

6571,Cost-effectiveness study comparing imatinib with interferon-alpha for patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from the Chinese public health-care system perspective (CPHSP),"Imatinib, a breakthrough oral molecular-targeted therapy, has demonstrated durable responses and significant survival advantage compared with interferon-based treatment. This study compares imatinib with interferon in newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) patients from the Chinese public health-care system perspective (CPHSP).One-year cost responder and lifetime cost-utility analyses were conducted, respectively. Complete cytogenetic response was used to define a responder. Direct medical costs were included. Response rates as well as survival estimates were obtained from published literature.The cost per responder for interferon was close to 20 times higher than that for imatinib. The cost per additional responder was RMB36,545. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing imatinib with interferon was RMB73,674 (95% confidence interval RMB67,712-RMB79,637) per quality-adjusted life-year.In newly diagnosed CML-CP, the cost per responder for patients treated with imatinib is much lower than that for patients treated with interferon. In the cost-utility analysis, the ICER is below the cost-effectiveness threshold recommended by the World Health Organization for developing countries. Therefore, imatinib is more cost-effective than interferon from the CPHSP.",2009-01-13597,20586990,Value Health,Zi Chen,2009,12 Suppl 3 /,S85-8,Yes,20586990,"Zi Chen; Chun Wang; Xiaoping Xu; Weiwei Feng; Cost-effectiveness study comparing imatinib with interferon-alpha for patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from the Chinese public health-care system perspective (CPHSP), Value Health, ; 12 Suppl 3():1098-3015; S85-8",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Imatinib vs. Interferon-alpha,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,73674,China,2007,12094.63
6572,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections accounting for antibiotic resistance,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of community-acquired complicated intraabdominal infections accounting for development of antibiotic resistance in the Dutch setting.A decision tree was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam at different time points after introduction of treatment. Development of resistance was incorporated using a compartment model. Resistance was a function of the eradication rate of pathogens and antibiotic prescription. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct costs and cost per QALY saved. Microbiological eradication rate, clinical success, and costs were derived from literature. The analyses included pathogens with intrinsic or acquired resistance.The model suggested overall savings of euro355 (95% uncertainty interval euro480; euro1205) per patient when abdominal infections are treated with ertapenem instead of piperacillin/tazobactam. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found a 94% probability of the incremental cost per QALY saved being within the generally accepted threshold for cost-effectiveness (euro20,000). After 5 years, it is expected that antibiotic resistance with piperacillin/tazobactam has increased with a greater rate compared to ertapenem, and cost-savings with ertapenem are expected to increase to euro672 (euro-232; euro1617). Ertapenem will, in addition, result in greater success rates and in QALY savings (0.17; 0.07-0.30). Alternative scenarios, with lower levels of initial resistance confirm the cost savings with ertapenem.Given the underlying assumptions and data used, this evaluation demonstrated that ertapenem is a cost saving and possibly an economically dominant therapy over piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of community-acquired intraabdominal infections in The Netherlands.",2009-01-13598,20667059,Value Health,Jeroen P Jansen,2009,12 / 2,234-44,Yes,20667059,"Jeroen P Jansen; Ritesh Kumar; Yehuda Carmeli; Cost-effectiveness evaluation of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections accounting for antibiotic resistance, Value Health, ; 12(2):1098-3015; 234-44",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ertapenem vs. Piperacillin/tazobactam,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,60 Months,4.00,1.50,-3954.18,Euro,2006,-6377.33
6573,Costs and benefits of free medications after myocardial infarction,"Although combination pharmacotherapy after myocardial infarction dramatically reduces morbidity and mortality, the full benefits of secondary prevention medications remain unrealized owing to medication non-adherence. Because financial barriers are a major determinant of non-adherence, we examined the costs and benefits of providing free medications to myocardial infarction patients who do not have private insurance and are ineligible for substantial public coverage.An economic evaluation combining decision analysis and Markov modelling was conducted to compare full public coverage of secondary prevention medications with the status quo. Costs and benefits were estimated using Canadian data wherever possible. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio measured in cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.From the perspective of the publicly funded healthcare system, full coverage resulted in greater quality-adjusted survival than the status quo (7.02 vs. 6.13 QALYs) but at increased cost ($20,423 vs. $17,173). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for full coverage compared to the status quo was $3,663/QALY. This result was robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses. In a secondary analysis from the perspective of government, the ICER for full coverage compared to the status quo was $12,350/QALY. In this analysis, the ICER was sensitive to changes in price elasticity, but remained below $50,000/QALY as long as the elasticity remained below -0.035.Public payers in Canada should consider providing secondary prevention medications to myocardial infarction patients without private insurance free of charge.

6574,An economic evaluation comparing concomitant oral and topical mesalazine versus oral mesalazine alone in mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis based on results from randomised controlled trial,"A previous randomised controlled trial has demonstrated that oral plus topical mesalazine enema is more effective than oral mesalazine alone for achieving clinical remission in mild-to-moderately active extensive ulcerative colitis (UC). To evaluate whether this strategy is cost-effective we conducted an economic evaluation comparing 1?g topical mesalazine in combination with 4?g oral mesalazine compared to 4?g mesalazine monotherapy in mild-to-moderately active UC.The economic evaluation was based on the ability to achieve remission using changes from baseline in the ulcerative colitis disease activity instrument (UCDAI). A cost-utility analysis was used where the main outcome was quality-adjusted life years to reflect improved quality of life associated with achieving remission compared with active disease. A simulated Markov model with five health states was constructed to model cost and outcome changes over time: (1) active UC; (2) mesalazine-refractory active UC; (3) steroid-refractory active UC; (4) infliximab-responsive active UC; and (5) remission. To reflect parameter uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted by varying relevant clinical parameters.Average treatment costs required to transition a patient from active UC to remission using oral and topical mesalazine compared with oral alone were ?1812 and ?2390, respectively. Improved remission rates attributed to oral and topical mesalazine resulted in moderate improvements in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to oral mesalazine alone. Disaggregation of medical costs indicated that medical consultations and diagnostic costs were similar for both treatment arms. An abbreviated analysis which considered costs up to steroid-refractory patients in subacute UC indicated that combination therapy offered a cost-savings of ?285 over 16?weeks of therapy compared with monotherapy.The results indicate that the addition of 1?g topical mesalazine results in significant cost-savings and moderate quality of life improvements. We have also shown that irrespective of which treatment modality is used in steroid-refractory patients (eg, infliximab, azathioprine, ciclosporine) that topical mesalazine is cost-saving.",2009-01-13606,21172266,J Crohns Colitis,Mark P Connolly,2009,3 / 3,168-74,No,21172266,"Mark P Connolly; Sandy K Nielsen; Craig J Currie; Philippe Marteau; Chris S J Probert; Simon P L Travis; An economic evaluation comparing concomitant oral and topical mesalazine versus oral mesalazine alone in mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis based on results from randomised controlled trial, J Crohns Colitis , ; 3(3):1876-4479; 168-74",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Topical mesalazine (1g) in combination with oral mesalazine (4g) vs. Oral mesalazine monotherapy (4g),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,32 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-57500,United Kingdom,2008,-128180.72

However, their economic value compared with standard of care in Italy has not been explored. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of intermittent therapy with etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis in comparison with nonsystemic therapy in Italy.This study employs cost-utility analysis using a Markov model adapted from the British ""York model"". It compares the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of intermittent etanercept (25 mg twice weekly) versus nonsystemic therapy.

6580,Cost-effectiveness analysis of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer - a health-economic analysis based on the 100-month analysis of the ATAC trial and the German health system,"BACKGROUND: In the 'Arimidex', Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial, the aromatase inhibitor (AI) anastrozole had a significantly better efficacy and safety profile than tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer (EBC) in postmenopausal patients. To compare the combined long-term clinical and economic benefits, we carried out a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of anastrozole versus tamoxifen based on the data of the 100month analysis of the ATAC trial from the perspective of the German public health insurance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model with a 25-year time horizon was developed using the 100-month analysis of the ATAC trial as well as data obtained from published literature and expert opinion. RESULTS: Adjuvant treatment of EBC with anastrozole achieved an additional 0.32 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient compared with tamoxifen, at an additional cost of D 6819 per patient. Thus, the incremental cost effectiveness of anastrozole versus tamoxifen at 25 years was D 21,069 ($30,717) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first CEA of an AI that is based on extended follow-up data, taking into account the carryover effect of anastrozole, which maintains the efficacy benefits beyond therapy completion after 5 years.

6581,Incorporating Equity-Efficiency Interactions in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis-Three Approaches Applied to Breast Cancer Control,"ABSTRACT Background: The past decade, medical technology assessment focused on cost-effectiveness analysis, yet there is an increasing need to consider equity implications of health interventions as well. This article addresses three equity-efficiency trade-off methods proposed in the literature. Moreover, it demonstrates their impact on cost-effectiveness analyses in current breast cancer control options for women of different age groups. Methods: We adapted an existing breast cancer model to estimate cost-effectiveness and equity effects of breast cancer interventions. We applied three methods to quantify the equity-efficiency trade-offs: 1) targeting specific groups, comparing disparities at baseline and in different intervention scenarios; 2) equity weighting, valuing low and high health gains differently; and 3) multicriteria decision analysis, weighing multiple equity and efficiency criteria. We compared the resulting composite league tables of all approaches. Results: The approaches show that a comprehensive breast cancer program, including screening, for women below 75 years of age was most attractive in both the group targeting approach and the equity weighting approach. Such control programs would reduce disparities with 56% and at euro1908 per equity quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the multicriteria approach, a comprehensive treatment program for women below 75 years of age and treatment in stage III breast cancer were most attractive, with both an 82% selection probability, followed by screening programs for the two age groups.

This article addresses three equity-efficiency trade-off methods proposed in the literature. Moreover, it demonstrates their impact on cost-effectiveness analyses in current breast cancer control options for women of different age groups. Methods: We adapted an existing breast cancer model to estimate cost-effectiveness and equity effects of breast cancer interventions.

6593,The Cost-Effectiveness of Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Compared with Routine Primary Care for Women with Postnatal Depression in the UK,"ABSTRACT Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of group cognitive behavior therapy (gCBT) in comparison with routine primary care for women with postnatal depression in the UK. Methods: Our analysis was based on a systematic literature review of the relative clinical effectiveness of gCBT compared with routine primary care and further reviews, supplemented with expert opinion of the likely cost of providing gCBT and the duration of comparative advantage for gCBT. Raw data were used to estimate a statistical relationship between changes in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS) values and changes in short-form six dimensions' (SF-6D) values. A mathematical model was constructed, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to estimate the mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and to evaluate the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). Results: The mean cost per QALY from the stochastic analysis was estimated to be pound36,062; however, there was considerable uncertainty around this value. The EVPI was estimated to be greater than pound64 million; the key uncertainties were in the cost per woman of providing treatment and in the statistical relationship between changes in EPDS values and changes in SF-6D values. The expected value of perfect partial information for both of these parameters was in excess of pound25 million. Conclusions: Given the current information, the use of gCBT does not appear to be cost-effective; however, this decision is uncertain. The value of information analyses conducted indicates that further research to provide robust information on key parameters is needed and appears justified in cost-effective terms.",2010-01-05952,20384978,Value Health,Matt D Stevenson,2010,/,,Yes,20384978,"Matt D Stevenson; The Cost-Effectiveness of Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Compared with Routine Primary Care for Women with Postnatal Depression in the UK, Value Health, 2010-Mar-31; ():1098-3015",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Group cognitive behavioral therapy vs. Routine primary care (individual cognitive behavioral therapy),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,46462,United Kingdom,2008,103574.48
6594,Cost-effectiveness of the 70-gene signature versus Sankt Gallen guidelines and Adjuvant Online for early breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: The 70-gene signature (MammaPrint(R)) is a prognostic test used to guide adjuvant treatment decisions in patients with node-negative breast cancer. In order to decide upon its use, a systematic comparative analysis of the effects of the 70-gene signature, the Sankt Gallen guidelines and the Adjuvant Online Software for these patients on survival, quality of life and costs is warranted. METHODS: A Markov decision model was used to simulate the 20-year costs and outcomes (survival and quality-of-life adjusted survival (QALYs)) in a hypothetical cohort of node-negative, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the three prognostic tools were based on 5 and 10years breast cancer specific survival and distant metastasis as first event, derived from a pooled analysis consisting of 305 tumour samples from 3 previously reported validation studies concerning the 70-gene signature. RESULTS: Small differences in survival, but substantial differences in quality-adjusted survival between the prognostic tools were observed. Quality-adjusted survival was highest when using the 70-gene signature. Based on costs per QALY, the 70-gene has the highest probability of being cost-effective for a willingness to pay for a QALY higher than euro12.000. Sankt Gallen showed the highest survival rates compared to the 70-gene signature, but leads to a substantial larger amount of adjuvant chemotherapy and lower cost-effectiveness, thus demanding a high willingness to pay to save a life year.

6596,Age at initiation and frequency of screening to detect type 2 diabetes: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: No clinical trials have assessed the effects or cost-effectiveness of sequential screening strategies to detect new cases of type 2 diabetes. We used a mathematical model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of several screening strategies. METHODS: We used person-specific data from a representative sample of the US population to create a simulated population of 325 000 people aged 30 years without diabetes. We used the Archimedes model to compare eight simulated screening strategies for type 2 diabetes with a no-screening control strategy. Strategies differed in terms of age at initiation and frequency of screening. Once diagnosed, diabetes treatment was simulated in a standard manner. We calculated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and microvascular complications in addition to quality of life, costs, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, all simulated screening strategies reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction (3-9 events prevented per 1000 people screened) and diabetes-related microvascular complications (3-9 events prevented per 1000 people), and increased the number of QALYs (93-194 undiscounted QALYs) added over 50 years. Most strategies prevented a significant number of simulated deaths (2-5 events per 1000 people). There was little or no effect of screening on incidence of stroke (0-1 event prevented per 1000 people). Five screening strategies had costs per QALY of about US$10 500 or less, whereas costs were much higher for screening started at 45 years of age and repeated every year ($15 509), screening started at 60 years of age and repeated every 3 years ($25 738), or a maximum screening strategy (screening started at 30 years of age and repeated every 6 months; $40 778). Several strategies differed substantially in the number of QALYs gained. Costs per QALY were sensitive to the disutility assigned to the state of having diabetes diagnosed with or without symptoms.

FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, all simulated screening strategies reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction (3-9 events prevented per 1000 people screened) and diabetes-related microvascular complications (3-9 events prevented per 1000 people), and increased the number of QALYs (93-194 undiscounted QALYs) added over 50 years. Most strategies prevented a significant number of simulated deaths (2-5 events per 1000 people). There was little or no effect of screening on incidence of stroke (0-1 event prevented per 1000 people). Five screening strategies had costs per QALY of about US$10 500 or less, whereas costs were much higher for screening started at 45 years of age and repeated every year ($15 509), screening started at 60 years of age and repeated every 3 years ($25 738), or a maximum screening strategy (screening started at 30 years of age and repeated every 6 months; $40 778). Several strategies differed substantially in the number of QALYs gained. Costs per QALY were sensitive to the disutility assigned to the state of having diabetes diagnosed with or without symptoms. INTERPRETATION: In the US population, screening for type 2 diabetes is cost effective when started between the ages of 30 years and 45 years, with screening repeated every 3-5 years.

6599,Age at initiation and frequency of screening to detect type 2 diabetes: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: No clinical trials have assessed the effects or cost-effectiveness of sequential screening strategies to detect new cases of type 2 diabetes. We used a mathematical model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of several screening strategies. METHODS: We used person-specific data from a representative sample of the US population to create a simulated population of 325 000 people aged 30 years without diabetes. We used the Archimedes model to compare eight simulated screening strategies for type 2 diabetes with a no-screening control strategy. Strategies differed in terms of age at initiation and frequency of screening. Once diagnosed, diabetes treatment was simulated in a standard manner. We calculated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and microvascular complications in addition to quality of life, costs, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, all simulated screening strategies reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction (3-9 events prevented per 1000 people screened) and diabetes-related microvascular complications (3-9 events prevented per 1000 people), and increased the number of QALYs (93-194 undiscounted QALYs) added over 50 years.

6600,Long-term cost-effectiveness of weight management in primary care,"Summary Background: As obesity prevalence and health-care costs increase, Health Care providers must prevent and manage obesity cost-effectively. Methods: Using the 2006 NICE obesity health economic model, a primary care weight management programme (Counterweight) was analysed, evaluating costs and outcomes associated with weight gain for three obesity-related conditions (type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, colon cancer). Sensitivity analyses examined different scenarios of weight loss and background (untreated) weight gain. Results: Mean weight changes in Counterweight attenders was -3 kg and -2.3 kg at 12 and 24 months, both 4 kg below the expected 1 kg/year background weight gain. Counterweight delivery cost was pound59.83 per patient entered. Even assuming drop-outs/non-attenders at 12 months (55%) lost no weight and gained at the background rate, Counterweight was 'dominant' (cost-saving) under 'base-case scenario', where 12-month achieved weight loss was entirely regained over the next 2 years, returning to the expected background weight gain of 1 kg/year. Quality-adjusted Life-Year cost was pound2017 where background weight gain was limited to 0.5 kg/year, and pound2651 at 0.3 kg/year. Under a 'best-case scenario', where weights of 12-month-attenders were assumed thereafter to rise at the background rate, 4 kg below non-intervention trajectory (very close to the observed weight change), Counterweight remained 'dominant' with background weight gains 1 kg, 0.5 kg or 0.3 kg/year. Conclusion: Weight management for obesity in primary care is highly cost-effective even considering only three clinical consequences. Reduced healthcare resources use could offset the total cost of providing the Counterweight Programme, as well as bringing multiple health and Quality of Life benefits.",2010-01-05964,20353431,Int J Clin Pract,Group Author,2010,/,,No,20353431,"Group Author; Long-term cost-effectiveness of weight management in primary care, Int J Clin Pract, 2010-Mar-26; ():1368-5031",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,A primary care weight management program (Counterweight) delivered by primary nurses or health care workers vs. No active intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-450,United Kingdom,2005,-1085.56
