13901,Cost-effectiveness analysis of neurocognitive-sparing treatments for brain metastases,"BACKGROUND: Decisions regarding how to treat patients who have 1 to 3 brain metastases require important tradeoffs between controlling recurrences, side effects, and costs. In this analysis, the authors compared novel treatments versus usual care to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from a payer's (Medicare) perspective. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a microsimulation of a Markov model for 60 one-month cycles. The model used 4 simulated cohorts of patients aged 65 years with 1 to 3 brain metastases. The 4 cohorts had a median survival of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to test the sensitivity of the model to different prognoses. The treatment alternatives evaluated included stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with 3 variants of salvage after recurrence (whole-brain radiotherapy [WBRT], hippocampal avoidance WBRT [HA-WBRT], SRS plus WBRT, and SRS plus HA-WBRT). The findings were tested for robustness using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Traditional radiation therapies remained cost-effective for patients in the 3-month and 6-month cohorts. In the cohorts with longer median survival, HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT became cost-effective relative to traditional treatments. When the treatments that involved HA-WBRT were excluded, either SRS alone or SRS plus WBRT was cost-effective relative to WBRT alone. The deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results. CONCLUSIONS: HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT were cost-effective for 2 of the 4 cohorts, demonstrating the value of controlling late brain toxicity with this novel therapy. Cost-effectiveness depended on patient life expectancy. SRS was cost-effective in the cohorts with short prognoses (3 and 6 months), whereas HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT were cost-effective in the cohorts with longer prognoses (12 and 24 months).

13903,The impact of biologic therapy in chronic plaque psoriasis from a societal perspective: an analysis based on Italian actual clinical practice,"OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is one of the most common forms of chronic dermatitis, affecting 2-3% of the worldwide population. It has a serious effect on the way patients perceive themselves and others, thereby prejudicing their quality of life and giving rise to a significant deterioration in their psycho-physical well-being; it also poses greater difficulties for them in leading a normal social life, including their ability to conduct a normal working life. All the above-mentioned issues imply a cost for the society. This study proposes to evaluate the impact on societal costs for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis with biologics (etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) in the Italian clinical practice. METHOD: A prospective observational study has been conducted in 12 specialized centres of the Psocare network, located throughout Italy. Direct and indirect costs (as well as the health-related quality of life of patients with plaque psoriasis undergoing biologic treatments) have been estimated, while the societal impact has been determined using a cost-utility approach. RESULTS: Non-medical and indirect costs account for as much as 44.97% of the total cost prior to treatment and to 6.59% after treatment, with an overall 71.38% decrease. Adopting a societal perspective in the actual clinical practice of the Italian participating centres, the ICER of biologic therapies for treating plaque psoriasis amounted to euro18634.40 per QALY gained - a value far from the euro28656.30 obtained by adopting a third-party payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that chronic psoriasis subjects patients to a considerable burden, together with their families and caregivers, stressing how important it is to take the societal perspective into consideration during the appraisal process.

13904,"The epidemiologic and economic impact of improving HIV testing, linkage, and retention in care in the United States","BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines advocate early antiretroviral therapy (ART) to decrease HIV morbidity and prevent transmission, but suboptimal engagement in care may compromise impact. We sought to determine the economic and epidemiologic impact of incomplete engagement in HIV care in the United States (US). METHODS: We constructed a dynamic transmission model of HIV among US adults (15-65) and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of improvements along the HIV care continuum : We evaluated: enhanced HIV testing (annual for high-risk groups), increased 3-month linkage to care (to 90%), and improved retention (50% relative reduction in yearly disengagement and 50% increase in reengagement). Our primary outcomes were HIV incidence, mortality, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Despite early ART initiation, a projected 1.39 million (95% uncertainty range 0.91-2.2 million) new HIV infections will occur at a (discounted) cost of $256 billion ($199-298 billion) over two decades at existing levels of HIV care engagement. Enhanced testing with increased linkage has modest epidemiologic benefits and could reduce incident HIV infections by 21% (13-26%) at a cost of $65,700 per QALY-gained [$44,500-111,000]). By contrast, comprehensive improvements that couples enhanced testing and linkage with improved retention would reduce HIV incidence by 54% (37-68%) and mortality by 64% (46-78%), at a cost-effectiveness ratio of $45,300 per QALY-gained [$27,800-72,300].

13909,Cost-effectiveness of high-dose versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine in adults aged 65 years and older: an economic evaluation of data from a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Adults aged 65 years and older account for most seasonal influenza-related hospital admissions and deaths. Findings from the randomised controlled FIM12 study showed that high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine is more effective than standard-dose vaccine for prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza in this age group. We aimed to assess the economic impact of high-dose versus standard-dose influenza vaccine in participants in the FIM12 study population. METHODS: The FIM12 study was a head-to-head randomised controlled trial in which 31 989 participants aged 65 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either high-dose or standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine over two influenza seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13). Data for health-care resource consumption obtained in the FIM12 study were summarised across vaccine groups. Unit costs obtained from standard US cost sources were applied to each resource item, including to the vaccines (high dose US$31.82, standard dose $12.04). Clinical illness data were mapped to existing quality-of-life data. The time horizon was one influenza season; however, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost due to death during the study were calculated over a lifetime. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for high-dose versus standard-dose vaccine and used QALYs as an outcome in the cost-utility analysis. We undertook a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping to explore the effect of statistical uncertainty on the study results. FINDINGS: Mean per-participant medical costs were lower in the high-dose vaccine group ($1376.72 [SD 6857.59]) than in the standard-dose group ($1492.64 [7447.14]; difference -$115.92 [95% CI -264.18 to 35.48]). Mean societal costs were likewise lower in the high-dose versus the standard-dose group ($1506.48 [SD 7305.19] vs $1634.50 [7952.99]; difference -$128.02 [95% CI -286.89 to 33.30]). Hospital admissions contributed 95% of the total health-care-payer cost and 87% of the total societal costs. The mean per-participant number of hospital admissions was 0.0937 (SD 0.3644) in the high-dose group and 0.1017 (0.3708) in the standard-dose group (difference -0.0080, 95% CI -0.0160 to -0.0003). The high-dose vaccine provided a gain in QALYs (mean 8.1502 QALYs gained per participant [SD 0.5693]) compared with the standard-dose vaccine (8.1499 QALYs [0.5697]) and, due to cost savings, dominated standard-dose vaccine in the cost-utility analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the high-dose vaccine is 93% likely to be cost saving. INTERPRETATION: High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is a less costly and more effective alternative to the standard-dose vaccine, driven by a reduction in the number of hospital admissions.

The time horizon was one influenza season; however, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost due to death during the study were calculated over a lifetime. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for high-dose versus standard-dose vaccine and used QALYs as an outcome in the cost-utility analysis. We undertook a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping to explore the effect of statistical uncertainty on the study results. FINDINGS: Mean per-participant medical costs were lower in the high-dose vaccine group ($1376.72 [SD 6857.59]) than in the standard-dose group ($1492.64 [7447.14]; difference -$115.92 [95% CI -264.18 to 35.48]). Mean societal costs were likewise lower in the high-dose versus the standard-dose group ($1506.48 [SD 7305.19] vs $1634.50 [7952.99]; difference -$128.02 [95% CI -286.89 to 33.30]). Hospital admissions contributed 95% of the total health-care-payer cost and 87% of the total societal costs. The mean per-participant number of hospital admissions was 0.0937 (SD 0.3644) in the high-dose group and 0.1017 (0.3708) in the standard-dose group (difference -0.0080, 95% CI -0.0160 to -0.0003). The high-dose vaccine provided a gain in QALYs (mean 8.1502 QALYs gained per participant [SD 0.5693]) compared with the standard-dose vaccine (8.1499 QALYs [0.5697]) and, due to cost savings, dominated standard-dose vaccine in the cost-utility analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the high-dose vaccine is 93% likely to be cost saving. INTERPRETATION: High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is a less costly and more effective alternative to the standard-dose vaccine, driven by a reduction in the number of hospital admissions. These findings are relevant to US health-care beneficiaries, providers, payers, and recommending bodies, especially those seeking to improve outcomes while containing costs.

13912,Cost-Effectiveness of Pertuzumab in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,"PURPOSE: The Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) study showed a 15.7-month survival benefit with the addition of pertuzumab to docetaxel and trastuzumab (THP) as first-line treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the value of adding pertuzumab. PATIENT AND METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of docetaxel plus trastuzumab (TH) with or without pertuzumab in US patients with metastatic breast cancer. The model followed patients weekly over their remaining lifetimes. Health states included stable disease, progressing disease, hospice, and death. Transition probabilities were based on the CLEOPATRA study. Costs reflected the 2014 Medicare rates. Health state utilities were the same as those used in other recent cost-effectiveness studies of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Outcomes included health benefits expressed as discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs in US dollars, and cost effectiveness expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. One- and multiway deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored the effects of specific assumptions. RESULTS: Modeled median survival was 39.4 months for TH and 56.9 months for THP. The addition of pertuzumab resulted in an additional 1.82 life-years gained, or 0.64 QALYs, at a cost of $713,219 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that THP is unlikely to be cost effective even under the most favorable assumptions, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted 0% chance of cost effectiveness at a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: THP in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer is unlikely to be cost effective in the United States.",2015-01-17285,26351332,J Clin Oncol,Ben Y Durkee,2015,/,,No,26351332,"Ben Y Durkee; Yushen Qian; Erqi L Pollom; Martin T King; Sara A Dudley; Jenny L Shaffer; Daniel T Chang; Iris C Gibbs; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Kathleen C Horst; Cost-Effectiveness of Pertuzumab in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, J Clin Oncol, 2015 Sep 8; ():0732-183X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Docetaxel plus trastuzuman with pertuzumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Docetaxel plus trastuzuman,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,472668,United States,2014,516743.03
13913,A Novel Dynamic Model for Health Economic Analysis of Influenza Vaccination in the Elderly,"INTRODUCTION: New vaccines are being developed to improve the efficacy of seasonal influenza immunization in elderly persons aged >/=65 years. These products require clinical and economic evaluation to aid policy decisions. METHODS: To address this need, a two-part model has been developed, which we have applied to examine the potential clinical and economic impact of vaccinating elderly persons with adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (aTIV) relative to conventional trivalent (TIV) and quadrivalent (QIV) vaccines. We compared outcomes in the US population for (1) aTIV in persons aged >/=65 years and QIV in all other age cohorts; (2) QIV in all cohorts; (3) TIV in all cohorts. Low, average, and high intensity seasons with low, average, and high vaccine match scenarios were compared. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted within each discrete scenario to explore the impact of variation in model inputs on potential outcomes. RESULTS: Assuming current vaccination coverage rates in the US population with (a) 25% better efficacy of adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted vaccine against any strain and (b) 35% better efficacy of non-adjuvanted vaccine against matched B versus mismatched B strains, use of aTIV in persons aged >/=65 years and QIV in persons <65 years could reduce influenza cases by 11,166-1,329,200, hospitalizations by 1365-43,674, and deaths by 421-11,320 versus use of QIV in all cohorts. These outcomes are reflected in a corresponding increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 3003-94,084. If the prevalence of mismatched influenza B was >54.5% of all circulating strains, use of QIV in all cohorts would offset the clinical benefits of aTIV. Elderly aTIV or QIV vaccination was associated with improved outcomes over non-adjuvanted TIV in many of the scenarios, particularly in low match seasons of any intensity. Total cost savings (including direct and indirect healthcare costs plus productivity impacts) with aTIV in the elderly versus QIV in the whole population ranged from $27 million (low intensity, low match) to $934 million (high intensity, high match). Univariate sensitivity analysis of relative vaccine prices in the average intensity, average match scenario indicated that aTIV could be marginally cost saving relative to QIV at the currently published Medicare price for influenza vaccines offering enhanced efficacy in the elderly. Elderly vaccination with aTIV was associated with a higher overall cost compared with TIV in only two scenarios (low intensity with average or high match); the incremental cost/QALY relative to TIV was $9980 in the average match scenario and $28,800 in the high match scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of persons aged >/=65 years with aTIV has the potential to provide clinical and economic benefit relative to QIV and TIV.

13917,"Prenatal Testing in the Genomic Age: Clinical Outcomes, Quality of Life, and Costs","OBJECTIVE: To use a decision-analytic model to assess a comprehensive set of outcomes of prenatal genetic testing strategies among women of varying ages. METHODS: We assessed outcomes of six testing strategies incorporating diagnostic testing with chromosomal microarray, multiple marker screening, cell-free DNA screening, and nuchal translucency screening alone, in combination, or in sequence. Clinical outcomes included prenatal detection or birth of a neonate with a significant chromosomal abnormality and diagnostic procedures performed. Other outcomes included maternal quality-adjusted life-years and costs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: At all ages assessed, screening strategies starting with multiple marker screening offered the highest detection rate when all chromosomal abnormalities were considered. Incorporating cell-free DNA as an optional secondary screen decreased the number of diagnostic procedures, but also decreased the number of abnormalities diagnosed prenatally, resulting in a similar number of procedures per case diagnosed at age 30 years; the option of secondary cell-free DNA screening becomes more favorable at older ages. Multiple marker screening with optional follow-up diagnostic testing was the most effective (highest quality-adjusted life-years) and least expensive strategy at ages 20-38 years. At age 40 years or older, cell-free DNA screening was optimal with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $73,154 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Incorporating cell-free DNA as an optional secondary screen decreased the number of diagnostic procedures, but also decreased the number of abnormalities diagnosed prenatally, resulting in a similar number of procedures per case diagnosed at age 30 years; the option of secondary cell-free DNA screening becomes more favorable at older ages. Multiple marker screening with optional follow-up diagnostic testing was the most effective (highest quality-adjusted life-years) and least expensive strategy at ages 20-38 years. At age 40 years or older, cell-free DNA screening was optimal with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $73,154 per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSION: When considering all detectable chromosome problems as well as patient preferences and baseline risks, multiple marker screening with the option of diagnostic testing for screen-positive results is the optimal strategy for most women. At age 40 years and older, cell-free DNA as a primary screen becomes optimal and is cost-effective.

13922,The Cost Effectiveness of Maintenance Schedules Following Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Economic Evaluation Alongside a Randomised Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects approximately 3 million people in the UK. An 8-week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) course is recommended under current guidelines. However, studies show that initial benefits diminish over time. OBJECTIVE: We present here an economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a low-intensity maintenance programme over a time horizon of 1 year delivered in UK primary and secondary care settings. METHODS: Patients with COPD who completed at least 60 % of a standard 8-week PR programme were randomised to a 2-h maintenance session at 3, 6 and 9 months (n = 73) or treatment as usual (n = 75). Outcomes were change in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) score, EQ-5D-based QALYs, cost (price year 2014) to the UK NHS and social services over the 12 months following initial PR, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: At 12 months, incremental cost to the NHS and social services was - pound204.04 (95 % CI - pound1522 to pound1114). Incremental CRQ and QALY gains were -0.007 (-0.461 to 0.447) and +0.015 (-0.050 to 0.079), respectively. Based on point estimates, PR maintenance therefore dominates treatment as usual from the perspective of the NHS and social services in terms of cost per QALY gained. Whether it is cost effective in terms of CRQ depends on whether the pound204 per patient could be reinvested elsewhere to a CRQ gain of greater than 0.007. However, there is much decision uncertainty: 95 % CIs around increments did not exclude zero, and there is a 72.9 % (72.5 %) probability that the ICER is below pound20,000 ( pound30,000) per QALY. CONCLUSION: Future research should explore whether more intensive maintenance regimens offer benefit to patients at reasonable cost.",2015-01-17299,26346590,Med Arch,Darren K Burns,2015,/,,No,26346590,"Darren K Burns; Edward C F Wilson; Paula Browne; Sandra Olive; Allan Clark; Penny Galey; Emma Dix; Helene Woodhouse; Sue Robinson; Andrew Wilson; The Cost Effectiveness of Maintenance Schedules Following Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Economic Evaluation Alongside a Randomised Controlled Trial, Med Arch, 2015 Sep 7; ():0350-199X",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) course, followed by maintenance sessions at 3, 6 and 9 months vs. Standard/Usual Care- Encouragement to continue exercises at the conclusion of the initial 2-month course, and to attend a local support group for people with lung conditions",Patients with COPD plus a smoking history,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-13602.67,United Kingdom,2013,-23638.21
13923,Cost-Effectiveness of Herpes Zoster Vaccine for Persons Aged 50 Years,"Background: Each year, herpes zoster (HZ) affects 1 million U.S. adults, many of whom develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Zoster vaccine is licensed for persons aged 50 years or older, but its cost-effectiveness for those aged 50 to 59 years is unknown. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccine versus no vaccination. Design: Markov model. Data Sources: Medical literature. Target Population: Adults aged 50 years. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: HZ vaccine. Outcome Measures: Number of HZ and PHN cases prevented and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Results of Base-Case Analysis: For every 1000 persons receiving the vaccine at age 50 years, 25 HZ cases and 1 PHN case could be prevented. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for HZ vaccine versus no vaccine was $323 456 per QALY. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: In deterministic and scenario sensitivity analyses, the only variables that produced an ICER less than $100 000 per QALY were vaccine cost (at a value of $80) and the rate at which efficacy wanes. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was $500 754 per QALY (95% CI, $93 510 to $1 691 211 per QALY). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY, the probability that vaccination would be cost-effective was 3%. Limitation: Long-term effectiveness data for HZ vaccine are lacking for 50-year-old adults. Conclusion: Herpes zoster vaccine for persons aged 50 years does not seem to represent good value according to generally accepted standards. Our findings support the decision of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices not to recommend the vaccine for adults in this age group.

13924,Economic evaluation of a tight-control treatment strategy using an imaging device (handscan) for monitoring joint inflammation in early rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a tight-control treatment strategy using the handscan (TCHS) compared to using only clinical assessments (TC) and compared to a general non-tight-control treatment strategy (usual care; UC) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Data from 299 early RA patients from the CAMERA trial were used. Clinical outcomes were extrapolated to Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and costs using a Markov model. Costs and QALYs were compared between the TC and UC treatment strategy arm of the CAMERA trial and a simulated tight-control treatment strategy using the handscan (TCHS). Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were calculated and several scenario analyses performed. All analyses were performed probabilistically to obtain confidence intervals and costs-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves. RESULTS: In TCHS, euro4,660 (95% CI -euro11,516 to euro2,045) was saved and 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.11) QALYs were gained when compared to UC, with an ICER of euro77,670 saved per QALY gained. Ninety-one percent (91%) of simulations resulted in less costs and more QALYs.

13927,The Cost Effectiveness of Docetaxel and Active Symptom Control versus Active Symptom Control Alone for Refractory Oesophagogastric Adenocarcinoma: Economic Analysis of the COUGAR-02 Trial,"BACKGROUND: The COUGAR-02 trial recently showed survival and quality-of-life benefits of docetaxel and active symptom control (DXL + ASC) over active symptom control (ASC) alone in patients with refractory oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. AIM: The aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation conforming to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance to evaluate the cost effectiveness of DXL + ASC versus ASC from the perspective of the English National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: Cost-utility analyses were conducted using trial data. Utility values were captured using the EQ-5D completed by patients at 3- and 6-weekly intervals, while resource use was captured using nurse-completed report forms and patient reports. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and the main outcome was cost per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted to capture sampling uncertainty and to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The analysis horizon was the trial period (median follow-up 12 months) and no modelling or discounting of future costs and benefits was conducted. RESULTS: Average costs were pound9352 and pound6218 for DXL + ASC and ASC, respectively, and average QALYs were 0.302 and 0.186, respectively. This yielded an ICER of pound27,180 for DXL + ASC. DXL + ASC had a 24 % chance of being cost effective at a pound20,000 QALY threshold (lambda) and a mean net monetary benefit of - pound821; this rose to 59 % and pound332 when the threshold was raised to pound30,000. If NICE end-of-life criteria are applied, the probability of cost effectiveness increases to 90 % (at lambda = pound50,000). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: DXL + ASC is likely to be cost effective if an end-of-life premium is applied.

13928,"Cost Effectiveness of Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide Compared with Sevelamer Carbonate in the Treatment of Hyperphosphataemia in Patients Receiving Dialysis, from the Perspective of the National Health Service in Scotland","BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphataemia is common and harmful in patients receiving dialysis. Treatment options include noncalcium-based phosphate binders such as sevelamer carbonate (SC) and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the health economic impact of PA21-based strategies compared with SC-based strategies, from the perspective of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on data from a randomised clinical trial comparing PA21 and SC. Model input parameters were derived from published literature, national statistics and unpublished sources. Costs (price year 2012) and effects were discounted at 3.5 %. Analysis with a lifelong time horizon yielded the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost or savings per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or forgone. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to explore uncertainties around assumptions and model input parameters. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, phosphorus reductions for PA21 and SC were 1.93 and 1.95 mg/dL. Average undiscounted survival was estimated to be 7.61 years per patient in both strategies. PA21 patients accrued less QALYs (2.826) than SC patients (2.835), partially due to differential occurrence of side effects. Total costs were 13,119 and 14,728 for PA21 and SC, respectively (difference per patient of 1609). By using PA21 versus SC, one would save 174,999 (or 123,463 when including dialysis and transplantation costs) for one QALY forgone. A scenario modelling the nonsignificant reduction in mortality (relative risk 0.714) observed in the trial yielded an ICER for PA21 of 22,621 per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the base-case, PA21 was dominant in 11 %, and at least cost-effective in 53 %, of iterations, using a threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PA21 versus SC in hyperphosphataemic patients being intolerant of calcium-based phosphate binders may be cost saving and yields only very limited disadvantages in terms of quality-adjusted survival.

13929,A cost-effectiveness analysis of trametinib plus dabrafenib as first-line therapy for metastatic BRAF V600-positive melanoma in the Swiss setting,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The treatment of patients with metastatic melanomas that harbour BRAF V600E or V600K mutations with trametinib plus dabrafenib appears to be superior to treatment with vemurafenib alone. This treatment regimen is likely to become available in Switzerland in the near future. However, its cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation was conducted to model the clinical course of typical patients with metastatic melanoma. Information on response rates, clinical condition, and follow-up treatments were derived and transition probabilities estimated based on the results of a clinical trial that compared treatment with trametinib plus dabrafenib versus vemurafenib alone. RESULTS: Treatment with trametinib plus dabrafenib was estimated to cost an additional CHF199,647 on average and yield a gain of 0.52 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF385,603/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that a willingness to pay threshold of CHF100,000/QALY would not be reached at trametinib's current United States price. CONCLUSION: The introduction of trametinib in Switzerland at US market prices for the treatment of metastatic BRAF V600-positive melanoma with trametinib plus dabrafenib is unlikely to be cost effective compared to vemurafenib monotherapy. A reduction in the total price of the combination therapy is required to achieve an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio for this clinically promising treatment.

13932,The Role of Surgical Resection in Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Decision and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical intervention (CRS) vs definitive chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CR) in clinical stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients at academic and nonacademic centers. METHODS: Patients with clinical stage IIIA NSCLC receiving CR or CRS from 1998 to 2010 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Propensity score matching on patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics was performed. Medicare allowable charges were used for treatment costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was based on probabilistic 5-year survival and calculated as cost per life-year gained. RESULTS: We identified 5,265 CR and CRS matched patient pairs. Surgical resection imparted an increased effectiveness of 0.83 life-years, with an ICER of $17,618. Among nonacademic centers, 1,634 matched CR and CRS patients demonstrated a benefit with surgical resection of 0.86 life-years gained, for an ICER of $17,124. At academic centers, 3,201 matched CR and CRS patients had increased survival of 0.81 life-years with surgical resection, for an ICER of $18,144. Finally, 3,713 CRS patients were matched between academic and nonacademic centers. Academic center surgical patients had an increased effectiveness of 1.5 months gained and dominated the model with lower surgical cost estimates associated with lower 30-day mortality rates.

This paper reports the health economic evaluation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adults with new diagnosis of tennis elbow were recruited from 38 general practices in the UK, and randomly allocated to PCM (n = 120) or PCM plus TENS (n = 121). Outcomes included reduction in pain intensity and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) based on the EQ5D and SF6D. Two economic perspectives were evaluated: (i) healthcare-inclusive of NHS and private health costs for the tennis elbow; (ii) societal-healthcare costs plus productivity losses through work absenteeism. Mean outcome and cost differences between the groups were evaluated using a multiple imputed dataset as the base case evaluation, with uncertainty represented in cost-effectiveness planes and through probabilistic cost-effectiveness acceptability curves). Incremental healthcare cost was pound33 (95%CI -40, 106) and societal cost pound65 (95%CI -307, 176) for PCM plus TENS. Mean differences in outcome were: 0.11 (95%CI -0.13, 0.35) for change in pain (0-10 pain scale); -0.015 (95%CI -0.058, 0.029) for QALYEQ5D; 0.007 (95%CI -0.022, 0.035) for QALYSF6D (higher score differences denote greater benefit for PCM plus TENS). The ICER (incremental cost effectiveness ratio) for the main evaluation of mean difference in societal cost ( pound) relative to mean difference in pain outcome was -582 (95%CI -8666, 8113). However, incremental ICERs show differences in cost-effectiveness of additional TENS, according to the outcome being evaluated. CONCLUSION: Our findings do not provide evidence for or against the cost-effectiveness of TENS as an adjunct to primary care management of tennis elbow.",2015-01-17337,26317528,PLoS One,Martyn Lewis,2015,10 / 8,e0135460,No,26317528,"Martyn Lewis; Linda S Chesterton; Julius Sim; Christian D Mallen; Elaine M Hay; Danielle A van der Windt; An Economic Evaluation of TENS in Addition to Usual Primary Care Management for the Treatment of Tennis Elbow: Results from the TATE Randomized Controlled Trial, PLoS One , 2015; 10(8):1932-6203; e0135460",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Primary care management vs. Standard/Usual Care- Primary care management,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1145,United Kingdom,2011,-2113.54
13934,Economic evaluation of sacral neuromodulation in overactive bladder: A Canadian perspective,"INTRODUCTION: Refractory overactive bladder (OAB) with urge incontinence is an underdiagnosed condition with substantial burden on the healthcare system and diminished patient's quality-of-life. Many patients will fail conservative treatment with optimized medical-therapy (OMT) and may benefit from minimally invasive procedures, including sacral-neuromodulation (SNM) or botulinum-toxin (BonT-A). The goal of this study was to estimate the cost-efectiveness of SNM vs. OMT and BonT-A as important parameters from coverage and access to a therapy. METHODS: A Markov model with Monte-Carlo simulation was used to assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SNM vs. BonT-A and OMT both in deterministic and probabilistic analysis from a provincial payer perspective over a 10-year time horizon with 9-month Markov-cycles. Clinical data, healthcare resource utilization, and utility scores were acquired from recent publications and an expert panel of 7 surgeons. Cost data (2014-Dollars) were derived from provincial health insurance policy, drug benefit formulary, and hospital data. All cost and outcomes were discounted at a 3% rate. RESULTS: The annual (year 1-10) incremental quality-adjusted life years for SNM vs. BonT-A was 0.05 to 0.51 and SNM vs. OMT was 0.19 to 1.76. The annual incremental cost of SNM vs. BonT-A was $7237 in year 1 and -$9402 in year 10 and was between $8878 and -$11 447 vs. OMT. In the base-case deterministic analysis, the ICER for SNM vs. BonT-A and OMT were within the acceptable range ($44 837 and $15 130, respectively) at the second year of therapy, and SNM was dominant in consequent years. In the base-case analysis the probability of ICER being below the acceptability curve (willingness-to-pay $50 000) was >99% for SNM vs. BonT-A at year 3 and >95% for OMT at year 2. CONCLUSION: SNM is a cost-effective treatment option to manage patients with refractory OAB when compared to either BonT-A or OMT. From a Canadian payers' perspective, SNM may be considered a first-line treatment option in management of patients with OAB with superior long-term outcomes.

13936,Clinical and Economic Implications of Apixaban Versus Aspirin in the Low-Risk Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although recommended by guidelines, the benefits of treating patients with atrial fibrillation with a low-stroke risk score, with aspirin or anticoagulants, have not been clearly established. With advent of safer non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, we assessed the clinical and economic implications of 5 mg BID of apixaban versus aspirin among patients with a relative low risk of stroke as assessed using the CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age>75, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack) and CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease) stroke risk classification. METHODS: A previously developed and validated Markov model was adapted. A secondary analysis of the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) study was conducted to estimate event rates in different low-risk cohorts by treatment. Three cohorts (n=1000) with a CHADS2 score of 1, CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, and CHA2DS2-VASc of score 2 to 4 were simulated to assess the number of clinical events avoided in terms of strokes and major bleeds, as well as life years gained, quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained. RESULTS: Apixaban was associated with fewer strokes and systemic embolism versus aspirin across all subgroups; however, it caused more major bleeding events. The reduction in systemic embolism offset the increase in major bleeding events leading to increased life expectancy and quality-adjusted life year gains, achieved at an increased cost that was lower than the UK threshold of $44 400 (ie, pound30 000) per quality-adjusted life year gained across the 3 cohorts examined.

13939,Targeted vaccination in healthy school children - Can primary school vaccination alone control influenza?,"BACKGROUND: The UK commenced an extension to the seasonal influenza vaccination policy in autumn 2014 that will eventually see all healthy children between the ages of 2-16 years offered annual influenza vaccination. Models suggest that the new policy will be both highly effective at reducing the burden of influenza as well as cost-effective. We explore whether targeting vaccination at either primary or secondary schools would be more effective and/or cost-effective than the current strategy. METHODS: An age-structured deterministic transmission dynamic SEIR-type mathematical model was used to simulate a national influenza outbreak in England. Costs including GP consultations, hospitalisations due to influenza and vaccinations were compared to potential gains in quality-adjusted life years achieved through vaccinating healthy children. Costs and benefits of the new JCVI vaccination policy were estimated over a single season, and compared to the hypothesised new policies of targeted and heterogeneous vaccination. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: All potential vaccination policies were highly cost-effective.

13942,Necitumumab in Metastatic Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: Establishing a Value-Based Cost,"Importance: The SQUIRE trial demonstrated that adding necitumumab to chemotherapy for patients with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer (mSqCLC) increased median overall survival by 1.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.84). However, the costs and value associated with this intervention remains unclear. Value-based pricing links the price of a drug to the benefit that it provides and is a novel method to establish prices for new treatments. Objective: To evaluate the range of drug costs for which adding necitumumab to chemotherapy could be considered cost-effective. Design, Setting, and Participants: We developed a Markov model using data from multiple sources, including the SQUIRE trial, which compared standard chemotherapy with and without necitumumab as first-line treatment of mSqCLC, to evaluate the costs and patient life expectancies associated with each regimen. In the analysis, patients were modeled to receive gemcitabine and cisplatin for 6 cycles or gemcitabine, cisplatin, and necitumumab for 6 cycles followed by maintenance necitumumab. Our model's clinical inputs were the survival estimates and frequency of adverse events (AEs) described in the SQUIRE trial. Log-logistic models were fitted to the survival distributions in the SQUIRE trial. The cost inputs included drug costs, based on the Medicare average sale prices, and costs for drug administration and management of AEs, based on Medicare reimbursement rates (all in 2014 US dollars). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the use of necitumumab across a range of values for its cost. Model robustness was assessed by probabilistic sensitivity analyses, based on 10000 Monte Carlo simulations, sampling values from the distributions of all model parameters. Results: In the base case analysis, the addition of necitumumab to the treatment regimen produced an incremental survival benefit of 0.15 life-years and 0.11 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The probabilistic sensitivity analyses established that when necitumumab cost less than $563 and less than $1309 per cycle, there was 90% confidence that the ICER for adding necitumumab would be less than $100000 per QALY and less than $200000 per QALY, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings provide a value-based range for the cost of necitumumab from $563 to $1309 per cycle.

13943,Chlamydia screening for pregnant women aged 16-25 years attending an antenatal service: a cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE: Determine the cost-effectiveness of screening all pregnant women aged 16-25 years for chlamydia compared with selective screening or no screening. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness based on a decision model. SETTING: Antenatal clinics in Australia. SAMPLE: Pregnant women, aged 16-25 years. METHODS: Using clinical data from a previous study, and outcomes data from the literature, we modelled the short-term perinatal (12-month time horizon) incremental direct costs and outcomes from a government (as the primary third-party funder) perspective for chlamydia screening. Costs were derived from the Medicare Benefits Schedule, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and average cost-weights reported for hospitalisations classified according to the Australian refined diagnosis-related groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct costs of screening and managing chlamydia complications, number of chlamydia cases detected and treated, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated and subjected to sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming a chlamydia prevalence rate of 3%, screening all antenatal women aged 16-25 years at their first antenatal visit compared with no screening was $34,931 per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Screening all women could result in cost savings when chlamydia prevalence was higher than 11%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to the assumed prevalence of chlamydia, the probability of pelvic inflammatory disease, the utility weight of a positive chlamydia test and the cost of the chlamydia test and doctor''s appointment. CONCLUSION: From an Australian government perspective, chlamydia screening of all women aged 16-25 years old during one antenatal visit was likely to be cost-effective compared with no screening or selective screening, especially with increasing chlamydia prevalence.

13944,Chlamydia screening for pregnant women aged 16-25 years attending an antenatal service: a cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE: Determine the cost-effectiveness of screening all pregnant women aged 16-25 years for chlamydia compared with selective screening or no screening. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness based on a decision model. SETTING: Antenatal clinics in Australia. SAMPLE: Pregnant women, aged 16-25 years. METHODS: Using clinical data from a previous study, and outcomes data from the literature, we modelled the short-term perinatal (12-month time horizon) incremental direct costs and outcomes from a government (as the primary third-party funder) perspective for chlamydia screening. Costs were derived from the Medicare Benefits Schedule, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and average cost-weights reported for hospitalisations classified according to the Australian refined diagnosis-related groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct costs of screening and managing chlamydia complications, number of chlamydia cases detected and treated, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated and subjected to sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming a chlamydia prevalence rate of 3%, screening all antenatal women aged 16-25 years at their first antenatal visit compared with no screening was $34,931 per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Screening all women could result in cost savings when chlamydia prevalence was higher than 11%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to the assumed prevalence of chlamydia, the probability of pelvic inflammatory disease, the utility weight of a positive chlamydia test and the cost of the chlamydia test and doctor''s appointment. CONCLUSION: From an Australian government perspective, chlamydia screening of all women aged 16-25 years old during one antenatal visit was likely to be cost-effective compared with no screening or selective screening, especially with increasing chlamydia prevalence.

13945,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Regorafenib for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"PURPOSE: Regorafenib is a standard-care option for treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer that increases median overall survival by 6 weeks compared with placebo. Given this small incremental clinical benefit, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib in the third-line setting for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer from the US payer perspective. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost and effectiveness of regorafenib with those of placebo in the third-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates in 2014. Model robustness was addressed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Regorafenib provided an additional 0.04 QALYs (0.13 life-years) at a cost of $40,000, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $900,000 per QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for regorafenib was > $550,000 per QALY in all of our univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

13948,Cost effectiveness evaluation of a rotavirus vaccination program in Argentina,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus diarrhea is one of the most important vaccine-preventable causes of severe diarrhea in children worldwide. There are two live-attenuated virus vaccines licensed, Rotarix(R) (RV1) a monovalent vaccine by GlaxoSmithKline and a pentavalent vaccine, RotaTeq(R) (RV5), by Merck & Co., with similar results. This study aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the utilization of RV1 compared with RV5 in Argentina. METHODS: A deterministic Markov model based on the lifetime follow up of a static cohort was used. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as a measure of results, the perspective of the health care system and a 5% discount rate for health benefits and costs has been used. A review of the literature to obtain epidemiologic and resources utilization of rotavirus diarrhea was performed. The sources used to estimate epidemiologic parameters were the National Health Surveillance System, the national mortality statistics and national database of hospital discharges records. Costs were obtained from different health subsectors and are expressed in local currency. RESULTS: Both vaccination alternatives were less costly and more effective than the strategy without vaccination (total costs $ 69,700,645 and 2575 total QALYs lost). When comparing RV1 vs. RV5, RV1 was less expensive ($ 60,174,508 vs. $ 67,545,991 total costs) and more effective (1105 vs. 1213 total QALYs lost) than RV5, RV1 being therefore a dominating strategy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed results to be robust with a 100% probability of being cost-effective at a WTP threshold of 1 GDP per capita when comparing the RV1 vs. no vaccination.

13950,Cost-Effective Evaluation of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease With NAFLD Fibrosis Score and Vibration Controlled Transient Elastography,"OBJECTIVES: The risk of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is traditionally assessed with a liver biopsy, which is both costly and associated with adverse events. METHODS: We sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of four different strategies to assess fibrosis risk in patients with NAFLD: vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE), the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), combination testing with NFS and VCTE, and liver biopsy (usual care). We developed a probabilistic decision analytical microsimulation state-transition model wherein we simulated a cohort of 10,000 50-year-old Americans with NAFLD undergoing evaluation by a gastroenterologist. VCTE performance was obtained from a prospective cohort of 144 patients with NAFLD. RESULTS: Both the NFS alone and the NFS/VCTE strategies were cost effective at $5,795 and $5,768 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY), respectively. In the microsimulation, the NFS alone and NFS/VCTE strategies were the most cost-effective (dominant) in 66.8 and 33.2% of samples given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. In a sensitivity analysis, the minimum cost per liver biopsy at which the NFS is cost saving is $339 and the maximum cost per VCTE exam at which the NFS/VCTE strategy remains cost saving is $1,593. The expected value of further research on this topic is $526 million.

13953,Cost-Effectiveness of Adding Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy to an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Among Patients With Mild Heart Failure,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with mild heart failure. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding CRT to an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (CRT-D) compared with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) alone among patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, prolonged intraventricular conduction, and mild heart failure. DESIGN: Markov decision model. DATA SOURCES: Clinical trials, clinical registries, claims data from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention life tables. TARGET POPULATION: Patients aged 65 years or older with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% or less, QRS duration of 120 milliseconds or more, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I or II symptoms. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: CRT-D or ICD alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Use of CRT-D increased life expectancy (9.8 years versus 8.8 years), QALYs (8.6 years versus 7.6 years), and costs ($286 500 versus $228 600), yielding a cost per QALY gained of $61 700. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The cost-effectiveness of CRT-D was most dependent on the degree of mortality reduction: When the risk ratio for death was 0.95, the ICER increased to $119 600 per QALY. More expensive CRT-D devices, shorter CRT-D battery life, and older age also made the cost-effectiveness of CRT-D less favorable. LIMITATIONS: The estimated mortality reduction for CRT-D was largely based on a single trial. Data on patients with NYHA class I symptoms were limited. The cost-effectiveness of CRT-D in patients with NYHA class I symptoms remains uncertain. CONCLUSION: In patients with an LVEF of 30% or less, QRS duration of 120 milliseconds or more, and NYHA class II symptoms, CRT-D appears to be economically attractive relative to ICD alone when a reduction in mortality is expected.

13956,Linezolid Versus Vancomycin in the Empiric Treatment of Nosocomial Pneumonia: A Cost-Utility Analysis Incorporating Results from the ZEPHyR Trial,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of vancomycin versus linezolid in the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonias incorporating results from a recent prospective, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial in adults with suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS: A decision-analytic model examining the cost-effectiveness of linezolid versus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia was created. Publicly available cost, efficacy, and utility data populated relevant model variables. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis varied parameters in 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations, and univariate sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of model uncertainties and the robustness of our conclusions. RESULTS: Results indicated that the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) increased 6% ($22,594 vs. $23,860) by using linezolid versus vancomycin for nosocomial pneumonia. The incremental cost per QALY gained by using linezolid over vancomycin was $6,089, and the incremental cost per life saved was $68,615 with the use of linezolid. Vancomycin dominated linezolid in the subset of patients with documented MRSA. The incremental cost per QALY gained using linezolid if no mortality benefit exists between agents or a 60-day time horizon was analyzed was $19,608,688 and $443,662, respectively.

13957,Cost-Effectiveness of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation versus Antidepressant Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression,"BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy is a clinically safe, noninvasive, nonsystemic treatment for major depressive disorder. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of rTMS versus pharmacotherapy for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder who have failed at least two adequate courses of antidepressant medications. METHODS: A 3-year Markov microsimulation model with 2-monthly cycles was used to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of rTMS and a mix of antidepressant medications (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). The model synthesized data sourced from published literature, national cost reports, and expert opinions. Incremental cost-utility ratios were calculated, and uncertainty of the results was assessed using univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with pharmacotherapy, rTMS is a dominant/cost-effective alternative for patients with treatment-resistant depressive disorder. The model predicted that QALYs gained with rTMS were higher than those gained with antidepressant medications (1.25 vs. 1.18 QALYs) while costs were slightly less (AU $31,003 vs. AU $31,190). In the Australian context, at the willingness-to-pay threshold of AU $50,000 per QALY gain, the probability that rTMS was cost-effective was 73%. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the superiority of rTMS in terms of value for money compared with antidepressant medications. CONCLUSIONS: Although both pharmacotherapy and rTMS are clinically effective treatments for major depressive disorder, rTMS is shown to outperform antidepressants in terms of cost-effectiveness for patients who have failed at least two adequate courses of antidepressant medications.",2015-01-17396,26297087,Value Health,Kim-Huong Nguyen,2015,18 / 5,597-604,Yes,26297087,"Kim-Huong Nguyen; Louisa G Gordon; Cost-Effectiveness of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation versus Antidepressant Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression, Value Health, 2015 Jul; 18(5):1098-3015; 597-604",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard antidepressant therapy,Treatment-resistant depression.

13958,The Cost-Effectiveness of Different Hearing Screening Strategies for 50- to 70-Year-Old Adults: A Markov Model,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of screening 50- to 70-year-old adults for hearing loss in The Netherlands. We compared no screening, telephone screening, Internet screening, screening with a handheld screening device, and audiometric screening for various starting ages and a varying number of repeated screenings. METHODS: The costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for no screening and for 76 screening strategies were analyzed using a Markov model with cohort simulation for the year 2011. Screening was deemed to be cost-effective if the costs were less than euro20,000/QALY. RESULTS: Screening with a handheld screening device and audiometric screening were generally more costly but less effective than telephone and Internet screening. Internet screening strategies were slightly better than telephone screening strategies. Internet screening at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, was the most cost-effective strategy, costing euro3699/QALY. At a threshold of euro20,000/QALY, this strategy was with 100% certainty cost-effective compared with current practice and with 69% certainty the most cost-effective strategy among all strategies. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that Internet screening at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, is the optimal strategy to screen for hearing loss and might be considered for nationwide implementation.",2015-01-17399,26297083,Value Health,Anouk M Linssen,2015,18 / 5,560-9,Yes,26297083,"Anouk M Linssen; Lucien J C Anteunis; Manuela A Joore; The Cost-Effectiveness of Different Hearing Screening Strategies for 50- to 70-Year-Old Adults: A Markov Model, Value Health, 2015 Jul; 18(5):1098-3015; 560-9",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Internet screening strategies at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years vs. None",Not in possession of hearing aids,70 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,-3697.12,Euro,2011,-5919.55

Antidepressant treatment is the primary therapeutic intervention. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of new generation antidepressants and their cost-effectiveness in the Singapore healthcare system. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for head-to-head randomised controlled trials on ten antidepressants (agomelatine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone and venlafaxine) employed as monotherapy in acute MDD management. We performed a network meta-analysis to compare their relative efficacy. The outcome measures for efficacy were response and remission rate, and mean change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score; and for tolerability, study withdrawal rates due to adverse events. To evaluate their relative cost effectiveness, a decision tree simulating a cohort of MDD patients using antidepressant as monotherapy was constructed from a societal perspective over 6 months. We used effectiveness data from our network meta-analysis and local data on resource use for depression in Singapore. The incremental cost expected for each additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated and presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: We identified 76 relevant articles for the network meta-analysis. Of the ten agents included in the analysis, mirtazapine and agomelatine were most efficacious in achieving response and remission, respectively. Mirtazapine and duloxetine resulted in the greatest magnitude of change in the HDRS score. Agomelatine, escitalopram and sertraline were the best tolerated of the drugs analysed, while duloxetine was the least well tolerated drug. Using a composite outcome of efficacy (response and remission rates) and tolerability, agomelatine, escitalopram and mirtazapine were the favoured treatments. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, apart from agomelatine, all the treatments were dominated by mirtazapine. Against mirtazapine, agomelatine was not cost effective given that its ICER exceeded the threshold value.

Of the ten agents included in the analysis, mirtazapine and agomelatine were most efficacious in achieving response and remission, respectively. Mirtazapine and duloxetine resulted in the greatest magnitude of change in the HDRS score. Agomelatine, escitalopram and sertraline were the best tolerated of the drugs analysed, while duloxetine was the least well tolerated drug. Using a composite outcome of efficacy (response and remission rates) and tolerability, agomelatine, escitalopram and mirtazapine were the favoured treatments. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, apart from agomelatine, all the treatments were dominated by mirtazapine. Against mirtazapine, agomelatine was not cost effective given that its ICER exceeded the threshold value.

13967,Network Meta-Analysis and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of New Generation Antidepressants,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts health, quality of life and workplace productivity. Antidepressant treatment is the primary therapeutic intervention. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of new generation antidepressants and their cost-effectiveness in the Singapore healthcare system. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for head-to-head randomised controlled trials on ten antidepressants (agomelatine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone and venlafaxine) employed as monotherapy in acute MDD management. We performed a network meta-analysis to compare their relative efficacy. The outcome measures for efficacy were response and remission rate, and mean change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score; and for tolerability, study withdrawal rates due to adverse events. To evaluate their relative cost effectiveness, a decision tree simulating a cohort of MDD patients using antidepressant as monotherapy was constructed from a societal perspective over 6 months. We used effectiveness data from our network meta-analysis and local data on resource use for depression in Singapore. The incremental cost expected for each additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated and presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: We identified 76 relevant articles for the network meta-analysis.

13968,A cost-utility analysis of sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) compared to medical treatment in complete spinal cord injured patients with a neurological bladder,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) and posterior sacral rhizotomy restores the ability to urinate on demand with low residual volumes, a key for preventing urinary complications which account for 10% of the causes of death in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) with a neurological bladder. Nevertheless, comparative cost-effectiveness results on a long-time horizon are lacking to adequately inform decisions of reimbursement. PURPOSE: To estimate the long-term cost-utility of SARS using the Finetech-Brindley device compared to medical treatment (anticholinergics + catheterization). STUDY DESIGN / SETTINGS: Markov model elaborated with a 10-year time-horizon. Four irreversible states: 1) initial treatment; 2) year 1 of surgery for urinary complication; 3) year >1 of surgery for urinary complication 4) death. Reversible states: urinary calculi; Finetech-Brindley device failures. PATIENT SAMPLE: Theoretical cohorts of patients with a complete spinal cord lesion since >/=1 year, and a neurological bladder. OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness was expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALY). Costs were valued in EUR 2013 in the perspective of the French health system. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed to estimate transition probabilities and Quality Ajusted Life Years (QALYs). Costs were estimated from the literature, and through simulations using the 2013 French prospective payment system (PMSI) classification. Probabilistic analyses were conducted to handle parameters uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base case analysis (2.5% discount rate), the cost-utility ratio was 12 710 EUR/QALY gained. At a threshold of 30,000 EUR/QALY the probability of SARS being cost-effective compared to medical treatment was 60%. If the French Healthcare System reimbursed SARS for 80 patients/year during 10 years (anticipated target population) the expected incremental net health benefit would be 174 QALYs, and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) would be 4.735 million EUR. The highest partial EVPI is reached for utility values and costs (1.3 to 1.6 million EUR). CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that SARS using Finetech-Brindley device offers the most important benefit and should be considered cost-effective at a cost-effectivness threshold of 30,000 EUR/QALY. Despite a high uncertainty, EVPI and partial EVPI may indicate that further research would not be profitable to inform decision making.",2015-01-17410,26291400,J Trauma Nurs,Camille Morliere,2015,/,,No,26291400,"Camille Morliere; Elise Verpillot; Laurence Donon; Louis-Rachid Salmi; Pierre-Alain Joseph; Jean-Rodolphe Vignes; Antoine Benard; A cost-utility analysis of sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) compared to medical treatment in complete spinal cord injured patients with a neurological bladder, J Trauma Nurs, 2015 Aug 17; ():1078-7496",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sacral anterior root stimulation and posterior sacral rhizotomy with Finetech-Brindley device vs. Standard/Usual Care- Anticholinergics + catheterization,Patients with a complete traumatic cervical or thoracic spinal cord lesion since 1 year or more and suffering from a neurogenic bladder,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,2.50,2.50,12710,Euro,2013,18754.1
13969,Cost-effectiveness of tiotropium versus usual care and glycopyrronium in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Tiotropium (TIO) is a well-established bronchodilator, LAMA (long-acting anticholinergic), for the treatment of moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical evidence suggests that tiotropium is superior to usual non-LAMA care (UC) but may also have benefits compared to other LAMAs in preventing and limiting the effects of severe exacerbations. The primary objective of this study was to undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis of adding tiotropium to usual care versus usual care alone. A secondary objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of tiotropium compared to glycopyrronium (GLY), another LAMA. The study was conducted with a Swedish setting in mind. METHODS: A Markov cohort model, incorporating the effects of exacerbations, was populated with efficacy data from the UPLIFT and SPARK trials and epidemiological data relevant for a Swedish patient population. Treatment efficacy of tiotropium was modelled as a lowering of the risk of exacerbations and as a slow-down of overall disease progression. The model followed patients over their remaining life-time. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that patients treated with tiotropium gained 0.07 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to usual care alone at an incremental cost of SEK 15,041, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of SEK 224,850. Compared to glycopyrronium the QALY gained was estimated to 0.23 QALYs in favour of tiotropium at an incremental cost of SEK 2423, yielding a cost per QALY gained of SEK 10,456. The results were mainly driven by differences in the risk of severe exacerbations. CONCLUSION: At the current implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY threshold in Sweden, the results from this study indicate that tiotropium is a highly cost-effective intervention when added to usual non-LAMA care in the treatment of moderate to very severe COPD in Sweden.

13971,"Cost-effectiveness of three treatment strategies for lumbar spinal stenosis: Conservative care, laminectomy, and the Superion interspinous spacer","BACKGROUND: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a painful and debilitating condition resulting in healthcare costs totaling tens of billions of dollars annually. Initial treatment consists of conservative care modalities such as physical therapy, NSAIDs, opioids, and steroid injections. Patients refractory to these therapies can undergo decompressive surgery, which has good long-term efficacy but is more traumatic and can be associated with high post-operative adverse event (AE) rates. Interspinous spacers have been developed to offer a less-invasive alternative. The objective of this study was to compare the costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained of conservative care (CC) and decompressive surgery (DS) to a new minimally-invasive interspinous spacer. METHODS: A Markov model was developed evaluating 3 strategies of care for lumbar spinal stenosis. If initial therapies failed, the model moved patients to more invasive therapies. Data from the Superion FDA clinical trial, a prospective spinal registry, and the literature were used to populate the model. Direct medical care costs were modeled from 2014 Medicare reimbursements for healthcare services. QALYs came from the SF-12 PCS and MCS components. The analysis used a 2-year time horizon with a 3% discount rate. RESULTS: CC had the lowest cost at $10,540, while Spacers and DS were nearly identical at about $13,950. CC also had the lowest QALY increase (0.06), while Spacers and DS were again nearly identical (.28). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for Spacers compared to CC was $16,300 and for DS was $15,200.

Dabigatran etexilate demonstrated similar efficacy to warfarin, and was associated with a reduced risk of major or clinically relevant bleeds. Based on results of these trials, and real-life disease prognosis following discontinuation of anticoagulation treatment, we evaluated the cost-utility of dabigatran etexilate compared with warfarin in six months anticoagulation, and in extended, up to 24 months anticoagulation, in patients with acute VTE, acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or acute, symptomatic, pulmonary embolism (PE). Costs were analysed from the perspective of the National Health Services (NHS) and Public Social Services (PSS) in England and Wales. Outcomes were quantified in quality-adjusted life years (QALY).

CONCLUSIONS: While both PPM and Xpert are promising tools for combatting TB in India, PPM should be prioritized over Xpert, as private sector engagement is more cost-effective than Xpert alone and, if sufficient resources are available, would substantially increase the value of Xpert if both interventions are implemented together.",2015-01-17472,26260835,J Hepatol,S-C Suen,2015,19 / 9,1115-24,No,26260835,"S-C Suen; E Bendavid; J D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Cost-effectiveness of improvements in diagnosis and treatment accessibility for tuberculosis control in India, J Hepatol, 2015 Sep; 19(9):1600-0641; 1115-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Private-public mix intervention with GeneXpert for all diagnosis vs. Private-public mix intervention where some patients entering private clinics may be referred to public clinics plus diagnosis with GeneXpert for drug susceptibility testing,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1103.58,United States,2013,1226.06
13978,Cost-effectiveness analysis of EGFR mutation testing and gefitinib as first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer,"OBJECTIVES: The combination use of gefitinib and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing is a standard first-line therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we examined the cost-effectiveness of this approach in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our analysis compared the 'EGFR testing strategy', in which EGFR mutation testing was performed before treatment and patients with EGFR mutations received gefitinib while those without mutations received standard chemotherapy, to the 'no-testing strategy,' in which genetic testing was not conducted and all patients were treated with standard chemotherapy. A three-state Markov model was constructed to predict expected costs and outcomes for each strategy. We included only direct medical costs from the healthcare payer's perspective. Outcomes in the model were based on those reported in the Iressa Pan-Asia Study (IPASS). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost and effectiveness per patient of the 'EGFR testing strategy' compared to the 'no-testing strategy' was estimated to be approximately JP yen122,000 (US$1180; US$1=JP yen104 as of February 2014) and 0.036 QALYs. The ICER was then calculated to be around JP yen3.38 million (US$32,500) per QALY gained. These results suggest that the 'EGFR testing strategy' is cost-effective compared with the 'no-testing strategy' when JP yen5.0 million to 6.0 million per QALY gained is considered an acceptable threshold. These results were supported by the sensitivity and scenario analyses. CONCLUSION: The combination use of gefitinib and EGFR testing can be considered a cost-effective first-line therapy compared to chemotherapy such as carboplatin-paclitaxel for the treatment for NSCLC in Japan.",2015-01-17475,26259876,Acta Oncol,Yusuke Narita,2015,90 / 1,71-7,No,26259876,"Yusuke Narita; Yukiko Matsushima; Takeru Shiroiwa; Koji Chiba; Yoichi Nakanishi; Tatsuo Kurokawa; Hisashi Urushihara; Cost-effectiveness analysis of EGFR mutation testing and gefitinib as first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer, Acta Oncol, 2015 Oct; 90(1):1651-226X; 71-7",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Testing for mutations with gefitinib and epidermal growth factor receptor before treatment with gefitnib treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- All patients treated with standard chemotherapy,Patients with identified mutation and standard chemotherapy,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,2.00,2.00,3380000,Japan,2012,43497.5
13979,"Personalizing Colonoscopy Screening for Elderly Individuals Based on Screening History, Cancer Risk, and Comorbidity Status Could Increase Cost Effectiveness","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decisions for elderly individuals are often made based primarily on age-other factors that affect the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening are often not considered. We investigated the relative importance of factors that could be used to identify elderly individuals most likely to benefit from CRC screening and determined the maximum ages at which screening remains cost effective based on these factors. METHODS: We used a microsimulation model (Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon) that was calibrated to the incidence of CRC in the US and the prevalence of adenomas reported in autopsy studies to determine the appropriate age to stop colonoscopy screening in 19,200 cohorts (of 10 million individuals), defined by sex, race, screening history, background risk for CRC, and comorbidity status. We applied a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Less-intensive screening history, higher background risk for CRC, and fewer comorbidities were associated with cost-effective screening at older ages. Sex and race had only a small effect on the appropriate age to stop screening. For some individuals likely to be screened in current practice (for example, 74-year-old white women with moderate comorbidities, half the average background risk for CRC, and negative findings from a screening colonoscopy 10 y prior), screening resulted in a loss of QALYs, rather than a gain. For some individuals unlikely to be screened in current practice (for example, 81-year-old black men with no comorbidities, an average background risk for CRC, and no prior screening), screening was highly cost effective. Although screening some previously screened, low-risk individuals was not cost effective even when they were 66 years old, screening some healthy, high-risk individuals remained cost effective until they reached an age of 88 years.

13982,Cost-Utility Analysis of Mechanical Thrombectomy Using Stent Retrievers in Acute Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, 5 randomized controlled trials demonstrated the benefit of endovascular therapy compared with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator in acute stroke. Economic evidence evaluating stent retrievers is limited. We compared the cost-effectiveness of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator alone versus mechanical thrombectomy and intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator as a bridging therapy in eligible patients in the UK National Health Service. METHODS: A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed using a lifetime horizon. A Markov model was constructed and populated with probabilities, outcomes, and cost data from published sources, including 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Mechanical thrombectomy was more expensive than intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator, but it improved quality-adjusted life expectancy. The incremental cost per (quality-adjusted life year) gained of mechanical thrombectomy over a 20 year period was $11 651 ( pound7061). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that thrombectomy had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the minimum willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life year commonly used in United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: Although the upfront costs of thrombectomy are high, the potential quality-adjusted life year gains mean this intervention is cost-effective.

13983,Cost-effectiveness of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the lifetime outcomes and economic implications of combinatorial pharmacogenomic (CPGx) testing versus treatment as usual (TAU) psychopharmacologic medication selection for a representative major depressive disorder patient who has not responded to previous treatment(s). STUDY DESIGN: Markov state-transition analysis based on clinical studies. METHODS: Clinical validity and utility were based on published findings in prospective clinical studies of a commercially available CPGx test. Data for quality of life, direct costs, and indirect costs were extracted from meta-analyses of published literature on clinical studies and claims databases. Outcomes were assessed from a societal perspective, and included differences between the CPGx and the TAU strategies in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cumulative direct and indirect costs, and cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: CPGx improved the treatment response rate by 70% (1.7 times as high as that with TAU), increasing QALYs by 0.316 years. With these health benefits, CPGx is expected to save $3711 in direct medical costs per patient and $2553 in work productivity costs per patient over the lifetime. The cost-effectiveness of CPGx testing was robust over a wide range of variation in the input parameters, including the scenario when testing efficacy was set to its lower limit. CONCLUSIONS: CPGx testing has been shown by prospective studies to modify treatment decisions for patients nonresponsive to previous treatment(s), with increased rates of treatment response. These effects are projected to increase quality-adjusted survival, and to save both direct and indirect costs to individual patients and society generally.",2015-01-17497,26247576,BJU Int,John Hornberger,2015,21 / 6,e357-65,No,26247576,"John Hornberger; Qianyi Li; Bruce Quinn; Cost-effectiveness of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients, BJU Int, 2015 Jun; 21(6):1464-410X; e357-65",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combinatorial pharmacogenomic (CPGx) testing vs. Standard/Usual Care,Representative major depressive disorder patient who has not responded to previous treatment(s).,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-11911.39,United States,2013,-13233.34
13984,Cost-effectiveness of Tofacitinib in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis in South Korea,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of introducing tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, to the treatment of Korean patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. METHODS: In this cost-utility analysis model, patients transitioned through treatment sequences based on Korean guidelines for RA patients with inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Lifetime health-related quality of life and costs were evaluated. Characteristics of the model cohort were based on those reported by the Oral Rheumatoid Arthritis phase 3 triaL (ORAL) Standard randomized Controlled trial of tofacitinib or adalimumab versus placebo. Efficacy was assessed using American College of Rheumatology response rates, converted to the changes in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores, based on tofacitinib clinical trials data. Published clinical trial data on discontinuation rates of the indicated drugs were incorporated in the model. The HAQ-DI scores were mapped onto utility values to calculate outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); HAQ-DI-to-utility (EuroQoL 5D) mapping was based on data from 5 tofacitinib clinical trials. Costs were analyzed from a societal perspective, with values expressed in 2013 Korean won (KRW). Cost-effectiveness is presented in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. FINDINGS: First-line tofacitinib used before the standard of care (base-case analysis) increased both treatment costs and QALYs gained versus the standard-of-care treatment sequence, resulting in an ICER of KRW 13,228,910 per QALY. Tofacitinib also increased costs and QALYs gained when incorporated as a second-, third-, or fourth-line therapy. The inclusion of first-line tofacitinib increased the duration of active immunomodulatory therapy from 9.4 to 13.2 years. Tofacitinib-associated increases in costs were attributable to the increased lifetime drug costs. In sensitivity analyses, variations in input parameters and assumptions yielded ICERs in the range of KRW 6,995,719 per QALY to KRW 37,450,109 per QALY. IMPLICATIONS: From a societal perspective, the inclusion of tofacitinib as a treatment strategy for moderate to severe RA is cost-effective; this conclusion was considered robust based on multiple sensitivity analyses. The study was limited by the lack of clinical data on follow-up therapy after tofacitinib administration and a lack of long-term data on discontinuation of drug use.",2015-01-17508,26243076,Clin Ther,Min-Young Lee,2015,37 / 8,1662-1676.e2,Yes,26243076,"Min-Young Lee; Sun-Kyeong Park; Sun-Young Park; Ji-Hye Byun; Sang-Min Lee; Su-Kyoung Ko; Eui-Kyung Lee; Cost-effectiveness of Tofacitinib in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis in South Korea, Clin Ther, 2015 Aug 1; 37(8):1879-114X; 1662-1676.e2",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,"First-line tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, treatment before the standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care",Rheumatoid arthritis patients with inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,13228910,South Korea,2013,13434.85
13985,Preliminary report on the cost effectiveness of ventricular assist devices,"The aim of the present study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of ventricular assist devices (VAD) implantation surgery in the Japanese medical reimbursement system. The study group consisted of thirty-seven patients who had undergone VAD implantation surgery for dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 25; 67.6 %) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 4; 10.8 %), and others (n = 8; 21.6 %). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the utility score and years of life. Medical reimbursement bills were chosen as cost indices. The observation period was the 12-month period after surgery. Then, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated according to the VAD type. In addition, the prognosis after 36 months was estimated on the basis of the results obtained using the Markov chain model. The mean preoperative INTERMACS profile score was 2.35 +/- 0.77. Our results showed that the utility score, which indicates the effectiveness of VAD implantation surgery, improved by 0.279 +/- 0.188 (DeltaQALY, p < 0.05). The cost of VAD implantation surgery was 313,282 +/- 25,275 (DeltaUS$/year) on the basis of medical reimbursement bills associated with therapeutic interventions. The calculated result of CEA was 364,501 +/- 190,599 (DeltaUS$/QALY). The improvement in the utility score was greater for implantable versus extracorporeal VADs (0.233 +/- 0.534 vs. 0.371 +/- 0.238) and ICER was 303,104 (DeltaUS$/DeltaQALY).

Improved hypertension control in China would result in result in enormous health gains in the world's largest population. A computer simulation model projected the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Chinese adults, assuming a range of essential medicines list drug costs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China, a Markov-style computer simulation model, simulated hypertension screening, essential medicines program implementation, hypertension control program administration, drug treatment and monitoring costs, disease-related costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by preventing cardiovascular disease or lost because of drug side effects in untreated hypertensive adults aged 35-84 y over 2015-2025. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in cardiovascular disease patients (secondary prevention) and for two blood pressure ranges in primary prevention (stage one, 140-159/90-99 mm Hg; stage two, >/=160/>/=100 mm Hg). Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension were modeled as a reduction in systolic blood pressure; treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension was modeled as a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored ranges of antihypertensive drug effectiveness and costs, monitoring frequency, medication adherence, side effect severity, background hypertension prevalence, antihypertensive medication treatment, case fatality, incidence and prevalence, and cardiovascular disease treatment costs. Median antihypertensive costs from Shanghai and Yunnan province were entered into the model in order to estimate the effects of very low and high drug prices. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than the per capita gross domestic product of China (11,900 international dollars [Int$] in 2015) were considered cost-effective. Treating hypertensive adults with prior cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention was projected to be cost saving in the main simulation and 100% of probabilistic simulation results. Treating all hypertension for primary and secondary prevention would prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually (95% uncertainty interval, 0.6 to 1.0 million) and was borderline cost-effective incremental to treating only cardiovascular disease and stage two patients (2015 Int$13,000 per QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, Int$10,000 to Int$18,000]). Of all one-way sensitivity analyses, assuming adherence to taking medications as low as 25%, high Shanghai drug costs, or low medication efficacy led to the most unfavorable results (treating all hypertension, about Int$47,000, Int$37,000, and Int$27,000 per QALY were gained, respectively).

13988,The Cost-Effectiveness of Low-Cost Essential Antihypertensive Medicines for Hypertension Control in China: A Modelling Study,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is China's leading cardiovascular disease risk factor. Improved hypertension control in China would result in result in enormous health gains in the world's largest population. A computer simulation model projected the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Chinese adults, assuming a range of essential medicines list drug costs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China, a Markov-style computer simulation model, simulated hypertension screening, essential medicines program implementation, hypertension control program administration, drug treatment and monitoring costs, disease-related costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by preventing cardiovascular disease or lost because of drug side effects in untreated hypertensive adults aged 35-84 y over 2015-2025. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in cardiovascular disease patients (secondary prevention) and for two blood pressure ranges in primary prevention (stage one, 140-159/90-99 mm Hg; stage two, >/=160/>/=100 mm Hg). Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension were modeled as a reduction in systolic blood pressure; treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension was modeled as a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored ranges of antihypertensive drug effectiveness and costs, monitoring frequency, medication adherence, side effect severity, background hypertension prevalence, antihypertensive medication treatment, case fatality, incidence and prevalence, and cardiovascular disease treatment costs. Median antihypertensive costs from Shanghai and Yunnan province were entered into the model in order to estimate the effects of very low and high drug prices. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than the per capita gross domestic product of China (11,900 international dollars [Int$] in 2015) were considered cost-effective. Treating hypertensive adults with prior cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention was projected to be cost saving in the main simulation and 100% of probabilistic simulation results. Treating all hypertension for primary and secondary prevention would prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually (95% uncertainty interval, 0.6 to 1.0 million) and was borderline cost-effective incremental to treating only cardiovascular disease and stage two patients (2015 Int$13,000 per QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, Int$10,000 to Int$18,000]). Of all one-way sensitivity analyses, assuming adherence to taking medications as low as 25%, high Shanghai drug costs, or low medication efficacy led to the most unfavorable results (treating all hypertension, about Int$47,000, Int$37,000, and Int$27,000 per QALY were gained, respectively). The strengths of this study were the use of a recent Chinese national health survey, vital statistics, health care costs, and cohort study outcomes data as model inputs and reliance on clinical-trial-based estimates of coronary heart disease and stroke risk reduction due to antihypertensive medication treatment. The limitations of the study were the use of several sources of data, limited clinical trial evidence for medication effectiveness and harms in the youngest and oldest age groups, lack of information about geographic and ethnic subgroups, lack of specific information about indirect costs borne by patients, and uncertainty about the future epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases in China.

13989,Cost-Effectiveness of Dabigatran Compared to Vitamin-K Antagonists for the Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis in the Netherlands Using Real-World Data,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs) present an effective anticoagulant treatment in deep venous thrombosis (DVT). However, the use of VKAs is limited because of the risk of bleeding and the necessity of frequent and long-term laboratory monitoring. Therefore, new oral anticoagulant drugs (NOACs) such as dabigatran, with lower rates of (major) intracranial bleeding compared to VKAs and not requiring monitoring, may be considered. OBJECTIVES: To estimate resource utilization and costs of patients treated with the VKAs acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon, for the indication DVT. Furthermore, a formal cost-effectiveness analysis of dabigatran compared to VKAs for DVT treatment was performed, using these estimates. METHODS: A retrospective observational study design in the thrombotic service of a teaching hospital (Deventer, The Netherlands) was applied to estimate real-world resource utilization and costs of VKA monitoring. A pooled analysis of data from RE-COVER and RE-COVER II on DVT was used to reflect the probabilities for events in the cost-effectiveness model. Dutch costs, utilities and specific data on coagulation monitoring levels were incorporated in the model. Next to the base case analysis, univariate probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: Real-world resource utilization in the thrombotic service of patients treated with VKA for the indication of DVT consisted of 12.3 measurements of the international normalized ratio (INR), with corresponding INR monitoring costs of euro138 for a standardized treatment period of 180 days. In the base case, dabigatran treatment compared to VKAs in a cohort of 1,000 DVT patients resulted in savings of euro18,900 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) -95,832, 151,162) and 41 (95% UI -18, 97) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained calculated from societal perspective. The probability that dabigatran is cost-effective at a conservative willingness-to pay threshold of euro20,000 per QALY was 99%. Sensitivity and scenario analyses also indicated cost savings or cost-effectiveness below this same threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Total INR monitoring costs per patient were estimated at minimally euro138. Inserting these real-world data into a cost-effectiveness analysis for patients diagnosed with DVT, dabigatran appeared to be a cost-saving alternative to VKAs in the Netherlands in the base case. Cost savings or favorable cost-effectiveness were robust in sensitivity and scenario analyses.

Several new treatments including Harvoni, Olysio + Sovaldi, Viekira Pak, Sofosbuvir-based regimens characterized with potent inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) providing more options for CHC patients. Trials have shown that the new treatments increased the rate to 80 % to 95 %, though with a substantial increase in cost. In particular, current market pricing of a 12-week course of sofosbuvir is approximately US$84,000. We determine the cost-effectiveness of new treatments in comparison with the standard care of treatments. METHODS: A Markov simulation model of CHC disease progression is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies based on genotype. The model calculates the expected lifetime medical costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of hypothetical cohorts of identical patients receiving certain treatments. For genotype 1, we compare: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin + telaprevir for 12 weeks, followed by 12 or 24 weeks treatment of peginterferon + ribavirin dependent on HCV RNA level at week 12; (2) Harvoni treatment, 12 weeks; (3) Olysio + Sovaldi, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (4) Viekira Pak + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (5) sofosbuvir + peginterferon + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with or without cirrhosis.

For genotypes 2 and 3, treatment strategies include: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin, 24 weeks for treatment-naive patients; (2) sofosbuvir + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with genotype 2, 24 weeks for genotype 3; (3) peginterferon + ribavirin as initial treatment, 24 weeks for patients with genotype 2/3, follow-up treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12/16 weeks are performed on non-responders and relapsers. RESULTS: Viekira Pak is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients without cirrhosis, whereas Harvoni is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir-based treatments for genotype 1 in general are not cost-effective due to its substantial high costs. Two-phase treatments with 12-week and 16-week follow-ups are cost-effective for genotype 3 patients and for genotype 2 patients with cirrhosis. The results were shown to be robust over a broad range of parameter values through sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: For genotype 1, sofosbuvir-based treatments are not cost-effective compared to Viekira Pak and Harvoni, although a 30 % reduction in sofosbuvir price would change this result. Sofosbuvir + ribavirin are cost-effective as second-phase treatments following peginterferon + ribavirin initial treatment for genotypes 2 and 3.
