11601,Assessing long-term health and cost outcomes of patient-centered medical homes serving adults with poor diabetes control,"The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is an integrated primary care delivery model particularly suited for patients with poor diabetes control. Although PCMH models targeting adults with diabetes have shown some early success, little is known about the long-term benefits of medical homes in terms of health and cost outcomes. The performance of a PCMH model in adults with poor diabetes control was assessed using simulated controlled trial data obtained from the Archimedes model of disease progression and health care utilization. Using the Cardio-Metabolic Risk data set, we compared health and cost outcomes over a 20-year period between adults with poor diabetes control (HbA1c >9%) receiving standard care and these same adults receiving care under a PCMH model with a 49% HbA1c intervention improvement rate at a per-beneficiary per-month care management cost of $20 per month. The results suggest that the PCMH model has the potential to not only reduce the proportion of the population with bilateral blindness, foot amputations, and myocardial infarctions-and the mortality rate-but it can also do so in a cost-effective manner ($7898 per quality-adjusted life year). The PCMH model is cost saving for the population 50 to 64 years old and it is particularly cost-effective for men ($883 per quality-adjusted life year). Moreover, these effects are relatively large for adults 30 to 49 years old (lower bilateral blindness and death rates), women (lower foot amputation and death rates), and men (lower bilateral blindness and myocardial infarction rates). The PCMH model has potential long-term benefits to both patients with poor diabetes control as well as health care systems and providers willing to invest in this health care delivery approach.",2013-01-11559,23799676,J Prim Care Community Health,Jose A Pagan,2013,4 / 4,,No,23799676,"Jose A Pagan; Erin K Carlson; Assessing long-term health and cost outcomes of patient-centered medical homes serving adults with poor diabetes control, J Prim Care Community Health, 2013 Oct; 4(4):2150-1327",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Patient centered medical home vs. Standard/Usual Care,HbA1c >9%,85 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,20 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,16648.94,United States,2011,19155.99
11602,Cost-effectiveness of different interferon beta products for relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: Decision analysis based on long-term clinical data and switchable treatments,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly debilitating immune mediated disorder and the second most common cause of neurological disability in young and middle-aged adults. Iran is amongst high MS prevalence countries (50/100,000). Economic burden of MS is a topic of important deliberation in economic evaluations study. Therefore determining of cost-effectiveness interferon beta (INF beta) and their copied biopharmaceuticals (CBPs) and biosimilars products is significant issue for assessment of affordability in Lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: A literature-based Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of three INF betas products compared with placebo for managing a hypothetical cohort of patients diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) in Iran from a societal perspective. Health states were based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Disease progression transition probabilities for symptom management and INF beta therapies were obtained from natural history studies and multicenter randomized controlled trials and their long term follow up for RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). A cross sectional study has been developed to evaluate cost and utility. Transitions among health states occurred in 2-years cycles for fifteen cycles and switching to other therapies was allowed. Calculations of costs and utilities were established by attachment of decision trees to the overall model. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY) for all available INF beta products (brands, biosimilars and CBPs) were considered. Both costs and utilities were discounted. Sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of model. RESULTS: ICER for Avonex, Rebif and Betaferon was 18712, 11832, 15768 US Dollars ($) respectively when utility attained from literature review has been considered. ICER for available CBPs and biosimilars in Iran was $847, $6964 and $11913. CONCLUSIONS: The Markov pharmacoeconomics model determined that according to suggested threshold for developing countries by world health organization, all brand INF beta products are cost effective in Iran except Avonex. The best strategy among INF beta therapies is CBP intramuscular INF beta-1a (Cinnovex).

A value of information analysis,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the value of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of lymph node dissection (LND) at the time of hysterectomy for high-risk subsets of women with endometrial cancer. METHODS: A modified Markov decision model compared routine LND to no LND for women with grade 3 or grades 2-3 endometrial cancer. Inputs were modeled as distributions for Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity and value of information (VOI) analyses. Survival without LND was modeled from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program data. A hazard ratio (HR) describing survival in the high-risk group undergoing LND (estimate 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.1), adverse event rates, probability and type of adjuvant therapy were modeled from published RCTs. Costs were obtained from national reimbursement data. VOI estimated the value of reducing uncertainty regarding the survival benefit of LND. RESULTS: For grade 3, LND had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,183/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to no LND. Acceptability curves revealed considerable uncertainty, with an expected value of perfect information of $4,195 per patient at societal willingness to pay of $50,000/QALY. The estimated value of partial perfect information regarding the HR was $3,702 per patient. Assuming 8,000 individuals annually with grade 3 endometrial cancer in the US, the upper limit of VOI for the HR was $29.6 million annually.

11610,Cost-Effectiveness of a Community Pharmacist-Led Sleep Apnea Screening Program - A Markov Model,"BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence and major public health ramifications, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) remains underdiagnosed. In many developed countries, because community pharmacists (CP) are easily accessible, they have been developing additional clinical services that integrate the services of and collaborate with other healthcare providers (general practitioners (GPs), nurses, etc.). Alternative strategies for primary care screening programs for OSAS involving the CP are discussed. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the quality of life, costs, and cost-effectiveness of three screening strategies among patients who are at risk of having moderate to severe OSAS in primary care. DESIGN: Markov decision model. DATA SOURCES: Published data. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old male patients with symptoms highly evocative of OSAS. TIME HORIZON: The 5 years after initial evaluation for OSAS. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Screening strategy with CP (CP-GP collaboration), screening strategy without CP (GP alone) and no screening. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Quality of life, survival and costs for each screening strategy. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Under almost all modeled conditions, the involvement of CPs in OSAS screening was cost effective. The maximal incremental cost for ""screening strategy with CP"" was about 455euro per QALY gained. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Our results were robust but primarily sensitive to the treatment costs by continuous positive airway pressure, and the costs of untreated OSAS. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the ""screening strategy with CP"" was dominant in 80% of cases. It was more effective and less costly in 47% of cases, and within the cost-effective range (maximum incremental cost effectiveness ratio at euro6186.67/QALY) in 33% of cases.

11612,Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in immunocompromised adults,"OBJECTIVE: Pneumococcal disease is a significant problem in immunocompromised persons, particularly in HIV-infected individuals. The CDC recently updated pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for immunocompromised adults, adding the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to the previously recommended 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). This analysis estimates the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination strategies in HIV-infected individuals and in the broader immunocompromised adult group. DESIGN: Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: The model considered immunocompromised persons aged 19-64 years and accounted for childhood PCV13 herd immunity; in a separate analysis, an HIV-infected subgroup was considered. PCV13 effectiveness was estimated by an expert panel; PPSV23 protection was modeled relative to PCV13 effectiveness. We assumed that both vaccines prevented invasive pneumococcal disease, but only PCV13 prevented nonbacteremic pneumonia. RESULTS: In all immunocompromised individuals, a single PCV13 cost $70,937 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to no vaccination; current recommendations cost $136,724/QALY. In HIV patients, with a longer life expectancy (22.5 years), current recommendations cost $89,391/QALY compared to a single PCV13. Results were sensitive to variation of life expectancy and vaccine effectiveness. The prior recommendation was not favored in any scenario.

11619,A novel method to value real options in health care: the case of a multicohort human papillomavirus vaccination strategy,"BACKGROUND: A large number of economic evaluations have already confirmed the cost-effectiveness of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination strategies. Standard analyses might not capture the full economic value of novel vaccination programs because the cost-effectiveness paradigm fails to take into account the value of active management. Management decisions can be seen as real options, a term used to refer to the application of option pricing theory to the valuation of investments in nonfinancial assets in which much of the value is attributable to flexibility and learning over time. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to discuss the potential advantages shown by using the payoff method in the valuation of the cost-effectiveness of competing HPV immunization programs. METHODS: This was the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to use the payoff method to determine the real option values of 4 different HPV vaccination strategies targeting female subjects aged 12, 15, 18, and 25 years. The payoff method derives the real option value from the triangular payoff distribution of the project''s net present value, which is treated as a triangular fuzzy number. To inform the real option model, cost-effectiveness data were derived from an empirically calibrated Bayesian model designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a multicohort HPV vaccination strategy in the context of the current cervical cancer screening program in Italy. A net health benefit approach was used to calculate the expected fuzzy net present value for each of the 4 vaccination strategies evaluated. RESULTS: Costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained seemed to be related to the number of cohorts targeted: a single cohort of girls aged 12 years (euro10,955 [95% CI, -1,021 to 28,212]) revealed the lowest cost among the 4 alternative strategies evaluated. The real option valuation challenged the cost-effectiveness dominance of a single cohort of 12-year-old girls. The simultaneous vaccination of 2 cohorts of girls aged 12 and 15 years yielded a real option value (euro17,723) equivalent to that attributed to a single cohort of 12-year-old girls (euro17,460). CONCLUSIONS: The payoff method showed distinctive advantages in the valuation of the cost-effectiveness of competing health care interventions, essentially determined by the replacement of the nonfuzzy numbers that are commonly used in cost-effectiveness analysis models, with fuzzy numbers as an input to inform the real option pricing method.

11623,Cost-effectiveness for acupuncture in seasonal allergic rhinitis: economic results of the ACUSAR trial,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a frequent allergic disorder with a significant economic effect on health care costs and productivity. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for patients with seasonal AR (SAR) in Germany. METHODS: The present analysis was part of the Acupuncture in Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ACUSAR) trial, a 3-arm randomized, controlled, multicenter trial in patients with SAR, comparing acupuncture plus rescue medication (RM), penetrating sham acupuncture plus RM, and a control group receiving RM alone. Measures for health economic analyses were costs and health-related quality of life. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for different scenarios on the duration of acupuncture effects and was expressed as costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The study was conducted from society''s and from a third-party payer''s perspective. RESULTS: From 422 initially randomized patients, a total of 364 patients with complete data on costs and quality of life were included in the health economic evaluation. Patients receiving acupuncture or sham acupuncture caused higher costs than patients in the RM group. Patients in the acupuncture group gained significantly more quality-adjusted life-years compared with the RM group. Depending on different scenarios, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for acupuncture patients was between euro31,241 (approximately US $38.569) and euro118,889 (approximately US $146,777) from society''s perspective and between euro20,807 (approximately US $25,688) and euro74,585 (approximately US $92.080) from a third-party payer''s perspective.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for patients with seasonal AR (SAR) in Germany. METHODS: The present analysis was part of the Acupuncture in Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ACUSAR) trial, a 3-arm randomized, controlled, multicenter trial in patients with SAR, comparing acupuncture plus rescue medication (RM), penetrating sham acupuncture plus RM, and a control group receiving RM alone. Measures for health economic analyses were costs and health-related quality of life. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for different scenarios on the duration of acupuncture effects and was expressed as costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The study was conducted from society''s and from a third-party payer''s perspective. RESULTS: From 422 initially randomized patients, a total of 364 patients with complete data on costs and quality of life were included in the health economic evaluation. Patients receiving acupuncture or sham acupuncture caused higher costs than patients in the RM group. Patients in the acupuncture group gained significantly more quality-adjusted life-years compared with the RM group. Depending on different scenarios, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for acupuncture patients was between euro31,241 (approximately US $38.569) and euro118,889 (approximately US $146,777) from society''s perspective and between euro20,807 (approximately US $25,688) and euro74,585 (approximately US $92.080) from a third-party payer''s perspective.

11627,Economic evaluation of an integrated care programme for patients with hand dermatitis,"BACKGROUND: Hand dermatitis has a large impact on society as a whole. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of integrated, multidisciplinary care as compared with usual care (UC) for patients with moderate to severe chronic hand dermatitis after 52 weeks. METHODS: Patients (n = 196) visiting the dermatology department at one of the participating hospitals for hand dermatitis were randomized to integrated care (IC) or UC. IC was provided by a multidisciplinary team, and integrated clinical and occupational care to optimize treatment of hand dermatitis. Effect outcomes were clinical assessment of hand dermatitis with the Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI), and disease-specific quality of life, work performance and quality-adjusted life-years with the EQ-5D. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. The ICER indicates the additional investment needed to gain one unit of effect. RESULTS: The HECSI difference between both groups after 52 weeks was 8.7 (standard error 5.3, 95% confidence interval -1.8-18.9). No differences were found on secondary outcome measures. Mean total costs with IC (euro 3613; SD 798) were significantly higher than with UC (euro 1576, SD 430). The ICER for improvement in HECSI score was -247. IC was not considered to be cost-effective as compared with UC. The probability that IC was cost-effective was 90% at a ceiling ratio of euro 1500 per additional point improvement in HECSI score. CONCLUSION: Integrated care was neither cost-effective, nor effective after 12 months follow-up, in contrast to our findings after 6 months.

11628,Economic and clinical comparison of atypical depot antipsychotic drugs for treatment of chronic schizophrenia in the Czech Republic,"PURPOSE: The Czech Republic is faced with making choices between pharmaceutical products, including depot injectable antipsychotics. A pharmacoeconomic analysis was conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of atypical depots. METHODS: An existing 1-year decision-analytic framework was adapted to model drug use in this healthcare system. The average direct costs to the General Insurance Company of the Czech Republic of using paliperidone palmitate (Xeplion(R)), risperidone (Risperdal Consta(R)), and olanzapine pamoate (Zypadhera(R)) were determined. Literature-derived clinical rates populated the model, with costs adjusted to 2012 Euros using the consumer price index. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), days in remission, and proportions hospitalized or visiting emergency rooms. One-way sensitivity analyses were calculated for all important inputs. A multivariate probability analysis was used to examine the stability of results using 10,000 iterations of simulated input over reasonable ranges of all included variables. RESULTS: Expected average costs/per patient treated were euro5377 for PP-LAI, euro6118 for RIS-LAI, and euro6537 for OLZ-LAI. Respective QALYs were 0.817, 0.809, and 0.811; ER visits were 0.127, 0.134, and 0.141; hospitalizations were 0.252, 0.298, and 0.289. Results were generally robust in sensitivity analyses. PP-LAI dominated RIS-LAI and OLZ-LAI in 90.2% and 92.1% of simulations, respectively. Results were insensitive to drug prices but sensitive to adherence and hospitalization rates.

11630,Cost-effectiveness of 3-year vs 1-year adjuvant therapy with imatinib in patients with high risk of gastrointestinal stromal tumour recurrence in the Netherlands; a modelling study alongside the SSGXVIII/AIO trial,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is rarely curative in patients at high risk of tumour recurrence and therefore 1 year of post-surgery adjuvant imatinib therapy has been recommended in this sub-group. Recently, adjuvant imatinib therapy administered for 3 years has been demonstrated to further increase recurrence-free survival and overall survival. The goal of this study was to assess the economic value of extending the duration of adjuvant imatinib therapy in high-risk patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: A multistate Markov model was developed to simulate how patients'' clinical status after GIST excision evolves over time until death. The model structure encompassed four primary health states: free of recurrence, first GIST recurrence, second GIST recurrence, and death. Transition probabilities between the health states, data on medical care costs, and quality-of-life were obtained from published sources and from expert opinion. RESULTS: The expected number of life years (or quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) was higher in the 3-year group than in the 1-year group, 8.91 (6.55) and 7.04 (5.18) years, respectively. In the 3-year and 1-year group, the expected total costs amounted to euro120,195 and euro79,361, of which, euro74,631 (62%) and euro27,619 (35%) were adjuvant therapy drug costs, respectively. The difference in health benefits, that is 1.87 life years or 1.37 QALYs, and costs, euro40,835, resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of euro21,865 per life year gained, and euro29,872 per QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: A limitation of the study was inherently related to the uncertainty around the predictions of RFS. Scenario analyses were conducted to test the sensitivity of different RFS predictions on the results.

11631,Cost effectiveness of intraoperative pathology examination during diagnostic hemithyroidectomy for unilateral follicular thyroid neoplasms,"BACKGROUND: The use of intraoperative pathology examination (IPE) during diagnostic hemithyroidectomy for a follicular neoplasm is controversial. Although this service rarely alters intraoperative decision making, it does provide patients with the possibility of avoiding reoperation for completion thyroidectomy if malignancy is detected. We hypothesized diagnostic hemithyroidectomy with IPE for a unilateral follicular thyroid neoplasm diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration is not cost effective compared with diagnostic hemithyroidectomy alone. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with a Markov decision model was performed comparing diagnostic hemithyroidectomy without IPE, diagnostic hemithyroidectomy with IPE, and total thyroidectomy. Treatment outcomes and their probabilities were identified based on literature review. Costs were estimated using data from Medicare, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Sensitivity analysis and a 1,000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation were used to examine the uncertainty of cost, probability, and utility estimates in the model. RESULTS: Diagnostic hemithyroidectomy without IPE had an expected cost of US$7,665 and an effectiveness of 23.95 quality-adjusted life years and dominated both the IPE and total thyroidectomy strategies. Intraoperative pathology examination became cost effective during one-way sensitivity analysis if the sensitivity of IPE increased from 14.3% to 34.4%, the specificity increased from 98.6% to 99.8%, or the pretest probability of malignancy increased from 25% to 43%. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that the intraoperative pathology strategy was not cost effective in 92.7% of iterations.

11633,A multidisciplinary support programme increases the efficiency of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adherence to antiviral treatment is important to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We evaluated the efficiency of a multidisciplinary support programme (MSP), based on published HIV treatment experience, to increase patient adherence and the efficacy of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in CHC. METHODS: 447 patients receiving antiviral treatment were distributed into 3 groups: control group (2003-2004, n=147), MSP group (2005-2006, n=131), and MSP-validation group (2007-2009, n=169). The MSP group included two hepatologists, two nurses, one pharmacist, one psychologist, one administrative assistant, and one psychiatrist. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov model. RESULTS: Adherence and SVR rates were higher in the MSP (94.6% and 77.1%) and MSP-validation (91.7% and 74.6%) groups compared to controls (78.9% and 61.9%) (p<0.05 in all cases). SVR was higher in genotypes 1 or 4 followed by the MSP group vs. controls (67.7% vs. 48.9%, p=0.02) compared with genotypes 2 or 3 (87.7% vs. 81.4%, p=n.s.). The MSP was the main predictive factor of SVR in patients with genotype 1. The rate of adherence in patients with psychiatric disorders was higher in the MSP groups (n=95, 90.5%) compared to controls (n=28, 75.7%) (p=0.02). The cost per patient was euro 13,319 in the MSP group and euro 16,184 in the control group. The MSP group achieved more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (16.317 QALYs) than controls (15.814 QALYs) and was dominant in all genotypes.

METHODS: 206 Adults who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for hip or knee osteoarthritis were included in an economic evaluation from the perspectives of the New Zealand health system and society alongside a randomized controlled trial. Resource use was collected using the Osteoarthritis Costs and Consequences Questionnaire. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the Short Form 6D. Willingness-to-pay threshold values were based on one to three times New Zealand''s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of NZ$ 29,149 (in 2009). RESULTS: All three treatment programmes resulted in incremental QALY gains relative to usual care. From the perspective of the New Zealand health system, exercise therapy was the only treatment to result in an incremental cost utility ratio under one time GDP per capita at NZ$ 26,400 (-$34,081 to $103,899). From the societal perspective manual therapy was cost saving relative to usual care for most scenarios studied. Exercise therapy resulted in incremental cost utility ratios regarded as cost effective but was not cost saving. For most scenarios combined therapy was not as cost effective as the two therapies alone. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, exercise therapy and manual therapy were more cost effective than usual care at policy relevant values of willingness-to-pay from both the perspective of the health system and society.

From the perspective of the New Zealand health system, exercise therapy was the only treatment to result in an incremental cost utility ratio under one time GDP per capita at NZ$ 26,400 (-$34,081 to $103,899). From the societal perspective manual therapy was cost saving relative to usual care for most scenarios studied. Exercise therapy resulted in incremental cost utility ratios regarded as cost effective but was not cost saving. For most scenarios combined therapy was not as cost effective as the two therapies alone. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, exercise therapy and manual therapy were more cost effective than usual care at policy relevant values of willingness-to-pay from both the perspective of the health system and society.

11640,Cost-effectiveness analysis of intraoperative radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Shortened courses of radiation therapy have been shown to be similarly effective to whole-breast external-beam radiation therapy (WB-EBRT) in terms of local control. We sought to analyze, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of two radiation strategies for early-stage invasive breast cancer: single-dose intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) and the standard 6-week course of WB-EBRT. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision-analytic model to evaluate these treatment strategies in terms of life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over 10 years. RESULTS: IORT single-dose intraoperative radiation therapy was the dominant, more cost-effective strategy, providing greater quality-adjusted life years at a decreased cost compared with 6-week WB-EBRT. The model was sensitive to health state utilities and recurrence rates, but not costs. IORT was either the preferred or dominant strategy across all sensitivity analyses. The two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrate the need to accurately determine utility values for the two forms of radiation treatment and to avoid indiscriminate use of IORT. CONCLUSIONS: With less cost and greater QALYs than WB-EBRT, IORT is the more valuable strategy. IORT offers a unique example of new technology that is less costly than the current standard of care option but offers similar efficacy. Even when considering the capital investment for the equipment ($425 K, low when compared with the investments required for robotic surgery or high-dose-rate brachytherapy), which could be recouped after 3-4 years conservatively, these results support IORT as a change in practice for treating early-stage invasive breast cancer.",2013-01-11583,23812769,Ann Surg Oncol,Michael D Alvarado,2013,20 / 9,2873-80,No,23812769,"Michael D Alvarado; Aron J Mohan; Laura J Esserman; Catherine C Park; Brittany L Harrison; Rebecca J Howe; Cristina Thorsen; Elissa M Ozanne; Cost-effectiveness analysis of intraoperative radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer, Ann Surg Oncol, ; 20(9):1068-9265; 2873-80",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,3-week whole-breast external-beam radiation therapy vs. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT),Not Stated,Not Stated,56 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-64907.28,United States,2011,-74681.21

11642,The cost-effectiveness of the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) structured education programme: an update using the Sheffield Type 1 Diabetes Policy Model,"AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of training in flexible intensive insulin therapy [as provided in the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) structured education programme] compared with no training for adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus in the UK using the Sheffield Type 1 Diabetes Policy Model. METHODS: The Sheffield Type 1 Diabetes Policy Model was used to simulate the development of long-term microvascular and macrovascular diabetes-related complications and the occurrence of diabetes-related adverse events in 5000 adults with Type 1 diabetes. Total costs and quality-adjusted life years were estimated from a National Health Service perspective over a lifetime horizon, discounted at a rate of 3.5%. The treatment effectiveness of DAFNE was modelled as a reduction in HbA1c that affected the risk of developing long-term diabetes-related complications. Probabilistic and structural sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: DAFNE resulted in greater life expectancy and reduced incidence of some diabetes-related complications compared with no DAFNE. DAFNE was found to generate an average of 0.0294 additional quality-adjusted life years for an additional cost of pound426 per patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound14 400 compared with no DAFNE. There was a 54% probability that DAFNE would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per quality-adjusted life year.

To compare the cost-effectiveness of OLA of NMIBC with that of inpatient cystodiathermy (IC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients with NMIBC treated with OLA by one consultant surgeon between March 2008 and July 2011 A subgroup of patients had PDD before undergoing OLA. Safety and effectiveness were determined by complications (In the immediate post operative period, at three days and at three months), patient tolerability (visual analogue score) and recurrence rates. The long-term costs and cost-effectiveness of OLA and IC of NMIBC were evaluated using Markov modeling. RESULTS: A total of 74 OLA procedures (44 white-light, 30 PDD) were carried out in 54 patients. The mean (range) patient age was 77 (52-95) years. More than half of the patients had more than three comorbidities. Previous tumour histology ranged from G1pTa to T3. One patient had haematuria for 1 week which settled spontaneously and did not require hospital admission. There were no other complications. The procedure was well tolerated with pain scores of 0-2/10. Additional lesions were found in 21% of patients using PDD that were not found using white light. At 3 months, the percentage of patients who had recurrence after OLA with white light and OLA with PDD were 10.6 and 4.3%, respectively. At 1 year, 65.1% and 46.9% of patients had recurrence. The cost of OLA was found to be much lower than that of IC ( pound538 vs pound1474), even with the addition of PDD ( pound912 vs pound1844). Over the course of a patient''s lifetime, OLA was more clinically effective, measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), than IC (0.147 [sd 0.059]) and less costly ( pound2576.42 [sd pound7293.07]). At a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound30,000/QALY, as set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, there was an 82% probability that OLA was cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the long-term cost-effectiveness of OLA of NMIBC.

METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was used to assess the epidemiological and economic impact of the routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls with a HPV4 vaccine in preventing cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 1, 2 and 3 and genital warts. RESULTS: The model projected that at year 100, HPV4 vaccination would lead to a reduction of HPV 16/18 related cervical cancer incidence and deaths by over 97% and the incidence of HPV 6/11 related genital warts among Estonian women and men by over 94% and 81%, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the HPV4 vaccination strategy was euro 4,889 per QALY gained over a time horizon of 100 years.

11645,Cost-effectiveness of using 2 vs 3 primary doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although effective in preventing pneumococcal disease, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is the most expensive vaccine on the routinely recommended pediatric schedule in the United States. We examined the cost-effectiveness of switching from 4 total doses to 3 total doses by removing the third dose in the primary series in the United States. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model following a single birth cohort of 4.3 million to calculate societal cost savings and increased disease burden from removing the 6-month dose of PCV13. Based on modified estimates of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine from randomized trials and observational studies, we assumed that vaccine effectiveness under the 2 schedules is identical for the first 6 months of life and largely similar after administration of the 12- to 15-month booster dose. RESULTS: Removing the third dose of PCV13 would annually save $500 million (in 2011$) but would also result in an estimated 2.5 additional deaths among inpatients with pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease. Such dose removal would also result in 261,000 estimated otitis media and 12,000 estimated pneumonia cases annually. These additional illnesses could be prevented through modest increases in coverage. Overall, societal savings per additional life-year lost would be approximately $6 million. When nonfatal outcomes are also considered, savings would range from $143,000 to $4 million per additional quality adjusted life-year lost, depending on the assumptions used for otitis media.

11646,Change in quality of life and cost/utility analysis in open stage-related surgical treatment of elbow stiffness,"The goals of this study were to examine the improvement in quality of life achieved after open surgical treatment of elbow stiffness and to verify the cost/utility ratio of surgery. Thirty-three patients (22 men and 11 women) underwent surgery. The etiologies of elbow stiffness were posttraumatic conditions (n=26), primary osteoarthritis (n=5), and rheumatoid arthritis (n=2). Surgery included 14 ulnohumeral arthroplasties, 6 ulnohumeral arthroplasties associated with radiocapitellar replacement, 5 ulnohumeral arthroplasties associated with radial head replacement, and 8 total elbow arthroplasties. All patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively with the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, the Mayo Elbow Performance Index, the modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score, and the Short Form 36 after a mean follow-up of 26 months. Possible variables affecting clinical outcome and quality of life improvement were assessed. The cost/utility ratio was evaluated as diagnosis-related group reimbursement per quality-adjusted life year. Mayo Elbow Performance Scores and modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores increased, on average, by 43 and 41 points, respectively (P<.0001). Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores decreased, on average, by 44 points (P<.0001). The improvement in the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score was 7.6 and 7, respectively (P=.0001 and .0018). The cost/utility ratio ranged between 670 and 817 Euro/quality-adjusted life year. A significant correlation was found between pain score and quality of life improvement. An inverse correlation emerged between pre- and postoperative quality of life score. The current study shows that open surgery significantly improves quality of life and elbow function. Selecting the surgical procedure that most effectively reduces pain appears to be the most relevant variable responsible for quality of life improvement. Surgery shows a satisfactory cost/utility ratio, justifying a health spending increase to reduce the social costs resulting from lingering elbow stiffness.",2013-01-11604,23823051,Orthopedics,Giuseppe Giannicola,2013,36 / 7,e923-30,No,23823051,"Giuseppe Giannicola; Gianluca Bullitta; Federico M Sacchetti; Marco Scacchi; David Polimanti; Guido Citoni; Gianluca Cinotti; Change in quality of life and cost/utility analysis in open stage-related surgical treatment of elbow stiffness, Orthopedics, ; 36(7):1938-2367; e923-30",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Open surgical treatment of elbow stiffness vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,726,Euro,2011,1162.42
11647,Cost-effectiveness of dutasteride-tamsulosin combination therapy for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: A Canadian model based on the CombAT trial,"INTRODUCTION: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common in men 50 years old and older. The main treatment options are alpha-blockers (such as tamsulosin), which reduce symptoms, and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (such as dutasteride), which reduce symptoms and slow disease progression. Clinical studies have demonstrated that dutasteride-tamsulosin combination therapy is more effective than either monotherapy to treat symptomatic BPH. We studied the cost-effectiveness in Canada of the dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) and tamsulosin (0.4 mg/day) combination compared with tamsulosin or dutasteride monotherapy. METHODS: A Markov model was developed which follows a cohort of male BPH patients >/=50 with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The model estimates costs to the Canadian health care system and outcomes (in terms of quality adjusted life years [QALYs]) at 10 years and over a patient''s lifetime. The dutasteride-tamsulosin combination was compared to each of tamsulosin monotherapy and dutasteride monotherapy. RESULTS: Compared with tamsulosin, the combination was more costly and produced better patient outcomes. Over a lifetime, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CAN$25 437 per QALY gained. At a willingness to pay CAN$50 000 per QALY, the probability of combination therapy being cost-effective was 99.6%.

BACKGROUND: There are few studies evaluating cost-effectiveness of interventions among HF patient-partner dyads. METHODS: Dyads randomised to the experimental group received nurse-led counselling, computer-based education and written materials aimed at developing problem-solving skills at two, six and 12 weeks after hospitalisation with HF exacerbation. The dyads in the control group received usual care. A cost-effectiveness analysis that included costs associated with staff time to deliver the intervention and travel costs was conducted at 12 months. Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) weights for patients and partners were estimated by SF-6D. RESULTS: A total of 155 dyads were included. The intervention cost was euro223 per patient. Participants in both groups showed improvements in QALY weights after 12 months. However, no significant difference in QALY weights was found between the patients in the two groups, nor among their partners. CONCLUSION: The intervention was not proven cost-effective, neither for patients nor for partners. The intervention, however, had trends (but not significant) effects on the patient-partner dyads, and by analysing the QALY gained from the dyad, a reasonable mean cost-effectiveness ratio was achieved.

11650,An economic model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of computer assisted knee replacement surgery in Norway,"BACKGROUND: The use of Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) for knee replacements is intended to improve the alignment of knee prostheses in order to reduce the number of revision operations. Is the cost effectiveness of computer assisted surgery influenced by patient volume and age? METHODS: By employing a Markov model, we analysed the cost effectiveness of computer assisted surgery versus conventional arthroplasty with respect to implant survival and operation volume in two theoretical Norwegian age cohorts. We obtained mortality and hospital cost data over a 20-year period from Norwegian registers. We presumed that the cost of an intervention would need to be below NOK 500,000 per QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year) gained, to be considered cost effective. RESULTS: The added cost of computer assisted surgery, provided this has no impact on implant survival, is NOK 1037 and NOK 1414 respectively for 60 and 75-year-olds per quality-adjusted life year at a volume of 25 prostheses per year, and NOK 128 and NOK 175 respectively at a volume of 250 prostheses per year. Sensitivity analyses showed that the 10-year implant survival in cohort 1 needs to rise from 89.8% to 90.6% at 25 prostheses per year, and from 89.8 to 89.9% at 250 prostheses per year for computer assisted surgery to be considered cost effective. In cohort 2, the required improvement is a rise from 95.1% to 95.4% at 25 prostheses per year, and from 95.10% to 95.14% at 250 prostheses per year. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of using computer navigation for total knee replacements may be acceptable for 60-year-old as well as 75-year-old patients if the technique increases the implant survival rate just marginally, and the department has a high operation volume.

11652,Comparative cost-effectiveness of the quadrivalent and bivalent human papillomavirus vaccines: a transmission-dynamic modeling study,"BACKGROUND: The quadrivalent and bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are now licensed in several countries. We compared the cost-effectiveness of the HPV vaccines to provide evidence for policy decisions. METHODS: We developed HPV-ADVISE, a multi-type individual-based transmission-dynamic model of HPV infection and disease (anogenital warts, and cervical, anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers). We calibrated the model to sexual behavior and epidemiologic data from Canada, and estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost and costs ($CAN 2010) from the literature. Vaccine-type efficacy was based on a systematic literature review. The analysis was performed from the healthcare provider perspective, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Predictions are presented using the median [10th;90th percentiles] of simulations. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions (vaccinating 10-year-old girls, 80% coverage, $95/dose), using the quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines is estimated to cost $15,528 [12,056;19,140] and $20,182 [15,531;25,240] per QALY-gained, respectively. At equal price, the quadrivalent vaccine is more cost-effective than bivalent under all scenarios investigated, except when assuming longer duration of protection for the bivalent and minimal anogenital warts burden. Under base-case assumptions, the maximum additional cost per dose for the quadrivalent vaccine to remain more cost-effective than the bivalent is $32 [17;46] (using a $40,000/QALY-gained threshold). Results were most sensitive to discounting, time-horizon, differences in durations of protection and anogenital warts burden.

11654,Cost-effectiveness of point-of-care C-reactive protein testing to inform antibiotic prescribing decisions,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care C-reactive protein (POCCRP) is a biomarker of inflammation that offers clinicians a rapid POC test to guide antibiotic prescribing decisions for acute cough and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). However, evidence that POCCRP is cost-effective is limited, particularly outside experimental settings. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of POCCRP as a diagnostic tool for acute cough and LRTI from the perspective of the health service. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study of the presentation, management, and outcomes of patients with acute cough and LRTI in primary care settings in Norway and Sweden. METHOD: Using hierarchical regression, data were analysed in terms of the effect on antibiotic use, cost, and patient outcomes (symptom severity after 7 and 14 days, time to recovery, and EQ-5D), while controlling for patient characteristics (self-reported symptom severity, comorbidities, and health-related quality of life) at first attendance. RESULTS: POCCRP testing is associated with non-significant positive reductions in antibiotic prescribing (P = 0.078) and increased cost (P = 0.092). Despite the uncertainty, POCCRP testing is also associated with a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of euro9391. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000 per QALY gained, there is a 70% probability of CRP being cost-effective.

11655,Do modern total knee replacements offer better value for money? A health economic analysis,"PURPOSE: Cost effectiveness is an increasingly important factor in today''s healthcare environment, and selection of arthroplasty implant is not exempt from such concerns. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) are the typical tool for this type of evaluation. Using this methodology, joint arthroplasty has been shown to be cost effective; however, studies directly comparing differing prostheses are lacking. METHODS: Data was gathered in a single-centre prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing the outcome of modern and traditional knee implants, using the Short Form 6 dimensional (SF-6D) score and quality adjusted life year (QALY) methodology. RESULTS: There was significant improvement in the SF-6D score for both groups at one year (p < 0.0001). The calculated overall life expectancy for the study cohort was 15.1 years, resulting in an overall QALY gain of 2.144 (95% CI 1.752-2.507). The modern implant group demonstrated a small improvement in SF-6D score compared to the traditional design at one year (0.141 versus 0.143, p = 0.94). This difference resulted in the modern implant costing pound298 less per QALY at one year. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that modern implant technology does not influence the cost-effectiveness of TKA using the SF-6D and QALY methodology. This type of analysis however assesses health status, and is not sensitive to joint specific function. Evolutionary design changes in implant technology are thus unlikely to influence QALY analysis following joint replacement, which has important implications for implant procurement.",2013-01-11633,23835559,Int Orthop,David F Hamilton,2013,37 / 11,,No,23835559,"David F Hamilton; Nicholas D Clement; Richard Burnett; James T Patton; Mathew Moran; Colin R Howie; A H R W Simpson; Paul Gaston; Do modern total knee replacements offer better value for money?

11656,"Value of information: interim analysis of a randomized, controlled trial of goal-directed hemodynamic treatment for aged patients","BACKGROUND: A randomized, controlled trial, intended to include 460 patients, is currently studying peroperative goal-directed hemodynamic treatment (GDHT) of aged hip-fracture patients. Interim efficacy analysis performed on the first 100 patients was statistically uncertain; thus, the trial is continuing in accordance with the trial protocol. This raised the present investigation''s main question: Is it reasonable to continue to fund the trial to decrease uncertainty? To answer this question, a previously developed probabilistic cost-effectiveness model was used. That model depicts (1) a choice between routine fluid treatment and GDHT, given uncertainty of current evidence and (2) the monetary value of further data collection to decrease uncertainty. This monetary value, that is, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), could be used to compare future research costs. Thus, the primary aim of the present investigation was to analyze EVPI of an ongoing trial with interim efficacy observed. METHODS: A previously developed probabilistic decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was employed to compare the routine fluid treatment to GDHT. Results from the interim analysis, published trials, the meta-analysis, and the registry data were used as model inputs. EVPI was predicted using (1) combined uncertainty of model inputs; (2) threshold value of society''s willingness to pay for one, quality-adjusted life-year; and (3) estimated number of future patients exposed to choice between GDHT and routine fluid treatment during the expected lifetime of GDHT. RESULTS: If a decision to use GDHT were based on cost-effectiveness, then the decision would have a substantial degree of uncertainty. Assuming a 5-year lifetime of GDHT in clinical practice, the number of patients who would be subject to future decisions was 30,400. EVPI per patient would be euro204 at a euro20,000 threshold value of society''s willingness to pay for one quality-adjusted life-year. Given a future population of 30,400 individuals, total EVPI would be euro6.19 million. CONCLUSIONS: If future trial costs are below EVPI, further data collection is potentially cost-effective. When applying a cost-effectiveness model, statements such as ''further research is needed'' are replaced with ''further research is cost-effective and ''further funding of a trial is justified''.

11657,Cost-effectiveness of MRI for breast cancer screening in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers,"BACKGROUND: Women with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at high risk of developing breast cancer and, in British Columbia, Canada, are offered screening with both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography to facilitate early detection. MRI is more sensitive than mammography but is more costly and produces more false positive results. The purpose of this study was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of MRI screening for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in a Canadian setting. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model of annual MRI and mammography screening for BRCA1/2 carriers, using local data and published values. We calculated cost-effectiveness as cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY), and conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of annual mammography plus MRI screening, compared to annual mammography alone, was $50,900/QALY. After incorporating parameter uncertainty, MRI screening is expected to be a cost-effective option 86% of the time at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY, and 53% of the time at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY. The model is highly sensitive to the cost of MRI; as the cost is increased from $200 to $700 per scan, the ICER ranges from $37,100/QALY to $133,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of using MRI and mammography in combination to screen for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is finely balanced. The sensitivity of the results to the cost of the MRI screen itself warrants consideration: in jurisdictions with higher MRI costs, screening may not be a cost-effective use of resources, but improving the efficiency of MRI screening will also improve cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-11637,23837641,BMC Cancer,Reka Pataky,2013,13 /,339,No,23837641,"Reka Pataky; Linlea Armstrong; Stephen Chia; Andrew J Coldman; Charmaine Kim-Sing; Barbara McGillivray; Jenna Scott; Christine M Wilson; Stuart Peacock; Cost-effectiveness of MRI for breast cancer screening in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, BMC Cancer, ; 13():1471-2407; 339",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual mammography plus MRI screening vs. Annual mammography,Not Stated,Not Stated,26 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,50900,Canada,2008,57769.13
11658,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in nonsurgical candidates with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis: a cost-effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) seems to improve the survival and quality of life of patients with aortic stenosis ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a decision analytic Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and benefits in a hypothetical cohort of patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who were ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. The model compared transfemoral TAVR with medical management and was calibrated to the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial. TAVR increased life expectancy from 2.08 to 2.93 years and quality-adjusted life expectancy from 1.19 to 1.93 years. TAVR also reduced subsequent hospitalizations by 1.40 but increased complications, particularly stroke (from 1% to 11% lifetime risk), and also increased lifetime costs from $83,600 to $169,100. The incremental cost-effectiveness of TAVR was $116,500 per quality-adjusted life-year gained ($99,900 per life-year gained). Results were robust to reasonable changes in individual variables but were sensitive to the level of annual healthcare costs caused by noncardiac diseases and to the projected life expectancy of medically treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR seems to be an effective but somewhat expensive alternative to medical management among patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis ineligible for surgery.

11659,Cost--utility analysis of a shock-absorbing floor intervention to prevent injuries from falls in hospital wards for older people,"BACKGROUND: hospital falls place a substantial burden on healthcare systems. There has been limited research into the use of hospital flooring as an intervention against fall-related injuries. OBJECTIVE: to assess the cost-effectiveness of shock-absorbing flooring compared with standard hospital flooring in hospital wards for older people. DESIGN: a cost-utility analysis was undertaken drawing upon data collected in a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial and the wider literature. SETTING: the trial included eight hospital sites across England. Four sites installed shock-absorbing flooring in one bay, and four maintained their standard flooring. MEASUREMENTS: falls and resulting injuries and treatment were reported by hospital staff. Data on destination of discharge were collected. Patients were followed up at 3 months and further resource use data were collected. Health-related quality of life was assessed, allowing quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to be estimated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the shock-absorbing flooring was assessed compared with the standard hospital flooring. RESULTS: in the base case, the shock-absorbing flooring was cost saving, but generated QALY losses due to an increase in the faller rate reported in the intervention arm. Scenario analysis showed that if the shock-absorbing flooring does not increase the faller rate it is likely to represent a dominant economic strategy-generating cost savings and QALY gains.

11660,Cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive versus open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer,"BACKGROUND: A recent randomized trial comparing minimally invasive (MIE) and open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer reported improved short-term outcomes. However, MIE has increased operative costs, and it is unclear whether the short-term benefits of MIE outweigh the increased operative costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of MIE compared to open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was developed to estimate the expected costs and outcomes after MIE and open esophagectomy from a health care system perspective with a time horizon of 1 year. Costs were represented in 2012 Canadian dollars, and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessed parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: MIE was estimated to cost $1641 (95% confidence interval 1565, 1718) less than open esophagectomy, with an incremental gain of 0.022 QALYs (95% confidence interval 0.021, 0.023). MIE was therefore dominant over open esophagectomy. On deterministic sensitivity analyses, the results were most sensitive to variations in length of stay. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the base case result, with 66, 77, and 82% probabilities of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $0/QALY, $50,000/QALY, and $100,000/QALY, respectively.

11661,"Long-term impact on healthcare resource utilization of statin treatment, and its cost effectiveness in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a record linkage study","AIMS: To assess the impact on healthcare resource utilization, costs, and quality of life over 15 years from 5 years of statin use in men without a history of myocardial infarction in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS). METHODS: Six thousand five hundred and ninety-five participants aged 45-54 years were randomized to 5 years treatment with pravastatin (40 mg) or placebo. Linkage to routinely collected health records extended follow-up for secondary healthcare resource utilization to 15 years. The following new results are reported: cause-specific first and recurrent cardiovascular hospital admissions including myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, coronary revascularization and angiography; non-cardiovascular hospitalization; days in hospital; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); costs of pravastatin treatment, treatment safety monitoring, and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Five years treatment of 1000 patients with pravastatin (40 mg/day) saved the NHS pound710 000 (P < 0.001), including the cost of pravastatin and lipid and safety monitoring, and gained 136 QALYs (P = 0.017) over the 15-year period. Benefits per 1000 subjects, attributable to prevention of cardiovascular events, included 163 fewer admissions and a saving of 1836 days in hospital, with fewer admissions for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and coronary revascularization. There was no excess in non-cardiovascular admissions or costs (or in admissions associated with diabetes or its complications) and no evidence of heterogeneity of effect over sub-groups defined by baseline cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSION: Five years'' primary prevention treatment of middle-aged men with a statin significantly reduces healthcare resource utilization, is cost saving, and increases QALYs.

11662,"Cost-effectiveness of CTA, MRA and DSA in patients with non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage","OBJECTIVES: Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) are imaging modalities used for diagnostic work-up of non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. The aim of our study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of MRA, DSA and CTA in the first year after the bleed. METHODS: A decision model was used to calculate costs and benefits (in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) that accrued to cohorts of 1,000 patients. Costs and characteristics of diagnostic tests, therapy, patients'' quality of life and associated costs were respected. The diagnostic strategy with highest QALYs and lowest costs was considered most cost-effective. RESULTS: DSA was the most effective diagnostic option, yielding on average 0.6039 QALYs (95 % CI, 0.5761-0.6327) per patient, followed by CTA 0.5983 QALYs (95 % CI, 0.5704-0.6278) and MRA 0.5947 QALYs (95 % CI, 0.5674-0.6237). Cost was lowest for DSA (39,808 <euro>; 95 % CI, 37,182-42,663), followed by CTA (40,748 <euro>; 95 % CI, 37,937-43,831) and MRA (41,814 <euro>; 95 % CI, 38,730-45,146).

11667,Cost-effectiveness analysis of enhancements to angioplasty for infrainguinal arterial disease,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to perform an economic evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of endovascular enhancements to percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) with bail-out bare metal stents for infrainguinal peripheral arterial disease. METHODS: The following interventions were considered: PTA with no bail-out stenting, PTA with bail-out drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons, primary bare metal stents, primary drug-eluting stents, endovascular brachytherapy, stent-grafts and cryoplasty. A discrete-event simulation model was developed to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of the interventions from a health service perspective over a lifetime. Populations of patients with intermittent claudication (IC) and critical leg ischaemia (CLI) were modelled separately. Univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Effectiveness was measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: For both patient populations, the use of drug-coated balloons dominated all other options by having both lower lifetime costs and greater effectiveness. For willingness-to-pay thresholds between pound0 and pound100,000 per additional QALY, the probability of drug-coated balloons being cost-effective was at least 58.3 per cent for patients with IC and at least 72.2 per cent for patients with CLI.

11670,Economic evaluation of treatments for chronic hepatitis B,"The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-utility study of adefovir, entecavir, interferon alpha, pegylated interferon alpha, lamivudine and tenofovir for chronic hepatitis B in the context of Brazilian Public Health Care System. A systematic review was carried out for efficacy and safety. Another review was performed to collect utility data and transition probabilities between health states. A Markov model was developed in a time horizon of 40 years with annual cycles for three groups of: HBeAg positive, HBeAg negative, and all patients. These strategies were compared to a fourth group that received no treatment. Discount rates of 5% were applied and sensitivity analyses were performed. Tenofovir offered the best cost-utility ratio for the three evaluated models: U$397, U$385 and U$384 (per QALY, respectively, for HBeAg positive, negative, and all patients). All other strategies were completely dominated because they showed higher costs and lower effectiveness than tenofovir. The sequence of cost-utility in the three models was: tenofovir, entecavir, lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, pegylated interferon alpha, and interferon alpha.

11690,Cost effectiveness of romiplostim for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in Ireland,"BACKGROUND: Romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPOra), is a second-line medical treatment option for adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Clinical trials have shown that romiplostim increases platelet counts, while reducing the risk of bleeding and, in turn, the need for costly rescue medications. AIMS: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of romiplostim in the treatment of adult ITP in Ireland, in comparison with eltrombopag and the medical standard of care (SoC). METHODS: A lifetime treatment-sequence cost-utility Markov model with embedded decision tree was developed from an Irish healthcare perspective to compare romiplostim with eltrombopag and SoC. The model was driven by platelet response (platelet count >/=50 x 10(9)/L), which determined effectiveness and progression along the treatment pathway, need for rescue therapy (e.g. intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIg] and steroids) and risk of bleeding. Probability of response, mean treatment duration, average time to initial response and utilities were derived from clinical trials and other published evidence. Treatment sequences and healthcare utilization practice were validated by Irish clinical experts. Costs were assessed in <euro> for 2011 and included drug acquisition costs and costs associated with monitoring patients and management of bleeding, as available from published Irish reimbursement lists and other relevant sources. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Romiplostim treatment resulted in an average of 20.2 fewer administrations of rescue medication (IVIg or intravenous steroids) over a patient lifetime than eltrombopag, and 29.3 fewer rescue medication administrations than SoC. Romiplostim was dominant, with cost savings of <euro>13,258 and <euro>22,673 and gains of 0.76 and 1.17 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), compared with eltrombopag and SoC, respectively. Romiplostim remained cost effective throughout a variety of potential scenarios, including short-term TPOra treatment duration (1 year). One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most sensitive to variation in the cost of IVIg and use of romiplostim and IVIg. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that romiplostim was likely to be cost effective in over 90 % of cases compared with eltrombopag, and 96 % compared with SoC at a willingness-to-pay threshold of <euro>30,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Use of romiplostim in the ITP treatment pathway, compared with eltrombopag or SoC, is likely to be cost effective in Ireland.

11692,Duration of anticoagulation for the management of venous thromboembolism in inflammatory bowel disease: a decision analysis,"OBJECTIVES: There is practice variation in the duration of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Clinicians must weigh the high risk of recurrent VTE with the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: We implemented Markov decision analysis to compare the costs and effectiveness of extended anticoagulation vs. time-limited anticoagulation (6 months) among IBD patients with first unprovoked VTE over a 5-year time horizon. In a secondary analysis, we added two strategies in which therapeutic-dose or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was administered during IBD flares. RESULTS: Compared with time-limited anticoagulation, extended anticoagulation yielded slightly higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (4.40 vs. 4.38) and costs ($21,158 vs. $20,825), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $15,254/QALY over 5 years. In secondary analysis, pharmacological prophylaxis during IBD flares was associated with the highest QALYs (4.41) and costs ($28,177), but was not cost-effective when compared with extended anticoagulation (ICER=$1,158,717/QALY). Anticoagulation during flares yielded the lowest cost ($19,681) and same QALYs as extended anticoagulation. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, extended anticoagulation yielded higher QALYs than time-limited anticoagulation in 91% of trials and was dominant or cost-effective (<$50,000/QALY) in 72% of trials. When analyzed over a lifetime, extended anticoagulation dominated time-limited anticoagulation with higher effectiveness (18.44 vs. 17.95 QALYs) and lower costs ($94,738 vs. $102,874) and was highly robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that extended anticoagulation may provide marginal benefit over time-limited anticoagulation and should be considered in the management of first unprovoked VTE in IBD.

Our objective was to estimate the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs per QALY gained using low-molecular-weight heparin compared with low-dose aspirin for two weeks after total knee or total hip arthroplasty in patients with no history of venous thromboembolism. METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model with health states of healthy after surgery, no postphlebitic syndrome after venous thromboembolism, postphlebitic syndrome after venous thromboembolism, and survival after intracranial hemorrhage to compare treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin or aspirin (160 mg) for fourteen days after total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty in patients with an age of fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five, eighty, or eighty-five years. We estimated lifetime costs, QALYs gained, and costs per QALY gained for both strategies, and applied a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 (2010 U.S. dollars) per QALY gained. RESULTS: For patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty at the ages of fifty-five and seventy years, costs per QALY gained for low-molecular-weight heparin compared with aspirin were $315,000 and $1.4 million, respectively. For those undergoing total hip arthroplasty at the age of eighty or eighty-five years, aspirin cost less and saved more QALYs than low-molecular-weight heparin. For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty at the ages of fifty-five, seventy, and eighty-five years, costs per QALY gained with low-molecular-weight heparin were $36,000, $112,000, and $448,000, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed a low probability of low-molecular-weight heparin being cost-effective for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and for those with an age of eighty years or older undergoing total knee arthroplasty. For individuals younger than eighty years of age undergoing total knee arthroplasty, the cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin compared with aspirin is uncertain.

11695,The economic evaluation of screening for colorectal cancer: Case of Iran,"BACKGROUND: Given increasing rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in countries with intermediate incidence rates, the decision to implement population-based screening must consider the trade-off between high costs and a relatively low yield. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10 strategies for colorectal cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance, and data on the costs and benefits of chemotherapy in Iran. METHODS: We used a Markov model to measure the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 50-year-old average-risk Iranian without screening and with screening by each test. In this study, we populated the model with data from the ministry of health and published literature. We considered costs from the perspective of a health insurance organization, with inflation to the 2011 Iranian Rial converted to US dollars. We focused on three tests of the 10 strategies considered, currently being used for population screening in some Iranian provinces (Mazandaran Kerman, Golestan, Ardabil, and Tehran): low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually; fecal immunochemical test, performed annually; and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years. RESULTS: These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 39%, 60%, and 76% and mortality by 50%, 69%, and 78%, respectively, compared with no screening. These strategies generated ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) of $9067, $654, and $8700 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year), respectively. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of various parameters on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every 10 years yielded the greatest net health benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective over conventional levels of WTP (Willingness to Pay).

11698,Dabigatran versus warfarin under standard or pharmacogenetic-guided management for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation: a cost/utility analysis using an analytic decision model,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of heart arrhythmia and a leading cause of stroke and systemic embolism. Chronic anticoagulation is recommended for preventing those complications. Our study aimed to compare the cost/utility (CU) of three main anticoagulation options: 1) standard warfarin dosing (SD-W) 2) warfarin dosage under the guidance of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping (GT-W) and 3) dabigatran 150 mg twice a day. METHODS: A Markov state transition model was built to simulate the expected C/U of dabigatran, SD-W and GT-W anticoagulation therapy for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation over a period of 5 years under the perspective of the public health care system. Model inputs were derived from extensive literature search and government''s data bases. Outcomes considered were the number of total major events (thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events), total costs in Canadian dollars (1CAD$ = 1$US), total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs/QALYs and incremental costs/QALYs gained (ICUR). RESULTS: Raw base case results show that SD-W has the lowest C/U ratio. However, the dabigatran option might be considered as an alternative, as its cost per additional QALY gained compared to SD-W is CAD $ 4 765, i.e. less than 50 000, the ICUR threshold generally accepted to adopt an intervention. At the same threshold, GT-W doesn''t appear to be an alternative to SD-W. Our results were robust to one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: SD-W has the lowest C/U ratio among the 3 options. However, dabigatran might be considered as an alternative. GT-W is not C/U and should not currently be recommended for the routine anticoagulotherapy management of AF patients.",2013-01-11681,23866305,Thromb J,Leon Nshimyumukiza,2013,11 / 1,14,No,23866305,"Leon Nshimyumukiza; Julie Duplantie; Mathieu Gagnon; Xavier Douville; Diane Fournier; Carmen Lindsay; Marc Parent; Alain Milot; Yves Giguere; Christian Gagne; Francois Rousseau; Daniel Reinharz; Dabigatran versus warfarin under standard or pharmacogenetic-guided management for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation: a cost/utility analysis using an analytic decision model, Thromb J, 2013; 11(1):1477-9560; 14",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pharmacogenetic oriented warfarin dosage for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard warfarin dosage,Not Stated,64 Years,64 Years,Not Stated,Full,"5 Years, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,54117.64,Canada,2011,62980.67

11700,Cost effectiveness of denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the US,"BACKGROUND: In the US, 26 % of women aged >/=65 years, and over 50 % of women aged >/=85 years are affected with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). Each year, the total direct health care costs are estimated to be $US12-18 billion. OBJECTIVE: The cost effectiveness of denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates in postmenopausal osteoporotic women from a US third-party payer perspective was evaluated. METHODS: A lifetime cohort Markov model was developed with seven health states: ''well'', hip fracture, vertebral fracture, ''other'' osteoporotic fracture, post-hip fracture, post-vertebral fracture, and dead. During each cycle, patients could have a fracture, remain healthy, remain in a post-fracture state or die. Relative fracture risk reductions, background fracture risks, mortality rates, treatment-specific persistence rate, utilities, and medical and drug costs were derived using published sources. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for generic alendronate, denosumab, branded risedronate, and branded ibandronate in the overall PMO population and high-risk subgroups: (a) >/=2 of the following risks: >70 years of age, bone mineral density (BMD) T score less than or equal to -3.0, and prevalent vertebral fracture; and (b) >/=75 years of age. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3 % annually, and all costs were inflated to 2012 US dollars. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying parameters e.g., efficacies of interventions, costs, utilities, and the medication persistence ratio. RESULTS: In the overall PMO population, total lifetime costs for alendronate, denosumab, risedronate, and ibandronate were $US64,400, $US67,400, $US67,600 and $US69,200, respectively. Total QALYs were 8.2804, 8.3155, 8.2735 and 8.2691, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for denosumab versus generic alendronate was $US85,100/QALY. Risedronate and ibandronate were dominated by denosumab. In the high-risk subgroup (a), total costs for alendronate, denosumab, risedronate and ibandronate were $US70,400, $US70,800, $US74,000 and $US76,900, respectively. Total QALYs were 7.2006, 7.2497, 7.1969 and 7.1841, respectively. Denosumab had an ICER of $US7,900/QALY versus generic alendronate and dominated all other strategies. Denosumab dominated all strategies in women aged >/=75 years. Base-case results between denosumab and generic alendronate were most sensitive to the relative risk of hip fracture for both drugs and the cost of denosumab. CONCLUSION: In each PMO population examined, denosumab represented good value for money compared with branded bisphosphonates. Furthermore, denosumab was either cost effective or dominant compared with generic alendronate in the high-risk subgroups.",2013-01-11684,23868102,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Anju Parthan,2013,11 / 5,,Yes,23868102,"Anju Parthan; Morgan Kruse; Nicole Yurgin; Joice Huang; Hema N Viswanathan; Douglas Taylor; Cost effectiveness of denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the US, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 11(5):1179-1896",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Denosumab vs. Generic alendronate,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,85060,United States,2012,95884.32
