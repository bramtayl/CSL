5501,Cost and cost-effectiveness of switching from stavudine to tenofovir in first-line antiretroviral regimens in South Africa,"BACKGROUND: Most first-line antiretroviral therapy regimens in Africa include stavudine (d4T), despite the high incidence of toxicities related to it. We estimated the cost and cost-effectiveness of switching from d4T to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in South Africa. METHODS: A model was developed to estimate the proportion of patients in a hypothetical cohort who experienced d4T- and TDF-related events over the 2 years after antiretroviral therapy initiation. Transition probabilities, event and drug costs, and utility losses were estimated from primary data and the literature. Outcomes included incremental cost, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year gained, and threshold prices for TDF. RESULTS: After 2 years, 82.5% of the d4T scenario cohort remained on d4T, 16.6% had switched to AZT, 0.8% had died, and 414 events that did not lead to a drug change had occurred. In the TDF scenario, 97.5% of the cohort remained on TDF. At a baseline cost of TDF of $17.00/month, the incremental cost of the TDF scenario was $128/patient/year and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $9007 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The change to TDF would be cost neutral for the government at a price of $6.17/month and highly cost effective at a price of $12.94/month. CONCLUSIONS: At a TDF price of $17.00/month, savings on d4T toxicity management will offset roughly 20% of the higher price of TDF. The price of TDF would have to fall substantially to make the change cost neutral for South Africa in budgetary terms, but it would be highly cost effective at a price only slightly less than what is currently available.",2008-01-04732,18545151,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Sydney Rosen,2008,48 / 3,334-44,No,18545151,"Sydney Rosen; Lawrence Long; Matthew Fox; Ian Sanne; Cost and cost-effectiveness of switching from stavudine to tenofovir in first-line antiretroviral regimens in South Africa, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2008-Jul-01; 48(3):1525-4135; 334-44",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate vs. Stavudine (d4T),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,9007,United States,2006,11563.05
5502,Economic evaluation of delivering hepatitis B vaccine to injection drug users,"BACKGROUND: Injection drug users (IDUs) are at high risk of hepatitis B (HBV) infection, and hepatitis B vaccination coverage in IDUs is low. Recent studies demonstrate that syringe exchange programs are effective venues to reach and immunize IDUs. The purpose of this paper was to determine if targeting IDUs for HBV vaccination through syringe exchange programs is economically desirable for the healthcare system and to assess the relative effectiveness of several different vaccination strategies. METHODS: Active IDUs in Chicago IL and Hartford and Bridgeport CT (N=1964) were recruited and screened through local syringe exchange programs, randomized to a standard (0, 1, 6 months) or accelerated (0, 1, 2 months) vaccination schedule, and followed from May 2003 to March 2006. Analyses were conducted in 2007. The vaccination program's costs were balanced against future HBV-associated medical costs. Benefits in terms of prevented acute HBV infections and quality-adjusted life years were estimated based on a Markov model. RESULTS: HBV vaccination campaigns targeting IDUs through syringe exchange programs are cost-saving. The most cost-saving strategies include giving the first dose to everyone at screening, administering the vaccination under the accelerated schedule (0, 1, 2 months), and obtaining highly discounted vaccine from local health departments. CONCLUSIONS: It is economically inappropriate to offer HBV screening in the absence of vaccination.

5506,Cost-effectiveness analysis of prevention strategies for gynecologic cancers in Lynch syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Women with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) have an increased lifetime risk for endometrial and ovarian cancer. Screening and prophylactic surgery have been recommended as prevention strategies. In this study, the authors estimated the net health benefits and cost-effectiveness of these strategies in a Markov decision-analytic model. METHODS: Five strategies were compared for a hypothetical cohort of women with Lynch syndrome: 1) no prevention ('reference'); 2) prophylactic surgery (hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) at age 30 years; 3) prophylactic surgery at age 40 years; 4) annual screening with endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, and CA 125 from age 30 years; and 5) annual screening from age 30 years until prophylactic surgery at age 40 years (combined strategy). Net health benefit was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the primary outcome measured was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Baseline and transition probabilities were obtained from published literature, and costs were from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Agency for Health Care Quality and Research. Sensitivity analyses were performed for uncertainty around various parameters. RESULTS: The combined strategy provided the highest net health benefit (18.98 QALYs) but had an ICER of $194,650 per QALY relative to the next best strategy (prophylactic surgery at age 40 years). Prophylactic surgery at age 30 years and annual screening were dominated by alternate strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Annual screening followed by prophylactic surgery at age 40 years was the most effective gynecologic cancer prevention strategy, but the incremental benefit over prophylactic surgery alone was attained at substantial cost.

5519,Capecitabine versus bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin (folinic acid) as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with Dukes' C colon cancer : economic evaluation in an Italian NHS setting,"In the recent X-ACT (Xeloda in Adjuvant Colon cancer Therapy) trial, oral capecitabine (Xeloda) demonstrated superior efficacy and an improved safety profile compared with infused fluorouracil + leucovorin (folinic acid) [FU+LV] in patients with Dukes' C colorectal cancer. We used the X-ACT results to determine the cost effectiveness of capecitabine compared with FU+LV from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS).Medical resource use data were collected throughout the treatment period. Unit costs for drug administration, hospitalization, emergency room visits and concomitant medications were obtained using Italian published sources. A health-state transition model was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-month (QALM) gains in the intent-to-treat population (1004 and 983 patients in the capecitabine and FU+LV arms, respectively). Costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3.5%. Costs were calculated in euros (2005 values).Administration of capecitabine required fewer clinic visits per patient than FU+LV (7.35 vs 28.0, respectively). Mean acquisition costs per patient for capecitabine were higher than for FU+LV (euro 2533 vs euro 231, respectively), but this difference was offset by the difference in mean chemotherapy administration costs per patient for FU+LV (euro 4338, compared with euro 152 for capecitabine). Mean total hospital days and medication costs for treatment-related adverse events were higher for FU+LV than for capecitabine (euro 352 vs euro 78, respectively). The cost of emergency room visits for the treatment of adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups. With respect to the lifetime horizon, compared with FU+LV, capecitabine is projected to increase QALMs by a mean 6.5 months, with overall cost savings of euro 2234 over the treatment period. These findings show that capecitabine is an economically dominant treatment in this setting.Adjuvant capecitabine for patients with Dukes' C colon cancer has the same activity in terms of outcome when compared with FU+LV but is a lower cost option from the economic perspective of the Italian NHS.",2008-01-13310,18783303,Clin Drug Investig,Francesco Di Costanzo,2008,28 / 10,645-55,Yes,18783303,"Francesco Di Costanzo; Roberto Ravasio; Alberto Sobrero; Oscar Bertetto; Orazio Vinante; Gabriele Luppi; Roberto Labianca; Dino Amadori; Carlo Barone; Marco Carlo Merlano; Flavia Longo; Giovanni Mansueto; Lorenzo Antonuzzo; Silvia Gasperoni; Capecitabine versus bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin (folinic acid) as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with Dukes' C colon cancer : economic evaluation in an Italian NHS setting, Clin Drug Investig, ; 28(10):1173-2563; 645-55",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Oral capecitabine (8 cycles, 1250 mg/m2 twice daily) vs. Rapid-infusion intravenous (IV) leucovorin (LV) (6 cycles, 20 mg/m2) followed immediately by an IV bolus of fluorouracil (FU) (425 mg/m2)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-342.75,Euro,2005,-565.44

Disease progression probabilities, costs and quality-of-life data were derived from the literature. We assumed a treatment duration of 4 years, with the use of combination therapy for drug resistance. Nonresponders to pegylated interferon were assumed to receive entecavir in years 3-4. Sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis, were conducted to evaluate uncertainty in the results. All costs were valued in $US, year 2008 values.

5527,Economic impact and long-term graft outcomes of mycophenolate mofetil dosage modifications following gastrointestinal complications in renal transplant recipients,"Gastrointestinal (GI) complications are common following renal transplantation. Discontinuing or reducing the dosage of mycophenolate mofetil can improve GI tolerability but adversely affect graft outcomes. This analysis was undertaken to assess the 3-year economic and clinical impact of mycophenolate mofetil dosage modifications or discontinuation following post-transplant GI events compared with no dosage modification.Adult renal transplant recipients with a Medicare-covered mycophenolate mofetil prescription at the time of GI complication between 1995 and 2000 were drawn from the US Renal Data System (USRDS). The 3-year graft survival rates after first diagnosis of a GI complication were obtained in four cohorts of patients according to mycophenolate mofetil administration within 6 months of initial GI diagnosis: (i) no dosage change in mycophenolate mofetil (NC); (ii) one or more episodes of mycophenolate mofetil dosage reduction <50% of the initial dosage, lasting >30 days (DR <50%); (iii) one or more episodes of mycophenolate mofetil dosage reduction >or=50% of the initial dosage, lasting >30 days (DR >or=50%); and (iv) one or more episodes of mycophenolate mofetil discontinuation >30 days (DC).Two multivariate models were used to estimate the association between DR and DC and graft survival <6 months after GI diagnosis and 6-36 months after diagnosis. In each cohort, Medicare costs for maintaining a patient with stable function were calculated using regression and were augmented with cost of graft failure, resumed maintenance dialysis and death post-graft loss using Medicare data supplied by the USRDS. Survival and cost outcomes were integrated in a 3-year Markov model with 6-month cycles. The perspective was that of Medicare, and costs and outcomes were discounted by 3% per annum.Adult patients (n = 3589) with a mycophenolate mofetil prescription at time of diagnosis of GI event were identified: NC = 2230 (62.1%); DR <50% = 247 (6.9%); DR >or=50% = 348 (9.7%); and DC = 764 (21.3%). In the first 6 months after GI diagnosis, DC was associated with increased risk of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR] 3.20; 95% CI 1.71, 5.99; p < 0.0001).

The inclusion criteria were elderly patients with geriatric syndrome. Exclusion criteria were advanced malignancy, APACHE II score > 34,in-hospital mortality in the first 24 hours, move to another ward before completing CGA management, the presence of dementia. After patients were allocated into CGA and non-CGA group, effectiveness was assessed using ADL/WHO Unescap score, days of hospitalization, proportion of re-hospitalization, survival, quality of life score (EQ5D),patients and nurses satisfaction score. Cost effectiveness analysis was done using TreeAge-Pro 2004 software program.the length of hospitalization was shorter in the CGA group than in non-CGA group (10.99 [0.79] days vs.20.16 [2.62] days; p=0.00). At the end of treatment, mean of ADL score changes was significantly higher in CGA group than non-CGA group. Mean of WHO-Unescap score changes in CGA group was higher than non-CGA group (0.71[0.04]vs 0.61 [0.04]; p=0.09). EQ5D-VAS score was also higher in CGA group (0.79[0,01] vs 0.75[0.01]; p=0,01). Survival proportion in CGA group was lower than non-CGA group(80.37% vs 86.92%; p>0.05). Rehospitalization proportion was higher in non-CGA group than in CGA group (21.5%vs 11.21%; p 0.04). Patient's satisfaction level was higher in CGA group (193.38 [1.25] vs 177.47 [3.04]; p=0.00).Nurse satisfaction level was also higher in CGA group than non-CGA group but not statistically significant (225.06[7.08] vs 220.06[8.26]; p=0.65).Mean of healthcare cost in non-CGA group was higher than in CGA group (Rp. 9,746,426.00 [1,180,331] vs Rp 4,760,965.00 [338,089]).

The number of women correctly diagnosed by QUS and DXA as being above a 10-year risk of > or =30% was estimated for different age groups (50-60, 60-70, 70-80 and 80-90 years, respectively). The robustness of the results was tested by a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation.Compared with no screening, the cost effectiveness of QUS plus DXA was found to be Euro 3529, Euro 9983, Euro 4382 and Euro 1987 per QALY for 50-, 60-, 70- and 80-year-old women, respectively (year 2006 values). This screening strategy results in annual costs of Euro 96 million or 0.07% of the SHI's annual budget. The cost effectiveness of DXA alone compared with DXA plus QUS is Euro 5331, Euro 60, 804, Euro 14, 943 and Euro 3654 per QALY for 50-, 60-, 70- and 80-year-old women, respectively. DXA alone results in a higher number of QALYs in all age groups.

5547,A cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for resected gastric cancer,"The Intergroup 0116 trial demonstrated that adding postoperative chemoradiotherapy for gastric cancer resulted in a significant overall survival improvement of 9 months. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for resected gastric cancer.An economic model was constructed to examine the costs and quality-adjusted survival benefit of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for gastric cancer. Medicare reimbursement rates were used for chemotherapy and radiotherapy costs. Costs of managing toxicities were also included. Patient utilities were derived from published literature. The analysis was performed from the third-party payer perspective, with results reported in 2007 US dollars. A lifetime time horizon and 3% discount rate were used. One-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.For the base case, the incremental cost of adding adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was $20,100. The net gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 0.53. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $38,400/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted a 67% likelihood that the ICER would be less than $50,000/QALY.Our model suggests that the ICER of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for resected gastric cancer compares favorably to other widely used cancer treatments.",2008-01-13346,19259297,Gastrointest Cancer Res,Samuel J Wang,2008,2 / 2,57-63,No,19259297,"Samuel J Wang; Clifton D Fuller; Mehee Choi; Charles R Thomas; A cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for resected gastric cancer, Gastrointest Cancer Res, ; 2(2):1934-7820; 57-63",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Postoperative chemoradiotherapy vs. No additional treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,38400,United States,2007,47932.12
5548,A pharmacoeconomic analysis of compliance gains on antipsychotic medications,"Compliance among patients with schizophrenia is typically poor. Consequently, treatments that are equally efficacious under trial-based conditions but face different compliance rates in clinical practice (e.g. due to adverse-effect profile, ease of use, reputation) may have differences in effectiveness not observed during trials. This study analyses the impact of differences in compliance with atypical antipsychotics using a pharmacoeconomic discrete-event simulation (DES) model, adapted to the Swedish treatment setting.An existing 5-year DES model was adapted to reflect a Swedish setting; the analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective, with only direct costs included. The two treatment arms were identical except for percentage of compliant patients. Non-compliant patients experienced shorter time between relapses and had inferior symptom control than their compliant counterparts. The difference in compliance rates was varied from 0% to 15%, and incremental costs and effects were recorded and analysed.With a 5%, 10% and 15% difference in compliance rate, incremental effects increased to 0.021, 0.037 and 0.062, respectively, while generating cost savings of Swedish kronor (SEK)31 500, SEK62 000 and SEK104 500, respectively (SEK9.25 = 1, Euro year 2007 values). Hence, each percentage point of compliance gain is predicted to roughly result in a cost saving of SEK6000 and a QALY gain of 0.004. On average, the model predicts that, with a 15% increase in compliance, 0.5 relapses are prevented, the average Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score decreases by 3.3 points and patients spend 22 fewer days in hospital over 5 years.The DES model predicts that increases in compliance may lead to considerable cost savings and health improvements. Therefore, when determining the cost effectiveness of a new antipsychotic, efficacy rates from clinical trials should not be taken at face value, but should be interpreted in tandem with expectations concerning compliance, in light of product characteristics such as adverse effects.

5551,Cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination against rotavirus with RIX4414 in France,"It is estimated that annually 300 000 cases of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis (RVGE) occur in children aged up to 5 years in France. A two-dose vaccine against rotavirus infection (RIX4414; Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline), has been shown to be highly effective against severe RVGE.This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of general vaccination against rotavirus using RIX4414 in France.A Markov model simulated RVGE events and the associated outcomes and costs relating to general vaccination of infants against rotavirus infection using RIX4414 (Rotarix) in a birth cohort of children aged up to 5 years in France with a combined adjustment for age distribution with the seasonality of the infection. Costs and outcomes were estimated from a limited societal perspective, including direct medical costs paid out of pocket or by third-party payers, as well as the proportion of direct medical costs reimbursed by the health authorities. Indirect costs were not included in the base-case analysis. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per QALY.Vaccination with RIX4414 incurred an incremental cost of 44 583 Euro per QALY at a public price of 57 Euro per vaccine dose. Univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the parameters with the largest influence on the results were the transition probabilities of severe diarrhoea, seeking medical advice and emergency visits, utility scores of diarrhoea (mild) in children and infants, and the discount rate for benefits. Probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analysis confirmed these results. The acceptability curve indicated that 94% of the results were under an informal threshold of 50 000 Euro per QALY. Comparing our results with those of a recently published study using pooled data for two rotavirus vaccine products in France, the main differences are explained by differences in model structure and in data input values. They include a different age distribution of the infection, shorter duration of the at-risk period (3 years instead of 5 years), different vaccine efficacy, different unit cost data, different disease duration, and different disutility values for the health states in the model. There is a need for agreed standards to improve comparability of results from different studies.The results demonstrate that a generalized vaccination strategy with RIX4414 would be cost effective in France from a limited societal perspective, depending on the baseline assumptions for disease progression and on utility scores selected.",2008-01-13353,19382820,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Baudouin Standaert,2008,6 / 4,199-216,Yes,19382820,"Baudouin Standaert; Nathalie Parez; Bertrand Tehard; Xavier Colin; Bruno Detournay; Cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination against rotavirus with RIX4414 in France, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 6(4):1179-1896; 199-216",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,General vaccination of infants against rotavirus infection using RIX4414 (Rotarix) vs. None,Not Stated,4 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,44583,Euro,2005,73548.55

This analysis was constructed using the Australian payer perspective of direct costs and outcomes, with indirect medical costs and lost productivity not being included. The study population comprised a hypothetical cohort of 1000 antiviral treatment-naive CHB patients who received either entecavir 0.5 mg/day or lamivudine 100 mg/day at model entry. The population of patients used in this analysis was representative of those patients likely to receive initial antiviral therapy in clinical practice in Australia. The long-term cost effectiveness of entecavir compared with lamivudine in the first-line treatment of CHB patients was expressed as an incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) or QALY gained.Results revealed that the availability of entecavir 0.5 mg/day as part of the Australian hepatologist's treatment armamentarium should result in significantly lower future rates of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) events (i.e. 54 fewer cases of CC, seven fewer cases of DC, and 20 fewer cases of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg+ve CHB patients, and 69 fewer cases of CC, eight fewer cases of DC and 25 fewer cases of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg-ve CHB patients).

Analysis of mean cost and QALY indicated that use of either implant is not associated with cost savings.Management with cementless or cemented total hip prostheses in a theoretical cohort of 70-year-old patients with fracture of the femoral neck or arthritis involving the hip is not significantly different according to the probabilistic results from the model.",2008-01-13355,19384477,J Orthop Traumatol,M Marinelli,2008,9 / 1,23-8,No,19384477,"M Marinelli; A Soccetti; N Panfoli; L de Palma; Cost-effectiveness of cemented versus cementless total hip arthroplasty.

5556,A comparison of the superficial inferior epigastric artery flap and deep inferior epigastric perforator flap in postmastectomy reconstruction: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) and deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps in postmastectomy reconstruction.A decision analytic model with seven clinically important health outcomes (health states) was used, incorporating the Ontario Ministry of Health's perspective. Direct medical costs were estimated from a university-based hospital. The utilities of each health state converted into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from previously published data. Health state probabilities were computed from a systematic literature review. Analyses yielded SIEA and DIEP expected costs and QALYs allowing calculation of the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted under five plausible scenarios, assessing result robustness.Five SIEA and 27 DIEP studies were identified. The baseline SIEA expected cost was slightly higher than that for the DIEP ($16,107 versus $16,095), with slightly higher QALYs (33.14 years versus 32.98 years), giving an ICUR of $77/QALY. Taking into account conversions from SIEA to DIEP, the ICUR increased to $4,480/QALY. Sensitivity analysis gave ICURs ranging from $2,614/QALY to 'dominant', all consistent with the adoption of the SIEA over the DIEP.The best available evidence suggests the SIEA is a cost-effective procedure. However, given the high SIEA to DIEP conversion rates and small marginal differences in cost and effectiveness, the ICUR may be sensitive to minor changes in costs or QALYs. The 'truth' can only be obtained from a randomized, controlled trial comparing both techniques side by side, simultaneously capturing the costs of the competing interventions.",2008-01-13362,19554170,Can J Plast Surg,Achilleas Thoma,2008,16 / 2,77-84,No,19554170,"Achilleas Thoma; Leigh Jansen; Sheila Sprague; Eric Duku P Stat; A comparison of the superficial inferior epigastric artery flap and deep inferior epigastric perforator flap in postmastectomy reconstruction: A cost-effectiveness analysis, Can J Plast Surg, ; 16(2):1195-2199; 77-84",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) flap in postmastectomy reconstruction vs. Deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap in postmastectomy reconstruction,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,77.4,Canada,2006,87.65

5559,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention in optimally treated stable coronary patients,"The COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive druG Evaluations) trial compared the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) plus optimal medical therapy with optimal medical therapy alone on cardiovascular events in 2287 patients with stable coronary disease. After 4.6 years, there was no difference in the primary end point of death or myocardial infarction, although PCI improved quality of life. The present study evaluated the relative cost and cost-effectiveness of PCI in the COURAGE trial.Resource use was assessed by diagnosis-related group for hospitalizations and by current procedural terminology code for outpatient visits and tests and then converted to costs by use of 2004 Medicare payments. Medication costs were assessed with the Red Book average wholesale price. Life expectancy beyond the trial was estimated from Framingham survival data. Utilities were assessed by the standard gamble method. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as cost per life-year and cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The added cost of PCI was approximately $10,000, without significant gain in life-years or quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varied from just over $168,000 to just under $300,000 per life-year or quality-adjusted life-year gained with PCI. A large minority of the distributions found that medical therapy alone offered better outcome at lower cost. The costs per patient for a significant improvement in angina frequency, physical limitation, and quality of life were $154,580, $112,876, and $124,233, respectively.The COURAGE trial did not find the addition of PCI to optimal medical therapy to be a cost-effective initial management strategy for symptomatic, chronic coronary artery disease.",2008-01-13374,20031783,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,William S Weintraub,2008,1 / 1,12-20,No,20031783,"William S Weintraub; William E Boden; Zugui Zhang; Paul Kolm; Zefeng Zhang; John A Spertus; Pamela Hartigan; Emir Veledar; Claudine Jurkovitz; Jim Bowen; David J Maron; Robert O'Rourke; Marcin Dada; Koon K Teo; Ron Goeree; Paul G Barnett; Department of Veterans Affairs C; Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention in optimally treated stable coronary patients, Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, ; 1(1):1941-7705; 12-20",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with optimal medical therapy vs. Optimal medical therapy alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,168019,United States,2004,230202.04

5562,Measurement of fractional flow reserve to guide decisions for percutaneous coronary intervention,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of premature death in Germany. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are frequently performed in patients with angiographically intermediate stenoses. However, the necessity of PCI has not been proven for all patients. Pressure-based fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an invasive test that can be used to assess the functional significance of intermediate coronary stenoses in order to guide decisions on PCI.This health technology assessment (HTA) aims to evaluate (1) the diagnostic accuracy, (2) the risk-benefit trade-off and (3) the long-term cost-effectiveness of FFR measurement to guide the decision on PCI in patients with stable angina pectoris and intermediate coronary stenoses.We performed a literature search in medical and HTA databases. We used the DIMDI instruments (DIMDI = Deutsches Institut f?r Medizinische Dokumentation und Information/German Institute for Medical Information and Documentation) to assess study quality and to extract and summarize the information in evidence tables. We performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled overall estimate for sensitivity and specificity of FFR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Individual studies' case numbers were used as weights. The influence of single studies and important covariates on the results was tested in sensitivity analyses. We developed the German Coronary Artery Disease Outcome Model (German CADOM), a decision-analytic Markov model, to estimate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FFR measurement in the context of the German healthcare system.Our literature search identified twelve studies relevant to this HTA-report including ten diagnostic accuracy studies of FFR measurement, one randomized clinical trial (RCT) investigating the clinical benefits of this technique as well as one economic evaluation. Pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 81.7% (95% CI: 77.0-85.7%) and 78.7% (95% CI: 74.3-82.7%). Sensitivity analyses indicated robust results.

Results of the decision analysis are limited by the necessary underlying assumptions and the uncertainty regarding long-term mortality reduction associated with PCI. Further research should focus on the acquisition of long-term data for disease progression in patients with and without functional coronary stenoses as well as the benefits and risks of PCI.Based on actual evidence and our decision analysis, the use of FFR measurement to guide the decision on PCI should lead to better short- and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with stable angina and single-vessel disease without documented myocardial ischemia and it should provide a cost-effective use of resources in the German healthcare system.

5567,Measurement of fractional flow reserve to guide decisions for percutaneous coronary intervention,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of premature death in Germany. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are frequently performed in patients with angiographically intermediate stenoses. However, the necessity of PCI has not been proven for all patients. Pressure-based fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an invasive test that can be used to assess the functional significance of intermediate coronary stenoses in order to guide decisions on PCI.This health technology assessment (HTA) aims to evaluate (1) the diagnostic accuracy, (2) the risk-benefit trade-off and (3) the long-term cost-effectiveness of FFR measurement to guide the decision on PCI in patients with stable angina pectoris and intermediate coronary stenoses.We performed a literature search in medical and HTA databases. We used the DIMDI instruments (DIMDI = Deutsches Institut f?r Medizinische Dokumentation und Information/German Institute for Medical Information and Documentation) to assess study quality and to extract and summarize the information in evidence tables. We performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled overall estimate for sensitivity and specificity of FFR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Individual studies' case numbers were used as weights. The influence of single studies and important covariates on the results was tested in sensitivity analyses. We developed the German Coronary Artery Disease Outcome Model (German CADOM), a decision-analytic Markov model, to estimate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FFR measurement in the context of the German healthcare system.Our literature search identified twelve studies relevant to this HTA-report including ten diagnostic accuracy studies of FFR measurement, one randomized clinical trial (RCT) investigating the clinical benefits of this technique as well as one economic evaluation. Pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 81.7% (95% CI: 77.0-85.7%) and 78.7% (95% CI: 74.3-82.7%). Sensitivity analyses indicated robust results. The RCT investigating the efficacy of an FFR-based treatment strategy provided evidence of the advantages of this strategy for patients with respect to freedom from angina and major adverse cardiac events. The published cost-effectiveness study demonstrates that the FFR-based strategy is cost-saving in the US context. Based on our own decision analysis for the German context, the FFR-based strategy improves (quality-adjusted) life-expectancy when compared to universal PCI and is cost-effective in the German healthcare context. This HTA is limited by the use of poor gold standards in several of the included diagnostic studies as well as the ongoing advance of technology and treatment options in interventional cardiology. Results of the decision analysis are limited by the necessary underlying assumptions and the uncertainty regarding long-term mortality reduction associated with PCI. Further research should focus on the acquisition of long-term data for disease progression in patients with and without functional coronary stenoses as well as the benefits and risks of PCI.Based on actual evidence and our decision analysis, the use of FFR measurement to guide the decision on PCI should lead to better short- and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with stable angina and single-vessel disease without documented myocardial ischemia and it should provide a cost-effective use of resources in the German healthcare system.

5570,Cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents including the economic impact of late stent thrombosis,"Recent studies examining the effectiveness of drug-eluting stents (DES) have found that the use of DES is associated with a significant increase in the incidence of late stent thrombosis (LST). Previous cost-effectiveness analyses of DES have not accounted for the costs associated with LST. In this study, published research was reviewed to identify studies that compared the cost-effectiveness of DES with that of bare-metal stents and to identify the incidence of LST. Probable costs were assigned to LST-related myocardial infarction and death on the basis of the treatment costs for these outcomes. These costs as well as those of extended clopidogrel therapy were then incorporated into the Sirolimus-Eluting Balloon Expandable Stent in the Treatment of Patients With De Novo Native Coronary Artery Lesions (SIRIUS) and TAXUS-IV cost-effectiveness data. This review found that the incidence of LST ranged from 0.2% to 0.7%. Assuming a base case LST incidence of 0.5%, a cost per death of $20,000, a cost per myocardial infarction of $20,000, and a cost of an additional 2 years of clopidogrel therapy of $2,428 per patient, the costs per revascularization avoided were $15,056 for the SIRIUS trial and $25,210 for the TAXUS-IV trial. The costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were $250,935 and $257,591, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the costs per revascularization avoided varied from $14,618 to $15,830 for the SIRIUS trial and from $24,540 to $26,396 for the TAXUS-IV trial. Similarly, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained varied from $243,638 to $263,840 for the SIRIUS trial and from $250,739 to $269,708 for the TAXUS-IV trial. In conclusion, LST-related adverse events and the need for extended clopidogrel therapy substantially increase the costs associated with the implementation of DES. The inclusion of these costs renders the widespread use of DES not cost effective in the United States in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained and cost per revascularization avoided.",2009-01-04229,19166686,Am J Cardiol,Kristian B Filion,2009,103 / 3,338-44,No,19166686,"Kristian B Filion; Arup Michael Roy; Tara Baboushkin; Stéphane Rinfret; Mark J Eisenberg; Arup Michael Roy; Tara Baboushkin; Stéphane Rinfret; Mark J Eisenberg; Cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents including the economic impact of late stent thrombosis, Am J Cardiol, 2009-Feb-01; 103(3):0002-9149; 338-44",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sirolimus-eluting stents vs. Bare-metal stents,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,250935,United States,2007,313225.19
5571,Cost utility evaluation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to transplant for children with end-stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiac transplantation are recognized to be expensive. METHODS: We performed a cost utility evaluation with a decision model approach, including 75 children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A cohort of patients with end stage heart failure who were offered ECMO bridging was compared with a similar cohort offered only conventional intensive care. Outcome was measured in cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.39 years (interquartile range, 1.83-5.74 years), during which 50 children underwent transplantation, 16 had a period of recovery, and 25 died. ECMO bridging was highly effective (hazard ratio, 0.181; 95% confidence interval, 0.067-0.489; p = 0.001) but exceeded conventional criteria for cost-effectiveness. The reference incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound65,645 per QALY and pound54,284 per life-year gained. Average life expectancy rose from 6.78 to 9.79 years and costs from pound146,398 to pound309,599 per patient with ECMO bridging. The ICER was sensitive to ECMO cost, the long-term transplant survival rate, and quality of life in transplant recipients. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO bridging is effective but expensive. The eligible target population is small, nationally, positively influencing affordability. We strongly support our national policy of mechanical bridge to transplant for suitable children in end stage heart failure. Cost effectiveness could be optimized by: 1) increased availability of organ donors, 2) reduction in mechanical support costs possibly by alternate devices and 3) inclusion of patients most likely to benefit.",2009-01-04240,19134528,J Heart Lung Transplant,Kate L Brown,2009,28 / 1,32-8,No,19134528,"Kate L Brown; Jo Wray; Tracey Lunnon Wood; Anne Marie Mc Mahon; Michael Burch; John Cairns; Jo Wray; Tracey Lunnon Wood; Anne Marie Mc Mahon; Michael Burch; John Cairns; Cost utility evaluation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to transplant for children with end-stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, J Heart Lung Transplant, 2009-Jan; 28(1):1053-2498; 32-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridging for heart transplant vs. No extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridging for heart transplant,Not Stated,18 Years,1 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,65645,United Kingdom,2007,164044.21
5572,Acute appendicitis in young children: cost-effectiveness of US versus CT in diagnosis--a Markov decision analytic model,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of different imaging strategies in the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis by using a decision analytic model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Approval for this retrospective study based on literature review was not required by the institutional Research Ethics Board. A Markov decision model was constructed by using costs, utilities, and probabilities from the literature. The risk of radiation-induced cancer was modeled by using the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report, which is based primarily on data from atomic bomb survivors. The three imaging strategies were ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and US followed by CT if the initial US study was negative. The model simulated the short-term and long-term outcomes of the patients, calculating the average quality-adjusted life span and health care costs. RESULTS: For a single abdominal CT study in a 5-year-old child, the lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer would be 26.1 per 100,000 in female and 20.4 per 100,000 in male patients. In the base-case analysis, US followed by CT was the most costly and most effective strategy, CT was the second-most costly and second-most effective strategy, and US was the least costly and least effective strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of CT to US and of US followed by CT to US were both well below the societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 (in U.S. dollars). The ICER of US followed by CT to CT was less than $10,000 in both male and female patients.

5578,Cost effectiveness of high-risk HPV DNA testing for cervical cancer screening in South Africa,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of several cervical cancer screening strategies utilizing HPV testing in South Africa. METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model of the costs, quality of life, and survival associated with screening and treating cervical cancer and its precursors. Screening strategies evaluated included: 1) conventional cytology, 2) cytology followed by HPV testing for triage of equivocal cytology, 3) HPV testing, 4) HPV testing followed by cytology for triage of HPV-positive women, and 5) co-screening with cytology and HPV testing. Primary outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years saved (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and lifetime risk of cervical cancer. Costs are in 2006 South African Rand (R). RESULTS: In a cohort of 100,000 women, starting at age 30 and screening once every 10 years reduced the lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 13-52% depending on the screening strategy used, at an incremental cost of R13,000-R42,000 per QALY. When strategies were compared incrementally, cytology with HPV triage was less expensive and more effective than screening using cytology alone. HPV testing with the use of cytology triage was a more effective strategy and costs an additional R42,121 per QALY. HPV testing with colposcopy for HPV-positive women was the next most effective option at an incremental cost of R1541 per QALY.

METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model of the costs, quality of life, and survival associated with screening and treating cervical cancer and its precursors. Screening strategies evaluated included: 1) conventional cytology, 2) cytology followed by HPV testing for triage of equivocal cytology, 3) HPV testing, 4) HPV testing followed by cytology for triage of HPV-positive women, and 5) co-screening with cytology and HPV testing. Primary outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years saved (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and lifetime risk of cervical cancer. Costs are in 2006 South African Rand (R). RESULTS: In a cohort of 100,000 women, starting at age 30 and screening once every 10 years reduced the lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 13-52% depending on the screening strategy used, at an incremental cost of R13,000-R42,000 per QALY. When strategies were compared incrementally, cytology with HPV triage was less expensive and more effective than screening using cytology alone.

5587,Health and economic impact associated with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Italy,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the health impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme with a quadrivalent vaccine alongside the existing cervical cancer screening programme in comparison to the current context in Italy. METHODS: A US Markov model was adapted to the Italian context, assuming under base case 80% vaccine coverage rate, lifetime duration of protection in a cohort of girls aged 12 years and discount rates of 1.5% and 3% for health benefits and costs, respectively, and estimating direct medical costs. RESULTS: The HPV vaccination in association with the current screening programme would allow to avoid 1432 cases of cervical cancer (-63.3%) and 513 deaths (-63.4%) compared to screening only, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 9569 euros per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The sensitivity analysis highlighted that this model was robust to all parameters presenting uncertainties as the ICERs ranged from 2,781 euros to 48,122 euros per QALY gained.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes associated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 500/50 microg treatment, salmeterol 50 microg, and fluticasone propionate 500 microg compared to no maintenance treatment in treating COPD from a third-party US payer perspective. The patient population was similar to that of the TORCH clinical trial. Model structure and inputs were obtained from published literature and clinical trial data. All costs are presented in 2006 US dollars. Outcomes included cost per life year (LY) saved and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model robustness. RESULTS: Compared to no maintenance treatment, treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 500/50mug results in a lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $33,865/QALY. Treatment with salmeterol 50 microg was found to have an ICER of $20,797/QALY. These results are robust to changes in input parameters.

5591,Cost-effectiveness of stroke unit care followed by early supported discharge,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke places a significant burden on the economy in England and Wales with the overall societal costs estimated at pound7 billion per annum. There is evidence that both stroke units (SUs) and early supported discharge (ESD) are effective in treating patients with stroke. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of the combination of these 2 strategies and compares it with the care provided in SU without ESD and in a general medical ward without ESD. The objective of this study was to model the long-term (10 years) cost-effectiveness of SU care followed by ESD. METHODS: The study design was cost-effectiveness modeling. The study took place in SUs in the coverage area of the South London Stroke Register, UK. The modeled population was incident ischemic stroke cases (N=844) observed between 2001 and 2006. SU care followed by ESD was compared with SU care without ESD and general medical ward care without ESD. Main outcome measures were health service and societal costs and cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

5594,Costs and cost-effectiveness of different follow-up schedules for detection of occupational hepatitis C virus infection,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the costs and cost-effectiveness (C/E) of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing (alternative-US recommendations) after occupational exposure to HCV with existing follow-up strategies: (1) French, anti-HCV antibodies and alanine transaminase (ALT) activity at months 1, 3 and 6; (2) European, monthly ALT activity for 4 months and anti-HCV antibodies at month 6; (3) and baseline-US, anti-HCV antibodies and ALT activity at month 6. METHODS: A decision tree simulated each strategy for 7300 healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to HCV each year in France, taking into account the impact of early diagnosis on the response to antiviral treatment and the deterioration of HCW quality of life after exposure. RESULTS: For a HCV transmission risk of 0.5% after exposure, the French strategy led to the highest costs/person (181.40 euros) and the baseline-US strategy to the lowest (126.60 euros) (178.50 euros) for alternative-US). The shortest mean time to HCV infection diagnosis (1 month) and the lowest number of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients (1.9/7300 HCWs exposed) was obtained with the alternative-US strategy (vs 6 months and 7.9 CHC, respectively with baseline-US). Compared with the alternative-US, the French strategy was associated with higher costs and lower utilities, and the European with a higher incremental C/E ratio. Compared with the baseline-US strategy, the alternative-US strategy C/E ratio was 2020 euros per quality-adjusted life year saved. CONCLUSION: In HCWs exposed to HCV, a strategy based on early HCV RNA testing shortens the period during which the HCW's wait for his HCV status, leads to lower risk of progression to CHC and is reasonably cost-effective.",2009-01-04467,18824553,Gut,S Deuffic-Burban,2009,58 / 1,105-10,No,18824553,"S Deuffic-Burban; D Abiteboul; F Lot; M Branger; E Bouvet; Y Yazdanpanah; D Abiteboul; F Lot; M Branger; E Bouvet; Y Yazdanpanah; Costs and cost-effectiveness of different follow-up schedules for detection of occupational hepatitis C virus infection, Gut, ; 58(1):0017-5749; 105-10",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Monitoring according to European recommendations vs. Monitoring according to US recommendations,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1676.47,Euro,2006,2703.83

5597,Economic evaluation of etanercept in the management of chronic plaque psoriasis,"BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended that etanercept 25 mg twice weekly (biw) be used in adults with severe plaque psoriasis. However, its economic model did not consider the alternative licensed regimen of etanercept 50 mg biw. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of etanercept 50 mg biw for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, and to explore characteristics of patients who benefited most from 50 mg dosing. METHODS: An economic model was constructed to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The model considered patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who had both Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) of 10 or higher who were unable to take standard systemic therapies. Quality of life gain was estimated from the DLQI responses of patients enrolled in three clinical studies. The model considered expenditure on drugs, monitoring visits, adverse events and inpatient stays. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the U.K. National Health Service over a time period of 10 years. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY for etanercept 50 mg biw compared with no systemic therapy was found to be 6217 pounds sterling (95% confidence interval 5396-7486 pounds sterling). The cost-effectiveness of 50 mg dosing was more attractive in patients with baseline PASI > or = 20 (5163 pounds sterling) or baseline DLQI > or = 20 (4599 pounds sterling).

5600,"""Prehabilitation"" prior to CABG surgery improves physical functioning and depression","BACKGROUND: Many patients demonstrate psychological distress and reduced physical activity before coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Here we evaluated the addition of a brief, cognitive-behavioural intervention (the HeartOp Programme) to routine nurse counselling for people waiting for CABG surgery. METHODS: Randomised controlled trial comparing nurse counselling with the HeartOp programme to routine nurse counselling in 204 patients awaiting first time elective CABG. Primary outcome measures were: anxiety and length of hospital stay; secondary outcome measures were: depression, physical functioning, cardiac misconceptions and cost utility. Measures were collected prior to randomisation and after 8 weeks of their intervention prior to surgery, excepting length of hospital stay which was collected after discharge following surgery. RESULTS: 100 patients were randomised to intervention, 104 to control. At follow-up there were no differences in anxiety or length of hospital stay. There were significant differences in depression (difference=7.79, p=0.008, 95% CI=2.04-13.54), physical functioning (difference=0.82, p=0.001, 95%CI=0.34-1.3) and cardiac misconceptions (difference=2.56, p<0.001, 95%CI=1.64-3.48) in favour of the HeartOp Programme. The only difference to be maintained following surgery was in cardiac misconceptions. The HeartOp Programme was found to have an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of pound 288.83 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse counselling with the HeartOp Programme reduces depression and cardiac misconceptions and improves physical functioning before bypass surgery significantly more than nurse counselling alone and meets the accepted criteria for cost efficacy.",2009-01-04589,18703241,Int J Cardiol,Gill Furze,2009,132 / 1,51-8,No,18703241,"Gill Furze; Jo C Dumville; Jeremy N V Miles; Karen Irvine; David R Thompson; Robert J P Lewin; Jo C Dumville; Jeremy N V Miles; Karen Irvine; David R Thompson; Robert J P Lewin; ""Prehabilitation"" prior to CABG surgery improves physical functioning and depression, Int J Cardiol, 2009-Feb-06; 132(1):0167-5273; 51-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cognitive-behavioural intervention to routine nurse counselling vs. Routine nurse counselling,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,288.33,United Kingdom,2007,720.53
