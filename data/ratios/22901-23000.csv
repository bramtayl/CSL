22901,Cost-effectiveness of patient navigation for breast cancer screening in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program,"OBJECTIVES: Patient navigation (PN) services have been shown to improve cancer screening in disparate populations. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of implementing PN services within the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). METHODS: We adapted a breast cancer simulation model to estimate a population cohort of women aged 40-64 years from the NBCCEDP through their lifetime. We incorporated their screening frequency and screening and diagnostic costs. RESULTS: Within the NBCCEDP, Program with PN (vs. No PN) resulted in a greater number of mammograms per woman (4.23 vs. 4.14), lower lifetime mortality from breast cancer (3.53% vs. 3.61%), and fewer missed diagnostic resolution per woman (0.017 vs. 0.025). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for a Program with PN was $32,531 per quality-adjusted life-years relative to Program with No PN. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating PN services within the NBCCEDP may be a cost-effective way of improving adherence to screening and diagnostic resolution for women who have abnormal results from screening mammography.

22905,Cost-effectiveness analysis of empagliflozin treatment in people with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial,"AIM: In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin therapy reduced cardiovascular death by 38% compared with placebo when added to standard of care. Using the trial results, we created a discrete-event simulation model to assess lifetime health economic outcomes in people with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Time-dependent survival regression analysis was performed on data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME for 10 cardiovascular and renal events (e.g. stroke, heart failure hospitalization, macroalbuminuria, cardiovascular mortality) to capture event rates over time, and interaction between events. Model performance was assessed by comparing predicted and observed outcomes at 3 years. Costs in the United Kingdom (UK) and health utilities were obtained from published literature. Outcomes included cumulative event rates, life-years, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The model predicted an 18% relative increase (by 2.1 life-years) in survival for empagliflozin (14.0 life-years) vs. standard of care (11.9 life-years), attributable to direct treatment effect on cardiovascular mortality, and to indirect effect via reductions in other events. Participants treated with empagliflozin may experience improved quality of life (1.0 QALY) and higher costs ( pound3737/participant), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound4083/QALY. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results to changes in input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Based on extrapolation of EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial data using a participant-level simulation model, empagliflozin in addition to standard of care is projected to be highly cost-effective using UK healthcare costs. The impact in other countries will vary due to differences in drug pricing and accrual of other costs.

22906,Diagnostic imaging in the management of patients with possible cerebral venous thrombosis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: Imaging is crucial for management of patients with possible cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different noninvasive imaging strategies in patients with possible CVT. METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) associated with the following imaging strategies: non-contrast CT (NCCT), NCCT plus CT venography (CTV), routine MRI without vascular imaging (R-MRI), and MRI with venography (MRV). The analysis was performed from a US healthcare perspective. Model input was based on best available and most recent evidence, including outcome data from the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT). Starting age was 37 years; both high and low pre-test probabilities of CVT were evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) estimated model uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, NCCT and CTV were dominant over R-MRI and MRV. CTV led to incremental lifetime QALYs compared with NCCT (23.385 QALYs vs. 23.374 QALYs) at slightly higher lifetime costs ($5210 vs. $5057). In PSA, CTV was the strategy with the highest percentage of cost-effective iterations if willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were higher than $13,750/QALY. Complying with contemporary WTP thresholds, CTV was thus identified as the most cost-effective strategy. When the pre-test probability was set to 50%, CTV was also preferred.

However, considering the high cost of immunotherapy, there is a need to assess its value by considering both efficacy and cost. The current study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab in the first-line setting for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC from the US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the lifetime cost and effectiveness of the combination of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel (ABCP) with the combination of bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel (BCP) and carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and lifetime costs were estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty. Additional subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: ABCP provided an additional 0.413 QALYs (0.460 LYs) and 0.738 QALYs (0.956 LYs), respectively, compared with BCP and CP.

22912,Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an 18-week supervised exercise program in patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation: results from the EXIST study,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a supervised 18-week high-intensity exercise program compared with usual care in patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation. METHODS: One hundred nine patients were randomly assigned to the exercise intervention (n = 54) or the usual care control group (n = 55). Data on cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), handgrip strength, general fatigue, and health-related quality of life (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) were collected at baseline (T0), after completion of the exercise intervention or at a similar time point in the control group (T1) and 12 months later (T2). Cost questionnaires were used to assess societal costs. Long-term effectiveness (at T2) was evaluated using linear mixed model analyses. For the economic evaluation, missing data were imputed using multiple imputation, and data were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: At T2, no statistically significant differences were found between the intervention and control group for VO2peak (0.12; 95%CI - 1.89; 2.14 ml/min/kg), handgrip strength (- 1.08; 95%CI- 2.47; 2.31), and general fatigue (- 0.69; 95%CI - 2.52; 1.14). During 12-months follow-up, no significant between-group differences in QALYs and societal costs were found (QALYs - 0.07; 95%CI - 0.17; 0.04; costs 529; 95%CI - 3205;4452). Intervention costs were euro1340 per patient. For all outcomes, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was low at reasonable values of willingness-to-pay. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for the exercise intervention being effective on physical fitness and fatigue, nor cost-effective from a societal perspective. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was prospectively registered on 27 May 2010 at the Netherlands Trial Register ( NTR2341 ).

22913,Model-based evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of systematic case-finding for COPD in primary care,"INTRODUCTION: ''One-off'' systematic case-finding for COPD using a respiratory screening questionnaire is more effective and cost-effective than routine care at identifying new cases. However, it is not known whether early diagnosis and treatment is beneficial in the longer term. We estimated the long-term cost-effectiveness of a regular case-finding programme in primary care. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of a 3-yearly systematic case-finding programme targeted to ever smokers aged >/=50 years with the current routine diagnostic process in UK primary care. Patient-level data on case-finding pathways was obtained from a large randomised controlled trial. Information on the natural history of COPD and treatment effects was obtained from a linked COPD cohort, UK primary care database and published literature. The discounted lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated from a health service perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of systematic case-finding versus current care was pound16 596 per additional QALY gained, with a 78% probability of cost-effectiveness at a pound20 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. The base case result was robust to multiple one-way sensitivity analyses. The main drivers were response rate to the initial screening questionnaire and attendance rate for the confirmatory spirometry test. DISCUSSION: Regular systematic case-finding for COPD using a screening questionnaire in primary care is likely to be cost-effective in the long-term despite uncertainties in treatment effectiveness. Further knowledge of the natural history of case-found patients and the effectiveness of their management will improve confidence to implement such an approach.",2019-01-32442,31285359,Thorax,Tosin Lambe,2019,74 / 8,730-739,No,31285359,"Tosin Lambe; Remo Panaccione; Jean-Frederic Colombel; Simon P L Travis; Peter Bossuyt; Filip Baert; Tomas Vanasek; Ahmet Danalioglu; Gottfried Novacek; Alessandro Armuzzi; Walter Reinisch; Scott Johnson; Marric Buessing; Ezequiel Neimark; Joel Petersson; Wan-Ju Lee; Geert R D'Haens; Model-based evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of systematic case-finding for COPD in primary care, Thorax, 2019 Aug; 74(8):0040-6376; 730-739",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Screening,3-yearly systematic case-finding program vs. Standard/Usual Care- Routine diagnostic process,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,16596.28,United Kingdom,2015,27700.05
22914,Tight control for Crohn's disease with adalimumab-based treatment is cost-effective: an economic assessment of the CALM trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an inflammatory biomarker and clinical symptom directed tight control strategy (TC) compared with symptom-based clinical management (CM) in patients with Crohn''s disease (CD) naive to immunosuppressants and biologics using a UK public payer perspective. DESIGN: A regression model estimated weekly CD Activity Index (CDAI)-based transition matrices (remission: CDAI <150, moderate: CDAI >/=150 to <300, severe: CDAI >/=300 to <450, very severe: CDAI >/=450) based on the Effect of Tight Control Management on Crohn''s Disease (CALM) trial. A regression predicted hospitalisations. Health utilities and costs were applied to health states. Work productivity was monetised and included in sensitivity analyses. Remission rate, CD-related hospitalisations, adalimumab injections, other direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. RESULTS: Over 48 weeks, TC was associated with a higher clinical remission (CDAI <150) rate (58.2% vs 46.8%), fewer CD-related hospitalisations (0.124 vs 0.297 events per patient) and more injections of adalimumab (40 mg sc) (mean 31.0 vs 24.7) than CM. TC was associated with 0.032 higher QALYs and pound593 higher total medical costs. The ICER was pound18 656 per QALY. The ICER was cost-effective in 57.9% of simulations. TC became dominant, meaning less costly but more effective, when work productivity was included. CONCLUSION: A TC strategy as used in the CALM trial is cost-effective compared with CM. Incorporating costs related to work productivity increases the economic value of TC. Cross-national inferences from this analysis should be made with caution given differences in healthcare systems.

22916,The cost-effectiveness of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids - The Australian healthcare perspective,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a triglyceride lowering medication-icosapent ethyl added on to statin from Australian healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A Markov-model was developed using data from the pivotal trial of icosapent ethyl in a secondary prevention population. Probabilities of CVD events were derived and extrapolated from the published Kaplan-Meier curve using a valid algorithm. Management cost of CVD, health-related quality of life, and background non-CVD mortality were extracted from publicly available sources. Acquisition cost of icosapent ethyl from the United States was used in the current analysis. Australian patients with histories of CVD were modelled for a 25year time horizon and costs and benefits were discounted. Sensitivity analyses (SA) were undertaken. Value of perfect information (VPI) was quantified. RESULTS: Treatment with icosapent ethyl was associated with both higher costs and benefits (i.e. quality-adjusted life year [QALY] and life year [LY]), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD59,036/QALY or AUD54,358/LY. Using the often quoted willingness-to-pay (WTP)/QALY of AUD50,000/QALY, icosapent ethyl was not considered cost-effective. SA showed that time horizon, drug cost, and discount rate were the key drivers of the ICER. Total monetary VPI for icosapent ethyl was over AUD15 million over 5years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with established CVD in whom level of triglycerides is high would benefit from the treatment using icosapent ethyl, however, it is not a cost-effective from an Australian healthcare system perspective.

Given recent changes in the evidence of efficacy, herd effects and price, a CEA of PCVs should be revisited. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of PCV10 and PCV13 compared to no PCV vaccination in Thai children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed under a societal perspective with a lifetime horizon. Inputs were derived from a comprehensive literature review. Costs were calculated using the Thai National Electronic Database and converted to the year 2017 value. All costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3%. The findings were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Thai Baht (THB) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was generated with the cost-effectiveness threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY. RESULTS: Base-case analysis of 2+1 dose schedule and five-year protection, with no consideration of herd effect showed that ICER for PCV10 was 170,437 THB/QALY, while ICER for PCV13 was 73,674 THB/QALY. With consideration of herd effect, both PCV10 and PCV13 had lower costs and higher QALYs compared to no PCV vaccination.

22919,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Abiraterone Acetate versus Docetaxel in the management of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: Hong Kong's perspective,"BACKGROUND: Several randomized control trials (RCTs) have showed that adding either abiraterone acetate (AA) or docetaxel (D) to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients (mCSPC). Yet, the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options has not been fully compared under Hong Kong''s setting. This cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) serves as the first study in Hong Kong to compare the economic value of these two combinations ADT + AA vs. ADT + D. METHODS: A deterministic Markov model is used to project cost-effectiveness of each treatment until death. Survival curves for progression/death were extracted and digitized from the five RCTs (CHAARTED, LATITUDE, two STAMPEDE (2016/2017), and GETUG-AFU15). Clinically significant adverse events (AEs) were modeled; utility values were obtained from the literature. Primary outcomes were the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We used the societal perspective from Hong Kong and considered three times of local gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) as the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (i.e., US$138,649). We estimated the break-even cost of AA in case ADT + AA is not a cost-effective strategy under this WTP threshold. While considering the standard AA dosage (1000 mg) as the main analysis, we also examined the potential impact of the low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy. RESULTS: Integrating simulations with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ADT + D returns 0.79 (median; 95% credible interval 0.56-0.97) QALY with an ICER of US$14,397/QALY ($7824-22,632) compared to ADT-alone. A head-to-head comparison indicates that ADT + AA further gains 0.79 (0.45-1.17) QALY but with an ICER of $361,439/QALY ($260,615-599,683) when compared to ADT + D. Considering three times of GDPpc as WTP threshold, ADT + D is more cost-effective in all simulations; while ADT + AA is more cost-effective than ADT + D only if the cost of AA is reduced by at least 63%. The low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy is potentially cost-effective when it generates equivalent efficacy as the standard dosage (1000 mg).

DESIGN: A single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Recovery rehabilitation unit of Harue Hospital, Japan. SUBJECTS: The trial included 72 clients (mean (SD): age, 74.64 (9.51) years; Functional Independence Measure score, 98.26 (15.27)) with cerebral or spinal disease or musculoskeletal disease. INTERVENTIONS: Clients were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group, who received occupational therapy with adjustment of the challenge-skill balance, and the control group who received conventional occupational therapy. Time from admission to discharge was considered the implementation period; the final evaluation was conducted at three months after discharge. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was subjective quality of life (Ikigai-9). Secondary outcomes were the health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5 Dimensions, Five Levels (EQ-5D-5L)), the Flow State Scale for Occupational Tasks, and the Functional Independence Measure. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using total cost and quality-adjusted life-year based on the EQ-5D-5L. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the experimental and control groups with respect to the Ikigai-9 score (P = 0.008) and EQ-5D-5L (P = 0.038), and the effect sizes were 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-1.24) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.14-1.10), respectively. No significant between-group differences in other outcomes were observed, for example, the Functional Independence Measure score improved in both experimental and control groups (119.80 (5.50) and 118.84 (6.97), respectively.

22922,"Cost-effectiveness of pharmacological fracture prevention for osteoporosis as prescribed in clinical practice in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom","This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological fracture prevention as prescribed in the five largest European countries (EU5) using the IOF reference cost-effectiveness model. Pharmacological fracture prevention as prescribed in clinical practice was cost-saving (provided more QALYs at lower costs) compared to no treatment in each of the EU5. PURPOSE: To estimate the real-world cost-effectiveness of pharmacological fracture prevention as prescribed in the five largest European countries by population size: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK) (collectively EU5). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed sales data on osteoporosis drugs in each of the EU5 to derive a hypothetical intervention that corresponds to the mix of osteoporosis medication prescribed in clinical practice. The costs for this treatment mix were obtained directly from the sales data, and the efficacy of the treatment mix was estimated by weighing the treatment-specific fracture risk reductions from a published meta-analysis. Subsequently, we estimated the cost-effectiveness using costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of the intervention compared to no treatment in each of the EU5 using the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) reference cost-effectiveness model. The model population comprised postmenopausal women, mean age 72 years with established osteoporosis (T-score </= - 2.5) among whom 23.6% had a prevalent vertebral fracture. The model was populated with country-specific data from the literature.

22927,Long-term Cost-effectiveness of Insulin Degludec Versus Insulin Glargine U100 in the UK: Evidence from the Basal-bolus Subgroup of the DEVOTE Trial (DEVOTE 16),"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec (degludec) versus insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) in basal-bolus regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high cardiovascular (CV) risk based on the DEVOTE CV outcomes trial. METHODS: A microsimulation model, informed by clinical outcomes from the subgroup of patients using basal-bolus insulin therapy in DEVOTE (NCT01959529) and by the UKPDS Outcomes Model 2 risk equations, was used to model direct costs (2018 GBP) and effectiveness outcomes [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] with degludec versus glargine U100 over a 40-year time horizon. The model captured the development of eight diabetes-related complications, death, severe hypoglycemia and insulin dosing. This analysis was conducted from the perspective of National Health Service (NHS) England. RESULTS: Treatment with degludec versus glargine U100 in basal-bolus regimens was associated with improved clinical outcomes at a higher cost per patient [incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER): pound14,956 GBP/QALY]. Degludec remained cost effective versus glargine U100 in all exploratory sensitivity analyses, with ICERs below the widely accepted willingness-to-pay threshold, although the result was most sensitive to assumptions regarding the persistence of treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term modeling analysis suggested that degludec was cost effective (from the perspective of NHS England) versus glargine U100 in basal-bolus regimens for patients with T2D at high CV risk.

INTERVENTION: Unilateral and sequential CI were compared with hearing aids (HA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated as costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained (in CHF/QALY), for individual age and sex combinations in relation to two different willingness to pay thresholds. 1 CHF (Swiss franc) is equivalent to 1.01 USD. RESULTS: When a threshold of 50,000 CHF per QALY is applied, unilateral CI in comparison to HA is cost-effective up to an age of 91 for women and 89 for men. Sequential CI in comparison to HA is cost-effective up to an age of 87 for women and 85 for men. If a more contemporary threshold of 100,000 CHF per QALY is applied, sequential CI in comparison to unilateral CI is cost-effective up to an age of 80 for women and 78 for men.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis in an adapted Markov model. SETTING: Adults with profound postlingual hearing loss in a ""high income"" country. INTERVENTION: Unilateral and sequential CI were compared with hearing aids (HA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated as costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained (in CHF/QALY), for individual age and sex combinations in relation to two different willingness to pay thresholds. 1 CHF (Swiss franc) is equivalent to 1.01 USD. RESULTS: When a threshold of 50,000 CHF per QALY is applied, unilateral CI in comparison to HA is cost-effective up to an age of 91 for women and 89 for men. Sequential CI in comparison to HA is cost-effective up to an age of 87 for women and 85 for men. If a more contemporary threshold of 100,000 CHF per QALY is applied, sequential CI in comparison to unilateral CI is cost-effective up to an age of 80 for women and 78 for men.

22952,Is Reclassification of the Oral Contraceptive Pill from Prescription to Pharmacist-Only Cost Effective? Application of an Economic Evaluation Approach to Regulatory Decisions,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Unplanned pregnancies can lead to poorer maternal and child health outcomes. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration committee rejected reclassifying a range of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) from prescription to pharmacist-only medicines in 2015, mainly based on safety concerns. Improving access to OCPs may encourage some women to use contraceptives or switch from other contraceptive methods. However, some adverse events may increase and some women may stop using condoms, increasing their risk of sexually transmitted infections. This study aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness of reclassifying OCPs from prescription to pharmacist-only. PERSPECTIVE: Healthcare system. SETTING: Australian primary care. METHODS: A Markov model was used to synthesise data from a variety of sources. The model included all Australian women aged 15-49 years (N = 5,644,701). The time horizon was 35 years. Contraceptive use before reclassification was estimated using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, while survey data informed use after reclassification. Health outcomes included pregnancies, pregnancy outcomes (live birth, miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and abortion), sexually transmitted infections, adverse events (venous thromboembolism, depression, myocardial infarction and stroke), ovarian cancer cases and quality-adjusted life-years. Costs included those related to general practitioner and specialist consultations, contraceptives and other medicines, pharmacist time, hospitalisations and adverse events. All costs were reported in 2016 Australian Dollars. A 5% discount rate was applied to health outcomes and costs. RESULTS: Reclassifying OCPs resulted in 85.70 million quality-adjusted life-years experienced and costs of $46,910.14 million over 35 years, vs. 85.68 million quality-adjusted life-years experienced and costs of $50,274.95 million with OCPs remaining prescription-only.

22953,Is Reclassification of the Oral Contraceptive Pill from Prescription to Pharmacist-Only Cost Effective? Application of an Economic Evaluation Approach to Regulatory Decisions,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Unplanned pregnancies can lead to poorer maternal and child health outcomes. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration committee rejected reclassifying a range of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) from prescription to pharmacist-only medicines in 2015, mainly based on safety concerns. Improving access to OCPs may encourage some women to use contraceptives or switch from other contraceptive methods. However, some adverse events may increase and some women may stop using condoms, increasing their risk of sexually transmitted infections. This study aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness of reclassifying OCPs from prescription to pharmacist-only. PERSPECTIVE: Healthcare system. SETTING: Australian primary care. METHODS: A Markov model was used to synthesise data from a variety of sources. The model included all Australian women aged 15-49 years (N = 5,644,701). The time horizon was 35 years. Contraceptive use before reclassification was estimated using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, while survey data informed use after reclassification. Health outcomes included pregnancies, pregnancy outcomes (live birth, miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and abortion), sexually transmitted infections, adverse events (venous thromboembolism, depression, myocardial infarction and stroke), ovarian cancer cases and quality-adjusted life-years. Costs included those related to general practitioner and specialist consultations, contraceptives and other medicines, pharmacist time, hospitalisations and adverse events. All costs were reported in 2016 Australian Dollars. A 5% discount rate was applied to health outcomes and costs. RESULTS: Reclassifying OCPs resulted in 85.70 million quality-adjusted life-years experienced and costs of $46,910.14 million over 35 years, vs. 85.68 million quality-adjusted life-years experienced and costs of $50,274.95 million with OCPs remaining prescription-only. Thus, reclassifying OCPs was more effective and cost saving. However, a sensitivity analysis found that more research on the probability of pregnancy in women not using contraception and not trying to conceive is needed. CONCLUSION: Reclassifying OCPs is likely to be considered cost effective by Australian decision makers.",2019-01-32501,31069781,Pharmacoeconomics,Mutsa Gumbie,2019,37 / 8,1049-1064,Yes,31069781,"Mutsa Gumbie; Emily S Tonorezos; Jennifer S Ford; Linwei Wang; Kirsten K Ness; Yutaka Yasui; Wendy Leisenring; Charles A Sklar; Leslie L Robison; Kevin C Oeffinger; Paul C Nathan; Gregory T Armstrong; Kevin Krull; Lee W Jones; Mark Monahan; Sue Jowett; Alecia Nickless; Marloes Franssen; Sabrina Grant; Sheila Greenfield; F D Richard Hobbs; James Hodgkinson; Jonathan Mant; Richard J McManus; D Wastlund; A A Moraitis; J G Thornton; J Sanders; I R White; P Brocklehurst; Gcs Smith; Ecf Wilson; Thomas Heiberg Brix; Charlotte Ferlov-Schwensen; Marianne Thvilum; Laszlo Hegedus; Laurie A Hiemstra; Sarah Kerslake; Xue Song; Antoine C El Khoury; Matthew Brouillette; David Smith; Kruti Joshi; D Kinnear; L Allan; J Morrison; J Finlayson; A Sherriff; L Macpherson; A Henderson; L Ward; M Muir; S A Cooper; Lluis Puig; Lourdes Rodriguez Fernandez-Freire; Ramon Burgos-Pol; Ismael Gomez; Carmen Peral; Susana Gomez; Francisco Jose Rebollo Laserna; Courtney K Blackwell; Amy J Elliott; Jody Ganiban; Julie Herbstman; Kelly Hunt; Christopher B Forrest; Carlos A Jr Camargo; program collaborators for Enviro; Anu Aronen; Janne Aittoniemi; Reetta Huttunen; Anssi Nikkola; Jussi Nikkola; Olli Limnell; Isto Nordback; Juhani Sand; Johanna Laukkarinen; Sorrel T Burden; Debra J Jones; Matthew Gittins; Joanne Ablett; Michael Taylor; Christopher Mountford; Jonathan Tyrrell-Price; Clare Donnellan; Fiona Leslie; Tim Bowling; Simon Gabe; Farooq Rahman; Stephen P McKenna; Jeanette Wilburn; Alice Heaney; Philip Allan; Simon Lal; Halima Amjad; Scott H Snyder; Jennifer L Wolff; Esther Oh; Quincy M Samus; Marieke J Krimphove; Alexander P Cole; David F Friedlander; David-Dan Nguyen; Stuart R Lipsitz; Paul L Nguyen; Kerry L Kilbridge; Adam S Kibel; Luis A Kluth; Quoc-Dien Trinh; Gaurav Jyani; Shankar Prinja; Atul Ambekar; Pankaj Bahuguna; Rajesh Kumar; Manel Fa-Binefa; Albert Clara; Silvia Perez-Fernandez; Maria Grau; Irene R Degano; Ruth Marti-Lluch; Rafel Ramos; Jaume Marrugat; Roberto Elosua; Franz Schaefer; Djalila Mekahli; Francesco Emma; Rodney D Gilbert; Detlef Bockenhauer; Melissa A Cadnapaphornchai; Lily Shi; Ann Dandurand; Kimberly Sikes; Susan E Shoaf; Ross Mandeville; Arvin Wali; Charlie Park; Erik Groessl; Francis O Walker; Michael S Cartwright; Ashutosh Hardikar; Thomas H Marwick; Gregory F Guzauskas; Erqi L Pollom; Volker W Stieber; Bruce C M Wang; Louis P Jr Garrison; Yangyang Liu; Toshiharu Mitsuhashi; Michiyo Yamakawa; Megumi Sasai; Toshihide Tsuda; Hiroyuki Doi; Jun Hamada; Theresa A Lawrie; Ewelina Rogozinska; Pauline Sobiesuo; Joshua P Vogel; Laura Ternent; Olufemi T Oladapo; Benedikt Schoser; Andreas Hahn; Emma James; Digant Gupta; Matthew Gitlin; Suyash Prasad; Addison Davis; Richard Liu; Jessica A Kerr; Melissa Wake; Anneke Grobler; Markus Juonala; Mengjiao Liu; Louise Baur; David Burgner; Kate Lycett; D R M Smith; K B Pouwels; S Hopkins; N R Naylor; T Smieszek; J V Robotham; Azusa Nagao; Nobuaki Suzuki; Hideyuki Takedani; Naoya Yamasaki; Yushi Chikasawa; Akihiro Sawada; Takeshi Kanematsu; Masanori Nojima; Satoshi Higasa; Kagehiro Amano; Katsuyuki Fukutake; Teruhisa Fujii; Tadashi Matsushita; Takashi Suzuki; Marie Gronkjaer; Trine Flensborg-Madsen; Merete Osler; Holger J Sorensen; Ulrik Becker; Erik L Mortensen; Merja K Laine; Niko S Wasenius; Hannes Lohi; Mika Simonen; Katriina Tiira; Johan G Eriksson; Minna K Salonen; Is Reclassification of the Oral Contraceptive Pill from Prescription to Pharmacist-Only Cost Effective?

22954,Cost-Utility Analysis of Incobotulinumtoxin-A Compared With Conventional Therapy in the Management of Post-Stroke Spasticity in Romania,"Objectives: In Romania, the strokes'' incidence is of 61,500 per year and improving upper limb function is the essence in rehabilitation after a stroke to maximize the patient quality of life and reduce disability. In this study, it is compared the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of post-stroke upper limb spasticity with incobotulinumtoxin-A (INCO), with or without electromyographic control, against the conventional therapy programme alone (CON). Methods: A Markov state transition model was developed to effectuate a cost-utility analysis (CUA). Measurements of health-related quality of life were derived from relevant clinical trials. Utility values for quality of life by response status were derived from the Short-Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey data from a published study. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of INCO (fixed, every 12 weeks) against CON was calculated in Ron per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for both therapies. Costs and outcomes were discounted using different scenarios at 3% and 5% per year with a time horizon of 3 and 5 years because Romanian legislative norms don''t specify the discount rates and time horizon for pharmacoeconomic analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were managed on the base case with distributions attributed to the frequency of repeat dosing and utility valuation of the responder and the non-responder for health utilities derived from both mental and physical health state. Results: Compared with CON, in all 4 scenarios, therapy with INCO had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than 950 Euro per QALY gained (1 Euro = 4.7 Ron). INCO proved to be more favorable treatment option than CON in the treatment of upper limb spasticity in Romania. Despite costs being higher for patients treated with INCO, this treatment has more advantageous Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio. Conclusions: This therapy should be taken into account when considering rehabilitation options because it is highly cost-effective at < EURO 1,000/QALY gained, a very low WTP (Willingness To Pay) threshold.

22958,Cost-Utility of Antimicrobial Prophylaxis for Treatment of Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux,"Objective: Antimicrobial prophylaxis for children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) reduces recurrences of urinary tract infection (UTI) but requires daily antimicrobials for extended periods. We used a cost-utility model to evaluate whether the benefits of antimicrobial prophylaxis outweigh its risks and, if so, to investigate whether the benefits and risks vary according to grade of VUR. Methods: We compared the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in four treatment strategies in children aged <6 years diagnosed with VUR after a first UTI, considering these treatment strategies: (1) prophylaxis for all children with VUR, (2) prophylaxis for children with Grade III or Grade IV VUR, (3) prophylaxis for children with Grade IV VUR, and (4) no prophylaxis. Costs and effectiveness were estimated over the patient''s lifetime. We used $100,000/QALY gained as the threshold for considering a treatment strategy cost effective. Results: Based on current data and plausible ranges to account for data uncertainty, prophylaxis of children with Grades IV VUR costs $37,903 per QALY gained. Treating children with Grade III and IV VUR costs an additional $302,024 per QALY gained. Treating children with all grades of VUR costs an additional $339,740 per QALY gained.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a regression equation-based cost-effectiveness model, using individual patient data from three randomized control trials (FIX-HF-5 Phases 1 and 2, and FIX-HF-5C) to populate the majority of parameters. A series of regression equations predicted NYHA class over time, mortality, all-cause hospitalization rates, and health-related quality of life. We conducted the analysis in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case, modelling costs from an English National Health Service perspective, and considering outcomes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a patient lifetime perspective. Our base case analysis produced an incremental cost per additional QALY of GBP22 988 (euro25 750) when comparing Optimizer + SoC to SoC alone. This result was not sensitive to parameter uncertainty but was sensitive to the time horizon over which costs and QALYs were captured and the duration over which a survival benefit with Optimizer + SoC can be assumed to apply. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac contractility modulation is likely to be cost-effective in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, NYHA III, and narrow QRS, provided that the treatment benefit can be maintained beyond the duration of the existing clinical trial follow-up.

Methods: A Markov model was constructed to simulate a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 females aged 30-59 years in a 20-year period. Screening strategies included liquid-based cytology (LBC) every three years, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing every three and five years, respectively, and a combination of HPV DNA testing and LBC (HPV+LBC) every three and five years, respectively. Model outcomes included cumulative incidence over 20 years, cumulative risk of cervical cancer, costs, life year saved (LYS), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and benefits. The cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost-utility ratios (CURs), and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) were used as outcomes in the health economic evaluation analysis. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the stability of the results. Results: The cumulative incidence of the five screening strategies ranged from 833.02 to 1,158.07 cases per 100,000 females. HPV DNA testing was most effective in reducing the cumulative risk of cervical cancer, saving life years and QALYs and gaining benefits. The CERs of HPV DNA testing every three and five years, and LBC every three years were considered to be very cost-effective if they were below China''s GDP per capita. The CERs of HPV+LBC were considered to be cost-effective if they were below three times GDP per capita.

22969,Cost-Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery versus Medication Therapy for Obese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in China: A Markov Analysis,"Aims/Introduction: The present study estimated the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus medication therapy for the management of recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in obese patients from a Chinese health insurance payer perspective. Materials and Methods: A Markov model was established to compare the 40-year time costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between bariatric surgery and medication therapy. The health-care costs in the bariatric surgery group, proportion of patients in each group with remission of diabetes, and state transition probabilities were calculated based on observed resource utilization from the hospital information system (HIS). The corresponding costs in the medication therapy group were derived from the medical insurance database. QALYs were estimated from previous literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted 5% annually. Results: In the base case analysis, bariatric surgery was more effective and less costly than medication therapy. Over a 40-year time horizon, the mean discounted costs were 86,366.55 RMB per surgical therapy patient and 113,235.94 CNY per medication therapy patient. The surgical and medication therapy patients lived 13.46 and 10.95 discounted QALYs, respectively. Bariatric surgery was associated with a mean health-care savings of 26,869.39 CNY and 2.51 additional QALYs per patient compared to medication therapy. Uncertainty around the parameter values was tested comprehensively in sensitivity analyses, and the results were robust. Conclusions: Bariatric surgery is a dominant intervention over a 40-year time horizon, which leads to significant cost savings to the health insurance payer and increases in health benefits for the management of recently diagnosed T2DM in obese patients in China.",2019-01-32557,31930144,J Diabetes Res,Bin Wan,2019,2019 /,1341963,No,31930144,"Bin Wan; Nan Fang; Wei Guan; Haixia Ding; Ying Wang; Xin Ge; Hui Liang; Xin Li; Yiyang Zhan; Cost-Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery versus Medication Therapy for Obese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in China: A Markov Analysis, J Diabetes Res, 2019; 2019():2314-6753; 1341963",QALY,China,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Surgical",bariatric surgery therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conventional medication therapy group,Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,5.00,5.00,-10704.94,China,2015,-1860.53
22970,Cost-effectiveness of a Medical Care Coordination Program for People With HIV in Los Angeles County,"Background: The Los Angeles County (LAC) Division of HIV and STD Programs implemented a medical care coordination (MCC) program to address the medical and psychosocial service needs of people with HIV (PWH) at risk for poor health outcomes. Methods: Our objective was to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the MCC program. Using the CEPAC-US model populated with clinical characteristics and costs observed from the MCC program, we projected lifetime clinical and economic outcomes for a cohort of high-risk PWH under 2 strategies: (1) No MCC and (2) a 2-year MCC program. The cohort was stratified by acuity using social and clinical characteristics. Baseline viral suppression was 33% in both strategies; 2-year suppression was 33% with No MCC and 57% with MCC. The program cost $2700/person/year. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime medical costs, and cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness threshold for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results: With MCC, life expectancy increased from 10.07 to 10.94 QALYs, and costs increased from $311 300 to $335 100 compared with No MCC (ICER, $27 400/QALY). ICERs for high/severe, moderate, and low acuity were $30 500/QALY, $25 200/QALY, and $77 400/QALY.

Methods: Our objective was to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the MCC program. Using the CEPAC-US model populated with clinical characteristics and costs observed from the MCC program, we projected lifetime clinical and economic outcomes for a cohort of high-risk PWH under 2 strategies: (1) No MCC and (2) a 2-year MCC program. The cohort was stratified by acuity using social and clinical characteristics. Baseline viral suppression was 33% in both strategies; 2-year suppression was 33% with No MCC and 57% with MCC. The program cost $2700/person/year. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime medical costs, and cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness threshold for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results: With MCC, life expectancy increased from 10.07 to 10.94 QALYs, and costs increased from $311 300 to $335 100 compared with No MCC (ICER, $27 400/QALY). ICERs for high/severe, moderate, and low acuity were $30 500/QALY, $25 200/QALY, and $77 400/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, MCC remained cost-effective if 2-year viral suppression was >/=39% even if MCC costs increased 3-fold.

22974,Cost-effectiveness of treating hepatitis C in Seychelles,"Introduction: approximately eighty million people around the world are living with hepatitis C, and 700,000 people die every year, due to hepatitis C related complications. In Seychelles, a total of 777 cases of hepatitis C were reported from 2002 to 2016, but up to mid of 2016, the cases were not being treated. Treatment with Harvoni, a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV), is now being offered on the condition that the patient does not, or has stopped, injecting drugs. This paper is the first to establish the cost effectiveness of treating all cases of hepatitis C in Seychelles with Harvoni, as compared to no treatment. Methods: data extracted from literature was used to populate an economic model to calculate cost-effectiveness from Seychelles'' government perspective. The model structure was also informed by the systematic review and an accompanying grading of economic models using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard (CHEERS) checklist. A Markov model was developed, employing a lifetime horizon and costs and benefits were analysed from a payer''s perspective and combined into incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: the direct-acting antiviral (DAA), Harvoni, was found to be cost-saving in Seychelles hepatitis C virus (HCV) cohort, as compared to no treatment, with an ICER of euro 753.65/QALY.

22983,Cost-effectiveness of a Pharmacogenomic Test for Stratified Isoniazid Dosing in Treatment of Active Tuberculosis,"BACKGROUND: There is marked interindividual variability in metabolism and resulting toxicity and effectiveness of drugs used for tuberculosis treatment. For isoniazid, mutations in the N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) gene explain over 88% of pharmacokinetic variability. However, weight-based dosing remains the norm globally. The potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomic-guided therapy (PGT) is unknown. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model to project lifetime costs and benefits of isoniazid PGT for drug-susceptible tuberculosis in Brazil, South Africa, and India. PGT was modeled to reduce isoniazid toxicity among slow NAT2 acetylators and reduce treatment failure among rapid acetylators. The genotyping test was assumed to cost the same as the GeneXpert test. The main outcomes were costs (2018 USD), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In Brazil, PGT gained 19 discounted life years (23 QALYs) and cost $11,064 per 1,000 patients, a value of $476 per QALY gained. In South Africa, PGT gained 15 life years (19 QALYs) and cost $33,182 per 1,000 patients, a value of $1,780 per QALY gained. In India, PGT gained 20 life years (24 QALYs) and cost $13,195 per 1,000 patients, a value of $546 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses showed the cost-effectiveness to be robust to all input parameters.

22986,Model-Based Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Panitumumab Plus FOLFIRI for the Second-Line Treatment of Patients with Wild-Type Ras Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"INTRODUCTION: The NCT00339183 trial demonstrated that adding panitumumab to fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a second-line therapy of wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) increases the median progression-free survival (PFS). Nevertheless, panitumumab is not yet approved in China, and the costs and outcomes of the therapy are still unclear. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of this intervention from the perspective of Chinese health care systems by constructing two pricing scenarios for panitumumab. Scenario 1: Pricing is based on the price of a similar product (cetuximab) in China. Scenario 2: We estimated the value-based price. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was created based on the results of the NCT00339183 trial, which evaluated panitumumab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI. The model simulated the disease progression. We calculated medical costs from the perspectives of the Chinese health care systems. The primary outcome measures were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: In scenario 1, compared with FOLFIRI alone, FOLFIRI with panitumumab arm had an ICER of yen1,539,988/QALY. The most influential factors were the mean overall survival (OS), utility before progression and cost of panitumumab. The probability of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI being cost-effective in China was 0% when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was yen193,932/QALY. In scenario 2, when the cost of panitumumab was assumed to be yen4032.61 or yen5218.96 per cycle, the ICERs approximated the WTP thresholds of yen193,932/QALY or yen420,633/QALY, respectively. In this value-based pricing scenario, panitumumab plus FOLFIRI is estimated to be cost-effective. CONCLUSION: We construct two pricing scenarios in China. In scenario 1, panitumumab plus FOLFIRI as a second-line therapy of mCRC provided an incremental benefit, but simultaneously increased costs (at the current price) even further. In scenario 2, when the value-based price was adopted, panitumumab plus FOLFIRI was estimated to be cost-effective.

22989,Identification of the Most Cost-effective Position of Vedolizumab Among the Available Biologic Drugs for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are limited data on the most cost-effective sequencing of biologics for ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: We utilized Markov modelling to identify the most cost-effective position for vedolizumab among biologics for steroid-dependent UC with a base-case of a 35-year-old male. We assessed three treatment algorithms, with vedolizumab use prior to an initial anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) and azathioprine (Algorithm 1), prior to a second anti-TNF and azathioprine (Algorithm 2), and prior to colectomy (Algorithm 3). The initial anti-TNF could be either infliximab or adalimumab. Transition probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life year estimates were derived from published estimates, Medicare, and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Primary analyses included 100 trials of 100,000 individuals over 1 year with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess our findings. RESULTS: From a population perspective, when both infliximab and adalimumab are available, vedolizumab was preferred as the first biologic if >/=14% of initial anti-TNF use was adalimumab. If infliximab is the primary biologic, vedolizumab use after infliximab (Algorithm 2) and prior to adalimumab was the most cost-effective strategy. All models were sensitive to biologic pricing. CONCLUSION: This simulation demonstrated that the most cost-effective strategy in UC depends on the proportion of patients using adalimumab as the initial anti-TNF. If adalimumab was >/=14%, vedolizumab was preferred as the first biologic.

22991,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of screening for hepatitis C virus infection in Japan,"AIM: The management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has changed with the advent of interferon (IFN) free treatment and the declining prevalence of HCV infection, which may impact the cost-effectiveness of the screening. We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of three screening strategies in Japanese general population: no screening, screening plus IFN-based therapy, and screening plus IFN-free therapy. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic Markov model for screening intervention and natural history of HCV. Model parameters were derived from published literature. A lifetime horizon and the healthcare payer perspective were taken. Sub-analyses included high screening scenario with improved rates of screening and attending referral in addition to heterogeneity analysis by age subgroup. RESULTS: In the base case, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the Japanese general population aged 40-89 years was JPY 1,124,482 and JPY 1,085,183 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for screening plus IFN-free therapy compared to no screening and screening plus IFN-based therapy, respectively. Screening plus IFN-free therapy remained cost-effective below JPY 5,000,000/QALY gained in sensitivity analyses. ICERs were lower in the younger population. Nearly 0.2% of HCV-related deaths were avoided by 1.5% of the general population screened followed by IFN-free therapy relative to no screening; the impact was greater with improved rates of screening and attending referral.

22994,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the microprocessor-controlled knee C-Leg in transfemoral amputees with and without diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND: The safe use of a prosthesis in activities of daily living is key for transfemoral amputees. However, the number of falls varies significantly between different prosthetic device types. This study aims to compare medical and economic consequences of falls in transfemoral amputees who use the microprocessor-controlled knee joint C-Leg with patients who use non-microprocessor-controlled (mechanical) knee joints (NMPK). The main objectives of the analysis are to investigate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of C-Legs in transfemoral amputees with diabetes mellitus (DM) and without DM in Germany. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed that took into account the effects of prosthesis type on the risk of falling and fall-related medical events. Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were performed separately for transfemoral amputees with and without DM. The study took the perspective of the statutory health insurance (SHI). Input parameters were derived from the published literature. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to investigate the impact of changes in individual input parameter values on model outcomes and to explore parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: C-Legs reduced the rate of fall-related hospitalizations from 134 to 20 per 1000 person years (PY) in amputees without DM and from 146 to 23 per 1000 PY in amputees with DM. In addition, the C-Leg prevented 15 or 14 fall-related death per 1000 PY. Over a time horizon of 25 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 16,123 Euro per quality-adjusted life years gained (QALY) for amputees without DM and 20,332 Euro per QALY gained for amputees with DM. For the period of 2020-2024, the model predicted an increase in SHI expenditures of 98 Mio Euro (53 Mio Euro in prosthesis users without DM and 45 Mio Euro in prosthesis users with DM) when all new prosthesis users received C-Legs instead of NMPKs and 50% of NMPK user whose prosthesis wore out switched to C-Legs. Results of the PSA showed moderate uncertainty and a probability of 97-99% that C-Legs are cost-effective at an ICER threshold of 40,000 Euro ( approximately German GDP per capita in 2018) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Results of the study suggest that the C-Leg provides substantial additional health benefits compared with NMPKs and is likely to be cost-effective in transfemoral amputees with DM as well as in amputees without DM at an ICER threshold of 40,000 Euro per QALY gained.",2020-01-30873,31897813,Eur J Health Econ,Alexander Kuhlmann,2020,/,,Yes,31897813,"Alexander Kuhlmann; Zhaoyan Chen; Mei Zhan; Fangyuan Tian; Ting Xu; Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the microprocessor-controlled knee C-Leg in transfemoral amputees with and without diabetes mellitus, Eur J Health Econ, 2020 Jan 4; ():1618-7598",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Medical Device,microprocessor-controlled knee joint c-leg vs. non-microprocessor-controlled (mechanical) knee joints (NMPK,without diabetes mellitus,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,16123,Euro,2019,18282.64

22996,Cost-effectiveness of dual-energy CT versus multiphasic single-energy CT and MRI for characterization of incidental indeterminate renal lesions,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DECT versus multiphasic CT and MRI for characterizing small incidentally detected indeterminate renal lesions using a Markov Monte Carlo decision-analytic model. BACKGROUND: Incidental renal lesions are commonly encountered due to the increasing utilization of medical imaging and the increasing prevalence of renal lesions with age. Currently recommended imaging modalities to further characterize incidental indeterminate renal lesions have some inherent drawbacks. Single-phase DECT may overcome these limitations, but its cost-effectiveness remains uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic (Markov) model was constructed to estimate life expectancy and lifetime costs for otherwise healthy 64-year-old patients with small (</= 4 cm) incidentally detected, indeterminate renal lesions on routine imaging (e.g., ultrasound or single-phase CT). Three strategies for evaluating renal lesions for enhancement were compared: multiphase SECT (e.g., true unenhanced and nephrographic phase), multiphasic MRI, and single-phase DECT (nephrographic phase in dual-energy mode). The model incorporated modality-specific diagnostic test performance, incidence, and prevalence of incidental renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), effectiveness, costs, and health outcomes. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to identify strategy preference at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, expected mean costs per patient undergoing characterization of incidental renal lesions were $2567 for single-phase DECT, $3290 for multiphasic CT, and $3751 for multiphasic MRI. Associated quality-adjusted life-years were the highest for single-phase DECT at 0.962, for multiphasic MRI it was 0.940, and was the lowest for multiphasic CT at 0.925.

Methods: A two-part cost-effectiveness model comprising of a 1-year decision tree and a long-term Markov model was utilized to simulate outcomes of three treatment strategies: universal use of clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or universal use of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for all patients and CYP2C19 LOF-guided therapy (LOF allele carriers receiving ticagrelor, LOF allele noncarriers receiving clopidogrel). Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, direct medical costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). ICERs less than one-time gross domestic product per capita in China 59,660 yuan/QALY were considered cost-effective. Results: Base-case analysis showed ''universal ticagrelor use'' was cost-effective for an ICER of 33,875 yuan per QALY gained compared with ''universal clopidogrel use'' of which gained a 1.6932 QALYs at lowest life-long cost of 2450 yuan. CYP2C19 LOF-guided therapy had an effectiveness of 1.6975 QALYs at a cost of 2812 yuan, for an ICER of 84,118 yuan per QALY gained relative to ''universal clopidogrel use''.

The results of our study demonstrated that ''universal ticagrelor use'' was cost-effective compared with ''universal clopidogrel use'' for Chinese acute coronary syndrome patients with percutaneous coronary intervention.",2020-01-31012,31849282,Pharmacogenomics,Yu Fu,2020,21 / 1,33-42,No,31849282,"Yu Fu; Kieran F Docherty; Li Shen; Davide Castagno; Mark C Petrie; William T Abraham; Michael Bohm; Akshay S Desai; Kenneth Dickstein; Lars V Kober; Milton Packer; Jean L Rouleau; Scott D Solomon; Karl Swedberg; Ali Vazir; Michael R Zile; Pardeep S Jhund; John J V McMurray; Cost-effectiveness of CYP2C19 LOF-guided antiplatelet therapy in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome, Pharmacogenomics, 2020 Jan; 21(1):1462-2416; 33-42",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,cyp2c19 loss-of-function-guided therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Clopidogrel,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,26 Years,5.00,5.00,84118.63,China,2018,13118.38
23000,CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic-guided SERM could be a cost-effective strategy in Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,"Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6*10 genetic testing for the management of Chinese women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer treated with selective estrogen receptor modulator. Methods: A Markov model was developed to evaluate a total expected cost and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Robustness of the model was addressed in one-way analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: The cost of strategies of tamoxifen, toremifene without genotyping and the strategy base on CYP2D6*10 genotype were $63,879.19, $90,156.60 and $95,021.41, and the quality-adjusted life years gained are 8.1588, 12.89687 and 13.85911, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the CYP2D6*10 testing versus toremifene were 5,055.74221/quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Conclusion: CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic-guided selective estrogen receptor modulator can be a cost-effective strategy in the Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",2020-01-31235,31769341,Pharmacogenomics,XiaoXia Wei,2020,21 / 1,43-53,No,31769341,"XiaoXia Wei; Nadina B Lincoln; Lucy E Bradshaw; Cris S Constantinescu; Florence Day; Avril Er Drummond; Deborah Fitzsimmons; Shaun Harris; Alan A Montgomery; Roshan das Nair; CRAMMS Trial Collaborative Group; CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic-guided SERM could be a cost-effective strategy in Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, Pharmacogenomics, 2020 Jan; 21(1):1462-2416; 43-53",QALY,China,Not Stated,Diagnostic,toremifene (tor) without cyp2d6*10 genetic testing vs. Standard/Usual Care- Tamoxifen (TAM) without CYP2D6*10 genetic testing,"Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), treated with selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)",Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,5546.01,United States,2017,5855.78
