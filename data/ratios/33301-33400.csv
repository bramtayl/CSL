33301,"Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C virus screening, and subsequent monitoring or treatment among pregnant women in the Netherlands","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diagnosed chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among pregnant women in the Netherlands is 0.26%, yet many cases remain undiagnosed. HCV screening and treatment of pregnant HCV carriers could reduce the burden of disease and limit vertical transmission from mother to child. We assessed the impact of HCV screening and subsequent treatment with new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among pregnant women in the Netherlands. METHODS: An HCV natural history Markov transition state model was developed, to evaluate the public-health and economic impact of HCV screening and treatment. Besides all 179,000 pregnant women in the Netherlands (cohort 1), we modelled 3 further cohorts: all 79,000 first-time pregnant women (cohort 2), 33,000 pregnant migrant women (cohort 3) and 16,000 first-time pregnant migrant women (cohort 4). Each cohort was analyzed in various scenarios: i no intervention, i.e., the current practice, ii screen-and-treat, i.e., the most extensive approach involving treatment of all individuals found HCV-positive, and iii screen-and-treat/monitor, i.e., a strategy involving treatment of symptomatic (F1-F4) patients and follow-up of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers with subsequent treatment only at progression. RESULTS: For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (ii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €9,306 and €10,173 per QALY gained and 5 year budget impacts varying between €6,283,830 and €19,220,405. For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (iii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €1,739 and €2,749 per QALY gained and budget impacts varying between €1,468,670 and €5,607,556. For all cohorts, the ICERs (scenario iii versus ii) involved in delayed treatment of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers varied between €56,607 and €56,892, well above the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained and even above a threshold of €50,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Universal screening for HCV among all pregnant women in the Netherlands is cost-effective. However, it would be reasonable to consider smaller risk groups in view of the budget impact of the intervention.",2021-01-35887,33064259,Eur J Health Econ,Job F H Eijsink,2021,22 / 1,75-88,Yes,33064259,"Job F H Eijsink; Mohamed N M T Al Khayat; Cornelis Boersma; Peter G J Ter Horst; Jan C Wilschut; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C virus screening, and subsequent monitoring or treatment among pregnant women in the Netherlands, Eur J Health Econ, 2021 Feb; 22(1):1618-7598; 75-88",QALY,Netherlands,Viral hepatitis,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical, Screening",screen and treat symptomatic patients (F1-F4) or monitor asymptomatic (F0) patients vs. No intervention,first time pregnant migrant women,45 Years,20 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",4.00,1.50,1739,Euro,2018,2217.52

33304,Prehospital continuous positive airway pressure for acute respiratory failure: the ACUTE feasibility RCT,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure is a life-threatening emergency. Standard prehospital management involves controlled oxygen therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure is a potentially beneficial alternative treatment; however, it is uncertain whether or not this treatment could improve outcomes in NHS ambulance services. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of a large-scale pragmatic trial and to update an existing economic model to determine cost-effectiveness and the value of further research. DESIGN: (1) An open-label, individual patient randomised controlled external pilot trial. (2) Cost-effectiveness and value-of-information analyses, updating an existing economic model. (3) Ancillary substudies, comprising an acute respiratory failure incidence study, an acute respiratory failure diagnostic agreement study, clinicians perceptions of a continuous positive airway pressure mixed-methods study and an investigation of allocation concealment. SETTING: Four West Midlands Ambulance Service hubs, recruiting between August 2017 and July 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with respiratory distress and peripheral oxygen saturations below the British Thoracic Society''s target levels were included. Patients with limited potential to benefit from, or with contraindications to, continuous positive airway pressure were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Prehospital continuous positive airway pressure (O-Two system, O-Two Medical Technologies Inc., Brampton, ON, Canada) was compared with standard oxygen therapy, titrated to the British Thoracic Society''s peripheral oxygen saturation targets. Interventions were provided in identical sealed boxes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility objectives estimated the incidence of eligible patients, the proportion recruited and allocated to treatment appropriately, adherence to allocated treatment, and retention and data completeness. The primary clinical end point was 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were enrolled (target 120 patients), including seven patients with a diagnosis for which continuous positive airway pressure could be ineffective or harmful. Continuous positive airway pressure was fully delivered to 74% of participants (target 75%). There were no major protocol violations/non-compliances. Full data were available for all key outcomes (target =?90%). Thirty-day mortality was 27.3%. Of the 21 deceased participants, 14 (68%) either did not have a respiratory condition or had ceiling-of-treatment decision implemented that excluded hospital non-invasive ventilation and critical care. The base-case economic evaluation indicated that standard oxygen therapy was probably cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio £5685 per quality-adjusted life-year), but there was considerable uncertainty (population expected value of perfect information of £16.5M). Expected value of partial perfect information analyses indicated that effectiveness of prehospital continuous positive airway pressure was the only important variable. The incidence rate of acute respiratory failure was 17.4 (95% confidence interval 16.3 to 18.5) per 100,000 persons per year. There was moderate agreement between the primary prehospital and final hospital diagnoses (Gwet''s AC1 coefficient 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.69). Lack of hospital awareness of the Ambulance continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): Use, Treatment Effect and economics (ACUTE) trial, limited time to complete trial training and a desire to provide continuous positive airway pressure treatment were highlighted as key challenges by participating clinicians. LIMITATIONS: During week 10 of recruitment, the continuous positive airway pressure arm equipment boxes developed a ''rattle''. After repackaging and redistribution, no further concerns were noted. A total of 41.4% of ambulance service clinicians not participating in the ACUTE trial indicated a difference between the control and the intervention arm trial boxes (115/278); of these clinician 70.4% correctly identified box contents. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment rate was below target and feasibility was not demonstrated. The economic evaluation results suggested that a definitive trial could represent value for money. However, limited compliance with continuous positive airway pressure and difficulty in identifying patients who could benefit from continuous positive airway pressure indicate that prehospital continuous positive airway pressure is unlikely to materially reduce mortality. FUTURE WORK: A definitive clinical effectiveness trial of continuous positive airway pressure in the NHS is not recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN12048261.

33305,A Cost-Effectiveness Framework for COVID-19 Treatments for Hospitalized Patients in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis impacting population health and the economy. We describe a cost-effectiveness framework for evaluating acute treatments for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, considering a broad spectrum of potential treatment profiles and perspectives within the US healthcare system to ensure incorporation of the most relevant clinical parameters, given evidence currently available. METHODS: A lifetime model, with a short-term acute care decision tree followed by a post-discharge three-state Markov cohort model, was developed to estimate the impact of a potential treatment relative to best supportive care (BSC) for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The model included information on costs and resources across inpatient levels of care, use of mechanical ventilation, post-discharge morbidity from ventilation, and lifetime healthcare and societal costs. Published literature informed clinical and treatment inputs, healthcare resource use, unit costs, and utilities. The potential health impacts and cost-effectiveness outcomes were assessed from US health payer, societal, and fee-for-service (FFS) payment model perspectives. RESULTS: Viewing results in aggregate, treatments that conferred at least a mortality benefit were likely to be cost-effective, as all deterministic and sensitivity analyses results fell far below willingness-to-pay thresholds using both a US health payer and FFS payment perspective, with and without societal costs included. In the base case, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) ranged from $22,933 from a health payer perspective using bundled payments to $8028 from a societal perspective using a FFS payment model. Even with conservative assumptions on societal impact, inclusion of societal costs consistently produced ICERs 40-60% lower than ICERs for the payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Effective COVID-19 treatments for hospitalized patients may not only reduce disease burden but also represent good value for the health system and society.

33309,Cost-effectiveness analysis of multiple imaging modalities in diagnosis and follow-up of intermediate complex cystic renal lesions,"OBJECTIVES: To compare health-economic aspects of multiple imaging modalities used to monitor renal cysts, the present study evaluates costs and outcomes of patients with Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts detected and followed-up by either contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (ceMRI), or contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A simulation using Markov models was implemented and performed with 10 cycles of 1 year each. Proportionate cohorts were allocated to Markov models by a decision tree processing specific incidences of malignancy and levels of diagnostic performance. Costs of imaging and surgical treatment were investigated using internal data of a European university hospital. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm results considering input value uncertainties. Patient outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as averages per patient including costs of imaging and surgical treatment. RESULTS: Compared to the ''gold standard'' of ceCT, ceMRI was more effective but also more expensive, with a resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) >€70 000 (Euro) per QALY gained. CEUS was dominant compared to ceCT in both Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts in terms of QALYs and costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed these results in the majority of iterations.

CEUS was dominant compared to ceCT in both Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts in terms of QALYs and costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed these results in the majority of iterations.

33312,Cost-effectiveness analysis of multiple imaging modalities in diagnosis and follow-up of intermediate complex cystic renal lesions,"OBJECTIVES: To compare health-economic aspects of multiple imaging modalities used to monitor renal cysts, the present study evaluates costs and outcomes of patients with Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts detected and followed-up by either contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (ceMRI), or contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A simulation using Markov models was implemented and performed with 10 cycles of 1 year each. Proportionate cohorts were allocated to Markov models by a decision tree processing specific incidences of malignancy and levels of diagnostic performance. Costs of imaging and surgical treatment were investigated using internal data of a European university hospital. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm results considering input value uncertainties. Patient outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as averages per patient including costs of imaging and surgical treatment. RESULTS: Compared to the ''gold standard'' of ceCT, ceMRI was more effective but also more expensive, with a resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) >€70 000 (Euro) per QALY gained.

33313,Cost-effectiveness of the long-acting regimen cabotegravir plus rilpivirine for the treatment of HIV-1 and its potential impact on adherence and viral transmission: A modelling study,"INTRODUCTION: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) improves outcomes for people living with HIV (PLWH) but requires adherence to daily dosing. Suboptimal adherence results in reduced treatment effectiveness, increased costs, and greater risk of resistance and onwards transmission. Treatment with long-acting (LA), injection-based ART administered by healthcare professionals (directly observed therapy (DOT)) eliminates the need for adherence to daily dosing and may improve clinical outcomes. This study reports the cost-effectiveness of the cabotegravir plus rilpivirine LA regimen (CAB+RPV LA) and models the potential impact of LA DOT therapies. METHODS: Parameterisation was performed using pooled data from recent CAB+RPV LA Phase III trials. The analysis was conducted using a cohort-level hybrid decision-tree and state-transition model, with states defined by viral load and CD4 cell count. The efficacy of oral cART was adjusted to reflect adherence to daily regimens from published data. A Canadian health service perspective was adopted. RESULTS: CAB+RPV LA is predicted to be the dominant intervention when compared to oral cART, generating, per 1,000 patients treated, lifetime cost-savings of $1.5 million, QALY and life-year gains of 107 and 138 respectively with three new HIV cases averted. CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluations of LA DOTs need to account for the impact of adherence and HIV transmission.

The health-economic comparison of a new porous 3D-printed hip implant for revision arthroplasty of Paprosky type 3B acetabular defects and its closest alternative,"PURPOSE: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common operation for patients suffering from hip arthrosis. It has been proven effective in improving quality of life while being cost-effective. Meanwhile, the number of revision hip arthroplasty is growing and those may require bone reconstruction and are potential indications for 3D custom implants. In these specific indications, medical 3D-printing has grown over the years and the use of 3D-printed implants has become more frequent. To date, the cost-effectiveness of 3D-printed implants for acetabular revision THA has not been evaluated. Therefore we performed a health economic analysis to: (1) analyse the cost-effectiveness of the aMace implant compared to its closest alternative on the market, (2) have a better insight into Belgian costs of revision hip arthroplasties and (3) estimate the budget impact in Belgium. HYPOTHESIS: 3D-printed acetabular implants provide good value-for-health in Paprosky type 3B defects in a Belgian setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Custom Three-flanged Acetabular Components (CTAC) were compared to a 3D-printed implant (aMace) by means of a Markov model with four states (successful, re-revision, resection and dead). The cycle length was set at 6 months with a 10-year time horizon. Data was obtained through systematic literature search and provided by a large social security agency. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective. All amounts are displayed in 2019 euros. Discount rates were applied for future cost (3%) and QALY (1.5%) estimates. RESULTS: Revision hip arthroplasty has an average societal cost of €9950 without implant. Based on the outcomes of our model, aMace provides an excellent value for money compared to CTAC. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was negative for all age groups. The base case of a 65 year old person, showed a QALY gain of 0.05 with a cost reduction of €1265 compared to CTAC. The advantage of using aMace was found to be greater if a patient is younger. The re-revision rates of both CTAC and aMace and the utility of successful revision have the highest impact on costs and effects. A Monte Carlo simulation showed aMace to be a cost-effective strategy in 90% of simulations for younger patients and in 88% of simulations for patients above 85 years old. In Belgium it would imply a cost reduction of €20500 on an annual basis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this model, the new 3D-printed aMace implant has the potential to bring an excellent value for money when used in revision arthroplasty of Paprosky type 3B acetabular defects. For all patients, aMace resulted in a dominant, cost-saving strategy in Belgium compared to CTAC.

The health-economic comparison of a new porous 3D-printed hip implant for revision arthroplasty of Paprosky type 3B acetabular defects and its closest alternative,"PURPOSE: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common operation for patients suffering from hip arthrosis. It has been proven effective in improving quality of life while being cost-effective. Meanwhile, the number of revision hip arthroplasty is growing and those may require bone reconstruction and are potential indications for 3D custom implants. In these specific indications, medical 3D-printing has grown over the years and the use of 3D-printed implants has become more frequent. To date, the cost-effectiveness of 3D-printed implants for acetabular revision THA has not been evaluated. Therefore we performed a health economic analysis to: (1) analyse the cost-effectiveness of the aMace implant compared to its closest alternative on the market, (2) have a better insight into Belgian costs of revision hip arthroplasties and (3) estimate the budget impact in Belgium. HYPOTHESIS: 3D-printed acetabular implants provide good value-for-health in Paprosky type 3B defects in a Belgian setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Custom Three-flanged Acetabular Components (CTAC) were compared to a 3D-printed implant (aMace) by means of a Markov model with four states (successful, re-revision, resection and dead). The cycle length was set at 6 months with a 10-year time horizon. Data was obtained through systematic literature search and provided by a large social security agency. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective. All amounts are displayed in 2019 euros. Discount rates were applied for future cost (3%) and QALY (1.5%) estimates. RESULTS: Revision hip arthroplasty has an average societal cost of €9950 without implant. Based on the outcomes of our model, aMace provides an excellent value for money compared to CTAC. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was negative for all age groups. The base case of a 65 year old person, showed a QALY gain of 0.05 with a cost reduction of €1265 compared to CTAC. The advantage of using aMace was found to be greater if a patient is younger. The re-revision rates of both CTAC and aMace and the utility of successful revision have the highest impact on costs and effects. A Monte Carlo simulation showed aMace to be a cost-effective strategy in 90% of simulations for younger patients and in 88% of simulations for patients above 85 years old. In Belgium it would imply a cost reduction of €20500 on an annual basis.

33327,Cost-Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery Prior to Posterior Lumbar Decompression and Fusion in an Obese Population with Degenerative Spondylolisthesis,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. OBJECTIVE: To determine if bariatric surgery prior to posterior lumbar decompression and fusion (PLDF) for degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a cost-effective strategy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Obesity poses significant perioperative challenges for DS. Treated operatively, obese patients achieve worse outcomes relative to non-obese peers. Concomitantly, they fare better with surgery than with nonoperative measures. These competing facts create uncertainty in determining optimal treatment algorithms for obese patients with DS. The role of bariatric surgery merits investigation as a potentially cost-effective optimization strategy prior to PLDF. METHODS: We simulate a Markov model with two cohorts of obese individuals with DS. 10,000 patients with BMI = 30 in both arms were candidates for both bariatric surgery and PLDF. Subjects were assigned either to 1) no weight loss intervention with immediate operative or non-operative management (""Traditional arm"") or 2) bariatric surgery two years prior to entering the same management options (""combined protocol"").Published costs, utilities, and transition probabilities from the literature were applied. A willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY was used. Sensitivity analyses were run for all variables to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Over a ten-year horizon, the combined protocol was dominant ($13,500 cheaper, 1.15 QALY more effective). Changes in utilities of operative and non-operative treatments in non-obese patients, the obesity cost-multiplier, cost of bariatric surgery and the probability of success of non-operative treatment in obese patients led to decision changes. However, all thresholds occurred outside published bounds for these variables. CONCLUSIONS: The combined protocol was less costly and more effective than the traditional protocol. Results were robust with thresholds occurring outside published ranges. Bariatric surgery is a viable, cost-effective preoperative strategy in obese patients considering elective PLDF for DS.Level of Evidence: 3.",2021-01-35597,33428363,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Chinmay S Paranjape,2021,/,,No,33428363,"Chinmay S Paranjape; Ryan D Gentry; Conor M Regan; Cost-Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery Prior to Posterior Lumbar Decompression and Fusion in an Obese Population with Degenerative Spondylolisthesis, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 2021 Jan 8; ():1528-1159",QALY,United States of America,Dorsopathies,Surgical,Bariatric surgery vs. No weight loss intervention with immediate operative or nonoperative management,Obese,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"10 Years, 2 Years",3.00,3.00,-8922.48,United States,2020,-9341.66
33328,The Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Impact of Ibalizumab-uiyk for Adults with Multidrug-Resistant HIV-1 Infection in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Ibalizumab-uiyk (ibalizumab) is a first-in-class, long-acting, postattachment HIV-1 inhibitor for adults with multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1 infection. This analysis examines the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of ibalizumab treatment for this difficult-to-treat population in the United States. METHODS: A Markov model followed cohorts of adults with MDR HIV-1 infection through two final lines of antiretroviral therapy: ibalizumab + optimized background therapy (OBT) or OBT alone followed by nonsuppressive therapy. Model inputs were based on ibalizumab clinical trial data, market uptake projections, and published literature, with costs in 2019 dollars. The cost-effectiveness analysis assessed costs and health outcomes from a health care sector perspective for individuals receiving ibalizumab + OBT versus OBT alone over a lifetime time horizon. The budget-impact analysis estimated the impact on payer budgets of the introduction of ibalizumab over 3 years for a hypothetical commercial health plan. RESULTS: Compared with individuals receiving OBT alone, individuals receiving ibalizumab + OBT incurred higher costs but lived longer, healthier lives, with an incremental cost of $133,040 per QALY gained. For a hypothetical commercial health plan with 1 million members, the introduction of ibalizumab + OBT was estimated to increase budgets by $217,260, $385,245, and $560,310 ($0.018, $0.032, and $0.047 per member per month) in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These results were found to be robust in sensitivity and scenario analyses.

33329,Cost-effectiveness of implementing 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for U.S. adults aged 19 years and older with underlying conditions,"In June 2019, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) changed the recommendation for routine 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) use in immunocompetent adults aged =65 years, including those with select chronic medical conditions (CMC). ACIP now recommends PCV13 for this group of adults based on shared clinical decision-making. Because adults with CMC continue to be at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of administering PCV13 in series with the recommended 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for adults aged =19 years with CMC. We used a probabilistic model following a cohort of 19-year-old adults. We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the impact on program, medical, and non-medical costs (in 2017 U.S. dollars [$], societal perspective), and pneumococcal disease burden when administering PCV13 in series with PPSV23. We used PCV13 efficacy and post-licensure vaccine effectiveness (VE) data to estimate VE against PCV13 type disease (separately for disease by serotype 3 [ST3], the most common PCV13 type, and all other PCV13 serotypes). We considered a range of estimates for sensitivity analyses. Analyses were performed in 2019. In the base case, assuming no PCV13 effectiveness against ST3 disease, adding a dose of PCV13 upon CMC diagnosis cost $689,299 per QALY gained.

33330,Cost-effectiveness of emicizumab vs bypassing agents in the prevention of bleeding episodes in haemophilia A patients with anti-FVIII inhibitors in France,"INTRODUCTION: The development of an anti-FVIII inhibitor is the most serious complication of haemophilia A occurring in up to 30% of severe haemophilic patients. The current management of haemophilia A with inhibitor uses bypassing agents (BPA) and represents a significant therapeutic burden together with a limited adherence to prophylactic treatment. Emicizumab is the first monoclonal antibody developed in haemophilia A approved for the prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with anti-FVIII inhibitor. AIM: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of emicizumab versus BPAs. METHODS: A Markov model was developed over a five-year time horizon to estimate the comparative costs and benefits of the different therapeutic approaches in this rare disease. Model inputs were clinical, including annual bleeding rate and quality of life, and economical including mainly costs of prophylaxis, bleeds and adverse events. RESULTS: Emicizumab treatment is dominant, ie lest costly and more effective, in the base-case analysis saving 234 191 € for a gain of 0.88 QALY. This is confirmed by both the deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The main limit of the study remains the absence of long-term clinical data allowing to relate treatment consumption to clinical benefit, especially in the progression of haemophilic arthropathy. CONCLUSION: Our results show that emicizumab is a cost-effective treatment allowing to consider an easy to implement prophylactic treatment for haemophilia A patients with anti-FVIII inhibitors.",2021-01-35530,33210412,Haemophilia,Benoît Polack,2021,27 / 1,e1-e11,No,33210412,"Benoît Polack; Marc Trossaërt; Mathias Cousin; Sandrine Baffert; Alexandra Pruvot; Chloé Godard; Cost-effectiveness of emicizumab vs bypassing agents in the prevention of bleeding episodes in haemophilia A patients with anti-FVIII inhibitors in France, Haemophilia, 2021 Jan; 27(1):1351-8216; e1-e11",QALY,French Republic,"Coagulation defects, purpura and other haemorrhagic conditions",Pharmaceutical,Emicizumab vs. Bypassing agents,severe haemophilic patients,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"5 Years, Not Stated / None",4.00,4.00,-265793.89,Euro,2019,-315556.09
33331,Cost-Effectiveness of 4CMenB Infant Vaccination in England: A Comprehensive Valuation Considering the Broad Impact of Serogroup B Invasive Meningococcal Disease,"OBJECTIVES: This cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of 4CMenB infant vaccination in England comprehensively considers the broad burden of serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (MenB IMD), which has not been considered, or was only partially considered in previous CEAs. METHODS: A review of previous MenB vaccination CEAs was conducted to identify aspects considered in the evaluation of costs and health outcomes of the disease burden of MenB IMD. To inform the model structure and comprehensive analysis, the aspects were grouped into 5 categories. A stepwise analysis was conducted to analyze the impact of each category, and the more comprehensive consideration of disease burden, on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: MenB IMD incidence decreased by 46.0% in infants and children 0-4 years old within 5 years after introduction of the program. Stepwise inclusion of the 5 disease burden categories to a conventional narrow CEA setting reduced the ICER from £360 595 to £18 645-that is, considering the impact of all 5 categories, 4CMenB infant vaccination is cost-effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: When considering comprehensively the MenB IMD burden, 4CMenB infant vaccination can be cost-effective, a finding contrary to previous CEAs. This analysis allows policy decision-makers globally to infer the impact of current disease burden considerations on the cost-effectiveness and the comprehensive assessment necessary for MenB IMD. Although this comprehensive CEA can help inform decision making today, it may be limited in capturing the full disease burden and complex interactions of health and economics of MenB IMD.",2021-01-35493,33431159,Value Health,Ekkehard Beck,2021,24 / 1,91-104,Yes,33431159,"Ekkehard Beck; Johan Klint; Mohamed Neine; Stephanie Garcia; Kinga Meszaros; Kairong Wang; Jie Zhong; Na Huang; Yingfeng Zhou; Cost-Effectiveness of 4CMenB Infant Vaccination in England: A Comprehensive Valuation Considering the Broad Impact of Serogroup B Invasive Meningococcal Disease, Value Health, 2021 Jan; 24(1):1098-3015; 91-104",QALY,United Kingdom,Other bacterial diseases,Immunization,4CMenB Infant Vaccination vs. Nothing,,4 Years,0 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"100 Years, Not Stated / None",1.50,1.50,18645,United Kingdom,2019,25234.46
33332,"Cost-effectiveness of paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab versus docetaxel, cisplatin and trastuzumab in new adjuvant therapy of breast cancer in china","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in China. Amplification of the Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) gene is present and overexpressed in 18-20% of breast cancers and historically has been associated with inferior disease-related outcomes. There has been increasing interest in de-escalation of therapy for low-risk disease. This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of Doxorubicin/ Cyclophosphamide/ Paclitaxel/ Trastuzumab (AC-TH) and Docetaxel/Carboplatin/Trastuzumab(TCH) from payer perspective over a 5 year time horizon. METHODS: A half-cycle corrected Markov model was built to simulate the process of breast cancer events and death occurred in both AC-TH and TCH armed patients. Cost data came from studies based on a Chinese hospital. One-way sensitivity analyses as well as second-order Monte Carlo and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.The transition probabilities and utilities were extracted from published literature, and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We identified 41 breast cancer patients at Hangzhou First People''s Hospital, among whom 15 (60%) had a partial response for AC-TH treatment and 13 (81.25%) had a partial response for TCH treatment.No cardiac toxicity was observed. Hematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in 1 of 28 patients.Nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities with a reverse pattern were observed in 6 of 29 patients. The mean QALY gain per patient compared with TCH was 0.25 with AC-TH, while the incremental costs were $US13,142. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AC-TH versus TCH was $US 52,565 per QALY gained.

33333,A cost-effectiveness analysis of three approaches for lymph node assessment in patients with low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of sentinel lymph node mapping compared to risk factor assessment and routine full lymph node dissection for the assessment of lymph nodes in patients with low- and intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was designed to compare three lymph node assessment strategies in terms of costs and effects: 1) sentinel lymph node mapping; 2) post-operative risk factor assessment (adjuvant therapy based on clinical and histological risk factors); 3) full lymph node dissection. Input data were derived from systematic literature searches and expert opinion. QALYs were used as measure of effectiveness. The model was built from a healthcare perspective and the impact of uncertainty was assessed with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed that sentinel lymph node mapping was the most effective strategy for lymph node assessment in patients with low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. Compared to risk factor assessment it was more costly, but the incremental cost effectiveness ratio stayed below a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 with a maximum of €9637/QALY. Sentinel lymph node mapping was dominant compared to lymph node dissection since it was more effective and less costly. Sensitivity analyses showed that the outcome of the model was robust to changes in input values. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 sentinel lymph node mapping remained cost-effective in at least 74.3% of the iterations.

33337,Cost-utility Analysis of Rotavirus Vaccines Including the Latest Evidence and Data as of June 2020 in Japan,"BACKGROUND: In several health economic analyses of rotavirus vaccines in Japan, all were not cost-effective from the healthcare payer perspective (HPP) but generally cost-effective from the societal perspective (SP). However, few studies have incorporated clinically significant factors of vaccine herd immunity, convulsions with gastroenteritis, encephalopathies, nosocomial infections, death, and intussusception as a vaccine side effect. A cost-utility analysis incorporating these were conducted. METHODS: We used Bakir''s decision-tree model and data in Japan with 94% coverage rate, 5-year time horizon, and 2% discount. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with a willingness-to-pay of Japanese Yen (JPY) 5 million from HPP and SP.

33341,Mini-sternotomy versus conventional sternotomy for aortic valve replacement: a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and health economic outcomes after manubrium-limited mini-sternotomy (intervention) and conventional median sternotomy (usual care). DESIGN: A single-blind, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Single centre UK National Health Service tertiary hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention was manubrium-limited mini-sternotomy performed using a 5-7 cm midline incision. Usual care was median sternotomy performed using a midline incision from the sternal notch to the xiphisternum. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received a red cell transfusion postoperatively and within 7 days of index surgery. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients receiving a non-red cell blood component transfusion and number of units transfused within 7 days and during index hospital stay, quality of life and cost-effectiveness analyses. RESULTS: 270 patients were randomised, received surgery and contributed to the intention to treat analysis. No difference between mini and conventional sternotomy in red-cell transfusion within 7 days was found; 23/135 patients in each arm received a transfusion, OR 1.0 (95% CI 0.5 to 2.0) and risk difference 0.0 (95% CI -0.1 to 0.1).

DESIGN: 120 patients with medial knee OA (VAS pain at rest >40/100), classified as Kellgren-Lawrence grade II-IV, were randomized into two groups: ODRA plus usual care (ODRA group) and usual care alone (UCA group). The primary effectiveness outcome was the change in VAS pain between M0 and M12. Secondary outcomes included changes over 1 year in KOOS (function) and OAKHQOL (quality of life) scores. Drug consumption, compliance, safety of the knee brace, and cost-utility over 1 year were also assessed. RESULTS: The ODRA group was associated with a higher improvement in: VAS pain (adjusted mean difference of -11.8; 95% CI: -21.1 to -2.5); all KOOS subscales (pain: +8.8; 95% CI: 1.4-16.2); other symptoms (+10.4; 95% CI: 2.7-18); function in activities of daily living (+9.2; 95% CI: 1.1-17.2); function in sports and leisure (+12.3; 95% CI: 4.3-20.3); quality of life (+9.9; 95% CI: 0.9-15.9), OAKHQOL subscales (pain: +14.8; 95% CI: 5.0-24.6); and physical activities (+8.2; 95% CI: 0.6-15.8), and with a significant decrease in analgesics consumption at M12 compared with the UCA group. Despite localized side-effects, observance was good at M12 (median: 5.3 h/day). The ODRA group had a more than 85% chance of being cost-effective for a willingness-to-pay threshold of €45 000 per QALY.

METHODS: A population-based randomised controlled prevention trial, with recruitment through UK general practices. A mailed screening questionnaire identified adults at high risk of CWP. Participants received either usual care (UC) or a short course of telephone CBT (tCBT). The primary outcome was CWP onset at 12 months assessed by mailed questionnaire. There were seven secondary outcomes including quality of life (EuroQol Questionnaire-five dimensions-five levels/EQ-5D-5L) used as part of a health economic assessment. RESULTS: 996 participants were randomised and included in the intention-to-treat analysis of which 825 provided primary outcome data. The median age of participants was 59 years; 59% were women. At 12 months there was no difference in the onset of CWP (tCBT: 18.0%?vs UC: 17.5%; OR 1.05; 95%?CI 0.75 to 1.48). Participants who received tCBT were more likely to report better quality of life (EQ-5D-5L utility score mean difference 0.024 (95% CI 0.009 to 0.040)); and had 0.023 (95% CI 0.007 to 0.039) more quality-adjusted life-years at an additional cost of £42.30 (95% CI -£451.19 to £597.90), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £1828. Most secondary outcomes showed significant benefit for the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A short course of tCBT did not prevent onset of CWP in adults at high risk, but improved quality of life and was cost-effective.

33349,Economic value of insertable cardiac monitors in unexplained syncope in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: Early use of insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) is recommended for patients with unexplained syncope following initial clinical workup, due to its superior ability to establish symptom-rhythm correlation compared with conventional testing (CONV). However, ICMs incur higher upfront costs, and the impact of additional diagnoses and resulting treatment on downstream costs and outcomes is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICM compared with CONV for the diagnosis of arrhythmia in patients with unexplained syncope, from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and benefits of arrhythmia diagnosis with ICM versus CONV, considering all related diagnostic and arrhythmia-related treatment costs and consequences. Cohort characteristics and costs were informed by original claims database analyses. Risks of mortality, syncopal recurrence, injury due to syncope and quality of life consequences from syncopal events were identified from the literature. RESULTS: ICM was less costly and more effective than CONV. Most of the observed US$4532 cost savings were attributed to reduced downstream diagnostic testing. For every 1000 patients, ICM was projected to yield an additional 253 arrhythmia diagnoses and lead to treatment in an additional 168 patients. The ICM strategy resulted in overall improved outcomes (0.30 quality-adjusted life years gained), due to a reduction in syncope recurrence and injury resulting from arrhythmia treatment. The results were robust to changes in the base case parameters but sensitive to the model time horizon, underlying probability of syncope recurrence and prevalence of arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Our model projected that early ICM for the diagnosis of unexplained syncope reduced long-term costs, and led to an improvement in overall clinical outcomes by shortening time to arrhythmia treatment. The cost of ICM was outweighed by savings arising from fewer downstream diagnostic episodes, and the increased cost of treatment was counterbalanced by fewer syncope-related event costs.",2021-01-35380,33622962,Open Heart,Brad S Sutton,2021,8 / 1,,No,33622962,"Brad S Sutton; Sarah L Bermingham; Alexander Diamantopoulos; Sarah C Rosemas; Stelios I Tsintzos; Ying Xia; Matthew R Reynolds; Saurabh Sinha; Ian Caplan; James Schuster; Matthew Piazza; Gregory Glauser; Nikhil Sharma; William Charles Welch; Benjamin Osiemo; Scott McClintock; Ali Kemal Ozturk; Neil Rainer Malhotra; Economic value of insertable cardiac monitors in unexplained syncope in the United States, Open Heart, 2021 Feb; 8(1):2053-3624",QALY,United States of America,"General symptoms and signs, Other forms of heart disease",Medical Device,insertable cardiac monitor vs. conventional testing for unexplained syncope,unexplained syncope: recurrent syncopal event with no definite diagnosis following initial clinical workup.,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-15079.84,United States,2018,-16272.68
33350,Costs and effects of cardiovascular risk reclassification using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in addition to the Framingham risk scoring in women,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ankle brachial index (ABI) is a simple and cheap parameter to assess the presence of atherosclerosis. It could also help correctly reclassify the cardiovascular risk when added to the Framingham risk score (FRS). Recent evidence has demonstrated improvement in prediction performance of ABI when added to FRS, particularly in women. However, no studies have been published yet evaluating the cost-effectiveness of this approach. This study attempts to fill in this gap by assessing the cost-effectiveness of ABI measurements in primary prevention in women. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare two different strategies for assessing the cardiovascular risk (low, intermediate and high) among women in the general population: 1) FRS strategy, and 2) FRS + ABI strategy; and the relative impact associated with interventions for preventing CV events in intermediate and high-risk categories. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, FRS + ABI reported an additional cost of € 110 and a gain of 0.0039 QALYs per patient, resulting in an ICER of € 27.986/QALY, when compared to FRS alone. The ICER improved to €1.641/QALY when using a lifetime horizon. The effectiveness of preventive CV disease interventions reported also a significant impact. A 32% reduction of CV events was the minimum value estimated to maintain FRS + ABI as a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ABI to FRS is a cost-effective approach in women classified at low and intermediate risk with FRS only. This new approach gives the possibility to reclassify and allocate them into the appropriate risk group and treatment.",2021-01-35363,33213858,Atherosclerosis,Paolo Angelo Cortesi,2021,317 /,59-66,No,33213858,"Paolo Angelo Cortesi; Alessandro Maloberti; Mariangela Micale; Federica Pagliarin; Ippazio Cosimo Antonazzo; Giampiero Mazzaglia; Cristina Giannattasio; Lorenzo Giovanni Mantovani; Costs and effects of cardiovascular risk reclassification using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in addition to the Framingham risk scoring in women, Atherosclerosis, 2021 Jan; 317():1879-1484; 59-66",QALY,Italy,"Cerebrovascular diseases, Cerebrovascular diseases, Cerebrovascular diseases",Screening,Framingham risk score + the ankle brachial index vs. Framingham risk score to stratify patient risk,No history of cardiovascular disease,73 Years,49 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, 10 Years",3.00,3.00,1641,Euro,2019,1948.23
33371,Cost-effectiveness of dexamethasone and triamcinolone for the treatment of diabetic macular oedema in Finland: A Markov-model,"PURPOSE: Diabetic macular oedema (DMO), a complication of diabetes, causes vision loss and blindness. Corticosteroids are usually used as a second-line treatment. The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of dexamethasone implants compared to cheaper and more frequently applied triamcinolone injections. METHODS: Markov-modelling, which incorporated both eyes, was used for economic evaluation. The model consisted of five health states based on visual acuity, illustrating the progression of DMO. A cycle length of five months was chosen for dexamethasone and four months for triamcinolone. Time horizons of two and five years were applied. Transition probabilities and health state utilities were sourced from previous studies. The perspective used in this analysis was the hospital perspective. The health care costs were acquired from Kuopio University Hospital in Finland. RESULTS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ICER with 3% discount rate was €56 591/QALY for a two-year follow-up and -€1 110 942/QALY for a five-year follow-up. In order to consider dexamethasone as cost-effective over a 2-year time horizon, the WTP needs to be around €55 000/QALY. Over the five-year follow-up, triamcinolone is clearly a dominant treatment.

Corticosteroids are usually used as a second-line treatment. The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of dexamethasone implants compared to cheaper and more frequently applied triamcinolone injections. METHODS: Markov-modelling, which incorporated both eyes, was used for economic evaluation. The model consisted of five health states based on visual acuity, illustrating the progression of DMO. A cycle length of five months was chosen for dexamethasone and four months for triamcinolone. Time horizons of two and five years were applied. Transition probabilities and health state utilities were sourced from previous studies. The perspective used in this analysis was the hospital perspective. The health care costs were acquired from Kuopio University Hospital in Finland. RESULTS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ICER with 3% discount rate was €56 591/QALY for a two-year follow-up and -€1 110 942/QALY for a five-year follow-up.

33375,Cost Effectiveness of Case Detection Strategies for the Early Detection of COPD,"OBJECTIVES: The value of early detection and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently unknown. We assessed the cost effectiveness of primary care-based case detection strategies for COPD. METHODS: A previously validated discrete event simulation model of the general population of COPD patients in Canada was used to assess the cost effectiveness of 16 case detection strategies. In these strategies, eligible patients (based on age, smoking history, or symptoms) received the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ) or screening spirometry, at 3- or 5-year intervals, during routine visits to a primary care physician. Newly diagnosed patients received treatment for smoking cessation and guideline-based inhaler pharmacotherapy. Analyses were conducted over a 20-year time horizon from the healthcare payer perspective. Costs are in 2019 Canadian dollars ($). Key treatment parameters were varied in one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Compared to no case detection, all 16 case detection scenarios had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below $50,000/QALY gained. In the most efficient scenario, all patients aged =?40 years received the CDQ at 3-year intervals. This scenario was associated with an incremental cost of $287 and incremental effectiveness of 0.015 QALYs per eligible patient over the 20-year time horizon, resulting in an ICER of $19,632/QALY compared to no case detection.

We assessed the cost effectiveness of primary care-based case detection strategies for COPD. METHODS: A previously validated discrete event simulation model of the general population of COPD patients in Canada was used to assess the cost effectiveness of 16 case detection strategies. In these strategies, eligible patients (based on age, smoking history, or symptoms) received the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ) or screening spirometry, at 3- or 5-year intervals, during routine visits to a primary care physician.

33391,"A MEA is a MEA is a MEA? Sequential decision making and the impact of different managed entry agreements at the manufacturer and payer level, using a case study for an oncology drug in England","BACKGROUND: In a typical single-payer setting that uses an explicit cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold in its decision-making, the payer aims to maximize the net-monetary-benefit (NMB) given the CE threshold, whilst the manufacturer aims to maximize the expected discounted-cash-flow (DCF) resulting from the sales of that technology. Managed entry agreements (MEAs) are tools that are used to improve access to expensive technologies that would otherwise not be deemed to be cost-effective to payers. While simple discount on the list price is the most commonly applied MEA type, there are different forms, each having a different impact on the cost-effectiveness of the technology, on the lifetime DCF-per-patient and on the decision uncertainty. We aim to analyze the sequential decision-making (SDM) of different MEAs (i.e. simple discount, free treatment initiation, lifetime treatment acquisition cost-capping [LTTACC], performance-based money-back guarantee [MBG]) at the manufacturer and at the payer level, respectively. METHODS: We first model the SDM of the manufacturer and the payer as a sequential game and explain the challenges to find an equilibrium analytically. Then we propose a heuristic computational method to follow for each of the MEA types, based on practice. To demonstrate this SDM on a case study, a UK-based cost-utility analysis using a three-state, partitioned-survival-model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib versus best-supportive-care for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The optimal agreement terms that would maximise the lifetime DCF-per-patient for each MEA, whilst remaining below the CE-threshold (£50,000/QALY gained) were obtained in the deterministic base-case. Robustness for each optimized MEA was then assessed using probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses, the value of information (VoI), and HTA-risk analyses. RESULTS: As expected, the introduction of all MEAs improved the probabilistic ICER and NMB values to (almost) acceptable levels, compared to the ""no-MEA"" case (ICER?~?£78,000/QALY-gained). The expected DCFs across the explored MEAs were all similar, whilst the payer strategy & uncertainty burden (PSUB) for regorafenib decreased in all MEAs explored. VoI analyses revealed that regorafenib mean-dose-intensity and time-on-treatment (ToT) parameters attributed most to the decision uncertainty. LTTACC provided the smallest PSUB and the most robust NMB estimates under parametric uncertainty. For scenarios assuming increased regorafenib ToT or mean-dose-intensity, LTACC again provided acceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes, whereas for scenarios assuming decreased regorafenib progression-free/overall survival effectiveness, only MBG resulted in plausible ICER values. In scenarios, where the source of uncertainty was not targeted by MEA parameters (e.g. the scenario assuming higher progressed disease resource utilization), all investigated MEA types resulted in unacceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes. CONCLUSION: Each MEA type has a different implication. The impact of different MEAs on the NMB is more noteworthy than on the DCF, in relative terms, hence payers will benefit from the early participation of the MEA design rather than leaving this up to the prerogative of the manufacturer. While simple discount might be practical for implementation purposes, other MEAs can provide additional benefits to the payer in terms of increased NMB, reduced decision risk and reduced uncertainty. MEA performance should be investigated not only under parametric uncertainty, but also under-identified structural uncertainty, and the barriers of implementation should be considered thoroughly before choosing the most appropriate MEA type.",2021-01-35358,32901420,Eur J Health Econ,Nasuh C Buyukkaramikli,2021,22 / 1,51-73,Yes,32901420,"Nasuh C Buyukkaramikli; Peter Wigfield; Men Thi Hoang; A MEA is a MEA is a MEA?

The objectives of this study were to examine the epidemiological consequences and cost-effectiveness of a routine quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV) vaccination and the routine 4vHPV vaccination plus 5-year catch-up vaccination by comparing with cervical cancer screening only (no vaccination) in Thailand. METHOD: A transmission dynamic model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the routine 4vHPV vaccination and the routine 4vHPV vaccination plus catch-up vaccination, compared with no vaccination (screening only) in Thai population. The vaccination coverage rate assumptions were 95% in 11-12-year-old girls for the routine vaccination and 70% in 13-24 year-old females for the 5-year catch-up vaccination.

METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical data were derived from PIONEER 2, 3 and 4. Patients were assumed to receive initial treatments until glycated hemoglobin exceeded 7.5%, then treatment-intensified to basal insulin therapy. Costs were accounted from a societal perspective in 2019 euros (EUR). RESULTS: Oral semaglutide 14mg was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.15, 0.22 and 0.09quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus empagliflozin 25 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and liraglutide 1.8 mg, respectively, with combined costs EUR1,032 higher, EUR115 higher and EUR1,267 lower.

33397,Cost-effectiveness of live-attenuated influenza vaccination among school-age children,"The current pediatric vaccination program in England and Wales administers Live-Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) to children ages 2-16 years old. Annual administration of LAIV to this age group is costly and poses substantial logistical issues. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prioritizing vaccination to age groups within the 2-16 year old age range to mitigate the operational and resource challenges of the current strategy. We performed economic evaluations comparing the influenza vaccination program from 1995-2013 to seven alternative strategies targeted at low risk individuals along the school age divisions Preschool (2-4 years old), Primary school (5-11 years old), and Secondary school (12-16 years old). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on the status quo scenario (vaccinating subgroups at high risk of influenza-related complications and individuals 65+ years old). Impact of vaccination was assessed using a transmission model from a previously published study and updated with new data. At all levels of coverage, all strategies had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the current National Health Service threshold, £20,000/QALY gained. The incremental analysis demonstrated vaccinating Primary School children was the most cost-efficient strategy compared incrementally against others with an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of £639 spent per QALY gained (Net Benefit: 404 M£ [155, 795]). When coverage was varied between 30%, 55%, and 70% strategies which included Primary school children had a higher probability of being cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay levels.
