34201,A cost-effectiveness analysis of the Chronic Disease Management Program in patients with hypertension in Korea.,"BACKGROUND: The Chronic Disease Management Program (CDMP) of Korea has been introduced to improve care continuity in patients with hypertension and diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of the CDMP in patients with hypertension from the perspective of the healthcare payer. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on a Markov simulation model. The cost and effect of the CDMP versus usual care was compared in individuals aged 40 years or above. The two strategies were presumed to result in a difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The model was analyzed over the lifetime of the cohort. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the difference in lifetime costs by the difference in lifetime effects (quality adjusted life years, QALYs) between the two strategies. Costs were expressed in Korean Won (KRW). RESULTS: The ICER value of the CDMP participation strategy was -5 761 088 KRW/QALY compared to usual care. Similar tendencies were found when limiting the population to only clinic users (-3 843 355 KRW/QALY) and national health examination participants (-5 595 185 KRW/QALY). CONCLUSION: The CDMP was highly cost-effective in patients with hypertension aged 40 years or above. Implementing efficient policies that enhance care coordination and improve outcomes in patients with hypertension is important.",2021-01-41760,33856029,Int J Qual Health Care,Woorim Kim,2021,33 / 2,,No,33856029,"Woorim Kim; Lee, Sang Ah; Chun, Sung-Youn; A cost-effectiveness analysis of the Chronic Disease Management Program in patients with hypertension in Korea., Int J Qual Health Care, 2021 Apr 30; 33(2):",QALY,South Korea,"Hypertensive diseases, Diabetes mellitus",Pharmaceutical,chronic disease management program (national health examination participants only) vs. usual care,patients newly diagnosed with hypertension between 2012 and 2014,Not Stated,40 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,-5595185,South Korea,2018,-5494.37
34202,Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid compared with sequential denosumab/alendronate for older osteoporotic women in Japan.,"Among hypothetical cohorts of older osteoporotic women without prior fragility fracture in Japan, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of two treatment strategies using a simulation model. Annual intravenous zoledronic acid for 3 years was cost-saving compared with biannual subcutaneous denosumab for 3 years followed by weekly oral alendronate for 3 years. PURPOSE: Osteoporosis constitutes a major medical and health economic burden to society worldwide. Injectable treatments for osteoporosis require less frequent administration than oral treatments and therefore have higher persistence and adherence with treatment, which could explain better efficacy for fracture prevention. Although annual intravenous zoledronic acid and biannual subcutaneous denosumab are available, it remains unclear which treatment strategy represents a better value from a health economic perspective. Accordingly, we examined the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid for 3 years compared with sequential denosumab/alendronate (i.e., denosumab for 3 years followed by oral weekly alendronate for 3 years, making the total treatment duration 6 years) among hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling osteoporotic women without prior fragility fracture in Japan at ages 65, 70, 75, or 80 years. METHODS: Using a previously validated and updated Markov microsimulation model, we obtained incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (Japanese yen [¥] (or US dollars [$]) per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) from the public healthcare and long-term care payer's perspective over a lifetime horizon with a willingness-to-pay of ¥5 million (or $47,500) per QALY. RESULTS: In the base case, zoledronic acid was cost-saving (i.e., more effective and less expensive) compared with sequential denosumab/alendronate. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to changes in the efficacy of zoledronic acid or the cumulative persistence rate with zoledronic acid or denosumab. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of zoledronic acid being cost-effective were 98-100%.

34206,Cost-effectiveness of the cell-based quadrivalent versus the standard egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine in Germany.,"BACKGROUND: Standard influenza vaccines are produced using egg-based manufacturing methods. Through the process, the resulting egg-adapted viral strains may differ from the selected vaccine strain. Cell-derived influenza vaccine manufacturing prevents egg-adaptation of the antigen which can improve vaccine effectiveness. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent cell-derived influenza vaccine (QIVc) versus an egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIVe) in preventing seasonal influenza from German societal and payer perspectives. METHODS: Adapted version of the individual-based dynamic 4Flu transmission model was combined with a decision-tree to calculate the impact of QIVc versus QIVe on influenza over 20 seasons in Germany. Egg-adaptation, resulting in lower effectiveness of QIVe versus QIVc towards the H3N2 influenza strain, is sourced from a US retrospective study and assumed in 100% (base case) or 55% (conservative scenario) of years. Influenza-related probabilities of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, productivity loss, and mortality, with associated (dis)utilities/costs, were extracted from literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted 3.0%/year. RESULTS: Replacing QIVe with QIVc in subjects aged ≥ 9 years can annually prevent 167,265 symptomatic cases, 51,114 outpatient visits, 2,091 hospitalizations, and 103 deaths in Germany. The annual number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 1,628 and healthcare costs decreased by €178 M from societal perspective. From payer perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €2,285 per QALY. Scenario analyses confirmed results robustness.

34212,Cost-effectiveness of single-use negative-pressure therapy compared with standard care for prevention of reconstruction failure in prepectoral breast reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND: Single-use negative-pressure wound therapy (sNPWT) has been reported to reduce the incidence of reconstruction failure in prepectoral breast reconstruction compared with standard surgical dressings. The aim of this economic evaluation was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of sNPWT compared with standard care for the prevention of reconstruction failure in prepectoral breast reconstruction in the UK. METHOD: A decision tree model was used to estimate the expected cost and effectiveness per patient. Effectiveness was measured both by the number of reconstruction failures avoided and the gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The baseline incidence of reconstruction failure (8.6 per cent) was taken from a recently published study of 2655 mastectomies in the UK. The effectiveness of sNPWT used results from a clinical study comparing sNPWT with standard dressings. Previously published utility weights were applied. The cost of reconstruction failure was estimated from detailed resource data from patients with reconstruction failure, applying National Health Service reference costs. One-way, probabilistic, scenario and threshold analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The undiscounted cost per patient associated with reconstruction failure was estimated to be £23 628 (£22 431 discounted). The use of sNPWT was associated with an expected cost saving of £1706 per patient, an expected increase in QALYs of 0.0187 and an expected 0.0834 reconstruction failures avoided. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analysis demonstrated that, at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY, 99.94 per cent of the simulations showed sNPWT to be more cost-effective than standard care. CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing immediate prepectoral breast reconstruction, the use of sNPWT is more cost-effective than standard dressings.",2021-01-41756,33839751,BJS Open,J A Murphy,2021,5 / 2,,No,33839751,"J A Murphy; D Myers; P Trueman; R Searle; Cost-effectiveness of single-use negative-pressure therapy compared with standard care for prevention of reconstruction failure in prepectoral breast reconstruction., BJS Open, 2021 Mar 5; 5(2):",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,single-use negative-pressure therapy vs. standard surgical dressing,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,"48 Months, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,-91245.45,Euro,2019,-108328.52
34214,Cost-effectiveness of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab versus TAS-102 monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: TAS-102 plus bevacizumab is an anticipated combination regimen for patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer. However, evidence supporting its use for this indication is limited. We compared the cost-effectiveness of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab combination therapy with TAS-102 monotherapy for patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. METHOD: Markov decision modeling using treatment costs, disease-free survival, and overall survival was performed to examine the cost-effectiveness of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab combination therapy and TAS-102 monotherapy. The Japanese health care payer's perspective was adopted. The outcomes were modeled on the basis of published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the two treatment regimens was the primary outcome. Sensitivity analysis was performed and the effect of uncertainty on the model parameters were investigated. RESULTS: TAS-102 plus bevacizumab had an ICER of $21,534 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with TAS-102 monotherapy. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that TAS-102 monotherapy was more cost-effective than TAS-102 and bevacizumab combination therapy at a willingness-to-pay of under $50,000 per QALY gained.

34215,Telemammography for breast cancer screening: a cost-effective approach in Argentina.,"Objectives: Argentina is a low and middle-income country (LMIC) with a highly fragmented healthcare system that conflicts with access to healthcare stated by the country's Universal Health Coverage plan. A tele-mammography network could improve access to breast cancer screening decreasing its mortality. This research aims to conduct an economic evaluation of the implementation of a tele-mammography program to improve access to healthcare. Methods: A cost-utility analysis was performed to explore the incremental benefit of annual tele-mammography screening for at-risk Argentinian women over 40 years old. A Markov model was developed to simulate annual mammography or tele-mammography screening in two hypothetical population-based cohorts of asymptomatic women. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model structure uncertainty was also explored to test the robustness of the results. Results: It was estimated that 31 out of 100 new cases of breast cancer would be detected by mammography and 39/100 by tele-mammography. The model returned an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £26 051/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) which is lower than the WHO-recommended threshold of £26 288/QALY for Argentina. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed the ICER is most sensitive to the uptake and sensitivity of the screening tests. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed tele-mammography is cost-effective in 59% of simulations. Discussion: Tele-mammography should be considered for adoption as it could improve access to expertise in underserved areas where adherence to screening protocols is poor. Disaggregated data by province is needed for a better- informed policy decision. Telemedicine could also be beneficial in ensuring the continuity of care when health systems are under stress like in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: There is a 59% chance that tele-mammography is cost-effective compared to mammography for at-risk Argentinian women over 40- years old, and should be adopted to improve access to healthcare in underserved areas of the country.",2021-01-41751,34281995,BMJ Health Care Inform,"Malek Pascha, Victoria Alba",2021,28 / 1,,No,34281995,"Malek Pascha, Victoria Alba; Li Sun; Ramiro Gilardino; Rosa Legood; Telemammography for breast cancer screening: a cost-effective approach in Argentina., BMJ Health Care Inform, 2021 Jul; 28(1):",QALY,Argentina,"Malignant neoplasms, breast and female genital organs",Screening,annual telemammography screening vs. current screening strategy,at risk of breast cancer but had not yet been diagnosed,75 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,26051.32,United Kingdom,2018,37564.75
34220,Health Impact and Cost-effectiveness Assessment for the Introduction of Universal Varicella Vaccination in Switzerland.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is a highly contagious infectious disease with substantial health and economic burden to society. Universal varicella vaccination (UVV) is not yet recommended by the Swiss National Immunization Program, which instead recommends catch-up immunization for children, adolescents and adults 11-40 years of age who have no reliable history of varicella or are varicella-zoster virus-IgG seronegative. The objective of this study was to perform an assessment of health impact and cost-effectiveness comparing UVV with current practice and recommendations in Switzerland. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model for varicella was adapted to Switzerland comparing 2 base-case schedules (no infant vaccination and 10% coverage with infant vaccination) to 3 different UVV schedules using quadrivalent (varicella vaccine combined with measles-mumps-rubella) and standalone varicella vaccines administered at different ages. Modeled UVV coverage rates were based on current measles-mumps-rubella coverage of approximately 95% (first dose) and 90% (second dose). Direct medical costs and societal perspectives were considered, with cost and outcomes discounted and calculated over a 50-year time horizon. RESULTS: UVV would reduce the number of varicella cases by 88%-90%, hospitalizations by 62%-69% and deaths by 75%-77%. UVV would increase direct medical costs by Swiss Franc (CHF) 39-49 (US $43-54) per capita and costs from a societal perspective by CHF 32-40 (US $35-44). Incremental quality-adjusted life-years per capita increased by 0.0012-0.0014.

34228,Health Impact and Cost-effectiveness Assessment for the Introduction of Universal Varicella Vaccination in Switzerland.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is a highly contagious infectious disease with substantial health and economic burden to society. Universal varicella vaccination (UVV) is not yet recommended by the Swiss National Immunization Program, which instead recommends catch-up immunization for children, adolescents and adults 11-40 years of age who have no reliable history of varicella or are varicella-zoster virus-IgG seronegative. The objective of this study was to perform an assessment of health impact and cost-effectiveness comparing UVV with current practice and recommendations in Switzerland. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model for varicella was adapted to Switzerland comparing 2 base-case schedules (no infant vaccination and 10% coverage with infant vaccination) to 3 different UVV schedules using quadrivalent (varicella vaccine combined with measles-mumps-rubella) and standalone varicella vaccines administered at different ages. Modeled UVV coverage rates were based on current measles-mumps-rubella coverage of approximately 95% (first dose) and 90% (second dose). Direct medical costs and societal perspectives were considered, with cost and outcomes discounted and calculated over a 50-year time horizon. RESULTS: UVV would reduce the number of varicella cases by 88%-90%, hospitalizations by 62%-69% and deaths by 75%-77%. UVV would increase direct medical costs by Swiss Franc (CHF) 39-49 (US $43-54) per capita and costs from a societal perspective by CHF 32-40 (US $35-44).

34238,Health Impact and Cost-effectiveness Assessment for the Introduction of Universal Varicella Vaccination in Switzerland.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is a highly contagious infectious disease with substantial health and economic burden to society. Universal varicella vaccination (UVV) is not yet recommended by the Swiss National Immunization Program, which instead recommends catch-up immunization for children, adolescents and adults 11-40 years of age who have no reliable history of varicella or are varicella-zoster virus-IgG seronegative. The objective of this study was to perform an assessment of health impact and cost-effectiveness comparing UVV with current practice and recommendations in Switzerland. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model for varicella was adapted to Switzerland comparing 2 base-case schedules (no infant vaccination and 10% coverage with infant vaccination) to 3 different UVV schedules using quadrivalent (varicella vaccine combined with measles-mumps-rubella) and standalone varicella vaccines administered at different ages. Modeled UVV coverage rates were based on current measles-mumps-rubella coverage of approximately 95% (first dose) and 90% (second dose). Direct medical costs and societal perspectives were considered, with cost and outcomes discounted and calculated over a 50-year time horizon. RESULTS: UVV would reduce the number of varicella cases by 88%-90%, hospitalizations by 62%-69% and deaths by 75%-77%.

34244,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a people-centred care model for community-living older people versus usual care ─ A randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: There is a need for effective and cost-effective interprofessional care models that support older people to maintain their quality of life (QoL) and physical performance to live longer independently in their own homes. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate effectiveness, QoL and physical performance, and cost-utility of a people-centred care model (PCCM), including the contribution of clinically trained pharmacists, compared with that of usual care in primary care. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a two-year follow-up was conducted. The participants were multimorbid community-living older people, aged ≥75 years. The intervention comprised an at-home patient interview, health review, pharmacist-led clinical medication review, an interprofessional team meeting, and nurse-led care coordination and health support. At the baseline and at the 1-year and 2-year follow-ups, QoL (SF-36, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) and physical performance (SPPB, Short Performance Physical Battery) were measured. Additionally, a physical dimension component summary in the SF-36 was calculated. The SF-36 data were transformed into SF-6D scores to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Healthcare resource use were collected and transformed into costs. A healthcare payer perspective was adopted. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, and one-way sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: No statistically or clinically significant differences were observed between the usual care (n = 126) and intervention group (n = 151) patients in their QoL; at the 2-year follow-up the mean difference was -0.02, (95 % CI -0.07; 0.04,p = 0.56). While the mean difference between the groups in physical performance at the 2-year follow-up was -1.02, (-1.94;-0.10,p = 0.03), between the physical component summary scores it was -7.3, (-15.2; 0.6,p = 0.07). The ICER was -73 638€/QALY, hence, the developed PCCM dominated usual care, since it was more effective and less costly. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-utility analysis showed that the PCCM including pharmacist-led medication review dominated usual care.

34245,Cost-utility of as-needed combination low-dose budesonide-formoterol in adolescents mild asthma.,"BACKGROUND: Previously evidence has demonstrated that as-needed combination low-dose budesonide-formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations compared with short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) reliever therapy in an adolescent with mild asthma. Concerns as if the extra benefit offered by this drug outweighs the additional cost. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of as-needed combination low-dose budesonide-formoterol compared with short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) reliever therapy in adolescents with mild asthma in Colombia. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with mild asthma in Colombia. Total costs and QALYs of low-dose budesonide-formoterol compared with short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $19,000. RESULTS: The model suggests a potential gain of 0.03 QALYs and per patient per year on low-dose budesonide-formoterol. The cost difference per person was US$-4 per patient per year in favor of budesonide- formoterol. The position of dominance negates the need to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In the one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, our base-case results were robust to variations of all assumptions and parameters. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, low-dose budesonide-formoterol as a reliever was found to be cost-effective when added to usual care in adolescents with mild asthma.

34246,Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Health Economic Evaluation to Assess the Feasibility in Nigeria.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease reflects a major burden of non-communicable disease in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Early detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), as a preventive measure against stroke, is currently not in the scope of the World Health Organization recommendation to reduce cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that screening for AF would be an important approach to determine the true AF prevalence in the general population in African countries and to identify asymptomatic AF patients at risk for stroke to optimize prevention. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to study the health-economic impact of AF screening in Nigeria over a life-time horizon. The patient population explored in the model was a population of newly detected AF cases that would be diagnosed with a one-time systematic screening for AF with a single lead ECG device in community health centres across Nigeria. CONCLUSIONS: The health gain per newly detected AF patient (N = 31,687) was 0.41 QALY at a cost of $5,205 per patient with 100% NOAC use, leading to an ICER of $12,587 per QALY gained. The intervention was cost-effective with a 99.9% warfarin use with an ICER of $1,363 per QALY gained. The total cost of a single screening session was $7.3 million for the total screened population in Nigeria or $1.60 per patient screened. Screening for AF to detect AF patients in need for stroke prevention can be a cost-effective intervention in the Sub-Saharan region, depending on type of anticoagulant used and drug costs.",2021-01-42185,34900571,Glob Heart,M S Jacobs,2021,16 / 1,80,No,34900571,"M S Jacobs; A M Adeoye; M O Owolabi; R G Tieleman; M J Postma; M van Hulst; Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Health Economic Evaluation to Assess the Feasibility in Nigeria., Glob Heart, 2021; 16(1):; 80",QALY,Nigeria,Other forms of heart disease,Screening,warfarin vs. no treatment,newly detected atrial fibrillation,Not Stated,55 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",4.00,4.00,12587,United States,2018,13582.65
34247,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Hepatic Arterial Infusion of FOLFOX Combined Sorafenib for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Portal Vein Invasion.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil (FOLFOX) plus sorafenib has a more desirable effect versus sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein invasion. However, considering the high cost of hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy (HAIC), this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HAIC plus sorafenib (SoraHAIC) versus standard care for HCC patients from the Chinese health system perspective. METHODS: A Markov multi-state model was constructed to simulate the disease course and source consumption of SoraHAIC. Costs of primary therapeutic drugs were calculated based on the national bid price, and hepatic artery catheterization fee was collected from the Fujian Provincial Price Bureau. Clinical data, other costs, and utility values were extracted from references. Primary outcomes included life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The robustness of model was verified by uncertainty sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: SoraHAIC gained 1.18 QALYs (1.68 LYs) at a cost of $65,254, while the effectiveness and cost of sorafenib were 0.52 QALYs (0.79 LYs) and $14,280, respectively. The ICER of SoraHAIC vs sorafenib was $77,132/QALY ($57,153/LY). Parameter that most influenced the ICER was utility of PFS state. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed that SoraHAIC was not cost-effective in the WTP threshold of 3*Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of China ($30,492/QALY). But about 38.8% of the simulations were favorable to SoraHAIC at the WTP threshold of 3*GDP per capita of Beijing ($72,000/QALY).

34248,Cost-Effectiveness of Improved Hypertension Management in India through Increased Treatment Coverage and Adherence: A Mathematical Modeling Study.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective and affordable treatments, only 14% of hypertensive Indians have controlled blood pressure. Increased hypertension treatment coverage (the proportion of individuals initiated on treatment) and adherence (proportion of patients taking medicines as recommended) promise population health gains. However, governments and other payers will not invest in a large-scale hypertension control program unless it is both affordable and effective. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a national hypertension control intervention implemented across the private and public sector facilities in India could save overall costs of CVD prevention and treatment. METHODS: We developed a discrete-time microsimulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of population-level hypertension control intervention in India for combinations of treatment coverage and adherence targets. Input clinical parameters specific to India were obtained from large-scale surveys such as the Global Burden of Disease as well as local clinical trials. Input hypertensive medication cost parameters were based on government contracts. The model projected antihypertensive treatment costs, avoided CVD care costs, changes in disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) and incremental cost per DALY averted (represented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or ICER) over 20 years. RESULTS: Over 20 years, at 70% coverage and adherence, the hypertension control intervention would avert 1.68% DALYs and be cost-saving overall. Increasing adherence (while keeping coverage constant) resulted in greater improvement in cost savings compared to increasing coverage (while keeping adherence constant). Results were most sensitive to the cost of antihypertensive medication, but the intervention remained highly cost-effective under all one-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: A national hypertension control intervention in India would most likely be budget neutral or cost-saving if the intervention can achieve and maintain high levels of both treatment coverage and adherence.",2021-01-42175,34040950,Glob Heart,Hemanshu Das,2021,16 / 1,37,No,34040950,"Hemanshu Das; Andrew Moran; Anupam Pathni; Bhawna Sharma; Abhishek Kunwar; Sarang Deo; Cost-Effectiveness of Improved Hypertension Management in India through Increased Treatment Coverage and Adherence: A Mathematical Modeling Study., Glob Heart, 2021 May 10; 16(1):; 37",QALY,India,Hypertensive diseases,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",70% coverage and adherence vs. 17% coverage and 30% adherence,Not Stated,69 Years,40 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"20 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,2338,United States,2019,2478.04
34249,The Cost-Effectiveness of Surgical Intervention for Spinal Metastases: A Model-Based Evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Operative and nonoperative treatments for spinal metastases are expensive interventions with a high rate of complications. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of a surgical procedure compared with nonoperative management as treatment for spinal metastases. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model with health states defined by ambulatory status and estimated the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs for operative and nonoperative management of spine metastases. We considered 2 populations: 1 in which patients presented with independent ambulatory status and 1 in which patients presented with nonambulatory status due to acute (e.g., <48 hours) metastatic epidural compression. We defined the efficacy of each treatment as a likelihood of maintaining, or returning to, independent ambulation. Transition probabilities for the model, including the risks of mortality and becoming dependent or nonambulatory, were obtained from secondary data analysis and published literature. Costs were determined from Medicare reimbursement schedules. We conducted analyses over patients' remaining life expectancy from a health system perspective and discounted outcomes at 3% per year. We conducted sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in data inputs. RESULTS: Among patients presenting as independently ambulatory, QALYs were 0.823 for operative treatment and 0.800 for nonoperative treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a surgical procedure was $899,700 per QALY. Among patients presenting with nonambulatory status, those undergoing surgical intervention accumulated 0.813 lifetime QALY, and those treated nonoperatively accumulated 0.089 lifetime QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a surgical procedure was $48,600 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of a surgical procedure was most sensitive to the variability of its efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the value to society of a surgical procedure for spinal metastases varies according to the features of the patient population. In patients presenting as nonambulatory due to acute neurologic compromise, surgical intervention provides good value (ICER, $48,600 per QALY).

34251,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Fourth- or Further-Line Ripretinib in Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.,"BACKGROUND: The INVICTUS trial assessed the efficacy and safety of ripretinib compared with placebo in the management of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. METHOD: We used a Markov model with three health states: progression-free disease, progression disease and death. We parameterized the model from time-to-event data (progression-free survival, overall survival) of ripretinib and placebo arms in the INVICTUS trial and extrapolated to a patient's lifetime horizon. Estimates of health state utilities and costs were based on clinical trial data and the published literature. The outcomes of this model were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Uncertainty was tested via univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The base-case model projected improved outcomes (by 0.29 QALYs) and additional costs (by $70,251) and yielded an ICER of $244,010/QALY gained for ripretinib versus placebo. The results were most sensitive to progression rates, the price of ripretinib, and health state utilities. The ICER was most sensitive to overall survival. When overall survival in the placebo group was lower, the ICER dropped to $127,399/QALY. The ICER dropped to $150,000/QALY when the monthly cost of ripretinib decreased to $14,057. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that ripretinib was the cost-effective therapy in 41.1% of simulations at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000. CONCLUSION: As the fourth- or further-line therapy in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, ripretinib is not cost-effective in the US.

34255,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of immunotherapy in metastatic solid tumours in Austria by applying the ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) version 1.1.,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment is a breakthrough in managing metastatic solid tumours, but its use is associated with a high financial burden for public health care systems. Validated tools such as the European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) are frameworks that might help to better assess the clinical benefit of these novel innovative cancer drugs. METHODS: Here, we systematically analysed the number of European Medicines Agency-approved ICIs labels with an ESMO-MCBS grade <4 and the impact of the ICIs on incremental costs, gain of life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in the Austrian population. RESULTS: Of 23 ICIs treatment settings, we identified three clinical scenarios in metastatic solid cancers with an ESMO-MCBS grade <4 with no otherwise approved alternatives. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the addition of first-line atezolizumab increased QALYs by 0.33 compared with nab-paclitaxel only, with an incremental cost per QALY of €143 853. In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the addition of first-line atezolizumab increased the QALY by 0.09, with an incremental cost per QALY of €373 256, and the addition of first-line durvalumab increased the QALYs by 0.11, with an incremental cost per QALY of €589 527. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, most of the approved ICIs carry significant clinical benefit (≥4).

34258,Cost-effectiveness of Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis After Hospitalization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a 2- to 3-fold greater risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than patients without IBD, with increased risk during hospitalization that persists postdischarge. We determined the cost-effectiveness of postdischarge VTE prophylaxis among hospitalized patients with IBD. METHODS: A decision tree compared inpatient prophylaxis alone vs 4 weeks of postdischarge VTE prophylaxis with 10 mg/day of rivaroxaban. Our primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 1 year, and strategies were compared using a willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY from a societal perspective. Costs (in 2020 $USD), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 VTE and VTE death were calculated. Deterministic 1-way and probabilistic analyses assessed model uncertainty. RESULTS: Prophylaxis with rivaroxaban resulted in 1.68-higher QALYs per 1000 persons compared with no postdischarge prophylaxis at an incremental cost of $185,778 per QALY. The NNT to prevent a single VTE was 78, whereas the NNT to prevent a single VTE-related death was 3190. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that higher VTE risk >4.5% and decreased cost of rivaroxaban ≤$280 can reduce the ICER to <$100,000/QALY.

CONCLUSIONS: Four weeks of postdischarge VTE prophylaxis results in higher QALYs compared with inpatient prophylaxis alone and prevents 1 postdischarge VTE among 78 patients with IBD.

34260,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Durvalumab Plus Chemotherapy in the First-Line Treatment of Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: In the CASPIAN trial, durvalumab + chemotherapy demonstrated significant improvements in overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in patients with extensive-stage SCLC from the US healthcare system perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A comprehensive Markov model was adapted to evaluate cost and effectiveness of durvalumab combination versus platinum/etoposide alone in the first-line therapy of extensive-stage SCLC based on data from the CASPIAN study. The main endpoints included total costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-e-ectiveness ratios (ICERs). Model robustness was assessed with sensitivity analysis, and additional subgroup analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Durvalumab + chemotherapy therapy resulted in an additional 0.27 LYs and 0.20 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $464,711.90 per QALY versus the chemotherapy treatment. The cost of durvalumab has the greatest inﬂuence on this model. Subgroup analyses showed that the ICER remained higher than $150,000/QALY (the willingness-to-pay threshold in the United States) across all patient subgroups.

34261,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Triple Combination Preparations in the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Objectives: This study analyzed the long-term cost-effectiveness of fluticasone/umeclidinium/vilanterol triple combination (FF/UMEC/VI) vs. budesonide/formoterol double combination (BUD/FOR) in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and provides evidence for COPD treatment decisions. Methods: From the perspective of the healthcare system, a Markov model was established that consists of four states-stable period, non-severely deteriorating period, severely deteriorating period, and death-according to real-world COPD progression. The model period comprises 6 months, with a cycle length of 14 years. The initial state, transition probabilities, costs, and utility data were collected from the FULFIL trial, published literature, hospital record surveys, and China Health Statistics Yearbook. The discount rate was 5%, and the threshold was set as the Chinese per capita GDP in 2020 (¥72,447). The cost, utility, transition probabilities, and discount rate were calculated through TreeagePro11 software. The results were analyzed via one-way factor analysis and probability sensitivity analysis. Results: The baseline study shows that the 14-year treatment for FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR groups are ¥199,765.55 and ¥173,030.05 with effectiveness at 8.54 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 7.73 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is ¥33,006.80/QALY, which is below the threshold. A tornado diagram of a one-way sensitivity analysis shows that the top three factors that affected the results are the non-severe deterioration rates of FF/UMEC/VI, the cost of FF/UMEC/VI and the non-severe deterioration rates of BUD/FOR. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that FF/UMEC/VI (compared to BUD/FOR) can be made cost-effective under the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (¥38,000). Furthermore, the likelihood of cost-effectiveness increases with a higher WTP. Conclusions: Compared with the double combination (BUD/FOR), the triple combination (FF/UMEC/VI) is more cost-effective under the Chinese per capita GDP threshold.",2021-01-42157,34395374,Front Public Health,Yikang Zhou,2021,9 /,713258,No,34395374,"Yikang Zhou; Enwu Long; Qian Xu; Lei Wang; Xuehua Jiang; Ming Hu; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Triple Combination Preparations in the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease., Front Public Health, 2021; 9():; 713258",QALY,China,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Pharmaceutical,fluticasone vs. budesonide,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"14 Years, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,33006.8,China,2020,5005.3
34262,Surgical treatment is not cost-effective compared to nonoperative treatment for displaced distal radius fractures in patients 65 years and over.,"AIMS: The purpose was to compare operative treatment with a volar plate and nonoperative treatment of displaced distal radius fractures in patients aged 65 years and over in a cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed alongside a randomized controlled trial. A total of 50 patients were randomized to each group. We prospectively collected data on resource use during the first year post-fracture, and estimated costs of initial treatment, further operations, physiotherapy, home nursing, and production loss. Health-related quality of life was based on the Euro-QoL five-dimension, five-level (EQ-5D-5L) utility index, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated. RESULTS: The mean QALYs were 0.05 higher in the operative group during the first 12 months (p = 0.260). The healthcare provider costs were €1,533 higher per patient in the operative group: €3,589 in the operative group and 2,056 in the nonoperative group. With a suggested willingness to pay of €27,500 per QALY there was a 45% chance for operative treatment to be cost-effective. For both groups, the main costs were related to the primary treatment. The primary surgery was the main driver of the difference between the groups. The costs related to loss of production were high in both groups, despite high rates of retirement. Retirement rate was unevenly distributed between the groups and was not included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not cost-effective in patients aged 65 years and older compared to nonoperative treatment of displaced distal radius fractures in a healthcare perspective. Costs related to loss of production might change this in the future if the retirement age increases.

34263,SMART therapy in adolescent and adults patients with moderate persistent asthma: a cost-utility analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Recent asthma guidelines, recommends for persistent asthma as first alternative low dose inhaled budesonide-formoterol maintenance and reliever over fixed combination of low doses inhaled corticosteroids - long-acting beta-agonist, or fixed-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Concerns arise as to which of the proposed alternatives has the best possible cost-effectiveness profile. This study aimed to assess the health and economic consequences of SMART, fixed combination, and fixed-dose inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate-severe persistent asthma. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with persistent asthma. Total costs and QALYs of SMART, fixed combination, and fixed-dose inhaled corticosteroids were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $19,000. RESULTS: The model suggests a potential gain of 1.27 and 1.34 QALYs per patient per year on SMART respect to fixed combination and fixed-dose ICS respectively. We observed a reduction of US$4 in total discounted cost per person-year on SMART with respect to fixed combination and US$0.1 respect to fixed-dose ICS. In the deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, our base-case results were robust to variations of all assumptions and parameters.

34281,Clinical Outcome and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of CSII Versus MDI in Children and Adolescent With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in a Public Health Care System of China.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) vs. multiple daily injections (MDI) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) from a public health care system in developed areas of developing country, considering changes in glycemic Control, daily insulin requirements, lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), frequency of severe hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and diabetic complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adolescents with T1DM. Data were collected at baseline and the end of every year including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose, lipid profile, blood pressure, and adverse events (severe hypoglycemia and DKA). The Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) to simulate diabetes progression by utilizing the clinical data obtained from the two groups. The main outcome measures were Life Expectancy, Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), Total Costs and Incremental Costs and Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of CSII compared with MDI in Chinese pediatric patients with T1DM in Qingdao City (60 years). RESULTS: Mean HbA1c values and daily insulin doses were significantly lower in those receiving CSII therapy throughout follow-up. Mean direct lifetime costs were ¥ 67,137 higher with CSII treatment than with MDI for pediatric patients. Treatment with CSII was associated with an improvement in life expectancy of 0.41 years for pediatric patients compared with MDI based on CORE diabetes model simulation. The corresponding gains in QALYs were 0.42. These data produced corresponding ICER is ¥ 161,815 per QALY for pediatric T1DM patients in Qingdao.

34282,Cost-effectiveness of a telemonitoring program (telEPOC program) in frequently admitted chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a typical disease among chronic and respiratory diseases. The costs associated with chronic disease care are rising dramatically, and this makes it necessary to redesign care processes, including new tools which allow the health system to be more sustainable without compromising on the quality of the care, compared to that currently provided. One approach may be to use information and communication technologies. In this context, we explored the cost-effectiveness of applying a telemonitoring system to a cohort of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with frequent readmissions (the telEPOC programme).We conducted an intervention study with a control group. The inclusion criteria used were having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (forced expiratory volume in the first second/forced vital capacity  < 70%) and having been hospitalised for exacerbation at least twice in the last year or three times in the last 2 years. We estimated the costs incurred by patients in each group and calculated the quality-adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Overall, 77 patients were included in the control group and 86 in the intervention group. The raw cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the cost of the telEPOC intervention was significantly lower than that of usual care, while there were no significant differences between the groups in effectiveness.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the intervention was €175,719.71 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.There were no differences between the intervention group (telemonitoring) and the control group (standard care) from the cost-effectiveness point of view.

34283,Cost Effectiveness of Splenic Artery Embolization versus Splenectomy after Trauma in the Netherlands.,"PURPOSE: To demonstrate that splenic artery embolization (SAE) is more cost-effective than splenectomy from a societal perspective in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-level data obtained from the SPLENIQ study were used to populate a health economic model and were supplemented with expert opinion when necessary. Propensity score matching was used to correct for baseline differences in injury severity scores. The health economic model consisted of 3 health states (complications after intervention, SAE failure, and recovery) and a dead state. Model outcomes were incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental costs of SAE over splenectomy. The Dutch health economic guidelines were followed. The model used a lifetime time horizon. Uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses. RESULTS: Patients undergoing SAE had a higher life expectancy than patients undergoing splenectomy. Incremental QALYs were 3.1 (mostly explained by difference in life expectancy), and incremental costs were €34,135 (explained by costs related to medical consumption and lost productivity in additional life years), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €11,010 per QALY. SAE was considered cost-effective in >95% of iterations using a threshold of €20,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: SAE results in more QALYs than splenectomy. Intervention costs for SAE are lower than that for splenectomy, but medical consumption and productivity costs in later years are higher for SAE due to better survival.

METHODS: We implemented a probabilistic cost-effectiveness model using a synthetic cohort of 16 181 men and 13 419 women intended to simulate the size of the Black, sexually active population in New Orleans ages 15-24 years. RESULTS: The Check It program cost $196 838 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $117 320-$287 555) to implement, saved 10.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 95% CI: 7.7-12.7 QALYs), and saved $140 950 (95% CI: -$197 018 to -$105 620) in medical costs per year. The program cost $5468 (95% CI: cost saving, $16 717) per QALY gained. All iterations of the probabilistic model returned cost-effectiveness ratios less than $50 000 per QALY gained.

34286,Mapping naso-ocular symptom scores to EQ-5D-5L utility values in Japanese cedar pollinosis.,"BACKGROUND: The total naso-ocular symptom score (TSS) is widely used as an endpoint to evaluate the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, it is not a generic preference-based measure. We sought to develop an algorithm for mapping between the TSS and health utility in Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP). We also performed a cost-utility analysis of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for JCP by using this algorithm. METHODS: Patients with JCP filled out the TSS questionnaire and EQ-5D-5L simultaneously during the pollen season in 2019 and in 2020. We estimated a direct utility mapping model by regressing responses to individual TSS questions directly onto utility. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of active SLIT to a placebo was determined by examining the drug expense and the estimated quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using a dataset from a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. RESULTS: A total of 238 records were included for analysis. The estimated utility decreased with increasing severity of rhinitis. Patients with comorbid asthma showed lower utility. A negative and significant correlation was seen between the TSS and utility in both 2019 and 2020. The estimated equations were: Y(utility) = -0.0161∗X(TSS) + 1.005 in non-asthmatic JCP patients. The ICER of active SLIT to the placebo was estimated to be 4,049,720 and 6,011,218 JPY/QALY in the first and second year, respectively.

34288,Determining cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening in urban Chinese populations using a state-transition Markov model.,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyses the cost-effectiveness of annual low-dose CT (LDCT) screening of high-risk cancer populations in Chinese urban areas. DESIGN: We used a Markov model to evaluate LDCT screening from a sociological perspective. SETTING: The data from two large lung cancer screening programmes in China were used. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 100 000 smokers who underwent annual LDCT screening until age 76. INTERVENTION: The study comprises five screening strategies, with the initial screening ages in both the screening strategies and their corresponding non-screening strategies being 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 years, respectively. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between screening and non-screening strategies at the same initial age was evaluated. RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, compared with those who were not screened, the specific mortality from lung cancer decreased by 18.52%-23.13% among those who underwent screening. The ICER of LDCT screening ranges from US$13 056.82 to US$15 736.06 per quality-adjusted life year, which is greater than one but less than three times the gross domestic product per capita in China. An initial screening age of 55 years is the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline analysis shows that annual LDCT screening of heavy smokers in Chinese urban areas is likely to be cost-effective. The sensitivity analysis reveals that sensitivity, specificity and the overdiagnosis rate influence the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening.

34289,Determining cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening in urban Chinese populations using a state-transition Markov model.,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyses the cost-effectiveness of annual low-dose CT (LDCT) screening of high-risk cancer populations in Chinese urban areas. DESIGN: We used a Markov model to evaluate LDCT screening from a sociological perspective. SETTING: The data from two large lung cancer screening programmes in China were used. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 100 000 smokers who underwent annual LDCT screening until age 76. INTERVENTION: The study comprises five screening strategies, with the initial screening ages in both the screening strategies and their corresponding non-screening strategies being 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 years, respectively. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between screening and non-screening strategies at the same initial age was evaluated. RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, compared with those who were not screened, the specific mortality from lung cancer decreased by 18.52%-23.13% among those who underwent screening. The ICER of LDCT screening ranges from US$13 056.82 to US$15 736.06 per quality-adjusted life year, which is greater than one but less than three times the gross domestic product per capita in China. An initial screening age of 55 years is the most cost-effective strategy.

We aimed to determine the value-for-money of nivolumab versus docetaxel in a Canadian and Swedish setting based on 5-year data. METHODS: These cost effectiveness analyses used partitioned survival models with three mutually exclusive health states: progression-free, progressed disease, and death. All clinical parameters were derived from two registration phase 3 randomized trials, CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057, with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Treatment duration was based on time-on-treatment data from the clinical trials. Costs were derived from published sources. The primary outcomes of the analyses were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The model input parameters for each analysis were chosen in line with guidance from the respective HTA authorities. RESULTS: From a Canadian payer perspective, the ICERs were CAN$140,753 per QALY in the squamous population, and CAN$173,804 per QALY in the non-squamous population, assuming a 10-year time horizon and a 5% discount rate for both costs and outcomes. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that changes to the discount rates for outcomes had the highest impact on the ICERs. In the Swedish analysis, the ICERs were SEK568,895 per QALY in the squamous population and SEK662,991 per QALY in the non-squamous population, assuming a 15-year time horizon, a 3% discount rate, and a 2-year maximum treatment duration for nivolumab. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICERs were most sensitive to changes in the discount rate for outcomes.

34297,Hospital-based evidence on cost-effectiveness of brucellosis diagnostic tests and treatment in Kenyan hospitals,"Hospitals in Kenya continue to use the Febrile Antigen Brucella Agglutination Test (FBAT) to diagnose brucellosis, despite reports showing its inadequacy. This study generated hospital-based evidence on the performance and cost-effectiveness of the FBAT, compared to the Rose Bengal Test (RBT).Twelve hospitals in western Kenya stored patient serum samples that were tested for brucellosis using the FBAT, and these were later re-tested using the RBT. Data on the running time and cost of the FBAT, and the treatment prescribed for brucellosis, were collected. The cost-effectiveness of the two tests, defined as the cost in US Dollars ($) per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted, was determined, and a basic sensitivity analysis was run to identify the most influential parameters. Over a 6-month period, 180 patient serum samples that were tested with FBAT at the hospitals were later re-tested with RBT at the field laboratory. Of these 24 (13.3%) and 3 (1.7%) tested positive with FBAT and RBT, respectively. The agreement between the FBAT and RBT was slight (Kappa = 0.12). Treatment prescribed following FBAT positivity varied between hospitals, and only one hospital prescribed a standardized therapy regimen.

34299,PET-Based Staging Is Cost-Effective in Early-Stage Follicular Lymphoma,"Rationale: The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of staging positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in early-stage follicular lymphoma from the Canadian health care system perspective. Methods: The study population was FL patients staged as early-stage using conventional CT imaging and planned for curative-intent radiation therapy (RT). A decision analytic model simulated the management after adding a staging PET/CT vs. using staging CT alone. In the no-PET/CT strategy, all patients proceeded to curative-intent RT as planned. In the PET/CT strategy, PET/CT information could result in an increased RT volume, switching to a non-curative approach, or no change in RT treatment as planned. Subsequent disease course was described using a state-transition cohort model over a 30-year time horizon. Diagnostic characteristics, probabilities, utilities and costs were derived from the literature. Baseline analysis was performed using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2019 Canadian dollars, CAD$) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted, evaluating net monetary benefit at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 simulations was performed. Costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 1.5%. Results: In the reference case scenario, staging PET/CT was the dominant strategy, resulting in an average lifetime cost saving of $3,165 and a gain of 0.32 QALYs. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, the PET/CT strategy remained the preferred strategy for all scenarios supported by available data. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the PET/CT strategy was strongly dominant in 77% of simulations (i.e., reduced cost and increased QALYs), and was cost-effective in 89% of simulations (i.e., either cost-saving or with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below $100,000/QALY). Conclusion: Our analysis shows that the use of PET/CT to stage early-stage FL patients reduces cost and improves QALYs. Patients with early-stage FL should undergo PET/CT prior to curative-intent RT.",2021-01-42300,34413148,J Nucl Med,Andrea Lo,2021,/,,No,34413148,"Andrea Lo; Lyndon James; Anca Prica; Adam Raymakers; Stuart Peacock; Melody Qu; Alex Louie; Kerry Savage; Laurie Sehn; David Hodgson; Joanna Yang; Hans Eich; Andrew Wirth; Hunink, M G Myriam; PET-Based Staging Is Cost-Effective in Early-Stage Follicular Lymphoma, J Nucl Med, 2021 Aug 19; ():",QALY,Canada,"Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue","Diagnostic, Medical Device",positron emission tomography/CT scanning for early-stage follicular lymphoma vs. no staging positron emission tomography/CT strategy in early-stage follicular lymphoma,low-grade (grades1–3A) FL staged as early-stage (stage I or II) using conventional CT imaging and planned for curative-intent radiation therapy,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"30 Years, Not Stated / None",1.50,1.50,-10212.9,Canada,2019,-8157.41
34300,Cost-utility analysis of dupilumab add on therapy versus standard therapy in adolescents and adults for severe asthma in Colombia.,"INTRODUCTION: Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. This drug raises concerns about the economic impact in scenarios with constrained resources. This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of dupilumab plus standard care (SoC) vs SoC alone in adolescents and adults with severe asthma and eosinophilic phenotype. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with uncontrolled allergic asthma in Colombia. Total costs and QALYs of standard therapy (ICS + LABA), add-on therapy with dupilumab, were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) value of $19,000. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed dupilumab was associated with higher annual annual per-patient costs (US$5,719 for dupilumab and US$1,214 for standard therapy) and higher QALYs than standard therapy (fe  4.06 QALYs vs 3.97 QALYs, respectively). . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimated was US$50,160 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Dupilumab is not cost-effective using a WTP of US$19000 per QALY threshold in Colombia. Our study provides evidence that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical practice guidelines and should be replicated to validate their results in other middle-income countries.",2021-01-41755,34860616,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,Jefferson Antonio Buendía,2021,/,1-6,No,34860616,"Jefferson Antonio Buendía; Patiño, Diana Guerrero; Cost-utility analysis of dupilumab add on therapy versus standard therapy in adolescents and adults for severe asthma in Colombia., Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res, 2021 Dec 3; ():; 1-6",QALY,Colombia,"Chronic lower respiratory diseases, Other respiratory diseases principally affecting the interstitium",Other,dupilumab vs. standard of care,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,45050,United States,2019,47748.34
