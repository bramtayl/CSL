28001,Is international volunteer surgery for cleft lip and cleft palate a cost-effective and justifiable intervention? A case study from East Asia,"Although surgery provided by international volunteers is increasingly common in the developing world, there have been few assessments of the cost-effectiveness of these activities. In this context, this study covered 15 years of experience of one international nongovernmental organization, Smile for Children, in providing cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (CP) surgical services in Vietnam.We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the program and its contributions to building local capacity. To assess the cost-effectiveness of CL/CP surgery performed during Smile for Children's missions in Vietnam, we analyzed the data from four annual missions, from 2007 to 2010. According to the 2003 World Health Organization Guide to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, we calculated cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted with and without age weighting. For the data from the 2010 mission, we repeated the same calculation but with and without considering opportunity cost for labor.The discounted cost per DALY averted averaged $68, ranging from $52 to $79 depending on the year of the mission. The average discounted cost per DALY averted with age weighting was $56 (range $43-$65). For the calculation that takes into account the volunteers' possible income loss as the labor cost of the mission in 2010, the cost per DALY averted without age weighting increased by 28%, from $76 to $97; and the cost per DALY averted with age weighting increased by 27%, from $63 to $80. Under all of these varying assumptions, the CL/CP program operated by Smile for Children is a cost-effective intervention using international criteria for cost-effectiveness.The contribution of the international volunteer surgical team to building in-country capacity is notable.

28005,Cost-effectiveness of early initiation of first-line combination antiretroviral therapy in Uganda,"ABSTRACT:Ugandan national guidelines recommend initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) at CD4+ T cell (CD4) count below 350 cell/?l, but the implementation of this is limited due to availability of medication. However, cART initiation at higher CD4 count increases survival, albeit at higher lifetime treatment cost. This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of initiating cART at a CD4 count between 250-350 cell/?l (early) versus <250 cell/?l (delayed).Life expectancy of cART-treated patients, conditional on baseline CD4 count, was modeled based on published literature. First-line cART costs $192 annually, with an additional $113 for patient monitoring. Delaying initiation of cART until the CD4 count falls below 250 cells/?l would incur the cost of the bi-annual CD4 count tests and routine maintenance care at $85 annually. We compared lifetime treatment costs and disability adjusted life-expectancy between early vs. delayed cART for ten baseline CD4 count ranges from 250-350 cell/?l. All costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually.Treatment delay varied from 6-18 months. Early cART initiation increased life expectancy from 1.5-3.5 years and averted 1.33-3.10 disability adjusted life years (DALY's) per patient. Lifetime treatment costs were $4,300-$5,248 for early initiation and $3,940-$4,435 for delayed initiation. The cost/DALY averted of the early versus delayed start ranged from $260-$270.In HIV-positive patients presenting with CD4 count between 250-350 cells/?l, immediate initiation of cART is a highly cost-effective strategy using the recommended one-time per capita GDP threshold of $490 reported for Uganda. This would constitute an efficient use of scarce health care funds.",2012-99-09700,22943068,BMC Public Health,Joseph Sempa,2012,12 /,736,No,22943068,"Joseph Sempa; Mark Ssennono; Andreas Kuznik; Mohammed Lamorde; Stefanie Sowinski; Aggrey Semeere; Sabine Hermans; Barbara Castelnuovo; Yukari C Manabe; Cost-effectiveness of early initiation of first-line combination antiretroviral therapy in Uganda, BMC Public Health, ; 12():1471-2458; 736",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"Initiating Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) early, consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine and either efavirenz or nevirapine vs. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) late (at CD4 count less than 250 cell/µlll),consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine and either efavirenz or nevirapine",CD4 count threshold of between 250-350 cells/uL,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,260,United States,2011,299.15

However, varying cost-effectiveness ratios among various HBIG therapies remain unclear. This study explored these differences in cost-effectiveness ratios.Four districts in Wuhan, China, were selected for the current study using stratified random sampling. Pregnant women who were positive for HB surface antigen (HBsAg) and who received prenatal care in district-level maternal and child health hospitals were interviewed. The mothers and their children underwent follow-up visits from the time of pregnancy until the children were six-and-a-half months old.A total of 324 cases completed the follow-up visits on a voluntary basis. Among the 324 HBsAg-positive pregnant women investigated, 60.49% (196/324) were injected with HBIG at different trimesters. A total of 249 neonates (76.85%) received an HBIG injection within 24 h after birth. The HBsAg-positive rate in infants was 5.56% (18/324).

28009,Cost-effectiveness analysis of an additional birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine to prevent perinatal transmission in a medical setting in Mozambique,"This study is the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of an additional birth dose of Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine administered by professional birth attendants in medical settings in a sub-Saharan country (Mozambique). The WHO has recommended the birth dose to prevent perinatal transmission of HBV. A Markov model was constructed to analyse the costs and effects associated with avoiding perinatal transmission of HBV through a birth dose vaccination in addition to the existing vaccination schedule in Mozambique. The comparator intervention is the existing vaccination schedule administered at 6-10-14 weeks. The analysis was conducted for the birth cohort of 2008. As the context is a low-income setting our main outcome measure was disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Transition probabilities, costs and effects were estimated based on a thorough literature review. One- to three-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainty in the data. We found an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the additional birth dose of 250.95 US$ per DALY averted. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of 441 US$, which was the GDP per capita for Mozambique in 2008, the findings show the additional birth dose to be highly cost-effective. However, one-way sensitivity analysis reveals that the outcome changes with parameter variation. To give unambiguous recommendations on introducing the birth dose in Mozambique, more information on the parameters that render the birth dose cost-ineffective in sensitivity analysis is needed. Those parameters are 'vaccine effectiveness', 'prevalence of HBV among mothers', 'the transition probability from chronic HBV to liver cancer' and 'the risk of perinatal transmission for mothers negative for the Hepatitis B ""e"" antigen (HBeAg)'. Parameter variation (one-way) showed the ICER to lie between 72 US$/DALY averted and 683 US$/DALY averted.",2012-99-09642,22902676,Vaccine,Corinna Klingler,2012,31 / 1,252-9,Yes,22902676,"Corinna Klingler; Andrea I Thoumi; Vinod S Mrithinjayam; Cost-effectiveness analysis of an additional birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine to prevent perinatal transmission in a medical setting in Mozambique, Vaccine, Dec/17/2012; 31(1):1873-2518; 252-9",DALY,Mozambique,Not Stated,Immunization,Additional birth dose of Hepatitis B administered as monovalent vaccination in addition to the existing vaccination schedule vs. Standard/Usual Care- Existing vaccination schedule administered at 6-10-14 weeks,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,250.95,United States,2008,301.66

28033,Volunteer orthopedic surgical trips in Nicaragua: a cost-effectiveness evaluation,"Injuries account for a substantial portion of the world's burden of disease and require effective surgical care. Volunteer surgical teams that form partnerships with hospitals help build local surgical capacity while providing immediate care. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of short orthopedic surgical volunteer trips as a method of reducing the global burden of surgical disease through both surgical and educational interventions.Data were collected from a scheduled volunteer trip to Leon, Nicaragua, in January 2011 as part of the Cooperaci?n Ortop?dica Americano Nicaraguense (COAN), a 501c3 nonprofit organization established in 2002. Costs are from the COAN provider prospective with an additional analysis to include the Nicaraguan provider variable costs. The total burden of musculoskeletal disease averted from the patients receiving surgical intervention was derived using the disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) framework and disability weights from the disease control priority project. The cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated by dividing the total costs by the total DALYs averted.A total of 44.78 DALYs were averted in this study, amounting to an average of 1.49 DALYs averted per patient. The average cost per patient from the COAN provider perspective was $525.64, and from both the COAN and Nicaraguan provider perspective it was $710.97. In the base case, cost-effectiveness was $352.15 per DALY averted, which is below twice the Nicaraguan per capita gross national income ($652.40).Volunteer orthopedic surgical trips are cost-effective in Nicaragua.

28034,A multifaceted intervention to improve the quality of care of children in district hospitals in Kenya: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"To improve care for children in district hospitals in Kenya, a multifaceted approach employing guidelines, training, supervision, feedback, and facilitation was developed, for brevity called the Emergency Triage and Treatment Plus (ETAT+) strategy. We assessed the cost effectiveness of the ETAT+ strategy, in Kenyan hospitals. Further, we estimate the costs of scaling up the intervention to Kenya nationally and potential cost effectiveness at scale.Our cost-effectiveness analysis from the provider's perspective used data from a previously reported cluster randomized trial comparing the full ETAT+ strategy (n?=?4 hospitals) with a partial intervention (n?=?4 hospitals). Effectiveness was measured using 14 process measures that capture improvements in quality of care; their average was used as a summary measure of quality. Economic costs of the development and implementation of the intervention were determined (2009 US$). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were defined as the incremental cost per percentage improvement in (average) quality of care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess uncertainty. The cost per child admission was US$50.74 (95% CI 49.26-67.06) in intervention hospitals compared to US$31.1 (95% CI 30.67-47.18) in control hospitals. Each percentage improvement in average quality of care cost an additional US$0.79 (95% CI 0.19-2.31) per admitted child. The estimated annual cost of nationally scaling up the full intervention was US$3.6 million, approximately 0.6% of the annual child health budget in Kenya. A ""what-if"" analysis assuming conservative reductions in mortality suggests the incremental cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted by scaling up would vary between US$39.8 and US$398.3.Improving quality of care at scale nationally with the full ETAT+ strategy may be affordable for low income countries such as Kenya.

28036,Immunization against Haemophilus Influenzae Type b in Iran; Cost-utility and Cost-benefit Analyses,"Haemophilus Influenzae type b (Hib) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Although its burden is considerably preventable by vaccine, routine vaccination against Hib has not been defined in the National Immunization Program of Iran. This study was performed to assess the cost-benefit and cost-utility of running an Hib vaccination program in Iran.Based on a previous systematic review and meta-analysis for vaccine efficacy, we estimated the averted DALYs (Disability adjusted life years) and cost-benefit of vaccination. Different acute invasive forms of Hib infection and the permanent sequels were considered for estimating the attributed DALYs. We used a societal perspective for economic evaluation and included both direct and indirect costs of alternative options about vaccination. An annual discount rate of 3% and standard age-weighting were used for estimation. To assess the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis was performed.The incidence of Hib infection was estimated 43.0 per 100000, which can be reduced to 6.7 by vaccination. Total costs of vaccination were estimated at US$ 15,538,129. Routine vaccination of the 2008 birth cohort would prevent 4079 DALYs at a cost per averted-DALY of US$ 4535. If we consider parents' loss of income and future productivity loss of children, it would save US$ 8,991,141, with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.14 in the base-case analysis. Sensitivity analysis showed a range of 0.78 to 3.14 for benefit-to-cost ratios.Considering costs per averted DALY, vaccination against Hib is a cost-effective health intervention in Iran, and allocating resources for routine vaccination against Hib seems logical.",2012-99-09202,22708030,Int J Prev Med,Maziar Moradi-Lakeh,2012,3 / 5,332-40,No,22708030,"Maziar Moradi-Lakeh; Sareh Shakerian; Abdoulreza Esteghamati; Immunization against Haemophilus Influenzae Type b in Iran; Cost-utility and Cost-benefit Analyses, Int J Prev Med, ; 3(5):2008-8213; 332-40",DALY,Iran,Not Stated,Immunization,"Haemophilus Influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in 3 doeses, National Immunization Program of Iran vs. None",Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,4535,United States,2010,5382.6
28037,Projected health impact and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination among children <5 years of age in China,"Two rotavirus vaccines have been licensed globally since 2006. In China, only a lamb rotavirus vaccine is licensed and several new rotavirus vaccines are in development. Data regarding the projected health impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination of children in China against rotavirus will assist policy makers in developing recommendations for vaccination.Using a Microsoft Excel model, we compared the national health and economic burden of rotavirus disease in China with and without a vaccination program. Model inputs included 2007 data on burden and cost of rotavirus outcomes (deaths, hospitalizations, outpatient visits), projected vaccine efficacy, coverage, and cost. Cost-effectiveness was measured in US dollars per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) and US dollars per life saved.A 2-dose rotavirus vaccination program could annually avert 3013 (62%) deaths, 194,794 (59%) hospitalizations and 1,333,356 (51%) outpatient visits associated with rotavirus disease in China. The medical break-even price of the vaccine is $1.19 per dose. From a societal perspective, a vaccination program would be highly cost-effective in China at the vaccine price of $2.50 to $5 per dose, and be cost-effective at the price of $10 to $20 per dose.A national rotavirus vaccination program could be a cost-effective measure to effectively reduce deaths, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits due to rotavirus disease in China.",2012-99-09356,22705174,Vaccine,Na Liu,2012,30 / 48,6940-5,Yes,22705174,"Na Liu; Catherine Yen; Zhao-Yin Fang; Jacqueline E Tate; Baoming Jiang; Umesh D Parashar; Guang Zeng; Zhao-Jun Duan; Projected health impact and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination among children <5 years of age in China, Vaccine, Nov/6/2012; 30(48):1873-2518; 6940-5",DALY,China,Not Stated,Immunization,2-dose rotavirus vaccination program vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2007,Not Stated
28038,"An economic evaluation of the use of Japanese encephalitis vaccine in the expanded program of immunization of Guizhou province, China","Historically, China's Japanese encephalitis vaccination program was a mix of household purchase of vaccine and government provision of vaccine in some endemic provinces. In 2006, Guizhou, a highly endemic province in South West China, integrated JE vaccine into the provincial Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI); later, in 2007 China fully integrated 28 provinces into the national EPI, including Guizhou, allowing for vaccine and syringe costs to be paid at the national level. We conducted a retrospective economic analysis of JE integration into EPI in Guizhou province.We modeled two theoretical cohorts of 100,000 persons for 65 years; one using JE live-attenuated vaccine in EPI (first dose: 95% coverage and 94.5% efficacy; second dose: 85% coverage and 98% efficacy) and one not. We assumed 60% sensitivity of surveillance for reported JE rates, 25% case fatality, 30% chronic disability and 3% discounting. We reviewed acute care medical records and interviewed a sample of survivors to estimate direct and indirect costs of illness. We reviewed the EPI offices expenditures in 2009 to estimate the average Guizhou program cost per vaccine dose.Use of JE vaccine in EPI for 100,000 persons would cost 434,898 US$ each year (46% of total cost due to vaccine) and prevent 406 JE cases, 102 deaths, and 122 chronic disabilities (4554 DALYs). If we ignore future cost savings and only use EPI program cost, the program would cost 95.5 US$/DALY, less than China Gross Domestic Product per capita in 2009 (3741 US$). From a cost-benefit perspective taking into account future savings, use of JE vaccine in EPI for a 100,000-person cohort would lead to savings of 1,591,975 US$ for the health system and 11,570,989 US$ from the societal perspective.In Guizhou, China, use of JE vaccine in EPI is a cost effective investment.

28039,Estimating the Burden of Disease from Unsafe Injections in India: A Cost-benefit Assessment of the Auto-disable Syringe in a Country with Low Blood-borne Virus Prevalence,"Unsafe medical injections are a prevalent risk factor for viral hepatitis and HIV in India.This review undertakes a cost-benefit assessment of the auto-disable syringe, now being introduced to prevent the spread of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).The World Health Organization methods for modeling the global burden of disease from unsafe medical injections are reproduced, correcting for the concentrated structure of the HIV epidemic in India. A systematic review of risk factor analyses in India that investigate injection risks is used in the uncertainty analysis.The median population attributable fraction for hepatitis B carriage associated with recent injections is 46%, the median fraction of hepatitis C infections attributed to unsafe medical injections is 38%, and the median fraction of incident HIV infections attributed to medical injections is 12% in India. The modeled incidence of blood-borne viruses suggests that introducing the auto-disable syringe will impose an incremental cost of $46-48 per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The epidemiological evidence suggests that the incremental cost of introducing the auto-disable syringe for all medical injections is between $39 and $79 per DALY averted.The auto-disable syringe is a cost-effective alternative to the reuse of syringes in a country with low prevalence of blood-borne viruses.",2012-99-09184,22654281,Indian J Community Med,Savanna Reid,2012,37 /,89-94,No,22654281,"Savanna Reid; Estimating the Burden of Disease from Unsafe Injections in India: A Cost-benefit Assessment of the Auto-disable Syringe in a Country with Low Blood-borne Virus Prevalence, Indian J Community Med, ; 37():1998-3581; 89-94",DALY,India,Not Stated,Medical Device,"Use of auto-disable syringe for medical injections to prevent the spread of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus & HIV vs. Standard/Usual Care",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,46,United States,2010,54.6

The case of a rural Ghanaian District,"Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of two strategies of home management of under-five fevers in Ghana - treatment using antimalarials only (artesunate-amodiaquine - AAQ) and combined treatment using antimalarials and antibiotics (artesunate-amodiaquine plus amoxicillin - AAQ + AMX). Methods We assessed the costs and cost-effectiveness of AAQ and AAQ + AMX compared with a control receiving standard care. Data were collected as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial with a step-wedged design. Approximately, 12 000 children aged 2-59 months in Dangme West District in southern Ghana were covered. Community health workers delivered the interventions. Costs were analysed from societal perspective, using anaemia cases averted, under-five deaths averted and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted as effectiveness measures. Results Total economic costs for the interventions were US$ 204 394.72 (AAQ) and US$ 260 931.49 (AAQ + AMX). Recurrent costs constituted 89% and 90% of the total direct costs of AAQ and AAQ + AMX, respectively. Deaths averted were 79.1 (AAQ) and 79.9 (AAQ + AMX), with DALYs averted being 2264.79 (AAQ) and 2284.57 (AAQ + AMX). The results show that cost per anaemia case averted were US$ 150.18 (AAQ) and US$ 227.49 (AAQ + AMX) and cost per death averted was US$ 2585.58 for AAQ and US$ 3272.20 for AAQ + AMX. Cost per DALY averted were US$ 90.25 (AAQ) and US$ 114.21 (AAQ + AMX). Conclusion Both AAQ and AAQ + AMX approaches were cost-effective, each averting one DALY at less than the standard US$ 150 threshold recommended by the World Health Organization.

Obstructed labor (OL), most commonly treated with Caesarean delivery, has been identified as a major contributor to global maternal morbidity and mortality. We used economic and epidemiological modeling to estimate the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted and benefit-cost ratio of treating OL with Caesarean delivery for 49 countries identified as providing an insufficient number of Caesarean deliveries to meet demand.Using publicly available data and explicit economic assumptions, we estimated that the cost per DALY (3,0,0) averted for providing Caesarean delivery for OL ranged widely, from $251 per DALY averted in Madagascar to $3,462 in Oman. The median cost per DALY averted was $304. Benefit-cost ratios also varied, from 0.6 in Zimbabwe to 69.9 in Gabon. The median benefit-cost ratio calculated was 6.0. The main limitation of this study is an assumption that lack of surgical capacity is the main factor responsible for DALYs from OL.Using the World Health Organization's cost-effectiveness standards, investing in Caesarean delivery can be considered ""highly cost-effective"" for 48 of the 49 countries included in this study.

The study examined 25 countries eligible for funding through the GAVI Alliance.For each country we estimate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of vaccination for each wealth quintile assuming current vaccination patterns and for a scenario where vaccine coverage is equalized to the highest quintile's coverage. In the case of India, variations in coverage and risk proxies by state were modeled to estimate geographic distributional effects.In all countries, rates of vaccination were highest and risks of mortality were lowest in the top two wealth quintiles. However countries differ greatly in the relative inequities in these two underlying variables. Similarly, in all countries examined, the cost-effectiveness ratio for vaccination ($/Disability-Adjusted Life Year averted, DALY) is substantially greater in the higher quintiles (ranging from 2-10 times higher). In all countries, the greatest potential benefit of vaccination was in the poorest quintiles. However, due to reduced vaccination coverage, projected benefits for these quintiles were often lower. Equitable coverage was estimated to result in an 89% increase in mortality reduction for the poorest quintile and a 38% increase overall.Rotavirus vaccination is most cost-effective in low-income groups and regions. However in many countries, simply adding new vaccines to existing systems targets investments to higher income children, due to disparities in vaccination coverage.

In the case of India, variations in coverage and risk proxies by state were modeled to estimate geographic distributional effects.In all countries, rates of vaccination were highest and risks of mortality were lowest in the top two wealth quintiles. However countries differ greatly in the relative inequities in these two underlying variables. Similarly, in all countries examined, the cost-effectiveness ratio for vaccination ($/Disability-Adjusted Life Year averted, DALY) is substantially greater in the higher quintiles (ranging from 2-10 times higher). In all countries, the greatest potential benefit of vaccination was in the poorest quintiles. However, due to reduced vaccination coverage, projected benefits for these quintiles were often lower. Equitable coverage was estimated to result in an 89% increase in mortality reduction for the poorest quintile and a 38% increase overall.Rotavirus vaccination is most cost-effective in low-income groups and regions. However in many countries, simply adding new vaccines to existing systems targets investments to higher income children, due to disparities in vaccination coverage. Maximizing health benefits for the poorest children and value for money require increased attention to these distributional effects.",2012-99-08996,22520124,Vaccine,Richard Rheingans,2011,29 /,A15-23,Yes,22520124,"Richard Rheingans; Deborah Atherly; John Anderson; Distributional impact of rotavirus vaccination in 25 GAVI countries: estimating disparities in benefits and cost-effectiveness, Vaccine, ; 29 ():1873-2518; A15-23",DALY,Congo,Not Stated,Immunization,Rotavirus vaccination vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,28.2,United States,2010,33.47
