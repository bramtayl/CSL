30001,Newborn screening and prophylactic interventions for sickle cell disease in 47 countries in sub-Saharan Africa: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) constitutes a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Newborn screening and early subsequent clinical intervention can reduce early mortality and increase life expectancy, but have not been widely implemented in SSA. This analysis assesses the cost-effectiveness of a newborn screening and prophylactic intervention (NSPI) package for SCD in 47 SSA countries. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with annual cycles was built with infants either being screened using isoelectric focusing (IEF) or not screened. Confirmed positive cases received interventions including insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets, folic acid supplementation, prophylactic antimalarial and penicillin therapy, and vaccinations against bacterial infections. Estimates for the local incidence of SCD, the life expectancy of untreated children, the SCD disability weight, and the cost of screening laboratory tests were based on published sources. Among treated infants, the annual probability of mortality until 30 years of age was derived from a pediatric hospital-based cohort. The outcome of interest included a country-specific cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: Of 47 modeled countries in SSA, NSPI is almost certainly highly cost-effective in 24 countries (average cost per DALY averted: US$184); in 10 countries, it is cost-effective in the base case (average cost per DALY averted: US$285), but the results are subject to uncertainty; in the remaining 13, it is most likely not cost-effective. We observe a strong inverse relationship between the incidence rate of SCD and the cost per DALY averted. Newborn screening is estimated to be cost-effective as long as the incidence rate exceeds 0.2-0.3 %, although in some countries NSPI is cost-effective at incidence rates below this range. In total, NSPI could avert over 2.4 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) annually across SSA.

30023,Cost-effectiveness of community-based screening and treatment for chronic hepatitis B in The Gambia: an economic modelling analysis,"BACKGROUND: Despite the high burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in sub-Saharan Africa, absence of widespread screening and poor access to treatment leads to most people remaining undiagnosed until later stages of disease when prognosis is poor and treatment options are limited. We examined the cost-effectiveness of community-based screening and early treatment with antiviral therapy for HBV in The Gambia. METHODS: In this economic evaluation, we combined a decision tree with a Markov state transition model to compare a screen and treat intervention consisting of adult community-based screening using a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid test and subsequent HBV antiviral therapy versus current practice, in which there is an absence of publicly provided screening or treatment for HBV. We used data from the PROLIFICA study to parameterise epidemiological, primary screening, and cost information, and other model parameter inputs were obtained from a literature search. Outcome measures were cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted; cost per life-year saved; and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between current practice and the screen and treat intervention. Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective. Costs (expressed in 2013 US$) and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. FINDINGS: In The Gambia, where the prevalence of HBsAg is 8.8% in people older than 30 years, adult screening and treatment for HBV has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $540 per DALY averted, $645 per life-year saved, and $511 per QALY gained, compared with current practice. These ICERs are in line with willingness-to-pay levels of one times the country''s gross domestic product per capita ($487) per DALY averted, and remain robust over a wide range of epidemiological and cost parameter inputs. INTERPRETATION: Adult community-based screening and treatment for HBV in The Gambia is likely to be a cost-effective intervention.

30024,Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention in Malawi: Modeling the Impact and Cost of Focusing the Program by Client Age and Geography,"BACKGROUND: In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) in priority countries with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision (MC) prevalence. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), an estimated 5.8 million males had undergone VMMC by the end of 2013. Implementation experience has raised questions about the need to refocus VMMC programs on specific subpopulations for the greatest epidemiological impact and programmatic effectiveness. As Malawi prepared its national operational plan for VMMC, it sought to examine the impacts of focusing on specific subpopulations by age and region. METHODS: We used the Decision Makers'' Program Planning Toolkit, Version 2.0, to study the impact of scaling up VMMC to different target populations of Malawi. National MC prevalence by age group from the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey was scaled according to the MC prevalence for each district and then halved, to adjust for over-reporting of circumcision. In-country stakeholders advised a VMMC unit cost of $100, based on implementation experience. We derived a cost of $451 per patient-year for antiretroviral therapy from costs collected as part of a strategic planning exercise previously conducted in- country by UNAIDS. RESULTS: Over a fifteen-year period, circumcising males ages 10-29 would avert 75% of HIV infections, and circumcising males ages 10-34 would avert 88% of infections, compared to the current strategy of circumcising males ages 15-49. The Ministry of Health''s South West and South East health zones had the lowest cost per HIV infection averted. Moreover, VMMC met WHO''s definition of cost-effectiveness (that is, the cost per disability-adjusted life-year [DALY] saved was less than three times the per capita gross domestic product) in all health zones except Central East. Comparing urban versus rural areas in the country, we found that circumcising men in urban areas would be both cost-effective and cost-saving, with a VMMC cost per DALY saved of $120 USD and with 15 years of VMMC implementation resulting in lifetime HIV treatment costs savings of $331 million USD. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the age analyses and programmatic experience, Malawi''s VMMC operational plan focuses on males ages 10-34 in all districts in the South East and South West zones, as well as Lilongwe (an urban district in the Central zone). This plan covers 14 of the 28 districts in the country.",2016-99-22573,27410474,PLoS One,Katharine Kripke,2016,11 / 7,e0156521,No,27410474,"Katharine Kripke; Frank Chimbwandira; Zebedee Mwandi; Faustin Matchere; Melissa Schnure; Jason Reed; Delivette Castor; Sema Sgaier; Emmanuel Njeuhmeli; Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention in Malawi: Modeling the Impact and Cost of Focusing the Program by Client Age and Geography, PLoS One , 2016; 11(7):1932-6203; e0156521",DALY,Malawi,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,Increase voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) prevalence to 60% vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,,3.00,3.00,177,United States,2014,193.5

In the context of infectious diseases, assessing the impact and cost-effectiveness of such tools at the population level, accounting for both direct and indirect effects, is key to informing adoption of these tools. Point-of-care (POC) CD4 testing has been shown to be highly effective in increasing the proportion of HIV positive patients who initiate ART. We assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing POC CD4 testing at the population level in South Africa in a range of care contexts, using a dynamic compartmental model of HIV transmission, calibrated to the South African HIV epidemic. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the differences between POC and laboratory CD4 testing on the proportion linking to care following CD4 testing. Cumulative infections averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over one and three years. We estimated that POC CD4 testing introduced in the current South African care context can prevent 1.7% (95% CI: 0.4% - 4.3%) of new HIV infections over 1 year. In that context, POC CD4 testing was cost-effective 99.8% of the time after 1 year with a median estimated ICER of US$4,468/DALY averted. In healthcare contexts with expanded HIV testing and improved retention in care, POC CD4 testing only became cost-effective after 3 years. The results were similar when, in addition, ART was offered irrespective of CD4 count, and CD4 testing was used for clinical assessment. Our findings suggest that even if ART is expanded to all HIV positive individuals and HIV testing efforts are increased in the near future, POC CD4 testing is a cost-effective tool, even within a short time horizon.

30028,The health and economic benefits of the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (2000-2014),"BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF), also known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) targeted for elimination through a Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF). Between 2000 and 2014, the GPELF has delivered 5.6 billion treatments to over 763 million people. Updating the estimated health and economic benefits of this significant achievement is important in justifying the resources and investment needed for eliminating LF. METHOD: We combined previously established models to estimate the number of clinical manifestations and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted from three benefit cohorts (those protected from acquiring infection, those with subclinical morbidity prevented from progressing and those with clinical disease alleviated). The economic savings associated with this disease prevention was then analysed in the context of prevented medical expenses incurred by LF clinical patients, potential income loss through lost-labour, and prevented costs to the health system to care for affected individuals. The indirect cost estimates were calculated using the human capital approach. A combination of four wage sources was used to estimate the fair market value of time for an agricultural worker with LF infection (to ensure a conservative estimate, the lowest wage value was used). RESULTS: We projected that due to the first 15 years of the GPELF 36 million clinical cases and 175 (116-250) million DALYs will potentially be averted. It was estimated that due to this notable health impact, US$100.5 billion will potentially be saved over the lifetimes of the benefit cohorts. This total amount results from summing the medical expenses incurred by LF patients (US$3 billion), potential income loss (US$94 billion), and costs to the health system (US$3.5 billion) that were projected to be prevented. The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis and were most sensitive to the assumed percentage of work hours lost for those suffering from chronic disease (changing the total economic benefit between US$69.30-150.7 billion). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of any such analysis, this study identifies substantial health and economic benefits that have resulted from the first 15 years of the GPELF, and it highlights the value and importance of continued investment in the GPELF.",2016-99-22615,27388873,Infect Dis Poverty,Hugo C Turner,2016,5 / 1,54,No,27388873,"Hugo C Turner; Alison A Bettis; Brian K Chu; Deborah A McFarland; Pamela J Hooper; Eric A Ottesen; Mark H Bradley; The health and economic benefits of the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (2000-2014), Infect Dis Poverty, 2016 Oct 03; 5(1):2049-9957; 54",DALY,"American Samoa, Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo Democratic Republic, Comoros, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Kiribati, Lao, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Yemen, Cook Islands, Niue, Wallis and Futuna",Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) vs. None,at risk for Lymphatic filariasis infection,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,Not Stated,-574.29,United States,2014,-627.84
30029,"Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Home-Based HIV Testing and Education (HOPE) for Pregnant Women and Their Male Partners in Nyanza Province, Kenya","INTRODUCTION: Women in sub-Saharan Africa face a 2-fold higher risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and postpartum and the majority do not know the HIV status of their male partner. Home-based couple HIV testing for pregnant women can reduce HIV transmission to women and infants while increasing antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage in men. However, the cost-effectiveness of this program has not been evaluated. METHODS: We modeled the health and economic impact of implementing a home-based partner education and HIV testing (HOPE) intervention for pregnant women and their male partners in a region of Western Kenya (formally Nyanza Province). We used data from the HOPE randomized clinical trial conducted in Kisumu, Kenya, to parameterize a mathematical model of HIV transmission. We conducted an in-country microcosting of the HOPE intervention (payer perspective) to estimate program costs as well as a lower cost scenario of task-shifting to community health workers. RESULTS: The incremental cost of adding the HOPE intervention to standard antenatal care was $31-37 and $14-16 USD per couple tested with program and task-shifting costs, respectively. At 60% coverage of male partners, HOPE was projected to avert 6987 HIV infections and 2603 deaths in Nyanza province over 10 years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $886 and $615 per disability-adjusted life year averted for the program and task-shifting scenario, respectively. ICERs were robust to changes in intervention coverage, effectiveness, and ART initiation and dropout rates. CONCLUSIONS: The HOPE intervention can moderately decrease HIV-associated morbidity and mortality by increasing ART coverage in male partners of pregnant women. ICERs fall below Kenya''s per capita gross domestic product ($1358) and are therefore considered cost-effective. Task-shifting to community health workers can increase intervention affordability and feasibility.",2016-99-22658,27355506,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Monisha Sharma,2016,72 Suppl 2 /,S174-80,No,27355506,"Monisha Sharma; Carey Farquhar; Roger Ying; Daisy Krakowiak; John Kinuthia; Alfred Osoti; Victor Asila; Molly Gone; Jennifer Mark; Ruanne V Barnabas; Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Home-Based HIV Testing and Education (HOPE) for Pregnant Women and Their Male Partners in Nyanza Province, Kenya, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2016 Aug 01; 72 Suppl 2():1525-4135; S174-80",DALY,Kenya,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Health Education or Behavior",Adding home-based partner education and HIV testing (HOPE) intervention to standard care - program model vs. Standard/Usual Care- continued facility HIV testing and ART expansion at current scale-up rates,pregnant women and their male partners,64 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,886,United States,2014,968.62
30030,Cost-Effectiveness of Pre-exposure HIV Prophylaxis During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding in Sub-Saharan Africa,"INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV acquisition is cost-effective when delivered to those at substantial risk. Despite a high incidence of HIV infection among pregnant and breastfeeding women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a theoretical increased risk of preterm birth on PrEP could outweigh the HIV prevention benefit. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate a strategy of daily oral PrEP during pregnancy and breastfeeding in SSA. We approached the analysis from a health care system perspective across a lifetime time horizon. Model inputs were derived from existing literature and local sources. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PrEP versus no PrEP was calculated in 2015 U.S. dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. We evaluated the effect of uncertainty in baseline estimates through one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: PrEP administered to pregnant and breastfeeding women in SSA was cost-effective. In a base case of 10,000 women, the administration of PrEP averted 381 HIV infections but resulted in 779 more preterm births. PrEP was more costly per person ($450 versus $117), but resulted in fewer disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (3.15 versus 3.49). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $965/DALY averted was below the recommended regional threshold for cost-effectiveness of $6462/DALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Providing PrEP to pregnant and breastfeeding women in SSA is likely cost-effective, although more data are needed about adherence and safety.

30031,Costs and Cost-Effectiveness of Hypertension Screening and Treatment in Adults with Hypertension in Rural Nigeria in the Context of a Health Insurance Program,"BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for death and disability in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We evaluated the costs and cost-effectiveness of hypertension care provided within the Kwara State Health Insurance (KSHI) program in rural Nigeria. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of population-level hypertension screening and subsequent antihypertensive treatment for the population at-risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) within the KSHI program. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the KSHI scenario compared to no access to hypertension care. We used setting-specific and empirically-collected data to inform the model. We defined two strategies to assess eligibility for antihypertensive treatment based on 1) presence of hypertension grade 1 and 10-year CVD risk of >20%, or grade 2 hypertension irrespective of 10-year CVD risk (hypertension and risk based strategy) and 2) presence of hypertension in combination with a CVD risk of >20% (risk based strategy). We generated 95% confidence intervals around the primary outcome through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We conducted one-way sensitivity analyses across key model parameters and assessed the sensitivity of our results to the performance of the reference scenario. RESULTS: Screening and treatment for hypertension was potentially cost-effective but the results were sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions with a wide range of uncertainty. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the first and second strategy respectively ranged from US$ 1,406 to US$ 7,815 and US$ 732 to US$ 2,959 per DALY averted, depending on the assumptions on risk reduction after treatment and compared to no access to antihypertensive treatment.

30032,Optimizing treatment for the prevention of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in Nepal: is calcium supplementation during pregnancy cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND: In Nepal, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (PE/E) causes an estimated 21% of maternal deaths annually and contributes to adverse neonatal birth outcomes. Calcium supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of PE/E for pregnant women and preterm birth. This study presents findings from a cost-effectiveness analysis of a pilot project, which provided calcium supplementation through the public sector to pregnant women during antenatal care for PE/E prevention as compared to existing PE/E management in Nepal. METHODS: Economic costs were assessed from program and societal perspectives for the May 2012 to August 2013 analytic time horizon, drawing from implementing partner financial records and the literature. Effects were calculated as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted for mothers and newborns. A decision tree was used to model the cost-effectiveness of three strategies delivered through the public sector: (i) calcium supplementation in addition to the existing standard of care (MgSO4); (ii) standard of care, and (iii) no treatment. Uncertainty was assessed using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses in TreeAge Pro. RESULTS: The costs to start-up calcium introduction in addition to MgSO4 were $44,804, while the costs to support ongoing program implementation were $72,852. Collectively, these values correspond to a program cost per person per year of $0.44. The calcium program corresponded to a societal cost per DALY averted of $25.33 ($25.22-29.50) when compared against MgSO4 treatment. Primary cost drivers included rate for facility delivery, costs associated with hospitalization, and the probability of developing PE/E. The addition of calcium to the standard of care corresponds to slight increases in effect and cost, and has a 84% probability of cost-effectiveness above a WTP threshold of $40 USD when compared to the standard of care alone. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium supplementation for pregnant mothers for prevention of PE/E provided with MgSO4 for treatment holds promise for the cost-effective reduction of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with PE/E.

A decision tree was used to model the cost-effectiveness of three strategies delivered through the public sector: (i) calcium supplementation in addition to the existing standard of care (MgSO4); (ii) standard of care, and (iii) no treatment. Uncertainty was assessed using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses in TreeAge Pro. RESULTS: The costs to start-up calcium introduction in addition to MgSO4 were $44,804, while the costs to support ongoing program implementation were $72,852. Collectively, these values correspond to a program cost per person per year of $0.44. The calcium program corresponded to a societal cost per DALY averted of $25.33 ($25.22-29.50) when compared against MgSO4 treatment. Primary cost drivers included rate for facility delivery, costs associated with hospitalization, and the probability of developing PE/E. The addition of calcium to the standard of care corresponds to slight increases in effect and cost, and has a 84% probability of cost-effectiveness above a WTP threshold of $40 USD when compared to the standard of care alone. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium supplementation for pregnant mothers for prevention of PE/E provided with MgSO4 for treatment holds promise for the cost-effective reduction of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with PE/E. The findings of this study compare favorably with other low-cost, high priority interventions recommended for South Asia.

The Indian state of Tamil Nadu has pioneered a ""One Health"" committee to address the challenge of rabies in dogs and humans. Currently, rabies control in Tamil Nadu involves postexposure vaccination of humans after dog bites, whereas potential supplemental approaches include canine vaccination and sterilization. We developed a data-driven rabies transmission model fit to human rabies autopsy data and human rabies surveillance data from Tamil Nadu. Integrating local estimates for canine demography and costs, we predicted the impact of canine vaccination and sterilization on human health outcomes and evaluated cost-effectiveness according to the WHO criteria for India, which correspond to thresholds of $1,582 and $4,746 per disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for very cost-effective and cost-effective strategies, respectively. We found that highly feasible strategies focused on stray dogs, vaccinating as few as 7% of dogs annually, could very cost-effectively reduce human rabies deaths by 70% within 5 y, and a modest expansion to vaccinating 13% of stray dogs could cost-effectively reduce human rabies by almost 90%. Through integration over parameter uncertainty, we find that, for a cost-effectiveness threshold above $1,400 per DALY, canine interventions are at least 95% likely to be optimal.

30050,Cost-Effectiveness Study of HPV Vaccination as a Primary Prevention Strategy for Anal Cancer in HIV-Positive Men in Chile,"BACKGROUND: Most anal cancers are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. The incidence is increasing, especially in high-risk individuals such as HIV-positive men. Evidence shows that the new quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduces the rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia among men who have sex with men. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vaccinating against HPV-related anal cancer is cost-effective in HIV-positive men in Chile. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted by constructing a cohort multistate life-table-based Markov model in MS Excel in which the prevention of HPV infection was expected to influence the incidence of anal cancer in HIV-positive men. The comparator was the current practice of no systematic HPV prevention. Estimates of the efficacy of the vaccine were obtained from a substudy of a larger randomized controlled trial, incidence rates from the Chilean Population Cancer Registries, mortality rates from the National Institute of Statistics, and disease costs from a cost-effectiveness report. A public health care sector perspective was applied. The outcome was measured in averted disability-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated considering a lifetime horizon for costs and health outcomes. RESULTS: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US $138,269/ disability-adjusted life-year (95% confidence interval $95,936-$221,862). Assuming a threshold of 3 times the gross domestic product per capita, the intervention was not cost-effective. The outcome was sensitive to the vaccine price and vaccine efficacy.

By adolescence, 27 percent of low-income children in the United States will have untreated cavities. School-based sealant programs typically provide dental sealants (a protective coating that adheres to the surface of molars) at little or no cost to students attending schools in areas with low socioeconomic status. These programs have been shown to increase the number of students receiving sealants and to prevent cavities. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of school sealant programs using data (from school programs in fourteen states between 2013 and 2014) on children''s cavity risk, including the effects of untreated cavities on a child''s quality of life. We found that providing sealants in school programs to 1,000 children would prevent 485 fillings and 1.59 disability-adjusted life-years.

30052,Effectiveness and Efficiency of Improving HIV Service Provision for Key Populations in Nicaragua,"OBJECTIVE: HIV in Nicaragua is concentrated among key populations (KPs) - men who have sex with men, female sex workers, and female transgender - in whom prevalence is 600-4,000 times higher than the general population. The United States Agency for International Development PrevenSida project is aimed at increasing healthy behavior among KPs and people with HIV and improving testing, counseling, and continuity of prevention and treatment by building capacity and improving performance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing services to KPs. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PrevenSida''s activities. METHODS: This retrospective observational evaluation used individuals in KPs covered by NGOs receiving assistance from PrevenSida from 2012 to 2014. Cost-effectiveness analysis compared PrevenSida''s intervention with business-as-usual. Model inputs were generated from epidemiological modeling and PrevenSida''s records. RESULTS: By 2014, 24 NGOs received grants and technical assistance from PrevenSida with 72,955 people in KPs served at $11.32/person ($9.39-$16.55/person, depending on region). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $50,700/HIV case averted or $2,600/Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted (95% CI: $1,000-$99,000 and $50-$5,100, respectively). CONCLUSION: PrevenSida distributed about $600,000 in grants and used $230,000 to support 24 NGOs in 2014. Cost-effectiveness from the program perspective compared to no program was slightly over half of GDP per capita per DALY averted, considered highly cost-effective by WHO criteria. Cost and efficiency varied by region, reflecting the number of people in KPs receiving services.

30055,Economic valuation of the impact of a large surgical charity using the value of lost welfare approach,"BACKGROUND: The assessment of the economic burden of surgical disease is integral to determining allocation of resources for health globally. We estimate the economic gain realised over an 11-year period resulting from a vertical surgical programme addressing cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (CP). METHODS: The database from a large non-governmental organisation (Smile Train) over an 11-year period was analysed. Incidence-based disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted through the programme were calculated, discounted 3%, using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and an effectiveness factor for each surgical intervention. The effectiveness factor allowed for the lack of 100% resolution of the disability from the operation. We used the value of lost welfare approach, based on the concept of the value of a statistical life (VSL), to assess the economic gain associated with each operation. Using income elasticities (IEs) tailored to the income level of each country, a country-specific VSL was calculated and the VSL-year (VSLY) was determined. The VSLY is the economic value of a DALY, and the DALYs averted were converted to economic gain per patient and aggregated to give a total value and an average per patient. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on the variations of IE applied for each country. RESULTS: Each CL operation averted 2.2 DALYs on average and each CP operation 3.3. Total averted DALYs were 1 325 678 (CP 686 577 and CL 639 102). The economic benefit from the programme was between US$7.9 and US$20.7 billion. Per patient, the average benefit was between US$16 133 and US$42 351. Expense per DALY averted was estimated to be $149. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing basic surgical needs in developing countries provides a massive economic boost through improved health.

Actually, biofortification by foliar Zn application has been demonstrated at small scale, but not at large scale due to the absence of economic analysis. Therefore, here, we conducted the first cost-effectiveness analysis using the method of ""disability-adjusted life year"" measuring the health burden. We thus quantified the cost of agronomic biofortification of wheat with Zn in three major wheat-growing regions of China. Our results show that the current annual health burden due to human Zn deficiency, defined as numbers of disability-adjusted life years lost, is 0.21 million years for the region under single wheat plantation, 0.79 million years for the region under wheat-maize rotation, and 0.38 million years for the region under wheat-rice rotation. Comparing with traditional wheat diets in these three regions, the consumption of agronomically Zn-biofortified wheat diets could increase the daily Zn intakes of infants and children under 5 years of age. These increased daily Zn intakes consequently reduce the health burden due to human Zn deficiency in these regions by up to 56.6 %. According to cost-effectiveness analysis, the cost for saving one disability-adjusted life year in these regions ranges from US$ 226 to US$ 594 for foliar Zn application alone.

30068,Cost-effectiveness of club-foot treatment in low-income and middle-income countries by the Ponseti method,"Background: Club foot is a common congenital deformity affecting 150 000-200 000 children every year. Untreated patients end up walking on the side or back of the affected foot, with severe social and economic consequences. Club foot is highly treatable by the Ponseti method, a non-invasive technique that has been described as highly suitable for use in resource-limited settings. To date, there has been no evaluation of its cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the cost of averting one disability-adjusted life year (DALY), a composite measure of the impact of premature death and disability. In this study, we aimed to calculate the average cost-effectiveness ratio of the Ponseti method for correcting club foot in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Using data from 12 sub-Saharan African countries provided by the international non-profit organisation CURE Clubfoot, which implements several Ponseti treatment programmes around the world, we estimated the average cost of the point-of-care treatment for club foot in these countries. We divided the cost of treatment with the average number of DALYs that can be averted by the Ponseti treatment, assuming treatment is successful in 90% of patients. Results: We found the average cost of the Ponseti treatment to be US$167 per patient. The average number of DALYs averted was 7.42, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$22.46 per DALY averted. To test the robustness of our calculation different variables were used and these yielded a cost range of US$5.28-29.75. This is less than a tenth of the cost of many other treatment modalities used in resource-poor settings today. Conclusions: The Ponseti method for the treatment of club foot is cost-effective and practical in a low-income country setting. These findings could be used to raise the priority for implementing Ponseti treatment in areas where patients are still lacking access to the life-changing intervention.",2016-01-03047,28588918,BMJ Glob Health,Caris E.

30069,Modelling the health impact and cost-effectiveness of lymphatic filariasis eradication under varying levels of mass drug administration scale-up and geographic coverage,"Background: A global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) is underway, yet two key programmatic features are currently still lacking: (1) the extension of efforts to all lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic countries, and (2) the expansion of geographic coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) within countries. For varying levels of scale-up of MDA, we assessed the health benefits and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with LF eradication, projected the potential savings due to decreased morbidity management needs, and estimated potential household productivity gains as a result of reduced LF-related morbidity. Methods: We extended an LF transmission model to track hydrocele and lymphoedema incidence in order to obtain estimates of the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to scaling up MDA over a period of 50 years. We then estimated the ICERs and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves associated with different rates of MDA scale-up. Health systems savings were estimated by considering the averted morbidity, treatment-seeking behaviour and morbidity management costs. Gains in worker productivity were estimated by multiplying estimated working days lost as a result of morbidity with country-specific per-worker agricultural wages. Results: Our projections indicate that a massive scaling-up of MDA could lead to 4.38 million incremental DALYs averted over a 50-year time horizon compared to a scenario which mirrors current efforts against LF. In comparison to maintaining the current rate of progress against LF, massive scaling-up of MDA-pursuing LF eradication as soon as possible-was most likely to be cost-effective above a willingness to pay threshold of US$71.5/DALY averted. Intensified MDA scale-up was also associated with lower ICERs. Furthermore, this could result in health systems savings up to US$483 million. Extending coverage to all endemic areas could generate additional economic benefits through gains in worker productivity between US$3.4 and US$14.4 billion. Conclusions: In addition to ethical and political motivations for scaling-up MDA rapidly, this analysis provides economic support for increasing the intensity of MDA programmes.",2016-01-03048,28588916,BMJ Glob Health,Christopher M.

30070,Modelling the health impact and cost-effectiveness of lymphatic filariasis eradication under varying levels of mass drug administration scale-up and geographic coverage,"Background: A global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) is underway, yet two key programmatic features are currently still lacking: (1) the extension of efforts to all lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic countries, and (2) the expansion of geographic coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) within countries. For varying levels of scale-up of MDA, we assessed the health benefits and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with LF eradication, projected the potential savings due to decreased morbidity management needs, and estimated potential household productivity gains as a result of reduced LF-related morbidity. Methods: We extended an LF transmission model to track hydrocele and lymphoedema incidence in order to obtain estimates of the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to scaling up MDA over a period of 50 years. We then estimated the ICERs and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves associated with different rates of MDA scale-up. Health systems savings were estimated by considering the averted morbidity, treatment-seeking behaviour and morbidity management costs. Gains in worker productivity were estimated by multiplying estimated working days lost as a result of morbidity with country-specific per-worker agricultural wages. Results: Our projections indicate that a massive scaling-up of MDA could lead to 4.38 million incremental DALYs averted over a 50-year time horizon compared to a scenario which mirrors current efforts against LF.

30072,"Strengthening the contribution of aquaculture to food and nutrition security: The potential of a vitamin A-rich, small fish in Bangladesh","Background: Since 1961, global per capita fish consumption has nearly doubled. Much of the increase has been due to aquaculture. Bangladesh, the world's eighth largest fish producing country, has been part of this transformation. Despite having vitamin A supplementation and fortification programs, the prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intake (IVAI) in Bangladesh is very high, estimated to be 60%. The promotion of a small indigenous fish, high in vitamin A - mola carplet - offers a promising food-based approach to improving vitamin A status of the 98% of Bangladeshis who eat fish. The objective of this paper was to conduct a benefit-cost analysis of a national household pond Mola Promotion Program (MPP) in Bangladesh. Methods: Using the 2005 Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and nutrition and health statistics, we developed baseline estimates of usual vitamin A intake, the prevalence of IVAI and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Drawing on a WorldFish project and HIES data, we designed and modeled the implementation of a MPP, and calculated the additional vitamin A intake it would provide, calculated new incidence rates of VAD-related health outcomes and estimated MPP-attributable annual changes in DALYs. The MPP's total health benefits were calculated over the program's 11-year phase-in as the annual sum of DALYs saved. The MPP's costs were estimated as the sum of the costs of a small fish program of the Fisheries Development Program plus the costs of mola brood stock, other inputs and additional farmer training-related costs. Program costs and benefits were combined to produce estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the program. Results: An 11-year, $23 million project would increase average daily vitamin A intakes by 7 mu g retinol activity equivalent (RAE), reduce the prevalence of IVAI by 1.1 percentage points, and save 3000 lives and 100,000 DALYs, at a cost of $194 per DALY saved. The MPP's impact would be concentrated among homestead pond-fishing households that would consume 60% of the additional mola produced. Among these, it would reduce IVAI prevalence by 7 percentage points. If the MPP was implemented for at least 20 years, it would dominate have higher health benefits and lower total costs - than a national vitamin A wheat flour fortification program. Conclusion: By World Bank and World Health Organization criteria, the MPP is a cost-effective approach to reduce the burden of micronutrient malnutrition in Bangladesh. (C) 2015 The Authors.

30079,Cost-effectiveness of Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms in six European countries,"Broilers are an important reservoir for human Campylobacter infections, one of the leading causes of acute diarrheal disease in humans worldwide. Therefore, it is relevant to control Campylobacter on broiler farms. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness ratios of eight Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms in six European countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom. The cost-effectiveness ratio of an intervention was the estimated costs of the intervention divided by the estimated public health benefits due to the intervention, and was expressed in euro per avoided disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Interventions were selected on the basis of a European risk factor study and other risk factor research. A deterministic simulation model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of each intervention, if it would be implemented on all broiler farms in a country where it isn''t implemented yet and implementation is possible. The model considered differences between countries in number and size of broiler farms and established practices, in import, export and transit of live broilers, broiler meat and meat products, in effect of interventions on Campylobacter prevalence in broilers, in disease burden of Campylobacter related human illness, in national economic factors, such as interest rate and general cost levels, and in technical and economic farm performance. Across interventions, cost-effectiveness ratios were the lowest for Poland and Spain, and highest for Norway and Denmark. Across countries, applying designated tools for each farm house and building an anteroom with hygiene barrier in each farm house had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratios, whereas a ban on thinning (partial depopulation), slaughter at 35 days, replacing old houses by new houses, and applying drink nipples without cup had the highest. Applying fly screens in Denmark had an intermediate cost-effectiveness ratio. A maximum downtime between flocks of ten days had a negative cost-effectiveness ratio (i.e. revenue) in Poland, a low positive cost-effectiveness ratio in Spain and high positive cost-effectiveness ratios in Denmark, the Netherlands and United Kingdom. Estimated cost-effectiveness ratios of Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms differed substantially between the six countries, but the order of interventions in increasing cost-effectiveness ratio was generally similar across the countries.",2016-01-04113,0,Epidemiol Health,C.,2016,/,53-62,No,Not Stated,"C.; Rosemary J.

30096,Cost-effectiveness of Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms in six European countries,"Broilers are an important reservoir for human Campylobacter infections, one of the leading causes of acute diarrheal disease in humans worldwide. Therefore, it is relevant to control Campylobacter on broiler farms. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness ratios of eight Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms in six European countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom. The cost-effectiveness ratio of an intervention was the estimated costs of the intervention divided by the estimated public health benefits due to the intervention, and was expressed in euro per avoided disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Interventions were selected on the basis of a European risk factor study and other risk factor research. A deterministic simulation model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of each intervention, if it would be implemented on all broiler farms in a country where it isn''t implemented yet and implementation is possible. The model considered differences between countries in number and size of broiler farms and established practices, in import, export and transit of live broilers, broiler meat and meat products, in effect of interventions on Campylobacter prevalence in broilers, in disease burden of Campylobacter related human illness, in national economic factors, such as interest rate and general cost levels, and in technical and economic farm performance. Across interventions, cost-effectiveness ratios were the lowest for Poland and Spain, and highest for Norway and Denmark. Across countries, applying designated tools for each farm house and building an anteroom with hygiene barrier in each farm house had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratios, whereas a ban on thinning (partial depopulation), slaughter at 35 days, replacing old houses by new houses, and applying drink nipples without cup had the highest.
