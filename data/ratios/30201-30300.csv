30201,Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of childhood pneumonia is a key priority in low-income countries, with substantial resource implications. WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia. RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 (0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries. Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Uzbekistan,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2013 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,46.57,United States,2013,51.74

30211,Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of childhood pneumonia is a key priority in low-income countries, with substantial resource implications. WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia. RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 (0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries.

WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia. RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 (0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries.

WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia. RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 (0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries.

WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia.

Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Ghana,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2013 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,20.99,United States,2013,23.32

Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,India,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2013 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,65.22,United States,2013,72.46

Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Kyrgyzstan,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2013 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,82.87,United States,2013,92.07

Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Malawi,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2013 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,38.56,United States,2013,42.84

Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Mozambique,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2013 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,41.29,United States,2013,45.87

WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines.

METHODS: Stochastic transmission compartmental TB model from the healthcare provider perspective with parameter input from direct measurements, systematic literature reviews and expert opinion. MODS and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF were evaluated as replacement test of smear microscopy (SM) or as an add-on test after a negative SM. Costs were calculated in 2013 USD, effects in disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Willingness to pay threshold (WPT) was established at once the per capita Gross National Income of Mozambique. RESULTS: MODS as an add-on test to negative SM produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5647.89USD/DALY averted.

30300,Cost-Effectiveness of Two Government District Hospitals in Sub-Saharan Africa,"BACKGROUND: District hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa are in need of investment if countries are going to progress towards universal health coverage, and meet the sustainable development goals and the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery time-bound targets for 2030. Previous studies have suggested that government hospitals are likely to be highly cost-effective and therefore worthy of investment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the inpatient logbooks for two government district hospitals in two sub-Saharan African hospitals was performed. Data were extracted and DALYs were calculated based on the diagnosis and procedures undertaken. Estimated costs were obtained based on the patient receiving ideal treatment for their condition rather than actual treatment received. RESULTS: Total cost per DALY averted was 26 (range 17-66) for Thyolo District Hospital in Malawi and 363 (range 187-881) for Bo District Hospital in Sierra Leone. CONCLUSION: This is the first published paper to support the hypothesis that government district hospitals are very cost-effective.
