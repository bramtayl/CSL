24601,Choice across 10 pharmacologic combination strategies for type 2 diabetes: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend a stepped-escalation treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Across multiple treatment strategies varying in efficacy and costs, no clinical or economic studies directly compared them. This study aims to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, a-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation, the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273 with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117 with strategy 8. Strategy 7 was dominant over seven strategies (strategies 2~6, 9~10) with higher QALYs but lower costs. Additionally, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $30,787/QALY (i.e., 3 times GDP/capita for China), strategy 7 was cost-effective compared with strategy 1 (ICER of strategy 7 vs. 1, $3371/QALY) and strategy 8 (ICER of strategy 8 vs. 7, $132,790/QALY). Ranking the strategies by ICERs and NMBs, strategy 7 provided the best value for money when compared to all other strategies, followed by strategies 5, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, and 4. Scenario analyses showed that patients insist on pharmacologic treatments increased their QALYs (0.456~0.653) at an acceptable range of cost increase (ICERs, $1450/QALY~$12,360/QALY) or even at cost saving compared with those not receive treatments.

A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation, the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273 with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117 with strategy 8. Strategy 7 was dominant over seven strategies (strategies 2~6, 9~10) with higher QALYs but lower costs. Additionally, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $30,787/QALY (i.e., 3 times GDP/capita for China), strategy 7 was cost-effective compared with strategy 1 (ICER of strategy 7 vs. 1, $3371/QALY) and strategy 8 (ICER of strategy 8 vs. 7, $132,790/QALY). Ranking the strategies by ICERs and NMBs, strategy 7 provided the best value for money when compared to all other strategies, followed by strategies 5, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, and 4. Scenario analyses showed that patients insist on pharmacologic treatments increased their QALYs (0.456~0.653) at an acceptable range of cost increase (ICERs, $1450/QALY~$12,360/QALY) or even at cost saving compared with those not receive treatments.

24614,Follow-Up 18F-FDG PET/CT versus Contrast-Enhanced CT after Ablation of Liver Metastases of Colorectal Carcinoma-A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"PURPOSE: After a percutaneous ablation of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), follow-up investigations to evaluate potential tumor recurrence are necessary. The aim of this study was to analyze whether a combined 18F-Fluordesoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan is cost-effective compared to a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) scan for detecting local tumor progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations that estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was developed. Model input parameters were obtained from the recent literature. Deterministic sensitivity analysis of diagnostic parameters based on a Monte-Carlo simulation with 30,000 iterations was performed. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) was set to $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, CE-CT resulted in total costs of $28,625.08 and an efficacy of 0.755 QALYs, whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT resulted in total costs of $29,239.97 with an efficacy of 0.767. Therefore, the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 18F-FDG PET/CT was $50,338.96 per QALY indicating cost-effectiveness based on the WTP threshold set above. The results were stable in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

24615,The cost-utility of intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating asthma exacerbations in children,"INTRODUCTION: Although evidence supports the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MS) in asthma exacerbations, MS continues to be considered a second-line drug for managing pediatric asthma exacerbations. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of MS in asthma exacerbations. METHODS: We used a decision tree model to estimate the cost-utility of MS compared to treatment without MS (control group) in children with asthma exacerbations. Cost data were obtained from a retrospective study from tertiary centers in Rionegro, Colombia, while utilities were collected from the literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out using the Monte Carlo technique with a simulation of a hypothetical cohort of 10?000 patients to generate expected cost utilities with 95% confidence intervals. We used a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to evaluate the uncertainty surrounding the cost-utility of MS. RESULTS: The model showed that MS had a lower total cost than the control group (US $1149 vs US $1598 average cost per patient) and higher quality-adjusted life years (0.60 vs 0.52 average per patient), showing dominance. The probability that MS provides a more cost-effective use of resources compared with standard therapy exceeds 99% for all willingness-to-pay thresholds. CONCLUSION: Intravenous MS was less expensive and more effective than treatment without intravenous MS in children with asthma exacerbations. Our study provides evidence that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical practice guidelines and should be replicated to validate its results in other middle-income countries.",2020-01-34521,32790241,Pediatr Pulmonol,Jefferson A Buendia,2020,55 / 10,2610-2616,No,32790241,"Jefferson A Buendia; Ranniery Acuña-Cordero; Carlos E Rodriguez-Martinez; The cost-utility of intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating asthma exacerbations in children, Pediatr Pulmonol, 2020 Oct; 55(10):1099-0496; 2610-2616",QALY,Colombia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,intravenous magnesium sulfate + albuterol + intravenous methylprednisolone vs. Standard/Usual Care- albuterol + intravenous methylprednisolone,"asthma exacerbations in emergency contexts, Rionegro, admitted to tertiary center",18 Years,4 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,-5613.75,United States,2018,-5785.98
24616,Cost effectiveness of nusinersen for patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy in US,"BACKGROUND: Patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease, do not achieve key motor function milestones (e.g., sitting) and have short life expectancy in the absence of treatment. Nusinersen is a disease-modifying therapy for patients with SMA. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of nusinersen compared to best supportive care (BSC) in patients diagnosed with infantile-onset SMA in the US. METHODS: A de novo economic model was developed with the following health states: ""permanent ventilation"", ""not sitting"", ""sitting"", ""walking"", and ""death"". Short-term data were sourced from the pivotal clinical trials and studies of nusinersen (ENDEAR and SHINE). Motor function milestones achieved at the end of follow-up in the clinical trials were assumed to be sustained until death. Mortality risks were based on survival modelling of relevant published Kaplan-Meier data. Costs, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analyses were performed from a US health care sector perspective. Scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results to key parameters. RESULTS: In our base-case analysis, nusinersen treatment achieves greater QALYs and more LYs (3.24 and 7.64, respectively) compared with BSC (0.46 QALYs and 2.40 LYs, respectively), resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of approximately $1,112,000 and an incremental cost per LY gained of $590,000 for nusinersen compared to BSC. The incremental cost effectiveness ratios did not fall below $990,000 per QALY gained in scenario and sensitivity analyses. Results were most sensitive to the length of survival, background health care costs, and utility in the ""not sitting"" and ""sitting"" health states. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness of nusinersen from a US health care sector perspective exceeded traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds. Cost-effectiveness was dependent on assumptions made regarding survival, costs, utilities, and whether the motor function milestones were sustained over lifetime. Given the relatively short-term effectiveness data available for the treatment, a registry to collect long-term data of infantile-onset SMA patients is recommended.",2020-01-34523,33041673,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Praveen Thokala,2020,18 /,41,Yes,33041673,"Praveen Thokala; Matt Stevenson; Varun M Kumar; Shijie Ren; Alexandra G Ellis; Richard H Chapman; Si Xuan; Kenneth M Zangwill; Weiyi Ni; Junjie Ma; Joel W Hay; Cost effectiveness of nusinersen for patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy in US, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2020; 18():1478-7547; 41",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,nusinersen vs. Standard/Usual Care- best supportive care,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1112000,United States,2017,1174109.95
24617,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban for prevention of venous thromboembolic events in patients after gynecologic cancer surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of apixaban was compared with enoxaparin for prevention of postoperative venothromboembolic events (VTE) in gynecologic oncology patients. Current guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin for 28 days following gynecologic cancer surgery, but recent trials suggest that oral apixaban may be a safe, patient-preferred alternative. Apixaban was superior to enoxaparin in a Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis using orthopedics trial data. METHODS: Medication costs, adherence rates, event rates, event costs, and utility decrements were estimated using prior clinical trial data and literature review for input into a short-term decision model to simulate outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as net cost difference per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Input values at which net costs and QALYs were equivalent and ICERs at upper and lower bounds were evaluated. RESULTS: Using aggregated costs, apixaban was less expensive and more effective than enoxaparin, and remained so or had high value in all scenarios on sensitivity analysis. Examining disaggregated ICERs, apixaban was cost-effective for deep venous thrombosis (DVT); of high value for clinically-relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) ($411); low value for major bleeding ($183,465), VTE-related death ($2,711,229), and all-cause mortality ($297,522); and not cost-effective for pulmonary embolism prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban is more cost-effective than enoxaparin for the prevention of postoperative VTE in patients with gynecologic cancer.

24618,Real-World Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin Compared to Docetaxel and Cisplatin Plus Fluorouracil Induction Chemotherapy in Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Addition of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) or docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil (TPF) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) signi?cantly improved survival in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, an economic evaluation of these regimens remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness of GP versus TPF regimen in the treatment of locoregionally advanced NPC in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive Markov model was developed to evaluate the health and economic outcomes of GP versus TPF regimen for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. Baseline and clinical outcome were derived from 158 patients with newly diagnosed stage III-IVA NPC between 2010 and 2015. We evaluated the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. One-way sensitive analysis explored the impact of uncertainty in key model parameters on results, and probabilistic uncertainty was assessed through a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: GP regimen provided an additional 0.42 QALYs with incremental cost of $3,821.99, resulting in an ICER of $9,099.98 per QALY versus TPF regimen at the real-world setting. One-way sensitivity analysis found that the results were most sensitive to the cost and proportion of receiving subsequent treatment in two groups.

24621,A decision analysis comparing three strategies for peritoneal lavage cytology testing in staging of gastric cancer in China,"BACKGROUND: Positive peritoneal cytology (PCY) indicates metastasis (M1) in gastric cancer (GC) patients; both the American and Chinese guidelines recommend laparoscopic peritoneal lavage (LPL) for cytology. However, relatively high costs impair the widespread use of LPL in some resource-limited regions in China, and the cost-effectiveness of PCY testing remains unclear. Therefore, we performed a decision analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCY testing by comparing the guideline-recommended intraoperative LPL, a newly proposed preoperative percutaneous peritoneal lavage (PPL), and a third strategy of exploratory laparotomy with no cytology testing (ELNC) among GC patients. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic Markov model of the aforementioned three strategies for a hypothetical cohort of GC patients with curative intent after initial imaging, from the perspective of Chinese society. We estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) as primary outcomes; we also conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to investigate the model''s robustness. RESULTS: We found that ELNC was dominated (i.e., more expensive and less effective) by PPL and LPL. LPL was the most cost-effective method with an ICER of US$17,200/QALY compared to PPL, which was below the Chinese willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$29,313 per QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, PPL was more likely to be cost-effective with a lower WTP threshold.

24623,Economic evaluation of carbetocin as prophylaxis for postpartum hemorrhage in the Philippines,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oxytocin as the drug of choice for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) prevention. However, the WHO has also recently considered carbetocin for PPH prevention, but only if carbetocin were a cost-effective choice in the country. Consequently, we determined the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of carbetocin against oxytocin in the Philippines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a decision tree was done to compare the costs and outcomes of carbetocin with oxytocin for PPH prophylaxis among women undergoing either vaginal delivery (VD) or cesarean section (CS) in a six-week time horizon using a societal perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were applied to investigate parameter uncertainties. Additionally, budget impact analysis was conducted using a governmental perspective. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using a 2895 United States dollar (USD) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained as the ceiling threshold in the Philippines. RESULTS: Carbetocin was not cost-effective given the listed price of carbetocin at 18 USD. Given a societal perspective, the ICER values of 13,187 USD and over 40,000 USD per QALY gained were derived for CS and VD, respectively. Moreover, the ICER values were sensitive to the risk ratio of carbetocin versus oxytocin and carbetocin price. On budget impact, the five-year total budget impact of a drug mix of carbetocin and oxytocin was 25.54 million USD (4.23 million USD for CS and 21.31 million USD for VD) compared with ''only oxytocin'' scenario. CONCLUSION: Carbetocin is not a cost-effective choice in PPH prevention for both modes of delivery in the Philippines, unless price reduction is made.

24625,Cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin in the UK in an EMPA-REG OUTCOME subgroup with type 2 diabetes and heart failure,"AIMS: Heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), common co-morbidities, translate into worse patient prognoses and higher direct costs than for either condition alone. Empagliflozin has been shown to markedly reduce cardiovascular (CV) deaths and HF hospitalizations (HHF) in HF patients with T2D. This study evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of supplementing standard of care (SoC) with empagliflozin, relative to SoC alone, in HF patients with T2D from the UK payer perspective. METHODS AND RESULTS: An existing discrete-event simulation model was adapted for the economic evaluation. Risk equations developed from time-dependent parametric survival analyses using patient-level HF subpopulation data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial were employed to predict CV and renal events. Non-CV death, utility weights, and costs were drawn from UK sources. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Relative to SoC, empagliflozin with SoC yielded fewer first HHF, recurrent HHF, CV death, and non-fatal myocardial infarction but more non-fatal stroke events. Empagliflozin with SoC vs. SoC alone was associated with increased average life expectancy (10.80 vs. 9.59 LYs) and quality of life (6.27 vs. 5.62 QALYs), though at higher lifetime cost (£18 197 vs. £16 829) per person, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2093 per QALY. The probability of empagliflozin being cost-effective in the HF subpopulation at a £20 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold was 91%. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that adding empagliflozin to SoC in HF patients with T2D constitutes a cost-effective use of UK healthcare resources and may provide long-term health benefits to patients.",2020-01-34544,32909680,ESC Heart Fail,Odette S Reifsnider,2020,7 / 6,3910-8,No,32909680,"Odette S Reifsnider; Anuraag R Kansal; Jennifer Franke; Joseph Lee; Jyothis T George; Martina Brueckmann; Stefan Kaspers; Sarah B Brand; Anastasia Ustyugova; Stephan Linden; Matthew Stargardter; Nikco Hau; Cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin in the UK in an EMPA-REG OUTCOME subgroup with type 2 diabetes and heart failure, ESC Heart Fail, 2020 Oct 27; 7(6):2055-5822; 3910-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,empagliflozin + standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard of care,not restricted by left ventricular ejection fraction or New York Heart Association class,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,2093,United Kingdom,2018,2882.58
24626,Cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin for cancer-associated thrombosis in Brazil,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. In Brazil, even though low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the gold standard of care for the management of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT), its cost limits its use and therefore warfarin is commonly prescribed. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as edoxaban, have been introduced as an alternative in this setting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban with LMWH (Model 1) and warfarin (Model 2) to support clinicians and hospitals when choosing an anticoagulant to manage CAT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using Markov state-transition models over a timeframe of 5 years, in a hypothetical, 64 years-old patients cancer population with an index VTE event. Transition probabilities, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and risk reductions were either derived from the literature, estimated or calculated. A willingness-to-pay limit of 3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head was used. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for robustness. The main outcome of this study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per QALY gained.

24628,Cost-effectiveness analysis of systematic fast-track transition from oncological treatment to specialised palliative care at home for patients and their caregivers: the DOMUS trial,"BACKGROUND: While hospitals remain the most common place of death in many western countries, specialised palliative care (SPC) at home is an alternative to improve the quality of life for patients with incurable cancer. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a systematic fast-track transition process from oncological treatment to SPC enriched with a psychological intervention at home for patients with incurable cancer and their caregivers. METHODS: A full economic evaluation with a time horizon of six months was performed from a societal perspective within a randomised controlled trial, the DOMUS trial ( Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01885637). The primary outcome of the health economic analysis was a incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is obtained by comparing costs required per gain in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY). The costs included primary and secondary healthcare costs, cost of intervention and informal care from caregivers. Public transfers were analysed in seperate analysis. QALYs were measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 for patients and SF-36 for caregivers. Bootstrap simulations were performed to obtain the ICER estimate. RESULTS: In total, 321 patients (162 in intervention group, 159 in control group) and 235 caregivers (126 in intervention group, 109 in control group) completed the study. The intervention resulted in significantly higher QALYs for patients when compared to usual care (p-value?=?0.026), while being more expensive as well. In the 6 months observation period, the average incremental cost of intervention compared to usual care was €2015 per patient (p value <?0.000). The mean incremental gain was 0.01678 QALY (p-value?=?0.026). Thereby, the ICER was €118,292/QALY when adjusting for baseline costs and quality of life. For the caregivers, we found no significant differences in QALYs between the intervention and control group (p-value?=?0.630). At a willingness to pay of €80,000 per QALY, the probability that the intervention is cost-effective lies at 15% in the base case scenario. CONCLUSION: This model of fast-track SPC enriched with a psychological intervention yields better QALYs than usual care with a large increase in costs.

24629,Cost-Effectiveness of Neoadjuvant-Adjuvant Treatment Strategies for Women With ERBB2 (HER2)-Positive Breast Cancer,"IMPORTANCE: The neoadjuvant treatment options for ERBB2-positive (also known as HER2-positive) breast cancer are associated with different rates of pathologic complete response (pCR). The KATHERINE trial showed that adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) can reduce recurrence in patients with residual disease compared with patients treated with trastuzumab; however, T-DM1 and other ERBB2-targeted agents are costly, and understanding the costs and health consequences of various combinations of neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatments in the United States is needed. OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and disease outcomes associated with selection of various neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment strategies for patients with ERBB2-positive breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate various neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment strategies for women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer from a health care payer perspective in the United States. The model was informed by the KATHERINE trial, other clinical trials with different regimens from the KATHERINE trial, the Flatiron Health Database, McKesson Corporation data, and other evidence in the published literature. Starting trial median age for KATHERINE patients was 49 years (range, 24-79 years in T-DM1 arm and 23-80 years in trastuzumab arm). The model simulated patients receiving 5 different neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment strategies. Data analyses were performed from March 2019 to August 2020. EXPOSURE: There were 4 neoadjuvant regimens: (1) HP: trastuzumab (H) plus pertuzumab (P), (2) THP: paclitaxel (T) plus H plus P, (3) DDAC-THP: dose-dense anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (DDAC) plus THP, (4) TCHP: docetaxel (T) plus carboplatin (C) plus HP. All patients with pCR, regardless of neoadjuvant regimen, received adjuvant H. Patients with residual disease received different adjuvant therapies depending on the neoadjuvant regimen according to the 5 following strategies: (1) neoadjuvant DDAC-THP followed by adjuvant H, (2) neoadjuvant DDAC-THP followed by adjuvant T-DM1, (3) neoadjuvant THP followed by adjuvant DDAC plus T-DM1, (4) neoadjuvant HP followed by adjuvant DDAC/THP plus T-DM1, or (5) neoadjuvant TCHP followed by adjuvant T-DM1. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime costs in 2020 US dollars and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for each treatment strategy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. A strategy was classified as dominated if it was associated with fewer QALYs at higher costs than the alternative. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, costs ranged from $415?833 (strategy 3) to $518?859 (strategy 4), and QALYs ranged from 9.67 (strategy 1) to 10.73 (strategy 3). Strategy 3 was associated with the highest health benefits (10.73 QALYs) and lowest costs ($415?833) and dominated all other strategies. Probabilistic analysis confirmed that this strategy had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness (>70% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $0-200,000/QALY) and was associated with the highest net benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that neoadjuvant THP followed by adjuvant H for patients with pCR or followed by adjuvant DDAC plus T-DM1 for patients with residual disease was associated with the highest health benefits and lowest costs for women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer compared with other treatment strategies considered.",2020-01-34561,33226431,JAMA Netw Open,Natalia Kunst,2020,3 / 11,e2027074,No,33226431,"Natalia Kunst; Shi-Yi Wang; Annette Hood; Sarah S Mougalian; Michael P DiGiovanna; Kerin Adelson; Lajos Pusztai; Cost-Effectiveness of Neoadjuvant-Adjuvant Treatment Strategies for Women With ERBB2 (HER2)-Positive Breast Cancer, JAMA Netw Open, 2020 Nov 2; 3(11):2574-3805; e2027074",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,dose dense anthracycline/cyclophosphamide + paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab triplet + dose dense anthracycline/cyclophosphamide/trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab,Not Stated,79 Years,24 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-70982.35,United States,2020,-70982.35

24633,Cost-effectiveness of osimertinib versus standard EGFR-TKI as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer in Australia,"Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib versus standard epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), gefitinib or erlotinib, as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer in Australia from a healthcare system perspective. Methods: A partitioned survival model comprising three mutually exclusive health states with a five-year time horizon was developed. Model inputs were sourced from the pivotal trial (FLAURA) and published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and cost per life-year (LY) gained, were calculated. Uncertainty of the results was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared with standard EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib was associated with a higher incremental cost of A$118,502, and an incremental benefit of 0.274 QALYs and 0.313 LYs. The ICER was estimated to be A$432,197/QALY gained and A$378,157/LY gained. The base-case ICER was most sensitive to changes in cost of first-line osimertinib, time horizon, and choice of overall survival data (interim versus final analysis). Conclusions: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000/QALY, first-line osimertinib is not cost-effective compared with standard EGFR-TKIs in Australia based on the current published price. To achieve acceptable cost-effectiveness, the cost of first-line osimertinib needs to be reduced by at least 68.4%.",2020-01-34564,33151783,Heart Rhythm,Terence Khoo,2020,/,1-9,No,33151783,"Terence Khoo; Lan Gao; Yin Liu; Hui Zhang; Lei Zhang; Xia Zou; Li Ling; Cost-effectiveness of osimertinib versus standard EGFR-TKI as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer in Australia, Heart Rhythm, 2020; ():1744-8379; 1-9",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"osimertinib vs. Standard/Usual Care- epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib or erlotinib",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,432197,Australia,2020,298709.93

We found that for most postmenopausal women 5 years of treatment prior to drug holiday is the more effective and cost-effective option. INTRODUCTION: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare 5 versus 10 years of alendronate treatment prior to 5-year drug holiday for postmenopausal osteoporotic women. METHODS: We created an individual-level state-transition microsimulation model to compare 3 treatment strategies for US postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and femoral neck BMD T-scores between -?2.5 and -?3.5 at baseline: recurrent periods of 5 years of alendronate followed by 5 years of drug holiday (alendronate 5/5), recurrent periods of 10 years of alendronate followed by 5 years of drug holiday (alendronate 10/5), and no alendronate treatment. RESULTS: Base-case analysis revealed for women initiating treatment at ages 50, 60, and 70, the alendronate 5/5 strategy dominated (was more effective and less costly than) the alendronate 10/5 strategy and no treatment. For women age 80, the alendronate 10/5 strategy dominated.

METHODS: We created an individual-level state-transition microsimulation model to compare 3 treatment strategies for US postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and femoral neck BMD T-scores between -?2.5 and -?3.5 at baseline: recurrent periods of 5 years of alendronate followed by 5 years of drug holiday (alendronate 5/5), recurrent periods of 10 years of alendronate followed by 5 years of drug holiday (alendronate 10/5), and no alendronate treatment. RESULTS: Base-case analysis revealed for women initiating treatment at ages 50, 60, and 70, the alendronate 5/5 strategy dominated (was more effective and less costly than) the alendronate 10/5 strategy and no treatment. For women age 80, the alendronate 10/5 strategy dominated. When assuming a lower relative risk of nonvertebral fracture during years 6-10 of alendronate treatment than the base-case assumption, the alendronate 10/5 strategy became the most cost-effective strategy even at younger treatment initiation ages. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings; for treatment initiation ages of 50, 60, and 70, the alendronate 5/5 strategy was favored, whereas for treatment initiation age of 80, the alendronate 10/5 strategy was favored; however, there was uncertainty in these findings.

24642,Economic Evaluation of Oral Alendronate Therapy for Osteoporosis in Chinese Postmenopausal Women: The Impact of Medication Compliance and Persistence,"Objective: Prevalence of osteoporosis in Chinese postmenopausal women has significantly increased over the past decade and oral bisphosphonates are the most potent antiresorptive drugs. The purpose of the present research was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of oral alendronate for individuals with osteoporosis. We also assessed the impact of medication compliance and persistence on economic outcomes of alendronate and potential economic evaluations of persistence-enhancing interventions. Methods: We constructed an individual-level state-transition model to project health outcomes and costs of oral alendronate for Chinese postmenopausal osteoporotic women. The impact of medication compliance and persistence on economic evaluation was addressed in various scenario analyses. Model inputs were derived from clinical trials and published sources, where available. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on the cost-effectiveness results. Results: Compared with no treatment, alendronate treatment was associated with an additional 0.052 QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years) at an additional cost of USD 738, which yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 14,192.308/QALY. The ICER for the different scenarios (full compliance, full persistence, and both full persistence and full compliance) was USD 4,933.333/QALY, USD 3,006.849/QALY, and USD 2,049.822/QALY, respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to variations in time horizon and residual effect. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that, at a willingness to pay of USD 29,340/QALY, the probability that oral alendronate therapy will be cost-effective is approximately 80%. Conclusion: The findings support the view that oral alendronate is cost-effective for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures in Chinese postmenopausal women.

24643,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of tranexamic acid for the treatment of traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the CRASH-3 randomised trial: a decision modelling approach","INTRODUCTION: An estimated 69?million traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur each year worldwide, with most in low-income and middle-income countries. The CRASH-3 randomised trial found that intravenous administration of tranexamic acid within 3?hours of injury reduces head injury deaths in patients sustaining a mild or moderate TBI. We examined the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid treatment for TBI. METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment with and without tranexamic acid, in addition to current practice. We modelled the decision in the UK and Pakistan from a health service perspective, over a lifetime time horizon. We used data from the CRASH-3 trial for the risk of death during the trial period (28 days) and patient quality of life, and data from the literature to estimate costs and long-term outcomes post-TBI. We present outcomes as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 2018 costs in pounds for the UK, and US dollars for Pakistan. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per QALY gained were estimated, and compared with country specific cost-effective thresholds. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Tranexamic acid was highly cost-effective for patients with mild TBI and intracranial bleeding or patients with moderate TBI, at £4288 per QALY in the UK, and US$24 per QALY in Pakistan. Tranexamic acid was 99% and 98% cost-effective at the cost-effectiveness thresholds for the UK and Pakistan, respectively, and remained cost-effective across all deterministic sensitivity analyses. Tranexamic acid was even more cost-effective with earlier treatment administration. The cost-effectiveness for those with severe TBI was uncertain.

24645,Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative colon cancer screening strategies in the context of the French national screening program,"BACKGROUND: A nationwide colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program was set up in France from 2009 for average-risk, asymptomatic people aged 50-74?years based on an immunochemical fecal occult blood test [faecal immunochemical test (FIT)] every 2?years, followed by colonoscopy if positive. The European standard recommends a participation rate of 45% for the program to be cost-effective, yet the latest published rate in France was 34%. The objective of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of screening alternatives taking real-world participation rates into account.

A microsimulation model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness associated with each strategy. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, FIT was associated with a 14.0 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) increase of €50,520 per 1000 individuals, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3600/QALY.

24653,Health and economic outcomes of newborn screening for infantile-onset Pompe disease,"PURPOSE: To estimate health and economic outcomes associated with newborn screening (NBS) for infantile-onset Pompe disease in the United States. METHODS: A decision analytic microsimulation model simulated health and economic outcomes of a birth cohort of 4 million children in the United States. Universal NBS and treatment was compared with clinical identification and treatment of infantile-onset Pompe disease. Main outcomes were projected cases identified, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over the life course. RESULTS: Universal NBS for Pompe disease and confirmatory testing was estimated to cost an additional $26 million annually. Additional medication costs associated with earlier treatment initiation were $181 million; however, $8 million in medical care costs for other services were averted due to delayed disease progression. Infants with screened and treated infantile-onset Pompe disease experienced an average lifetime increase of 11.66 QALYs compared with clinical detection. The ICER was $379,000/QALY from a societal perspective and $408,000/QALY from the health-care perspective. Results were sensitive to the cost of enzyme replacement therapy.

24655,"Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in China: an economic analysis based on a randomised, open-label, phase III trial","BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab was recently demonstrated to have survival benefit in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (r/mHNSCC). However, the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in China remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to describe the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care (SOC) therapy in r/mHNSCC in China. DESIGN: A Markov model consisting of three health states (stable, progressive and dead) was developed to compare the cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab with SOC in platinum-resistant r/mHNSCC. Model inputs for transition probabilities and toxicity were collected from the KEYNOTE-040 trial, while health utilities were estimated from a literature review. Cost data were acquired for the payer''s perspective in China. Costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3.0%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the uncertainties surrounding model parameters. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), which were calculated as the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The total mean cost of pembrolizumab and SOC was US$45 861 and US$41 950, respectively. As for effectiveness, pembrolizumab yielded 0.31 QALYs compared with 0.25 QALYs for SOC therapy. The ICER for pembrolizumab versus SOC was US$65 186/QALY, which was higher than the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of US$28 130/QALY in China. The univariate sensitivity analysis indicated that utility values for progressive state, probability from stable to progressive in the SOC group, as well as cost of pembrolizumab were the three most influential variables on ICER. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that standard therapy was more likely to be cost-effective compared with pembrolizumab at a WTP value of US$28 130/QALY. Results were robust across both univariate analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is not likely to be a cost-effective strategy compared with SOC therapy in patients with platinum-resistant r/mHNSCC in China.

We performed a trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a lifestyle intervention targeted at preventing diabetes in India. METHODS: The Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program was a cluster-randomized controlled trial of 1007 individuals conducted in 60 polling areas (electoral divisions) in Kerala state. Participants (30-60?years) were those with a high diabetes risk score and without diabetes on an oral glucose tolerance test. The intervention group received a 12-month peer-support lifestyle intervention involving 15 group sessions delivered in community settings by trained lay peer leaders. There were also linked community activities to sustain behavior change. The control group received a booklet on lifestyle change. Costs were estimated from the health system and societal perspectives, with 2018 as the reference year. Effectiveness was measured in terms of the number of diabetes cases prevented and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Three times India''s gross domestic product per capita (US$6108) was used as the cost-effectiveness threshold. The analyses were conducted with a 2-year time horizon. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per annum. One-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two study groups. Over 2 years, the intervention resulted in an incremental health system cost of US$2.0 (intervention group: US$303.6; control group: US$301.6), incremental societal cost of US$6.2 (intervention group: US$367.8; control group: US$361.5), absolute risk reduction of 2.1%, and incremental QALYs of 0.04 per person. From a health system perspective, the cost per diabetes case prevented was US$95.2, and the cost per QALY gained was US$50.0. From a societal perspective, the corresponding figures were US$295.1 and US$155.0. For the number of diabetes cases prevented, the probability for the intervention to be cost-effective was 84.0% and 83.1% from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively.

24659,Cost-effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention in high-risk individuals for diabetes in a low- and middle-income setting: Trial-based analysis of the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program,"BACKGROUND: Data on the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle-based diabetes prevention programs are mostly from high-income countries, which cannot be extrapolated to low- and middle-income countries. We performed a trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a lifestyle intervention targeted at preventing diabetes in India. METHODS: The Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program was a cluster-randomized controlled trial of 1007 individuals conducted in 60 polling areas (electoral divisions) in Kerala state. Participants (30-60?years) were those with a high diabetes risk score and without diabetes on an oral glucose tolerance test. The intervention group received a 12-month peer-support lifestyle intervention involving 15 group sessions delivered in community settings by trained lay peer leaders. There were also linked community activities to sustain behavior change. The control group received a booklet on lifestyle change. Costs were estimated from the health system and societal perspectives, with 2018 as the reference year. Effectiveness was measured in terms of the number of diabetes cases prevented and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Three times India''s gross domestic product per capita (US$6108) was used as the cost-effectiveness threshold. The analyses were conducted with a 2-year time horizon. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per annum. One-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two study groups. Over 2 years, the intervention resulted in an incremental health system cost of US$2.0 (intervention group: US$303.6; control group: US$301.6), incremental societal cost of US$6.2 (intervention group: US$367.8; control group: US$361.5), absolute risk reduction of 2.1%, and incremental QALYs of 0.04 per person. From a health system perspective, the cost per diabetes case prevented was US$95.2, and the cost per QALY gained was US$50.0. From a societal perspective, the corresponding figures were US$295.1 and US$155.0. For the number of diabetes cases prevented, the probability for the intervention to be cost-effective was 84.0% and 83.1% from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. The corresponding figures for QALY gained were 99.1% and 97.8%. The results were robust to discounting and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: A community-based peer-support lifestyle intervention was cost-effective in individuals at high risk of developing diabetes in India over 2 years.

24660,Preablation Diagnostic Whole-Body Scan vs Empiric Radioactive Iodine Ablation in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a comparative analysis of postthyroidectomy radioactive iodine ablation dosing with or without the implementation of a diagnostic whole-body scan in patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Decision analysis model. SETTING: Hospital or ambulatory center. METHODS: A decision tree model was created to determine the cost-effectiveness of radioactive iodine ablation dosed with diagnostic whole-body scans versus empiric radioactive iodine ablation in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer undergoing postthyroidectomy ablation. The decision tree was populated with values from the published literature. Costs were represented by 2020 Medicare reimbursement rates (US dollars), and morbidity and survival data were used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Empiric radioactive iodine dosing was the dominant economic strategy, producing 0.94 more quality-adjusted life-years while costing $1250.07 less than management with a diagnostic whole-body scan. Sensitivity analyses upheld these results except in cases involving a large discrepancy in successful ablation rates between the diagnostic and empiric treatment arms. CONCLUSION: For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer requiring postthyroidectomy ablation, it is more cost-effective to administer radioactive iodine empirically.",2020-01-34583,33076776,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Simran Arjani,2020,/,194599820966982,No,33076776,"Simran Arjani; Patrick L Quinn; Ravi J Chokshi; Preablation Diagnostic Whole-Body Scan vs Empiric Radioactive Iodine Ablation in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Cost-effectiveness Analysis, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 2020 Oct 20; ():0194-5998; 194599820966982",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Procedure",radioactive iodine ablation vs. Standard/Usual Care- radioactive iodine ablation + diagnostic whole-body scan,"requires a radioactive iodine ablation following a total or near-total thyroidectomy, gross extrathyroidal extension, tumor size >4 cm, bulky or >5 positive lymph nodes, or postoperative unstimulated thyroglobulin levels >5 to 10ng/mL",Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1329.86,United States,2020,-1329.86
24661,Conflicting findings between the Mitra-Fr and the Coapt trials: Implications regarding the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous repair for heart failure patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation,"PURPOSE: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Mitra-Fr and Coapt, evaluating the benefit of percutaneous repair (PR) for heart failure (HF) patients with severe mitral regurgitation, have led to conflicting results. We aimed to evaluate the impact of these trial results on the cost-effectiveness of PR using effectiveness inputs from the two RCTs. METHODS: We developed a time varying Markov type model with three mutually exclusive health states: alive without HF hospitalisation, alive with HF hospitalisation, and dead. Clinically plausible extrapolations beyond observed data were obtained by developing parametric modelling for overall survival and HF hospitalisations using published data from each trial. We adopted the perspective of the French Health System and used a 30-year time horizon. Results were expressed as € / quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained using utility inputs from literature. FINDINGS: Results are presented using treatment efficacy measures from Mitra-F and Coapt trials respectively. With the Mitra-Fr data, after annual discounting, the base case model generated an incremental 0.00387 QALY at a cost of €25,010, yielding an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €6,467,032 / QALY. The model was sensitive to changes made to model inputs. There was no potential of PR being cost-effective. With the Coapt data, the model generated 1.19 QALY gain at a cost of €26,130 yielding an ICER of €21,918 / QALY and at a threshold of >€50,000/QALY PR had a probability of 1 of being cost-effective.

24663,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of BCG Vaccination against Tuberculosis in Indonesia: A Model-Based Study,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only available vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), has been applied for decades. The Indonesian government recently introduced a national TB disease control programme that includes several action plans, notably enhanced vaccination coverage, which can be strengthened through underpinning its favourable cost-effectiveness. We designed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of Indonesia''s current BCG vaccination programme. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated from the perspectives of both society and healthcare. The robustness of the analysis was confirmed through univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Using epidemiological data compiled for Indonesia, BCG vaccination at a price US$14 was estimated to be a cost-effective strategy in controlling TB disease. From societal and healthcare perspectives, ICERs were US$104 and US$112 per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively. The results were robust for variations of most variables in the univariate analysis. Notably, the vaccine''s effectiveness regarding disease protection, vaccination costs, and case detection rates were key drivers for cost-effectiveness. The PSA results indicated that vaccination was cost-effective even at US$175 threshold in 95% of cases, approximating the monthly GDP per capita.

24665,Bempedoic acid for high-risk patients with CVD as adjunct lipid-lowering therapy: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Bempedoic acid is a novel adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase inhibitor shown to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as an adjunct lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. OBJECTIVE: Our analysis aimed to determine the price at which bempedoic acid would be cost-effective from the Australian health care perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was designed using data from the Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Harmony trial, to model the clinical outcomes and costs of 1000 patients treated with bempedoic acid over a lifetime horizon. Relevant health states were ""Alive with CVD,"" ""Alive with recurrent CVD,"" and ""Dead."" With annual cycles, patients were at risk of a nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and death from CVD or non-CVD causes. Costs and utilities were obtained from published sources. Outcomes of interest were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per year of life saved. Outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum. RESULTS: Among 1000 individuals, bempedoic acid in addition to statin therapy was estimated to save 122 (discounted) years of life and 103 (discounted) QALYs compared with statin therapy alone. At an acquisition cost of AU$584.40 per year (USD$397.01), bempedoic acid would be considered cost-effective within the Australian setting, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AU$49,890 per QALY gained (USD$33,893) and AU$42,433 per year of life saved (USD$28,827).

24666,Modeling the Cost-effectiveness of Esophageal Cancer Screening in China,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of one-time standard endoscopic screening with Lugol''s iodine staining for esophageal cancer (EC) in China. METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model with eleven states was built. Individuals aged 40 to 69 years were classified into six age groups in five-year intervals. Three different strategies were adopted for each cohort: (1) no screening; (2) one-time endoscopic screening with Lugol''s iodine staining with an annual follow-up for low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN); and (3) one-time endoscopic screening with Lugol''s iodine staining without follow-up. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) indicated the effectiveness of the model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the evaluation indicator. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: One-time screening with follow-up was the undominated strategy for individuals aged 40-44 and 45-49 years, which saved USD 10,942.57 and USD 6611.73 per QALY gained compared to nonscreening strategy. For those aged 50-69 years, the nonscreening scenarios were undominated. One-time screening without follow-up was the extended dominated strategy.

24682,Modeling the Cost-effectiveness of Esophageal Cancer Screening in China,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of one-time standard endoscopic screening with Lugol''s iodine staining for esophageal cancer (EC) in China. METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model with eleven states was built. Individuals aged 40 to 69 years were classified into six age groups in five-year intervals. Three different strategies were adopted for each cohort: (1) no screening; (2) one-time endoscopic screening with Lugol''s iodine staining with an annual follow-up for low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN); and (3) one-time endoscopic screening with Lugol''s iodine staining without follow-up. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) indicated the effectiveness of the model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the evaluation indicator. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: One-time screening with follow-up was the undominated strategy for individuals aged 40-44 and 45-49 years, which saved USD 10,942.57 and USD 6611.73 per QALY gained compared to nonscreening strategy. For those aged 50-69 years, the nonscreening scenarios were undominated. One-time screening without follow-up was the extended dominated strategy. Compared to screening strategies without follow-up, all the screening strategies with follow-up were more cost-effective, with the ICER increasing from 299.57 USD/QALY for individuals aged 40-44 years to 1617.72 USD/QALY for individuals aged 65-69 years.

However, their economic outcomes are still unclear. The current study would assess the cost-effectiveness of conbercept, aflibercept and ranibizumab for patients with wAMD in a Chinese healthcare setting. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on patient visual acuity. Five regimens were considered: usual care without active anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, IVT-AFL (intravitreal aflibercept on a two-monthly basis following three initial monthly doses), RBZ q4 (ranibizumab monthly dosing), RBZ RPN (ranibizumab dose as needed) and IVT-CON (intravitreal conbercept on a three-monthly basis after three initial monthly doses). Clinical, cost, and utility data were collected from published literature. RESULTS: In comparison with usual care, the IVT-AFL, RBZ q4, RBZ PRN, and IVT-CON strategies provided an additional 0.235, 0.338, 0.228, and 0.324 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively.

DESIGN: We designed a Markov model to compare expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of starting antiviral treatment at IT-phase (''treat-IT'') vs delaying the therapy until active hepatitis phase (''untreat-IT'') in CHB patients over a 20-year horizon. A cohort of 10 000 non-cirrhotic 35-year-old patients in IT-phase CHB (hepatitis B e antigen-positive, mean serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels 7.6 log(10) IU/mL, and normal alanine aminotransferase levels) was simulated. Input parameters were obtained from previous studies at Asan Medical Center, Korea. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the treat-IT and untreat-IT strategies was calculated. RESULTS: From a healthcare system perspective, the treat-IT strategy with entecavir or tenofovir had an ICER of US$16 516/QALY, with an annual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence of 0.73% in the untreat-IT group. With the annual HCC risk =0.54%, the treat-IT strategy was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$20 000/QALY. From a societal perspective considering productivity loss by premature death, the treat-IT strategy was extremely cost-effective, and was dominant (ICER <0) if the HCC risk was =0.43%, suggesting that the treat-IT strategy incurs less costs than the untreat-IT strategy. The most influential parameters on cost-effectiveness of the treat-IT strategy were those related with HCC risk (HBV DNA levels, platelet counts and age) and drug cost.

For patients in whom conventional treatment is no longer effective, biological or small molecule therapy may be an option. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1?year of UC with infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA), golimumab, vedolizumab (VDZ) and tofacitinib (TFB) compared with standard of care (SoC) in Poland. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of four biologics, TFB and placebo in patients with the diagnosis of moderate to severe UC who had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to a conventional therapy. Prior exposure to anti-TNF was considered. At the beginning of the maintenance phase, the decision to continue biological therapy was determined by the achievement of response at the end of induction. Efficacy data were obtained from a network meta-analysis using placebo as the common comparator. Costs were presented in 2018 Polish zloty (PLN) and outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

For patients in whom conventional treatment is no longer effective, biological or small molecule therapy may be an option. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1?year of UC with infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA), golimumab, vedolizumab (VDZ) and tofacitinib (TFB) compared with standard of care (SoC) in Poland. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of four biologics, TFB and placebo in patients with the diagnosis of moderate to severe UC who had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to a conventional therapy. Prior exposure to anti-TNF was considered. At the beginning of the maintenance phase, the decision to continue biological therapy was determined by the achievement of response at the end of induction. Efficacy data were obtained from a network meta-analysis using placebo as the common comparator. Costs were presented in 2018 Polish zloty (PLN) and outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
