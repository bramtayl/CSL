33601,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Vedolizumab Compared With Infliximab in Anti-TNF-α-Naïve Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis in China.,"Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of vedolizumab vs. infliximab in the treatment of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis (UC) in China. Methods: The costs and effectiveness of vedolizumab and infliximab in the treatment of anti-TNF-α naïve patients with moderate-to-severe active UC were compared using a hybrid decision tree model and a Markov model. From the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, this study simulated the lifetime health benefits [quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] and costs (USD) for patients with UC from the induction phase to the maintenance phase, with an annual discount rate of 5%. The clinical efficacy and transition probability data were based on a previously published network meta-analysis. The health utility, surgical risk, biologic drug discontinuation rate, and mortality were derived from previous literature and the Chinese statistical yearbook. The cost data were based on China's drug purchase and biding platform and the results of a survey sent to clinicians in 18 tertiary hospitals. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed to validate the robustness of the models' assumptions and specific parameter estimates. Results: The results of the base-case analyses showed that compared with infliximab, vedolizumab led to a gain of 0.25 QALYs (9.56 vs. 9.31 QALYs) and was less expensive by $7,349 ($180,138 vs. 187,487), indicating that the use of vedolizumab was a dominant strategy. The results of one-way sensitivity analyses suggested that the annual discount rate and health-state costs had the greatest impact, but the results were otherwise consistent with those of the base-case analyses. The PSAs suggested that vedolizumab had a 98.6% probability of being effective at a threshold of 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China in 2020. Conclusion: Compared with infliximab, vedolizumab appears to be a more cost-effective option in the treatment of anti-TNF-α naïve adult patients with moderate-to-severe, active UC in China.",2021-01-42492,34490187,Front Public Health,Ting Zhou,2021,9 /,704889,No,34490187,"Ting Zhou; Yanan Sheng; Haijing Guan; Rui Meng; Zijing Wang; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Vedolizumab Compared With Infliximab in Anti-TNF-α-Naïve Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis in China., Front Public Health, 2021; 9():; 704889",QALY,China,Noninfective enteritis and colitis,Pharmaceutical,vedolizumab vs. infliximab,"Mayo score ≥ 6, no response to conventional therapy, not previously received anti-TNF-α therapyn",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,-29396,United States,2020,-30777.03
33602,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a chronic back pain multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) compared to standard care for privately insured in Germany.,"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) is highly recommended for chronic lower back pain (CLBP) treatment, but its economic benefit remains to be clearly demonstrated. The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of a 12-month MBR programme of behavioural change coaching and device-supported exercise on direct medical costs, sick leave and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 24 months. METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in Germany from a private health insurance perspective using data from a multi-centre, two-arm randomised controlled trial with parallel-group Zelen's randomisation and 24-month follow-up. After removing dissimilarities in characteristics between MBR and usual care (control) via propensity score matching, treatment effects were calculated using a difference-in-difference approach. RESULTS: Base-case analysis of the MBR (n=112) and usual care group (n=111) showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €8,296 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, indicating that the intervention was cost-effective. Compared to the controls, MBR reduced economically unaccounted sick leave due to back pain in the last six months by 17.5 days (p = 0.001) and had a positive effect on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (0.046, p=0.026). Subgroup analysis of participants with major impairment demonstrated that a dominant intervention was possible, as reflected by an ICER of - €7,302 per QALY. Savings were driven by a - €1,824 reduction in back pain-specific costs. Moreover, sick leave was 27 days (p = 0.006) less in the MBR group. CONCLUSIONS: This first cost-effectiveness study with combined data from a private health insurer and a controlled trial in Germany demonstrated that long term MBR for the treatment of CLBP is cost-effective. Subgroups with major impairment from back pain benefitted more from the intervention than those with minor impairment. MBR significantly reduced sick leave in all participants. Hence, it is a profitable intervention from a societal point of view.

33603,A cost utility analysis alongside a cluster-randomised trial evaluating a minor ailment service compared to usual care in community pharmacy.,"BACKGROUND: Minor ailments are ""self-limiting conditions which may be diagnosed and managed without a medical intervention"". A cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) was designed to evaluate the clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes of a Minor Ailment Service (MAS) in community pharmacy (CP) compared with usual care (UC). METHODS: The cRCT was conducted for 6 months from December 2017. The pharmacist-patient intervention consisted of a standardised face-to-face consultation on a web-based program using co-developed protocols, pharmacists' training, practice change facilitators and patients' educational material. Patients requesting a non-prescription medication (direct product request) or presenting minor ailments received MAS or UC and were followed-up by telephone 10-days after the consultation. The primary economic outcomes were incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the service and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Total costs included health system, CPs and patient direct costs: health professionals' consultation time, medication costs, pharmacists' training costs, investment of the pharmacy and consultation costs within the 10 days following the initial consultation. The HRQoL was obtained using the EuroQoL 5D-5L at the time of the consultation and at 10-days follow up. A sensitivity analysis was carried out using bootstrapping. There were two sub-group analyses undertaken, for symptom presentation and direct product requests, to evaluate possible differences. RESULTS: A total of 808 patients (323 MAS and 485 UC) were recruited in 27 CPs with 42 pharmacists (20 MAS and 22 UC). 64.7% (n = 523) of patients responded to follow-up after their consultation in CP. MAS patients gained an additional 0.0003 QALYs (p = 0.053). When considering only MAS patients presenting with symptoms, the ICUR was 24,733€/QALY with a 47.4% probability of cost-effectiveness (willingness to pay of 25,000€/QALY). Although when considering patients presenting for a direct product request, MAS was the dominant strategy with a 93.69% probability of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Expanding community pharmacists' scope through MAS may benefit health systems. To be fully cost effective, MAS should not only include consultations arising from symptom presentation but also include an oversight of self-selected products by patients. MAS increase patient safety through the appropriate use of non-prescription medication and through the direct referral of patients to GP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN17235323 .

33604,China county-based prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer and a cost-effective analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, and is the third-leading cause of cancer death in men. Nearly 70% of new prostate cancer patients in China are locally advanced or widely metastatic with poor prognosis. Providing active treatment to early stage prostate cancer patients can improve the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Thus, this study sought to evaluate the economy of early prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening for high-risk prostate cancer. METHODS: Based on the data collected from the PSA screening activities of 11 county hospitals from October 2019 to April 2021, this study evaluated a high-risk prostate cancer population who received PSA screening and their quality of life and economy. The screening population comprised males aged over 50 years. All screening patients were tested for PSA. If the PSA value is unnormal, a further diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) or a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy were performed. The decision-tree and Markov model was used to simulate the process of disease development of high-risk prostate cancer patients who underwent screenings and those who did not, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 13,726 men received a PSA screening. Of these, 1,062 men had abnormal PSA values, and 73 of these were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Of these 73 patients, 40, 21, and 12 had early stage, mid-stage, and late-stage prostate cancer, respectively. Compared to the patients unscreened, the 1,000 patients who received an early PSA screening increased their quality-adjusted life year (QALY) by 15.69 years; however, each QALY had an additional cost of 38,550 yuan, which was lower than the willingness to pay threshold of 72,447 yuan (per capita gross domestic product in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: For high-risk prostate cancer patients, early screenings have a cost-effective advantage over no screenings. Thus, early screening should be vigorously promoted for high-risk prostate cancer patients.",2021-01-42508,34804822,Transl Androl Urol,Zhiguo Zhang,2021,10 / 10,3787-3799,No,34804822,"Zhiguo Zhang; Guoshu Liang; Peng Zhang; Zhongqi Zhao; Zhongnan He; Fengzhen Luo; Zhenqing Chen; Zongke Yang; Zhijie Zhang; Tao Xia; Xin Liu; Yong Zhang; Wei Ye; China county-based prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer and a cost-effective analysis., Transl Androl Urol, 2021 Oct; 10(10):; 3787-3799",QALY,China,Malignant neoplasms of male genital organs,Screening,prostate specific antigen screening vs. no prostate specific antigen screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Male,Full,"20 Years, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,38550,China,2020,5845.9
33605,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of dolutegravir/lamivudine for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: Dolutegravir(DTG)/lamivudine(3TC) is the first 2-drug regimen recommended as an initial treatment for people living with HIV (PLHIV). OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and potential budget impact of DTG/3TC in the US healthcare setting. METHODS: A previously published hybrid decision-tree and Markov cohort state transition model was adapted to estimate the incremental costs and health outcome benefits over a patients' lifetime. DTG/3TC was compared with current standard of care in treatment naive and treatment experienced virologically suppressed PLHIV. Health states included in the model were based upon virologic response and CD4 cell count, with death as an absorbing state. Clinical data was informed by the Phase III GEMINI 1 and 2 clinical trials, a published network meta-analysis (NMA) in treatment-naive patients and the Phase III TANGO clinical trial in treatment experienced patients. Costs and utilities were informed by published data and discounted annually at a rate of 3%. A separate 5-year budget impact analysis was conducted assuming 5%-15% uptake in eligible treatment naive and 10%-30% uptake in eligible treatment experienced patients. RESULTS: In the treatment naive analyses based on GEMINI 1 and 2, DTG/3TC dominated, i.e., was less costly and more effective, than all comparators. DTG/3TC resulted in 0.083 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a cost saving of $199,166 compared with the DTG + tenofovir disoproxil(TDF)/emtricitabine(FTC) comparator arm. The incremental QALY and cost savings for DTG/3TC compared with DTG/abacavir(ABC)/3TC, cobicistat-boosted darunavir(DRV/c)/tenofovir alafenamide(TAF)/FTC, and bictegravir (BIC)/TAF/FTC, based on NMA results were 0.465, 0.142, and 0.698, and $42,948, $122,846, and $44,962, respectively. In the analyses of treatment-experienced virologically suppressed patients based on TANGO, DTG/3TC offered slightly lower QALYs (-0.037) with an estimated savings of $78,730 when compared with continuation of TAF-based regimen (TBR). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that these conclusions were relatively insensitive to alternative parameter estimates. The budget impact analysis estimated that by 5th year a total of 70,240 treatment naive patients and 1,340,480 treatment experienced patients could be eligible to be prescribed DTG/3TC. The estimated budget savings over 5 years ranged from $1.12b to $3.35b (corresponding to 27,512 to 82,536 on DTG/3TC by year 5) in the lowest and highest uptake scenarios, respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, DTG/3TC with its comparable efficacy and lower drug acquisition costs, has the potential to offer significant cost savings to US healthcare payers for the initial treatment of treatment naive patients and as a treatment switching option for virologically suppressed patients.

DTG/3TC was compared with current standard of care in treatment naive and treatment experienced virologically suppressed PLHIV. Health states included in the model were based upon virologic response and CD4 cell count, with death as an absorbing state. Clinical data was informed by the Phase III GEMINI 1 and 2 clinical trials, a published network meta-analysis (NMA) in treatment-naive patients and the Phase III TANGO clinical trial in treatment experienced patients. Costs and utilities were informed by published data and discounted annually at a rate of 3%. A separate 5-year budget impact analysis was conducted assuming 5%-15% uptake in eligible treatment naive and 10%-30% uptake in eligible treatment experienced patients. RESULTS: In the treatment naive analyses based on GEMINI 1 and 2, DTG/3TC dominated, i.e., was less costly and more effective, than all comparators. DTG/3TC resulted in 0.083 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a cost saving of $199,166 compared with the DTG + tenofovir disoproxil(TDF)/emtricitabine(FTC) comparator arm. The incremental QALY and cost savings for DTG/3TC compared with DTG/abacavir(ABC)/3TC, cobicistat-boosted darunavir(DRV/c)/tenofovir alafenamide(TAF)/FTC, and bictegravir (BIC)/TAF/FTC, based on NMA results were 0.465, 0.142, and 0.698, and $42,948, $122,846, and $44,962, respectively. In the analyses of treatment-experienced virologically suppressed patients based on TANGO, DTG/3TC offered slightly lower QALYs (-0.037) with an estimated savings of $78,730 when compared with continuation of TAF-based regimen (TBR). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that these conclusions were relatively insensitive to alternative parameter estimates. The budget impact analysis estimated that by 5th year a total of 70,240 treatment naive patients and 1,340,480 treatment experienced patients could be eligible to be prescribed DTG/3TC. The estimated budget savings over 5 years ranged from $1.12b to $3.35b (corresponding to 27,512 to 82,536 on DTG/3TC by year 5) in the lowest and highest uptake scenarios, respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, DTG/3TC with its comparable efficacy and lower drug acquisition costs, has the potential to offer significant cost savings to US healthcare payers for the initial treatment of treatment naive patients and as a treatment switching option for virologically suppressed patients.

33610,Cost-Effectiveness of Ferrous Fumarate-Folic Acid and Ferrous Gluconate-Multivitamins in a High Prevalence Area of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Indonesia.,"Background: Up to now, the combinations of ferrous fumarate-folic acid (FF-FA) and ferrous gluconate-multivitamins (FG-MV) have been implemented by the local government in the province of Papua. Nevertheless, there is no a specific economic evaluation that has been applied to investigate the cost-effectiveness of FF-FA and FG-MV. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of FF-FA and FG-MV to be implemented in Teluk Bintuni, as one of the districts with the highest prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in Papua by taking the healthcare perspective into account. Methods: A prospective observational study was applied by considering two groups of women (15-49 years old) with iron deficiency anemia who received FF-FA and FG-MV from September to November 2018. Applying a purposive sampling method, respondents were selected from 875 targeted women in six sub-districts, who met inclusion criteria. To estimate the total cost, we applied a healthcare perspective that considered direct medical cost only (eg, the procurement cost of iron tablets, cost of Hb test, and cost of healthcare visit). To estimate the effectiveness of intervention, we applied two major parameters, such as Hb level and utility score in quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The cost-effectiveness values were evaluated by using the criteria on the cost-effectiveness of healthcare intervention according to the threshold of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (cost per QALY gained). Results: From 875 targeted women in six sub-districts who met inclusion criteria, we found approximately 222 women with moderate-severe iron deficiency anemia and 110 women with complete data in the group of FF-FA (n=69) and FG-MV (n-41). The results showed that there were significant differences (p-value <0.05) on the number of respondents, age, oral iron cost, total healthcare cost and utility score in both intervention groups. Comparing the use of FG-MV with FF-FA, we estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) would be $255.77 per controlled patient, $142.09 per patient with Hb increment >2.00 g/dL, $79.93 per patient with Hb increment >1.00 g/dL, and $11.59 per QALY gained. Conclusion: The ICER was estimated to be $11.59 per QALY gained, which was highly cost-effective, according to GDP-based cost-effectiveness threshold. In addition, the utility score of women with iron deficiency anemia was considered to be the most influential factor impacting the cost-effectiveness value.",2021-01-42516,34629872,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Yasinta Rakanita,2021,17 /,1075-1081,No,34629872,"Yasinta Rakanita; A A Syamsunarno, Mas Rizky; Rano Sinuraya; Eka Suradji; Rizky Abdulah; Auliya Suwantika; Cost-Effectiveness of Ferrous Fumarate-Folic Acid and Ferrous Gluconate-Multivitamins in a High Prevalence Area of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Indonesia., Ther Clin Risk Manag, 2021; 17():; 1075-1081",QALY,Indonesia,Nutritional anaemias,Pharmaceutical,Ferrous Fumarate–Folic Acid vs. Ferrous Gluconate Multivitamins,Not Stated,49 Years,15 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,1.57,United States,2019,1.67
33611,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cemiplimab vs pembrolizumab for treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Most cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs) can be treated with surgical excision or radiation; however, approximately 1% of patients develop advanced disease. In 2018, the FDA approved cemiplimab-rwlc as the first programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. In June 2020, pembrolizumab, another PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. We previously reported on the cost-effectiveness of cemiplimab vs historical standard of care for the treatment of advanced CSCC from a US perspective. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of cemiplimab vs pembrolizumab for patients with advanced CSCC in the United States. METHODS: A ""partitioned survival"" framework was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of cemiplimab vs pembrolizumab. Clinical inputs were based on the most recent data cut of the phase 2 trials for cemiplimab (EMPOWER-CSCC-1; NCT02760498) and pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-629). Progression-free survival and overall survival were extrapolated using parametric models until all patients had progressed or died. Health state utilities were derived from data collected in the EMPOWER-CSCC-1 trial. Costs included drug acquisition, drug administration, disease management, terminal care, and adverse events and were based on published 2020 US list prices. To assess model uncertainty, 1-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted, alongside scenario analyses evaluating key modeling assumptions. RESULTS: In the base case, cemiplimab resulted in an incremental gain of 3.44 life-years (discounted) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $130,329 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) vs pembrolizumab. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY, PSA indicated a 71% probability that cemiplimab is cost-effective when compared with pembrolizumab. Scenario analysis resulted in ICERs ranging from $115,909 to $187,374. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that cemiplimab is a cost-effective treatment for patients with advanced CSCC, compared with pembrolizumab. These results should be interpreted cautiously in the absence of head-to-head trials; however, in the absence of such data, these results can be used to inform health care decisions over resource allocation.

33612,The cost-effectiveness of as-needed budesonide-formoterol versus low-dose inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy in patients with mild asthma in Canada.,"BACKGROUND: The Global Initiative for Asthma recommends the use of as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol as a preferred controller therapy for patients with mild asthma. These recommendations were based, in part, on evidence from the SYGMA 1 and 2 studies of as-needed budesonide-formoterol. This analysis aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of as-needed budesonide-formoterol to low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed short-acting β(2)-agonist (SABA) in patients with mild asthma. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was designed that included three possible health states (non-exacerbation, severe exacerbation, and death) to compare as-needed budesonide-formoterol 200-6 μg to twice-daily budesonide 200 μg maintenance therapy (low-dose ICS) plus as-needed terbutaline 0.5 mg (SABA). The deterministic base-case analysis used severe exacerbation, adverse event (AE), and healthcare resource use data from SYGMA 2, and was conducted from a Canadian public payer perspective with a 50-year time horizon, and a discount rate of 1.5% per annum. Moderate exacerbation was modelled on data from SYGMA 1 in sensitivity analyses. Utility values were derived from SYGMA 2 quality of life data. All-cause- and asthma-related mortality rates and costs (reported in 2019 Canadian dollars) were based on published data, using Canada-specific values where available. One-way deterministic sensitivity, probabilistic sensitivity, and eight scenario analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: As-needed budesonide-formoterol was the dominant treatment option in the base-case analysis, providing incremental cost savings of $9882 per patient and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains of 0.002 versus low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA over a 50-year time horizon. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY ($100,000/QALY), as-needed budesonide-formoterol had a 94% (95%) probability of being cost-effective compared with maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA. Cost-saving was mostly driven by lower overall medication and AE-related costs. As-needed budesonide-formoterol remained the dominant treatment in sensitivity and scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: As-needed budesonide-formoterol is a cost-saving option for the treatment of mild asthma from the perspective of the Canadian public payer compared with low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA.",2021-01-42523,34641954,Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,Mohsen Sadatsafavi,2021,17 / 1,108,No,34641954,"Mohsen Sadatsafavi; FitzGerald, J Mark; Paul O'Byrne; Mena Soliman; Niroshan Sriskandarajah; Colin Vicente; Golam, Sarowar Muhammad; The cost-effectiveness of as-needed budesonide-formoterol versus low-dose inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy in patients with mild asthma in Canada., Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol, 2021 Oct 12; 17(1):; 108",QALY,Canada,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Pharmaceutical,Budesonide-formoterol vs. Budesonide (low-dose inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy),Not Stated,Not Stated,12 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"50 Years, Not Stated / None",1.50,1.50,-4941450,Canada,2019,-3946914.02

33614,An economic evaluation of vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunctive treatment to anti-seizure medications for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in England.,"INTRODUCTION: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are commonly used to prevent recurring epileptic seizures, but around a third of people with epilepsy fail to achieve an adequate response. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is clinically recommended for people with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) who are not suitable for surgery, but the cost-effectiveness of the intervention has not recently been evaluated. The study objective is to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with using VNS as an adjunct to ongoing ASM therapy, compared to the strategy of using only ASMs in the treatment of people with DRE, from an English National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A cohort state transition model was developed in Microsoft Excel to simulate costs and QALYs of the VNS + ASM and ASM only strategies. Patients could transition between five health states, using a 3-month cycle length. Health states were defined by an expected percentage reduction in seizure frequency, derived from randomized control trial data. Costs included the VNS device as well as its installation, setup, and removal; ASM therapy; adverse events associated with VNS (dyspnea, hoarseness, and cough); and health-state costs associated with epilepsy including hospitalizations, emergency department visits, neurologist visits, and primary care visits. A range of sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis, were run to assess the impact of parameter and structural uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base case, VNS + ASM had an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £17,771 per QALY gained compared to ASMs alone. The cost-effective ICER was driven by relative reductions in expected seizure frequency and the differences in health care resource use associated therewith. Sensitivity analyses found that the amount of resource use per epilepsy-related health state was a key driver of the cost component. CONCLUSIONS: VNS is expected to be a cost-effective intervention in the treatment of DRE in the English National Health Service.",2021-01-42528,34348576,J Med Econ,Christopher Raspin,2021,24 / 1,1037-1051,No,34348576,"Christopher Raspin; Rohit Shankar; Francesca Barion; Vicki Pollit; Joanna Murphy; Laura Sawyer; Vanessa Danielson; An economic evaluation of vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunctive treatment to anti-seizure medications for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in England., J Med Econ, 2021 Jan-Dec; 24(1):; 1037-1051",QALY,United Kingdom,Episodic and paroxysmal disorders,Pharmaceutical,vagus nerve stimulation vs. anti-seizure medications,"focal seizures, refractory to anti-seizure medications, not suitable candidates for surgery",Not Stated,5 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"10 Years, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,17711,United Kingdom,2019,23970.37
33615,The Cost-Effectiveness of Expanding Vaccination with a Cell-Based Influenza Vaccine to Low Risk Adults Aged 50 to 64 Years in the United Kingdom.,"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, the UK National Health Service (NHS) extended influenza vaccination in 50- to 64-year-olds from at-risk only to all in this age group for the 2020/21 season. The objective of this research is to determine the cost-effectiveness of continuing to vaccinate all with a quadrivalent cell-based vaccine (QIVc) compared to returning to an at-risk only policy after the pandemic resolves. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model, calibrated to match infection data from the UK, was used to estimate the clinical and economic impact of vaccination across 10 influenza seasons. The base case effectiveness of QIVc was 63.9% and the list price was GBP 9.94. RESULTS: Vaccinating 50% of all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc reduced the average annual number of clinical infections (-682,000), hospitalizations (-5800) and deaths (-740) in the UK. The base case incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (ICER) of all compared to at-risk only was GBP6000 (NHS perspective). When the cost of lost productivity was considered, vaccinating all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc became cost-saving.

33620,The Cost-Effectiveness of Expanding Vaccination with a Cell-Based Influenza Vaccine to Low Risk Adults Aged 50 to 64 Years in the United Kingdom.,"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, the UK National Health Service (NHS) extended influenza vaccination in 50- to 64-year-olds from at-risk only to all in this age group for the 2020/21 season. The objective of this research is to determine the cost-effectiveness of continuing to vaccinate all with a quadrivalent cell-based vaccine (QIVc) compared to returning to an at-risk only policy after the pandemic resolves. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model, calibrated to match infection data from the UK, was used to estimate the clinical and economic impact of vaccination across 10 influenza seasons. The base case effectiveness of QIVc was 63.9% and the list price was GBP 9.94. RESULTS: Vaccinating 50% of all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc reduced the average annual number of clinical infections (-682,000), hospitalizations (-5800) and deaths (-740) in the UK. The base case incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (ICER) of all compared to at-risk only was GBP6000 (NHS perspective). When the cost of lost productivity was considered, vaccinating all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc became cost-saving. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc is likely to be cost-effective.

33621,Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of Videoconference-Based Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy is known to improve the management of chronic pain. However, the components of this therapy are still being investigated and debated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy program with new components (attention-shift, memory work, video feedback, and image training) delivered via videoconferencing. METHODS: This study was unblinded and participants were recruited and assessed face-to-face in the outpatient department. We conducted a randomized controlled trial for chronic pain to compare 16 weekly videoconference-based cognitive behavioral therapy (vCBT) sessions provided by a therapist with treatment as usual (TAU). Thirty patients (age range, 22-75 years) with chronic pain were randomly assigned to either vCBT (n=15) or TAU (n=15). Patients were evaluated at week 1 (baseline), week 8 (midintervention), and week 16 (postintervention). The primary outcome was the change in pain intensity, which was recorded using the numerical rating scale at 16 weeks from the baseline. Secondary outcomes were pain severity and pain interference, which were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. Additionally, we evaluated disability, pain catastrophizing cognition, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and cost utility. RESULTS: In the eligibility assessment, 30 patients were eventually randomized and enrolled; finally, 15 patients in the vCBT and 14 patients in the TAU group were analyzed. Although no significant difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of changes in pain intensity by the numerical rating scale scores at week 16 from baseline (P=.36), there was a significant improvement in the comprehensive evaluation of pain by total score of Brief Pain Inventory (-1.43, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.37, df=24; P=.01). Further, significant improvement was seen in pain interference by using the Brief Pain Inventory (-9.42, 95% CI -14.47 to -4.36, df=25; P=.001) and in disability by using the Pain Disability Assessment Scale (-1.95, 95% CI -3.33 to -0.56, df=24; P=.008) compared with TAU. As for the Medical Economic Evaluation, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 1 year was estimated at 2.9 million yen (about US $25,000) per quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study suggest that integrated cognitive behavioral therapy delivered by videoconferencing in regular medical care may reduce pain interference but not pain intensity. Further, this treatment method may be cost-effective, although this needs to be further verified using a larger sample size.

33622,Cost-effectiveness and return on investment of school-based health promotion programmes for chronic disease prevention.,"BACKGROUND: While school-based health prevention programmes are effective in addressing unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, little is known about their economic implications. We conducted an economic evaluation of the programmes that were previously identified as feasible, acceptable, and sustainable in the Canadian context. METHODS: This study builds on a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of feasible, acceptable, and sustainable school-based health promotion programmes. A micro-simulation model incorporated intervention effects on multiple risk factors to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) of comprehensive school health (CSH), multicomponent, and physical education (PE) curriculum modification programmes. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the programme costs below which the programme would be cost-effective at a CA$50 000 threshold level. RESULTS: The estimated costs below which interventions were cost-effective per quality-adjusted life year gained were CA$682, CA$444, and CA$416 per student for CSH, multicomponent, and PE curriculum modification programmes, respectively. CSH programmes remained cost-effective per year of chronic disease prevented for costs of up to CA$3384 per student, compared to CA$1911 and CA$1987 for multicomponent and PE curriculum modification interventions, respectively. If the interventions were implemented at total discounted intervention costs of CA$100 per student, ROI through the avoidance of direct healthcare costs related to the treatment and management of chronic diseases would be 824% for CSH, 465% for multicomponent interventions, and 484% for PE curriculum modification interventions.

33624,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Tapentadol Versus Oxycodone/Naloxone in both Branded and Generic Formulations in Patients with Musculoskeletal Pain.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current evidence shows that tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged-release is more cost effective than other opioids. However, the introduction into the market of generic formulations of traditional comparators, leading to potential savings due to their lower price, creates space for further research. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of tapentadol versus oxycodone/naloxone and the economic impact of the two alternatives in both branded and generic formulations. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the third-payer perspective (TPP), with specific reference to the Italian National Health Service. A Markov model was implemented to simulate transitions between states, comparing two arms: The first arm simulated the administration of tapentadol, while the second simulated the administration of oxycodone/naloxone, both branded and generic. The results were reported in terms of net monetary benefit (NMB). The willingness to pay (WPT) was estimated at €35,000/quality-adjusted life year. RESULTS: Tapentadol was dominant in all scenarios, assuming a population of 1000 individuals over a 1-year time horizon. In all cases, although the prices of oxycodone/naloxone generic formulations were lower, the costs associated with treatment discontinuation were always higher than those associated with tapentadol. The comparison with the branded formulation of oxycodone/naloxone was associated with the highest savings of €431.77 per patient, and with the highest NMB of €1943.77 per patient.

33628,Cost and health impact analysis of herpes zoster vaccination in Norway.,"BACKGROUND: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a national vaccination program against herpes zoster in Norway. METHODS: The model analyzed six vaccination scenarios that included the live-attenuated zoster vaccine under different target ages of vaccination (60, 65, and 70 years) compared with no vaccination. A catch-up program implemented in the first year of the vaccination was included in three of the scenarios. The model followed the population of Norway over a 40-year time horizon to estimate costs and outcomes associated with vaccination. Immunization costs, costs related to herpes zoster (both healthcare sector and non-healthcare sector), the quality of life gains due to avoided cases of herpes zoster, and quality-of-life losses due to vaccine-related adverse events were estimated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A national vaccination program would result in reduction of the number of herpes zoster cases and decreased burden of illness.

33640,China county based COPD screening and cost-effectiveness analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can improve pulmonary function and reduce the incidence of exacerbations of acute COPD, thereby improving the patient's quality of life. In China, due to limited medical resources, COPD patients often cannot be diagnosed and treated early, so the benefits of early screening of patients with COPD high risk still lack effective supporting data. METHODS: Based on the data collected through the ""Dual-lung screening initiative"" performed by the Datan Health Center in Fengning Manchu Autonomous County on July 12 and July 19, 2020, the patients with COPD high risk who underwent early COPD screening were evaluated. The screened patients were mainly smokers aged over 45 and those with long-term exposure to secondhand smoke, underlying lung diseases, a family history of lung diseases, or respiratory symptoms. After filling out the COPD-population screener (COPD-PS) questionnaire, those who had a score of above 5 were subjected to the portable pulmonary function test. Subjects with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio <0.7 were diagnosed with COPD. A cost-effectiveness analysis model was applied to assess the screening's economic efficiency. The model was constructed through a combination of a decision tree and a Markov model, which enabled the simulation of the disease progression of COPD high risk patients under the condition of being screened or not being screened, to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between the two conditions. RESULTS: A total of 700 questionnaires were issued for screening and 379 questionnaires were valid, and 92 patients were diagnosed with COPD (24.27%). The modeling results showed that among patients with COPD high risk, those receiving early screening had an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.28 units over those who did not, and a cost of 6,366.19 Renminbi (RMB) would be needed, which was much lower than the set willingness-to-pay threshold (70,888.99 RMB) [an equivalent of the 2019 per capita gross domestic product (GDP)]. CONCLUSIONS: For COPD high risk patients, receiving early screening has a cost-effective advantage over no screening. Therefore, early screening should be vigorously promoted to COPD high risk patients.",2021-01-42541,33966413,Ann Palliat Med,Minghua Du,2021,10 / 4,4652-4660,No,33966413,"Minghua Du; Hao Hu; Lei Zhang; Wenpeng Liu; Tianbao Chu; Guoxia Wu; Xiaoling Wang; Ling Li; Jing Wang; Lingling Zheng; Shuchen Bai; China county based COPD screening and cost-effectiveness analysis., Ann Palliat Med, 2021 Apr; 10(4):; 4652-4660",QALY,China,Not Stated,Diagnostic,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease population screening questionnaire vs. no screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,previously undiagnosed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Not Stated,45 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"15 Years, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,6366.19,China,2019,976.75
33641,The cost-effectiveness of unilateral cochlear implants in UK adults.,"OBJECTIVE: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its eligibility criteria for unilateral cochlear implants (UCIs) in 2019. NICE claimed this would not impact the cost-effectiveness results used within its 2009 technology appraisal guidance. This claim is uncertain given changed clinical practice and increased healthcare unit costs. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness estimates of UCIs in UK adults with severe to profound hearing loss within the contemporary NHS environment. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis employing a Markov model was undertaken to compare UCIs with hearing aids or no hearing aids for people with severe to profound hearing loss. A clinical pathway was developed to estimate resource use. Health-related quality of life, potential adverse events, device upgrades and device failure were captured. Unit costs were derived mostly from the NHS data. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis further assessed the effect of uncertain model inputs. RESULTS: A UCI is likely to be deemed cost-effective when compared to a hearing aid (£11,946/QALY) or no hearing aid (£10,499/QALY). A UCI has an 93.0% and 98.7% likelihood of being cost-effective within the UK adult population when compared to a hearing aid or no hearing aid, respectively. ICERs were mostly sensitive to the proportion of people eligible for cochlear implant, discount rate, surgery and device costs and processor upgrade cost. CONCLUSION: UCIs remain cost-effective despite changes to clinical practice and increased healthcare unit costs.

33646,The Clinical and Economic Benefit of CMV Matching in Kidney Transplant: A Decision Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The development of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after kidney transplant remains a significant cause of posttransplant morbidity, graft loss, and mortality. Despite appropriate antiviral therapy, recipients without previous CMV exposure can currently be allocated a kidney from a donor with previous CMV infection (D+R-) which carries the greatest risk of posttransplant CMV infection and associated complications. Preferential placement of CMV D- organs in negative recipients (R-) has been shown to reduce the risk of viral infection and associated complications. METHODS: To assess the long-term survival and economic benefits of allocation policy reforms, a decision analytic model was constructed to compare receipt of CMV D- with CMV D+ organ in CMV R- recipients using data from transplant registry, Medicare claims, and pharmaceutical costs. RESULTS: For CMV R- patients, receipt of a CMV D- organ was associated with greater average survival (14.3 vs 12.6 years), superior quality-adjusted life years (12.6 vs 9.8), and lower costs ($529 512 vs $542 963). One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated a survival advantage for patients waiting as long as 30 months for a CMV D- kidney.

33648,The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Self-Efficacy-Focused Structured Education Program for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Mainland China Setting.,"Objective: To assess the long-term (50 years) cost-effectiveness of the self-efficacy-focused structured education program (SSEP) as opposed to routine education among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in mainland China from a healthcare service perspective. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis method was used. The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.0) was adopted to estimate the outcomes. The baseline cohort characteristics, variations of physiological parameters, costs of intervention and other treatments, and management-related diabetes were derived from a randomized controlled trial. Moreover, the complications costs and utilities were extracted from published sources. Furthermore, the univariate sensitivity analysis and the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted. Results: As compared with the control group, the life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-year in the intervention group were increased. Besides, the intervention group achieved lower cumulative incidences of complications and saved more direct medical costs compared with the control group. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the SSEP had 100% probability to be cost-effective. Conclusion: The SSEP is recognized as a highly cost-effective option for managing patients with T2DM, which are projected to both improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs.",2021-01-42557,34957020,Front Public Health,Xinjun Jiang,2021,9 /,767123,No,34957020,"Xinjun Jiang; Hua Jiang; Libo Tao; Mingzi Li; The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Self-Efficacy-Focused Structured Education Program for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Mainland China Setting., Front Public Health, 2021; 9():; 767123",QALY,China,Diabetes mellitus,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",self-efficacy focused structured education program to treat type 2 diabetes vs. routine health education for type 2 diabetes mellitus,type 2 diabetes with non insulin therapy,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,-100188.95,China,2017,-16391.35
33649,Cost-effectiveness Evaluation of the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Lung Cancer Screening.,"IMPORTANCE: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued its 2021 recommendation on lung cancer screening, which lowered the starting age for screening from 55 to 50 years and the minimum cumulative smoking exposure from 30 to 20 pack-years relative to its 2013 recommendation. Although costs are expected to increase because of the expanded screening eligibility criteria, it is unknown whether the new guidelines for lung cancer screening are cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 2021 USPSTF recommendation for lung cancer screening compared with the 2013 recommendation and to explore the cost-effectiveness of 6 alternative screening strategies that maintained a minimum cumulative smoking exposure of 20 pack-years and an ending age for screening of 80 years but varied the starting ages for screening (50 or 55 years) and the number of years since smoking cessation (≤15, ≤20, or ≤25). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A comparative cost-effectiveness analysis using 4 independently developed microsimulation models that shared common inputs to assess the population-level health benefits and costs of the 2021 recommended screening strategy and 6 alternative screening strategies compared with the 2013 recommended screening strategy. The models simulated a 1960 US birth cohort. Simulated individuals entered the study at age 45 years and were followed up until death or age 90 years, corresponding to a study period from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2050. EXPOSURES: Low-dose computed tomography in lung cancer screening programs with a minimum cumulative smoking exposure of 20 pack-years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of the 2021 vs 2013 USPSTF lung cancer screening recommendations as well as 6 alternative screening strategies vs the 2013 USPSTF screening strategy. Strategies with a mean ICER lower than $100 000 per QALY were deemed cost-effective. RESULTS: The 2021 USPSTF recommendation was estimated to be cost-effective compared with the 2013 recommendation, with a mean ICER of $72 564 (range across 4 models, $59 493-$85 837) per QALY gained. The 2021 recommendation was not cost-effective compared with 6 alternative strategies that used the 20 pack-year criterion. Strategies associated with the most cost-effectiveness included those that expanded screening eligibility to include a greater number of former smokers who had not smoked for a longer duration (ie, ≤20 years and ≤25 years since smoking cessation vs ≤15 years since smoking cessation). In particular, the strategy that screened former smokers who quit within the past 25 years and began screening at age 55 years was associated with screening coverage closest to that of the 2021 USPSTF recommendation yet yielded greater cost-effectiveness, with a mean ICER of $66 533 (range across 4 models, $55 693-$80 539). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This economic evaluation found that the 2021 USPSTF recommendation for lung cancer screening was cost-effective; however, alternative screening strategies that maintained a minimum cumulative smoking exposure of 20 pack-years but included individuals who quit smoking within the past 25 years may be more cost-effective and warrant further evaluation.",2021-01-42568,34673885,JAMA Oncol,Iakovos Toumazis,2021,7 / 12,1833-1842,No,34673885,"Iakovos Toumazis; Koen de Nijs; Pianpian Cao; Mehrad Bastani; Vidit Munshi; Kevin Ten Haaf; Jihyoun Jeon; Gazelle, G Scott; Eric Feuer; Harry de Koning; Rafael Meza; Kong, Chung Yin; Summer Han; Sylvia Plevritis; Cost-effectiveness Evaluation of the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Lung Cancer Screening., JAMA Oncol, 2021 Dec 1; 7(12):; 1833-1842",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,age 50-80 + ≥30 pack-years + ≤15 y since smoking cessation lung cancer screening vs. age 55-80 + ≥30 pack-years + ≤15 y since smoking cessation lung cancer screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,71205,United States,2020,74550.23

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of the 2021 vs 2013 USPSTF lung cancer screening recommendations as well as 6 alternative screening strategies vs the 2013 USPSTF screening strategy. Strategies with a mean ICER lower than $100 000 per QALY were deemed cost-effective. RESULTS: The 2021 USPSTF recommendation was estimated to be cost-effective compared with the 2013 recommendation, with a mean ICER of $72 564 (range across 4 models, $59 493-$85 837) per QALY gained. The 2021 recommendation was not cost-effective compared with 6 alternative strategies that used the 20 pack-year criterion. Strategies associated with the most cost-effectiveness included those that expanded screening eligibility to include a greater number of former smokers who had not smoked for a longer duration (ie, ≤20 years and ≤25 years since smoking cessation vs ≤15 years since smoking cessation). In particular, the strategy that screened former smokers who quit within the past 25 years and began screening at age 55 years was associated with screening coverage closest to that of the 2021 USPSTF recommendation yet yielded greater cost-effectiveness, with a mean ICER of $66 533 (range across 4 models, $55 693-$80 539). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This economic evaluation found that the 2021 USPSTF recommendation for lung cancer screening was cost-effective; however, alternative screening strategies that maintained a minimum cumulative smoking exposure of 20 pack-years but included individuals who quit smoking within the past 25 years may be more cost-effective and warrant further evaluation.",2021-01-42568,34673885,JAMA Oncol,Iakovos Toumazis,2021,7 / 12,1833-1842,No,34673885,"Iakovos Toumazis; Koen de Nijs; Pianpian Cao; Mehrad Bastani; Vidit Munshi; Kevin Ten Haaf; Jihyoun Jeon; Gazelle, G Scott; Eric Feuer; Harry de Koning; Rafael Meza; Kong, Chung Yin; Summer Han; Sylvia Plevritis; Cost-effectiveness Evaluation of the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Lung Cancer Screening., JAMA Oncol, 2021 Dec 1; 7(12):; 1833-1842",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,age 50-80 + ≥20 pack-years + ≤25 y since smoking cessation lung cancer screening vs. age 55-80 + ≥30 pack-years + ≤15 y since smoking cessation lung cancer screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,73952,United States,2020,77426.28
33656,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Direct Oral Anticoagulants Vs. Vitamin K Antagonists in the Elderly With Atrial Fibrillation: Insights From the Evidence in a Real-World Setting.,"Background: In the clinical setting, the economic benefits of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; warfarin) in preventing stroke among AF patients aged >75 years in real-world practice. Methods: A Markov model with a 10-year span was constructed to estimate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes among AF patients aged >75 years treated with DOACs and warfarin. The study was populated with a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 AF patients aged >75 years. Probabilities of clinical outcomes were obtained from the pooled observational studies (OSs), comparing DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) with VKAs. Other model inputs, including the utilities and the costs, were all estimated from public sources and the published literature. The costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QAYLs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated for each treatment strategy. Subgroup analyses of individual DOACs and the scenario analysis were performed. Uncertainty was evaluated by deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Results: Compared to warfarin, DOACs were associated with a gain of 0.36 QALY at an additional cost of $15,234.65, resulting in an ICER of $42,318.47 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the ICER was sensitive to the cost of DOACs. Direct oral anticoagulants also shifted from dominating to dominated status When their annual costs of DOACs were over $3,802.84 or the risk ratio of death compared to warfarin was over 1.077%/year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) suggested that DOACs had a 53.83 and 90.7% probability of being cost-effective when the willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $50,000 and $100,000, respectively. Among all the four individual DOACs, edoxaban treatment was revealed as the preferred treatment strategy for the AF patients aged over 75 years by yielding the most significant health gain with the relatively low total cost. Conclusions: Despite the high risk for major bleeding in elderly patients with AF, DOACs are more cost-effective treatment options than warfarin in real-world practice.

33661,Cost-utility analysis of ceftazidime-avibactam versus colistin-meropenem in the treatment of infections due to Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Colombia.,"Background: Ceftazidime-Avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a new antimicrobial against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The aim of the study is to examine the cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI compared to colistin-meropenem (COL+MEM) in Colombia. Methods: A decision tree model was developed from health-care system perspective assuming a 30-day time horizon. The clinical course was simulated based on treatment response between 48 and 72 hours, and the duration of the treatment was 7-14 days. Cost inputs were extracted from a published Colombian manual tariffs and official databases, expressed in 2019 dollars (USD). Results: In the base case analysis, CAZ-AVI was associated with reduced mortality, length of hospital stay and fewer add-on antibiotics, resulting in an increase of 1.76 QALYs per patient versus COL+MEM and incremental costs associated in CAZ-AVI were $2,521 higher per patient compared to COL+MEM ($755 versus $3,276). The incremental costs were partially increased due to the lower mortality rate observed with CAZ-AVI. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be $3,317 per QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, with a willingness to pay above $2,438, CAZ-AVI has higher probability of being cost-effective. Conclusion: CAZ-AVI demonstrates cost-effectiveness as a treatment for Carbapenem-resistant Klepsiella pneumoniae infections by reducing the number of deaths and increasing QALYs.

33662,Swiss cost-effectiveness analysis of universal screening for Lynch syndrome of patients with colorectal cancer followed by cascade genetic testing of relatives.,"BACKGROUND: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of universal DNA screening for Lynch syndrome (LS) among newly diagnosed patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) followed by cascade screening of relatives from the Swiss healthcare system perspective. METHODS: We integrated decision trees with Markov models to calculate incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved by screening all patients with CRC (alternative strategy) compared with CRC tumour-based testing followed by DNA sequencing (current strategy). RESULTS: The alternative strategy has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF65 058 compared with the current strategy, which is cost-effective according to Swiss standards. Based on annual incidence of CRC in Switzerland, universal DNA screening correctly identifies all 123 patients with CRC with LS, prevents 17 LS deaths and avoids 19 CRC cases, while the current strategy leads to 32 false negative results and 253 LS cases lost to follow-up. One way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that universal DNA testing is cost-effective in around 80% of scenarios, and that the cost of DNA testing and the number of invited relatives per LS case determine the cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: Results can inform policymakers, healthcare providers and insurance companies about the costs and benefits associated with universal screening for LS and cascade genetic testing of relatives.",2021-01-42530,34782441,J Med Genet,Islam Salikhanov,2021,/,,No,34782441,"Islam Salikhanov; Karl Heinimann; Pierre Chappuis; Nicole Buerki; Rossella Graffeo; Viola Heinzelmann; Manuela Rabaglio; Monica Taborelli; Simon Wieser; Maria Katapodi; Swiss cost-effectiveness analysis of universal screening for Lynch syndrome of patients with colorectal cancer followed by cascade genetic testing of relatives., J Med Genet, 2021 Nov 15; ():",QALY,Switzerland,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Diagnostic,universal DNA screening for Lynch syndrome vs. preliminary tumor testing with immunohistochemistry,newly diagnosed colorectal cancer,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"50 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,65058,Switzerland,2020,63953.79
33663,Health Economic Assessment of Optimal Biological Treatment for Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited guidance on which biologic therapies should be prioritised for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, amongst the many available options. New mode-of-action biologics, as well as recently available biosimilars for existing biologics, continue to be developed making the choice of treatment sequence increasingly complex. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to develop a cost-effectiveness model to determine the optimal placement of biologic therapies on the treatment pathway for psoriasis in the UK. METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed in Microsoft Excel, from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal and Social Services in the UK. The model followed a hypothetical cohort of patients over a lifetime. The health states in the model were defined by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response. In the model, patients could receive a total of four separate treatments, including three active interventions and best supportive care. RESULTS: A fully incremental analysis was undertaken on a subset of commonly used treatment sequences. The results of the list price analyses determined the most cost-effective sequence to be adalimumab biosimilar followed by ustekinumab, secukinumab, then best supportive care. This sequence is associated with total costs of £78,731 and total quality-adjusted life-years of 14.74 over a patient's lifetime.

33666,Health Economic Assessment of Optimal Biological Treatment for Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited guidance on which biologic therapies should be prioritised for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, amongst the many available options. New mode-of-action biologics, as well as recently available biosimilars for existing biologics, continue to be developed making the choice of treatment sequence increasingly complex. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to develop a cost-effectiveness model to determine the optimal placement of biologic therapies on the treatment pathway for psoriasis in the UK. METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed in Microsoft Excel, from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal and Social Services in the UK. The model followed a hypothetical cohort of patients over a lifetime. The health states in the model were defined by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response. In the model, patients could receive a total of four separate treatments, including three active interventions and best supportive care. RESULTS: A fully incremental analysis was undertaken on a subset of commonly used treatment sequences. The results of the list price analyses determined the most cost-effective sequence to be adalimumab biosimilar followed by ustekinumab, secukinumab, then best supportive care.

A Markov decision-analytic model using a 20-year time horizon was used to compare allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT), autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and chemo-immunotherapy (O-CHOP). For second relapse/refractory disease, novel therapy use was modeled, including lenalidomide and rituximab/obinutuzumab, and PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki). Costs were considered from a Canadian public health payer's perspective. Probabilistic analyses (10,000 simulations) demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, ASCT was most cost effective 60% of the time. ASCT resulted in more life years (10.2 vs. alloSCT 9.9 vs. O-CHOP 10.0) and quality-adjusted life years (7.5 vs. alloSCT 6.6 vs. O-CHOP 7.4), with the lowest direct costs ($190,128 CAD).

Cost-effectiveness of umeclidinium/vilanterol versus umeclidinium and salmeterol from a UK healthcare perspective in patients without exacerbations in the previous year was assessed using post hoc EMAX trial data. METHODS: The validated GALAXY model was populated with baseline characteristics and treatment effects from the non-exacerbating subgroup of the symptomatic EMAX population (COPD assessment test score ≥10) and 2020 UK healthcare and drug costs. Outputs included estimated exacerbation rates, costs, life-years (LYs), and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs); incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as incremental cost/QALY gained. The base case (probabilistic model) used a 10-year time horizon, assumed no treatment discontinuation, and discounted future costs and QALYs by 3.5% annually. Sensitivity and scenario analyses assessed robustness of model results. RESULTS: Umeclidinium/vilanterol treatment was dominant versus umeclidinium and salmeterol, providing an additional 0.090 LYs (95% range: 0.035, 0.158) and 0.055 QALYs (-0.059, 0.168) with total cost savings of £690 (£231, £1306) versus umeclidinium, and 0.174 LYs (0.076, 0.286) and 0.204 QALYs (0.079, 0.326) with savings of £1336 (£1006, £2032) versus salmeterol. In scenario and sensitivity analyses, umeclidinium/vilanterol was dominant versus umeclidinium except over a 5-year time horizon (more QALYs at higher total cost; ICER=£4/QALY gained) and at the lowest estimate of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire treatment effect (fewer QALYs at lower total cost; ICER=£12,284/QALY gained); umeclidinium/vilanterol was consistently dominant versus salmeterol.

33677,Cost utility of fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring for the management of children asthma.,"INTRODUCTION: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide is a simple, non-invasive measurement of airway inflammation with minimal discomfort to the patient and with results available within a few minutes. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of asthma management using fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring in patients between 4 and 18 years of age. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost-utility of asthma management using fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring versus asthma management without using fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring (standard therapy) in patients between 4 and 18 years of age. Cost data were obtained from a retrospective study on asthma from a tertiary center, in Medellin, Colombia, while probabilities of the Markov model and utilities were obtained from the systematic review of published randomized clinical trials. The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The model showed that fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring was associated with a lower total cost than standard therapy (US $1333 vs. US $1452 average cost per patient) and higher QALYs (0.93 vs. 0.92 average per patient). The probability that fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring provides a more cost-effective use of resources compared with standard therapy exceeds 99% for all willingness-to-pay thresholds. CONCLUSION: Asthma management using fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring was cost-effective for treating patients between 4 and 18 years of age with mild to moderate allergic asthma.

33678,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Dienogest Compared With Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist After Conservative Surgery for Endometriosis in China.,"PURPOSE: Although the clinical effect of dienogest for endometriosis after conservative surgery has been proven, the cost-effectiveness of this new pharmacotherapy remains to be determined. We aimed to assess the health economic implications of dienogest versus a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a; goserelin in the Chinese setting. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dienogest compared with a GnRH-a (goserelin) after conservative surgery for endometriosis during a 2-year time horizon from the perspective of a health care system in China. The cost of drugs, use of outpatient care facilities, administration of medications, routine laboratory work and imaging studies, and treatment of drug-related adverse events were considered. We obtained clinical efficacy data from the peer-reviewed literature. Base case findings were further tested with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: The model projects that treatment with dienogest would result in a modest incremental 0.02 quality-adjusted life-year gains compared with a GnRH-a (goserelin) (1.48 vs 1.46) at a cost saving of ¥7274 (¥22,809 vs ¥30,164). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that dienogest has a 100% probability of % being considered cost-effective compared with a GnRH-a (goserelin) at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times the gross domestic product per capita (¥64,644 × 3) of China in 2018 (¥1 = US$0.1454 and €0.1248).

33679,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab for Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,"Objective: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. chemotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the US payer perspective. Materials and methods: A Markov model wasdeveloped to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. The survival benefits of nivolumab plus ipilimumab were based on the results of the CheckMate 227 trial. The main endpoints of the model were cost, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model uncertainty. Additonal subgroup analyses were also performed. Results: nivolumab plus ipilimumab produced a gain of 0.62 QALYs, at a cost of $104238 per QALY. The variables that had the greatest influence on the ICER were body weight and overall survival (OS) hazard ratio (HR). The probability of nivolumab plus ipilimumab being cost-effectiveness compared to chemotherapy is 50.7 and 66.2% when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) value is $ 100,000 and $ 150,000 per QALY. The results of subgroup analyses showed the ICER remained below $150,000/QALY regardless of the PD-L1 expression level.

33680,Economic evaluation of isavuconazole for suspected invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in Canada.,"BACKGROUND: Invasive mold infections (IMI) directly impact life expectancy, especially with delayed therapy. Among IMI, aspergillosis (IA) is more common than mucormycosis (IM), resulting in IA-targeted empirical treatment with voriconazole for suspected invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), despite IM ineffectiveness. Recently, isavuconazole was approved in Canada for IA and IM. The primary objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole compared to voriconazole for suspected IPA in Canada. A secondary objective was to assess the impact of varying time horizons to address the wide spectrum of life expectancies, according to patients underlying diseases.

33681,Economic evaluation of isavuconazole for suspected invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in Canada.,"BACKGROUND: Invasive mold infections (IMI) directly impact life expectancy, especially with delayed therapy. Among IMI, aspergillosis (IA) is more common than mucormycosis (IM), resulting in IA-targeted empirical treatment with voriconazole for suspected invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), despite IM ineffectiveness. Recently, isavuconazole was approved in Canada for IA and IM. The primary objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole compared to voriconazole for suspected IPA in Canada. A secondary objective was to assess the impact of varying time horizons to address the wide spectrum of life expectancies, according to patients underlying diseases.

33682,Cost-Effectiveness of Advanced Neuroimaging for Transient and Minor Neurological Events in the Emergency Department.,"Background Accurate diagnosis of patients with transient or minor neurological events can be challenging. Recent studies suggest that advanced neuroimaging can improve diagnostic accuracy in low-risk patients with transient or minor neurological symptoms, but a cost-effective emergency department diagnostic evaluation strategy remains uncertain. Methods and Results We constructed a decision-analytic model to evaluate 2 diagnostic evaluation strategies for patients with low-risk transient or minor neurological symptoms: (1) obtain advanced neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging brain and magnetic resonance angiography head and neck) on every patient or (2) current emergency department standard-of-care clinical evaluation with basic neuroimaging. Main probability variables were: proportion of patients with true ischemic events, strategy specificity and sensitivity, and recurrent stroke rate. Direct healthcare costs were included. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, conducted sensitivity analyses, and evaluated various diagnostic test parameters primarily using a 1-year time horizon. Cost-effectiveness standards would be met if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than willingness to pay. We defined willingness to pay as $100 000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year. Our primary and sensitivity analyses found that the advanced neuroimaging strategy was more cost-effective than emergency department standard of care. The incremental effectiveness of the advanced neuroimaging strategy was slightly less than the standard-of-care strategy, but the standard-of-care strategy was more costly. Potentially superior diagnostic approaches to the modeled advanced neuroimaging strategy would have to be >92% specific, >70% sensitive, and cost less than or equal to standard-of-care strategy's cost. Conclusions Obtaining advanced neuroimaging on emergency department patient with low-risk transient or minor neurological symptoms was the more cost-effective strategy in our model.",2021-01-42602,34056914,J Am Heart Assoc,Ava Liberman,2021,10 / 12,e019001,No,34056914,"Ava Liberman; Hui Zhang; Sara Rostanski; Natalie Cheng; Charles Esenwa; Neil Haranhalli; Puneet Singh; Daniel Labovitz; Richard Lipton; Shyam Prabhakaran; Cost-Effectiveness of Advanced Neuroimaging for Transient and Minor Neurological Events in the Emergency Department., J Am Heart Assoc, 2021 Jun 15; 10(12):; e019001",QALY,United States of America,Other disorders of the nervous system,Diagnostic,advanced neuroimaging vs. emergency department standard-of- care basic neuroimaging,presenting to a hospital’s ED with presumed low-risk transient or minor neurological symptoms,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"1 Year, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,5506722,United States,2019,5836556.25
33683,"Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a community-based smoke-free-home intervention with or without indoor-air-quality feedback in Bangladesh (MCLASS II): a three-arm, cluster-randomised, controlled trial.","Background: Exposure to second-hand smoke from tobacco is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a community-based smoke-free-home intervention, with or without indoor-air-quality feedback, in reducing second-hand-smoke exposure in homes in Bangladesh. Methods: We did a three-arm, cluster-randomised, controlled trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and randomly assigned (1:1:1) mosques and consenting households from their congregations to a smoke-free-home intervention plus indoor-air-quality feedback, smoke-free-home intervention only, or usual services. Households were eligible if they had at least one resident attending one of the participating mosques, at least one adult resident (age 18 years or older) who smoked cigarettes or other forms of smoked tobacco (eg, bidi, waterpipe) regularly (on at least 25 days per month), and at least one non-smoking resident of any age. The smoke-free-home intervention consisted of weekly health messages delivered within an Islamic discourse by religious leaders at mosques over 12 weeks. Indoor-air-quality feedback comprised providing households with feedback on their indoor air quality measured over 24 h. Households in the usual services group received no intervention. Masking of participants and mosque leaders was not possible. The primary outcome was the 24-h mean household airborne fine particulate matter (<2·5 microns in diameter [PM2·5]) concentration (a marker of second-hand smoke) at 12 months after randomisation. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). This trial is registered with ISRCTN, 49975452. Findings: Between April 11 and Aug 2, 2018, we enrolled 1801 households from 45 mosques. 640 households (35·5%) were assigned to the smoke-free-home intervention plus indoor-air-quality feedback group, 560 (31·1%) to the smoke-free-home intervention only group, and 601 (33·4%) to the usual services group. At 12 months, the adjusted mean difference in household mean 24-h PM2·5 concentration was -1·0 μg/m3 (95% CI -12·8 to 10·9, p=0·88) for the smoke-free-home intervention plus indoor-air-quality feedback group versus the usual services group, 5·0 μg/m3 (-7·9 to 18·0, p=0·45) for the smoke-free-home intervention only group versus the usual services group, and -6·0 μg/m3 (-18·3 to 6·3, p=0·34) for the smoke-free-home intervention plus indoor-air-quality feedback group versus the smoke-free-home intervention only group. The ICER for the smoke-free-home intervention plus indoor-air-quality feedback versus usual services was US$653 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, which was more than the upper limit of the Bangladesh willingness-to-pay threshold of $427 per QALY.

33685,A Microsimulation Model to Determine the Cost-Effectiveness of Treat-to-Target Strategies for Crohn's Disease.,"Introduction: Cost-effectiveness of biomarker- vs endoscopy-based treat-to-target monitoring in Crohn's disease (CD) is unknown. Methods: A microsimulation model for CD was built to simulate biomarker (fecal calprotectin) vs endoscopy-based monitoring in a treat-to-target fashion. Published literature in combination with patient-level data from phase 3 clinical trials and population estimates for therapeutic drug monitoring were used to generate transition probabilities, costs, and utilities. Tracker variables were used to modify downstream probabilities and outcomes based on previous exposures, response patterns, and disease-related complications or surgery history. The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness over a 5-year horizon at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses in addition to multiple 1-, 2-, and 3-way microsimulation sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: In the base-case model, the endoscopy-based monitoring strategy dominated the biomarker-based monitoring strategy over a 5-year horizon. Over shorter periods of observation, the biomarker-based monitoring strategy became progressively more cost-effective, with cost-effectiveness achieved for this strategy over a 1-year horizon. Therapeutic drug monitoring did not influence short-term cost-effectiveness of biomarker-based monitoring. Once in endoscopic remission, continued biomarker-based vs endoscopy-based monitoring was more cost-effective. A hybrid biomarker-endoscopy-based monitoring strategy dominated the endoscopy-based monitoring strategy over a 5-year horizon. The strongest determinants for cost-effectiveness were cost of colonoscopy and diagnostic performance of fecal calprotectin.

METHODS: A decision-analytical study using Markov modeling was performed to compare 5 commonly used multistep follow-up strategies with different combinations of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): 1) DSA at 6 months and MRA at 12 and 24 months; 2) DSA at 6, 12, and 24 months; 3) MRA at 6, 12, and 24 months; 4) DSA at 6 and 12 months and MRA at 24 months; and 5) DSA at 12 months and MRA at 24 months. The input parameters were mainly collected from the latest meta-analysis, and 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of our model. RESULTS: Strategy 5, incorporating DSA at 12 months and MRA at 24 months, was the most cost-effective strategy for >99% of the 10,000 iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. The result remained robust in the 1- and 2-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current data, delayed imaging follow-up at 1 year with DSA and 2 years with MRA after PED treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms is more cost-effective than early follow-up at 6 months.",2021-01-42609,34757210,World Neurosurg,Mohamed Salem,2021,/,,No,34757210,"Mohamed Salem; Mira Salih; Felix Nwajei; Santiago Gomez-Paz; Ajith Thomas; Christopher Ogilvy; Justin Moore; Cost-Effectiveness Analytic Comparison of Neuroimaging Follow-Up Strategies After Pipeline Embolization Device Treatment of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms., World Neurosurg, 2021 Oct 29; ():",QALY,United States of America,Cerebrovascular diseases,Diagnostic,digital subtraction angiography at 12 months vs. do nothing,theoretical patients with an unruptured aneurysm who had undergone preventive pipeline embolization device treatment,Not Stated,50 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,5249.48,United States,2019,5563.91
33692,Cost-effectiveness of early placement of vena cava filters to prevent symptomatic pulmonary embolism in patients with contraindications to prophylactic anticoagulant.,"INTRODUCTION: Vena cava filters have been used as a primary means to prevent symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) in trauma patients who cannot be anticoagulated after severe injury, but the economic implications for this practice remain unclear. METHODS: Using a healthcare system perspective to analyze the a priori primary outcome of the da Vinci trial, we report the cost-effectiveness of using vena cava filters as a primary means to prevent PE in patients who have contraindications to prophylactic anticoagulation after major trauma. RESULTS: Of the 240 patients enrolled, complete, prospectively collected, hospital cost data during the entire hospital stay - including costs for the filter, medical/nursing/allied health staff, medical supplies, pathology tests, and radiological imaging - were available in 223 patients (93%). Patients allocated to the filter group (n = 114) were associated with a reduced risk of PE (0.9%) compared to those in the control group (n = 109, 5.5%; p = 0.048); and the filter's benefit was more pronounced among those who could not be anticoagulated within 7 days (filter: 0% vs control: 16%, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.02). Overall, the cost needed to prevent one PE was high (AUD $379,760), but among those who could not be anticoagulated within 7 days, the costs to prevent one PE (AUD $36,156; ~ USD $26,032) and gain one quality-adjusted life-year (AUD $30,903; ~ USD $22,250) were substantially lower. CONCLUSION: The cost of using a vena cava filter to prevent PE for those who have contraindications to prophylactic anticoagulation within 3 days of injury is prohibitive, unless such contraindications remain for longer than 7 days.

33696,Cost-Effectiveness of MR-Mammography in Breast Cancer Screening of Women With Extremely Dense Breasts After Two Rounds of Screening.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MR-mammography (MRM) vs. x-ray based mammography (XM) in two-yearly screening women of intermediate risk for breast cancer in the light of recent literature. METHODS: Decision analysis and Markov modelling were used to compare cumulative costs (in US-$) and outcomes (in QALYs) of MRM vs. XM over the model runtime of 20 years. The perspective of the U.S. healthcare system was selected. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated and related to a willingness to pay-threshold of $ 100,000 per QALY in order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of variations of the input parameters. In particular, variations of the rate of false positive findings beyond the first screening round and their impact on cost-effectiveness were assessed. RESULTS: Breast cancer screening with MRM resulted in increased costs and superior effectiveness. Cumulative average costs of $ 6,081 per woman and cumulative effects of 15.12 QALYs were determined for MRM, whereas screening with XM resulted in costs of $ 5,810 and 15.10 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $ 13,493 per QALY gained. When the specificity of MRM in the second and subsequent screening rounds was varied from 92% to 99%, the ICER resulted in a range from $ 38,849 to $ 5,062 per QALY.

33697,Clinical and economic impact of universal varicella vaccination in Norway: A modeling study.,"BACKGROUND: Norway has not implemented universal varicella vaccination, despite the considerable clinical and economic burden of varicella disease. METHODS: An existing dynamic transmission model of varicella infection was calibrated to age-specific seroprevalence rates in Norway. Six two-dose vaccination strategies were considered, consisting of combinations of two formulations each of a monovalent varicella vaccine (Varivax® or Varilrix®) and a quadrivalent vaccine against measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (ProQuad® or PriorixTetra®), with the first dose given with a monovalent vaccine at age 15 months, and the second dose with either a monovalent or quadrivalent vaccine at either 18 months, 7 or 11 years. Costs were considered from the perspectives of both the health care system and society. Quality-adjusted life-years saved and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios relative to no vaccination were calculated. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of vaccine efficacy, price, the costs of a lost workday and of inpatient and outpatient care, vaccination coverage, and discount rate. RESULTS: In the absence of varicella vaccination, the annual incidence of natural varicella is estimated to be 1,359 per 100,000 population, and the cumulative numbers of varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over 50 years are projected to be 1.81 million, 10,161, and 61, respectively. Universal varicella vaccination is projected to reduce the natural varicella incidence rate to 48-59 per 100,000 population, depending on the vaccination strategy, and to reduce varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by 75-85%, 67-79%, and 75-79%, respectively. All strategies were cost-saving, with the most cost-saving as two doses of Varivax® at 15 months and 7 years (payer perspective) and two doses of Varivax® at 15 months and 18 months (societal perspective).
