9601,Cost-effectiveness of universal and risk-based screening for autoimmune thyroid disease in pregnant women,"Hypothyroidism in pregnancy can lead to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Although screening of high-risk women is advocated, universal screening remains controversial.The objective of the study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of universal screening of pregnant women for autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) with screening only high-risk women and with no screening.A decision-analytic model compared the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained among the following: 1) universal screening, 2) high-risk screening, and 3) no screening. Screening consisted of a first-trimester thyroid-stimulating hormone level and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Women with abnormal results underwent further testing and, when indicated, levothyroxine therapy. Randomized controlled trials provided probabilities for adverse obstetrical outcomes. The model accounted for the development of postpartum thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism. Additional scenarios in which therapy prevented cases of decreased child intelligence quotient were explored.Medical consequences of AITD in pregnancy, QALY, and costs were measured.Risk-based screening and universal screening were both cost-effective relative to no screening, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $6,753/QALY and $7,138/QALY, respectively. Universal screening was cost-effective compared with risk-based screening, with an ICER of $7,258/QALY. Screening remained cost-effective in various clinical scenarios, including when only overt hypothyroidism was assumed to have adverse obstetrical outcomes. Universal screening was cost-saving in the scenario of untreated maternal hypothyroidism resulting in decreased child intelligence, with levothyroxine therapy being preventive.Universal screening of pregnant women in the first trimester for AITD is cost-effective, not only compared with no screening but also compared with screening of high-risk women.",2012-01-08823,22399510,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,Chrysoula Dosiou,2012,97 / 5,1536-46,No,22399510,"Chrysoula Dosiou; James Barnes; Alan Schwartz; Roberto Negro; Lawrence Crapo; Alex Stagnaro-Green; Cost-effectiveness of universal and risk-based screening for autoimmune thyroid disease in pregnant women, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, ; 97(5):0021-972X; 1536-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal screening for autoimmune thyroid disease vs. Risk-based screening for autoimmune thyroid disease,Not Stated,25 Years,25 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7258,United States,2009,8755.83

9605,Cost-effectiveness analysis of varenicline versus existing smoking cessation strategies in Central America and the Caribbean using the BENESCO model,"In Central American countries, the economic burden of tobacco has not been assessed. In Costa Rica, a study demonstrated that tobacco-related diseases represent high costs for the health care system. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of varenicline compared with other existing strategies for smoking cessation within a 10-year time horizon in an adult population cohort from Central American and Caribbean countries using the health care payer's perspective.The Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes simulation model was used for an adult cohort in Costa Rica (n = 2 474 029), Panama (n = 2 249 676), Nicaragua (n = 3 639 948), El Salvador (n = 4 537 803), and the Dominican Republic (n = 6 528 125) (N = 19 429 581). Smoking cessation therapies compared were varenicline (0.5-2 mg/day) versus bupropion (300 mg/day), nicotine replacement therapy (5-15 mg/day), and unaided cessation. Effectiveness measures were: life-years (LYs) gained and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Resource use and cost data were obtained from a country's Ministry of Health and/or Social Security Institutions (2008-2010). The model used a 5% discount rate for costs (expressed in 2010 US$) and health outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted and acceptability curves were constructed.Varenicline reduced smoking-related morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in each country included in the study. Accumulatively, mortality in the varenicline arm was reduced by 1190, 1538, and 2902 smoking-related deaths compared with bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy, and unaided cessation, respectively. The net average cost per additional quitter showed that varenicline was cost-saving when compared with competing alternatives. Regarding LYs and QALYs gained in 10 years, varenicline obtained the greatest number of QALYs and LYs in each country, while unaided cessation obtained the fewest. Cost-effectiveness analyses in all 5 countries showed that varenicline was the dominant strategy. Acceptability curves showed that, independent of the willingness to pay, the probability that varenicline is cost-effective was 99% for this region. The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the findings.Smoking cessation therapy with varenicline is cost-saving for the Central American and Caribbean countries included.

9620,Cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with solid tumors and bone metastases in the United States,"Abstract Objective: With increasing healthcare resource constraints, it has become important to understand the incremental cost-effectiveness of new medicines. Subcutaneous denosumab is superior to intravenous zoledronic acid (ZA) for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with advanced solid tumors and bone metastases. This study sought to determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs ZA in this setting, from a US managed-care perspective. Methods: A lifetime Markov model was developed, with relative rate reductions in SREs for denosumab vs ZA derived from three pivotal Phase 3 trials involving patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), breast cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and bone metastases. The real-world SRE rates in ZA-treated patients were derived from a large commercial database. SRE and treatment administration quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements were estimated with time-trade-off studies. SRE costs were estimated from a nationally representative commercial claims database. Drug, drug administration, and renal monitoring costs were included. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with a reduced number of SREs, increased QALYs, and increased lifetime total costs vs ZA. The costs per QALY gained for denosumab vs ZA in CRPC, breast cancer, and NSCLC were $49,405, $78,915, and $67,931, respectively, commonly considered good value in the US. Costs per SRE avoided were $8567, $13,557, and $10,513, respectively. Results were sensitive to drug costs and SRE rates. Limitations: Differences in pain severity and analgesic use favoring denosumab over ZA were not captured. Mortality was extrapolated from fitted generalized gamma function beyond the trial duration.

9621,Cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with solid tumors and bone metastases in the United States,"Abstract Objective: With increasing healthcare resource constraints, it has become important to understand the incremental cost-effectiveness of new medicines. Subcutaneous denosumab is superior to intravenous zoledronic acid (ZA) for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with advanced solid tumors and bone metastases. This study sought to determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs ZA in this setting, from a US managed-care perspective. Methods: A lifetime Markov model was developed, with relative rate reductions in SREs for denosumab vs ZA derived from three pivotal Phase 3 trials involving patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), breast cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and bone metastases. The real-world SRE rates in ZA-treated patients were derived from a large commercial database. SRE and treatment administration quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements were estimated with time-trade-off studies. SRE costs were estimated from a nationally representative commercial claims database. Drug, drug administration, and renal monitoring costs were included. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with a reduced number of SREs, increased QALYs, and increased lifetime total costs vs ZA. The costs per QALY gained for denosumab vs ZA in CRPC, breast cancer, and NSCLC were $49,405, $78,915, and $67,931, respectively, commonly considered good value in the US. Costs per SRE avoided were $8567, $13,557, and $10,513, respectively. Results were sensitive to drug costs and SRE rates. Limitations: Differences in pain severity and analgesic use favoring denosumab over ZA were not captured. Mortality was extrapolated from fitted generalized gamma function beyond the trial duration.

9623,Cost-effectiveness of diacetylmorphine versus methadone for chronic opioid dependence refractory to treatment,"Although diacetylmorphine has been proven to be more effective than methadone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence, its direct costs are higher. We compared the cost-effectiveness of diacetylmorphine and methadone maintenance treatment for chronic opioid dependence refractory to treatment.We constructed a semi-Markov cohort model using data from the North American Opiate Medication Initiative trial, supplemented with administrative data for the province of British Columbia and other published data, to capture the chronic, recurrent nature of opioid dependence. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to compare diacetylmorphine and methadone over 1-, 5-, 10-year and lifetime horizons.Diacetylmorphine was found to be a dominant strategy over methadone maintenance treatment in each of the time horizons. Over a lifetime horizon, our model showed that people receiving methadone gained 7.46 discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) on average (95% credibility interval [CI] 6.91-8.01) and generated a societal cost of $1.14 million (95% CI $736,800-$1.78 million). Those who received diacetylmorphine gained 7.92 discounted QALYs on average (95% CI 7.32-8.53) and generated a societal cost of $1.10 million (95% CI $724,100-$1.71 million). Cost savings in the diacetylmorphine cohort were realized primarily because of reductions in the costs related to criminal activity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of diacetylmorphine being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $0 per QALY gained was 76%; the probability was 95% at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. Results were confirmed over a range of sensitivity analyses.Using mathematical modelling to extrapolate results from the North American Opiate Medication Initiative, we found that diacetylmorphine may be more effective and less costly than methadone among people with chronic opioid dependence refractory to treatment.",2012-01-08838,22410375,CMAJ,Bohdan Nosyk,2012,184 /,E317-28,No,22410375,"Bohdan Nosyk; Daphne P Guh; Nicholas J Bansback; Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes; Suzanne Brissette; David C Marsh; Evan Meikleham; Martin T Schechter; Aslam H Anis; Cost-effectiveness of diacetylmorphine versus methadone for chronic opioid dependence refractory to treatment, CMAJ, ; 184 ():1488-2329; E317-28",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diacetylmorphine vs. Methadone,Not Stated,Not Stated,25 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-902173.88,Canada,2009,-958124.92
9624,Cost-effectiveness and population outcomes of general population screening for hepatitis C,"Current US guidelines recommend limiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening to high-risk individuals, and 50%-75% of infected persons remain unaware of their status.To estimate the cost-effectiveness and population-level impact of adding one-time HCV screening of US population aged 20-69 years to current guidelines, we developed a decision analytic model for the screening intervention and Markov model with annual transitions to estimate natural history. Subanalyses included protease inhibitor therapy and screening those at highest risk of infection (birth year 1945-1965). We relied on published literature and took a lifetime, societal perspective.Compared to current guidelines, incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained (ICER) was $7900 for general population screening and $4200 for screening by birth year, which dominated general population screening if cost, clinician uptake, and median age of diagnoses were assumed equivalent. General population screening remained cost-effective in all one-way sensitivity analyses, 30 000 Monte Carlo simulations, and scenarios in which background mortality was doubled, all genotype 1 patients were treated with protease inhibitors, and most parameters were set unfavorable to increased screening. ICER was lowest if screening was applied to a population with liver fibrosis similar to 2010 estimates. Approximately 1% of liver-related deaths would be averted per 15% of the general population screened; the impact would be greater with improved referral, treatment uptake, and cure.Broader screening for HCV would likely be cost-effective, but significantly reducing HCV-related morbidity and mortality would also require improved rates of referral, treatment, and cure.",2012-01-08841,22412061,Clin Infect Dis,Phillip O Coffin,2012,54 / 9,1259-71,No,22412061,"Phillip O Coffin; John D Scott; Matthew R Golden; Sean D Sullivan; Cost-effectiveness and population outcomes of general population screening for hepatitis C, Clin Infect Dis, ; 54(9):1537-6591; 1259-71",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adding one-time hepatitis C virus screening to current guidelines in population aged 20-69 years vs. Current US guidelines for screening high-risk individuals,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7900,United States,2010,9376.52

The health and economic outcomes of five first-line strategies (interferon-alfa, interleukin-2, interleukin-2 plus interferon-alfa, sunitinib and bevacizumab plus interferon-alfa) were estimated and assessed by indirect comparison. The clinical and utility data were taken from published studies. The cost data were estimated from local charge data and current Chinese practices. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty regarding the results. The impact of the sunitinib patient assistant program (SPAP) was evaluated via scenario analysis. The base-case analysis showed that the sunitinib strategy yielded the maximum health benefits: 2.71 life years and 1.40 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). The marginal cost-effectiveness (cost per additional QALY) gained via the sunitinib strategy compared with the conventional strategy was $220,384 (without SPAP, interleukin-2 plus interferon-alfa and bevacizumab plus interferon-alfa were dominated) and $16,993 (with SPAP, interferon-alfa, interleukin-2 plus interferon-alfa and bevacizumab plus interferon-alfa were dominated).

9632,A long-term analysis evaluating the cost-effectiveness of biphasic insulin lispro mix 75/25 and mix 50/50 versus long-acting basal insulin analogs in the United States,"Abstract Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of biphasic insulin lispro mix 75/25 (LM75/25) and mix 50/50 (LM50/50) compared with a long-acting analog insulin (LAAI) regimen from the perspective of a US healthcare payer. Methods: A published computer simulation model of diabetes was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LM75/25 and LM50/50 vs a LAAI (insulin glargine) from the perspective of a US healthcare payer. Treatment effects in terms of HbA1c benefits were taken from a recent meta-analysis. Direct medical costs including pharmacy, complication, and patient management costs were obtained from published sources. All costs were expressed in 2010 US dollars and future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: LM75/25 and LM50/50 were associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.08 and 0.09 years, improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.07 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.08 QALYs and increases in cost of US$ 1724 and US$ 1720, respectively, when compared with LAAI.

9633,A long-term analysis evaluating the cost-effectiveness of biphasic insulin lispro mix 75/25 and mix 50/50 versus long-acting basal insulin analogs in the United States,"Abstract Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of biphasic insulin lispro mix 75/25 (LM75/25) and mix 50/50 (LM50/50) compared with a long-acting analog insulin (LAAI) regimen from the perspective of a US healthcare payer. Methods: A published computer simulation model of diabetes was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LM75/25 and LM50/50 vs a LAAI (insulin glargine) from the perspective of a US healthcare payer. Treatment effects in terms of HbA1c benefits were taken from a recent meta-analysis. Direct medical costs including pharmacy, complication, and patient management costs were obtained from published sources. All costs were expressed in 2010 US dollars and future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: LM75/25 and LM50/50 were associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.08 and 0.09 years, improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.07 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.08 QALYs and increases in cost of US$ 1724 and US$ 1720, respectively, when compared with LAAI.

9634,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of sentinel lymph node biopsy compared with axillary node dissection in patients with early-stage breast cancer: a decision model analysis,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is less invasive than axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for staging early breast cancer, and has a lower risk of arm lymphoedema and similar rates of locoregional recurrence up to 8 years. This study estimates the longer-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SLNB.A Markov decision model was developed to estimate the incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of an SLNB-based staging and management strategy compared with ALND over 20 years' follow-up. The probability and quality-of-life weighting (utility) of outcomes were estimated from published data and population statistics. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Australian health care system. The model was used to identify key factors affecting treatment decisions.The SLNB was more effective and less costly than the ALND over 20 years, with 8 QALYs gained and $883,000 saved per 1000 patients. The SLNB was less effective when: SLNB false negative (FN) rate >13%; 5-year incidence of axillary recurrence after an SLNB FN>19%; risk of an SLNB-positive result >48%; lymphoedema prevalence after ALND <14%; or lymphoedema utility decrement <0.012.The long-term advantage of SLNB over ALND was modest and sensitive to variations in key assumptions, indicating a need for reliable information on lymphoedema incidence and disutility following SLNB. In addition to awaiting longer-term trial data, risk models to better identify patients at high risk of axillary metastasis will be valuable to inform decision-making.",2012-01-08847,22415293,Br J Cancer,H Verry,2012,106 /,1045-52,No,22415293,"H Verry; S J Lord; A Martin; G Gill; C K Lee; K Howard; N Wetzig; J Simes; Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of sentinel lymph node biopsy compared with axillary node dissection in patients with early-stage breast cancer: a decision model analysis, Br J Cancer, ; 106 ():0007-0920; 1045-52",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sentinal lymph node biopsy vs. Axillary node dissection,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,-107317.07,Australia,2010,-117184.71
9635,Can mucosal healing be a cost-effective endpoint for biologic therapy in Crohn's disease? A decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have demonstrated that mucosal healing (MH) may be associated with reductions in hospitalizations and surgeries for moderate to severe Crohn''s disease (CD). Whether treatment to achieve MH is a cost-effective endpoint has not been established previously. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model comparing two treatment strategies. In the clinical response (CR) arm, patients not in clinical remission at year 1 are dose-escalated. In the MH arm, patients with persistence of mucosal ulcerations at year 1 are escalated irrespective of clinical symptoms. Patients remain at risk for hospitalization and surgeries while they have active disease. We examined a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS: In the base case the MH strategy was more effective at 2 years (quality-adjusted life year [QALY] 0.71) compared to the CR strategy (QALY 0.69) but was also more expensive with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $49,278/QALY gained. In a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients assigned to each treatment arm, the MH strategy resulted in lower rates of hospitalization and surgery with a number needed to treat of 27 and 106, respectively. The results were sensitive to the ability of infliximab to achieve MH and the incremental benefit of MH over clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that MH as an endpoint is a cost-effective strategy in CD patients initiating IFX therapy. Further prospective studies on durability of MH and its incremental benefit as well as the ability of other available biologic agents to achieve MH are necessary to validate our findings.",2012-01-08850,22416019,Inflamm Bowel Dis,Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan,2013,19 / 1,,No,22416019,"Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan; Joshua R Korzenik; Chin Hur; Can mucosal healing be a cost-effective endpoint for biologic therapy in Crohn's disease?

9636,Cost-effectiveness of tapentadol in severe chronic pain in Spain: a cost analysis of data from RCTs,"Chronic pain is known to be a significant and common health problem. Tapentadol, a recently developed centrally active, oral analgesic agent is used to treat adults with severe chronic pain that can be adequately managed only with opioid analgesics. Tapentadol has been reported to provide an improved adverse-events (AE) profile compared with other potent opioid analgesics at similar levels of analgesia.The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of tapentadol to that of opioids commonly used as first-line treatment of severe, chronic, nonmalignant pain from the perspective of the health care payer in Spain.A Markov state-transition model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatment with tapentadol to that of oxycodone, morphine, and transdermal fentanyl (TDF) over a 1-year time horizon. Four health states were defined: (1) treatment discontinuation due to a severe AE; (2) treatment discontinuation due to a lack of efficacy; (3) occurrence of an AE that required medical treatment; and (4) no discontinuation and no AE. If a patient discontinued a treatment, he or she was switched to an alternative, second-line opioid. Data regarding efficacy, tolerability, and utility values (EQ-5D) were derived from randomized clinical trials. Clinical experts estimated the rates of switching to other opioids and the health care resource utilization associated with the treatment of severe chronic pain. Unit costs were derived from public price lists/tariff works and were calculated from the perspective of the National Spanish Health System. The robustness of the model results was tested in extensive sensitivity analyses in which event probabilities, costs, utilities, and treatment-switching rates were altered.Data from 3 studies (1981 patients) were included in the model. Overall, the model predicted that initiating first-line treatment with tapentadol in patients with severe, chronic, nonmalignant pain was associated with lower costs and greater efficacy versus first-line treatment with oxycodone. Compared with morphine and TDF, tapentadol yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ?2656 and ?2069 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. On extensive 1-way and scenario analyses, findings on the cost-effectiveness of tapentadol were consistent.

9642,Estimation of the burden of disease and costs of genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in Canada,"Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection in Canada have been increasing since the mid-1990s. We sought to estimate the burden of CT in this population.We developed an age- and sex-structured mathematical model parameterized to reproduce trends in CT prevalence between 1991 and 2009 in the Canadian population aged 10 to 39 years. Costs were identified, measured, and valued using a modified societal perspective and converted to year 2009 Canadian dollars. Cost-effectiveness of the implemented policy of enhanced screening for asymptomatic infections was estimated by comparison with model-projected trends in the absence of increased screening. Main outcome measures were current net cost and burden of illness attributable to CT infection, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Under base case model assumptions, there was a trend of increasing detection of CT cases (due to increases in screening), despite an underlying stabilization of actual CT infections. Average estimated costs associated with CT infection over this period were $51.4 million per year. Costs of screening and treatment of asymptomatic infections as a proportion of total CT costs were estimated to have increased over time, whereas costs of long-term sequelae associated with untreated infections declined over the same period. Compared with no change in screening, enhanced screening was estimated to be highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2910 per quality-adjusted life year.Despite increases in screening, the economic burden of CT in Canada remains high. Further investigation of trends in chlamydia-associated complications is required to better understand the impact of screening on incidence.",2012-01-08860,22421691,Sex Transm Dis,Ashleigh R Tuite,2012,39 /,260-7,No,22421691,"Ashleigh R Tuite; Gayatri C Jayaraman; Vanessa G Allen; David N Fisman; Estimation of the burden of disease and costs of genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in Canada, Sex Transm Dis, ; 39 ():0148-5717; 260-7",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis infections vs. None,Not Stated,39 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,19 Years,3.00,3.00,2910,Canada,2009,3090.47

Two patient cohorts with AF (starting age of <80 and =80 years) were considered separately, in line with the UK labelled indication. Modelled outcomes over a lifetime horizon included clinical events, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).Patients treated with dabigatran etexilate experienced fewer ischaemic strokes (3.74 dabigatran etexilate vs 3.97 warfarin) and fewer combined intracranial haemorrhages and haemorrhagic strokes (0.43 dabigatran etexilate vs 0.99 warfarin) per 100 patient-years. Larger differences were observed comparing dabigatran etexilate with aspirin or no therapy. For patients initiating treatment at ages <80 and =80 years, the ICERs for dabigatran etexilate were ?4831 and ?7090/QALY gained versus warfarin with a probability of cost-effectiveness at ?20?000/QALY gained of 98% and 63%, respectively. For the patient cohort starting treatment at ages <80 years, the ICER versus aspirin was ?3457/QALY gained and dabigatran etexilate was dominant (ie, was less costly and more effective) compared with no therapy.

9653,The cost efficiency of HPV vaccines is significantly underestimated due to omission of conisation-associated prematurity with neonatal mortality and morbidity,"Introduction: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) represents the precursor of invasive cervical cancer and is associated with human papillomavirus infection (HPV) against which two vaccines have been approved in the last years. Standard treatments of high-grade CIN are conisation procedures, which are associated with an increased risk of subsequent pregnancy complications like premature delivery and possible subsequent life-long disability. HPV vaccination has therefore the potential to decrease neonatal morbidity and mortality. This has not been taken into account in published cost-effectiveness models. Material and Methods: We calculated the possible reduction rate of conisations for different vaccination strategies for Germany. Using this rate, we computed the reduction of conisation-associated preterm deliveries, life-long disability and neonatal death due to prematurity. The number of life-years saved (LYS) and gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was estimated. The incremental costs per LYS / additional QALY were calculated. Results: The reduction of conisation procedures was highest in scenario I (vaccination coverage 90% prior to HPV exposition) with about 50%. The costs per LYS or additional QALY were lowest in scenario I, II and III with 45,101 ? or 43,505-47,855 ? and rose up to 60,544 ? or 58,401-64,240 ? in scenario V (50% vaccinated prior to sexual activity + additional 20% catch-up at a mean age of 20 y). Conclusion: Regarding the HPV 16 / 18 vaccines as ""vaccines against conisation-related neonatal morbidity and mortality"" alone, they already have the potential to be cost-effective.

9654,The cost efficiency of HPV vaccines is significantly underestimated due to omission of conisation-associated prematurity with neonatal mortality and morbidity,"Introduction: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) represents the precursor of invasive cervical cancer and is associated with human papillomavirus infection (HPV) against which two vaccines have been approved in the last years. Standard treatments of high-grade CIN are conisation procedures, which are associated with an increased risk of subsequent pregnancy complications like premature delivery and possible subsequent life-long disability. HPV vaccination has therefore the potential to decrease neonatal morbidity and mortality. This has not been taken into account in published cost-effectiveness models. Material and Methods: We calculated the possible reduction rate of conisations for different vaccination strategies for Germany. Using this rate, we computed the reduction of conisation-associated preterm deliveries, life-long disability and neonatal death due to prematurity. The number of life-years saved (LYS) and gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was estimated. The incremental costs per LYS / additional QALY were calculated.

In Latin America, many people with diabetes have limited access to health care, which means that indirect costs may exceed direct health care cost. Diabetes is Mexico's leading cause of death.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratios of the most used oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) in the treatment of outpatients with type 2 diabetes attending a public primary care clinic in Mexico City.A cross-sectional and analytic study was conducted in Mexico City.Twenty-seven adult outpatients with type 2 diabetes who were treated either with metformin or glibenclamide were included. Acarbose was used as an alternative strategy. The study was carried out from the perspective of Mexican society. Direct medical and nonmedical costs as well as indirect costs were evaluated using a structured questionnaire. Efficacies of all drug treatments were evaluated retrospectively. A systematic search was conducted to select published randomized clinical trials based on predetermined inclusion criteria, and treatment success was defined as glycosylated hemoglobin factor = 7%. Efficacy data of each drug and/or combination were analyzed using meta-analysis. The Monte Carlo Markov model was used.

9657,Impact of generic alendronate cost on the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and treatment,"Since alendronate became available in generic form in the Unites States in 2008, its price has been decreasing. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of alendronate cost on the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and treatment in postmenopausal women.Microsimulation cost-effectiveness model of osteoporosis screening and treatment for U.S. women age 65 and older. We assumed screening initiation at age 65 with central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and alendronate treatment for individuals with osteoporosis; with a comparator of ""no screening"" and treatment only after fracture occurrence. We evaluated annual alendronate costs of $20 through $800; outcome measures included fractures; nursing home admission; medication adverse events; death; costs; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2010 U.S. dollars per QALY gained. A lifetime time horizon was used, and direct costs were included. Base-case and sensitivity analyses were performed.Base-case analysis results showed that at annual alendronate costs of $200 or less, osteoporosis screening followed by treatment was cost-saving, resulting in lower total costs than no screening as well as more QALYs (10.6 additional quality-adjusted life-days). When assuming alendronate costs of $400 through $800, screening and treatment resulted in greater lifetime costs than no screening but was highly cost-effective, with ICERs ranging from $714 per QALY gained through $13,902 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening followed by alendronate treatment was robust to joint input parameter estimate variation at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY at all alendronate costs evaluated.Osteoporosis screening followed by alendronate treatment is effective and highly cost-effective for postmenopausal women across a range of alendronate costs, and may be cost-saving at annual alendronate costs of $200 or less.",2012-01-08872,22427903,PLoS One,Smita Nayak,2012,7 /,e32879,No,22427903,"Smita Nayak; Mark S Roberts; Susan L Greenspan; Impact of generic alendronate cost on the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and treatment, PLoS One , ; 7 ():1932-6203; e32879",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Osteoperosis screening followed by alendronate treatment vs. None (treatment only if fracture occurs),Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated

Multi-centred randomized controlled trial with quality of life and resource use data collected.Objective. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of yoga intervention plus usual care compared with usual care alone for chronic or recurrent low back pain.Summary of Background Data. Yoga has been shown as an effective intervention for treating chronic or recurrent low back pain. However, there is little evidence on its cost-effectiveness. The data is extracted from a pragmatic, multi-centred, randomized controlled trial which has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a 12-week progressive programme of yoga plus usual care in patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain.Methods. With this trial data, a cost-effectiveness analysis over the time period of 12 months from both perspectives of the UK National Health Service and the societal is presented. Main outcome measure is an incremental cost per quality adjusted life year. Results: From the perspective of the NHS, yoga intervention yields an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of ?13,606 per QALY. Given a willingness to pay for an additional QALY of ?20,000, the probability of yoga intervention being cost effective is 72%. From the perspective of the society, yoga intervention is a dominant treatment over usual care alone.

9663,Cost-effectiveness evaluation in Sweden of escitalopram compared with venlafaxine extended-release as first-line treatment in major depressive disorder,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major public health concern associated with a high burden to society, the health-care system, and patients and an estimated cost of ?3.5 billion in Sweden. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of escitalopram versus generic venlafaxine extended-release (XR) in MDD, accounting for the full clinical profile of each, adopting the Swedish societal perspective, and identifying major cost drivers.Cost-effectiveness of escitalopram versus venlafaxine XR was analyzed over a 6-month time frame, on the basis of a decision tree, for patients with MDD seeking primary care treatment in Sweden. Effectiveness outcomes for the model were quality-adjusted life-years and probability of sustained remission after acute treatment (first 8 weeks) and sustained for 6 months. Cost outcomes included direct treatment costs and indirect costs associated with sick leave.Compared with generic venlafaxine XR, escitalopram was less costly and more effective in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (expected gain 0.00865) and expected 6-month sustained remission probability (incremental gain 0.0374). The better tolerability profile of escitalopram contributed to higher expected quality-adjusted life-years and lower health-care resource utilization in terms of pharmacological treatment of adverse events (though only a minor component of treatment costs). Expected per-patient saving was ?169.15 for escitalopram versus venlafaxine. Cost from sick leave constituted about 85% of total costs.Escitalopram was estimated as more effective and cost saving than generic venlafaxine XR in first-line MDD treatment in Sweden, driven by the effectiveness and tolerability advantages of escitalopram.

Patient medical care costs and utilization were captured from Los Angeles County Department of Health Services claims records. Patient-reported outcomes included Short-Form Health Survey-12 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9-calculated depression-free days.Intervention patients had significantly greater Short-Form Health Survey-12 utility improvement from baseline compared with controls over the 18-month evaluation period (4.8%; P < 0.001) and a corresponding significant improvement in depression-free days (43.0; P < 0.001). Medical cost differences were not statistically significant in ordinary least squares and log-transformed cost regressions.

9665,Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy for stage III colon cancer in Japan based on the MOSAIC trial,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FU/LV) for patients with stage III colorectal cancer.We performed the cost-effectiveness of FOLFOX compared with standard FU/LV treatment by the retrospective analysis of patient-level data from the randomized controlled Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer (MOSAIC) trial. Predicted mean time spent in each disease state was calculated by our statistical model, which takes into account the cure rate and treats death from causes other than colon cancer as a competing risk. We performed this analysis from the perspective of the health-care payer. Using a time horizon of 30 years, both cost and effectiveness were discounted by 3% per year.Estimated cure rates for colon cancer were 0.715 (FOLFOX) and 0.622 (FU/LV). Estimated medical costs of FOLFOX were JPY 3.1 million (USD 34,000) compared with JPY 1.9 million (USD 22,000) of FU/LV. The mean estimated quality-adjusted life-year was 9.83 with FOLFOX and 9.07 with that of FU/LV. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of FOLFOX was JPY 1.5 million (USD 17,000) per quality-adjusted life-year compared with FU/LV, which was supported by sensitivity analysis. Even if we assume that Japanese outcomes were better than those reported by the MOSAIC trial, which would reduce the difference between cure rates for each treatment to 5%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained below 5.0 million (USD 56,000) per quality-adjusted life-year.Adjuvant FOLFOX is a cost-effective treatment for stage III colon cancer in Japan compared with FU/LV therapy.

9666,Lifetime cost-effectiveness of skin cancer prevention through promotion of daily sunscreen use,"Health-care costs for the treatment of skin cancers are disproportionately high in many white populations, yet they can be reduced through the promotion of sun-protective behaviors. We investigated the lifetime health costs and benefits of sunscreen promotion in the primary prevention of skin cancers, including melanoma.A decision-analytic model with Markov chains was used to integrate data from a central community-based randomized controlled trial conducted in Australia and other epidemiological and published sources. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was the primary outcome. Extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the uncertainty in the base findings with plausible variation to the model parameters.Using a combined household and government perspective, the discounted incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the sunscreen intervention was AU$40,890. Over the projected lifetime of the intervention cohort, this would prevent 33 melanomas, 168 cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas, and 4 melanoma-deaths at a cost of approximately AU$808,000. The likelihood that the sunscreen intervention was cost-effective was 64% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.Subject to the best-available evidence depicted in our model, the active promotion of routine sunscreen use to white populations residing in sunny settings is likely to be a cost-effective investment for governments and consumers over the long term.",2012-01-08881,22433757,Value Health,Nicholas G Hirst,2012,15 /,261-8,Yes,22433757,"Nicholas G Hirst; Louisa G Gordon; Paul A Scuffham; Adele C Green; Lifetime cost-effectiveness of skin cancer prevention through promotion of daily sunscreen use, Value Health, ; 15 ():1098-3015; 261-8",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Application of broad-spectrum Sun Protection Factor 15 sunscreen to head neck arms and hands every morning vs. Use of sun screen at their own discretion,Not Stated,49 Years,49 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,49500,Australia,2010,54051.45

The study objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in a Medicaid population. Methods: A societal cost-utility analysis was conducted of prophylaxis with palivizumab vs no prophylaxis among four groups of premature infants: (1) <32 weeks gestational age (wGA) and =6 months chronologic age (CA); (2) 32-34 wGA, =3 months CA with 2009 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) risk factors (RF); (3) 32-35 wGA, =6 months CA with 2006 AAP RF; and (4) 32-35 wGA, =6 months CA with =1 RF. Full dosing of palivizumab was assumed throughout the RSV season (consistent with the FDA-approved label). All costs were in 2010 US dollars. The societal public payer spend for palivizumab was estimated using Medicaid reimbursement methodologies for the top 10 palivizumab-using states in 2010 minus mandatory manufacturer rebates. This study reports the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were also conducted. Results: Palivizumab saved costs and improved QALYs among infants <32 wGA. Palivizumab was cost-effective in infants 32-34 wGA with 2009 AAP RF ($16,037 per QALY) and in infants 32-35 wGA with 2006 AAP RF ($38,244 per QALY). The ICER for infants 32-35 wGA with =1 RF was $281,892 per QALY. Influential variables in the sensitivity analysis included the background rate of RSV hospitalization, the cost of palivizumab, and the efficacy of palivizumab. Key limitations: These results are not generalizable to commercially insured infants or infants outside of the US.

The base-case analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness ratio of ART, DAART-MMT, and ART-MMT strategies was USD 1358.9, 1118.0 and 1327.1 per 1 Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), equivalent to 1.22, 1.00, and 1.19 times Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPpc). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for DAART-MMT and ART-MMT versus ART strategy was 569.4 and 1227.8, approximately 0.51 and 1.10 times GDPpc/QALY. At the willingness to pay threshold of 3 times GDPpc, the probability of being cost-effective of DAART-MMT versus ART was 86.1%. These findings indicated that providing MMT along with ART for HIV-positive DUs is a cost-effective intervention in Vietnam. Integrating MMT and ART services could facilitate the use of directly observed therapy that supports treatment adherence and brings about clinically important improvements in health outcomes.

9681,Cost-Effectiveness of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride for Hemodialysis Patients With Severe Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Cinacalcet effectively reduces elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), even those with severe disease for whom parathyroidectomy can be the treatment of choice. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment in hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT in Japan. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with severe SHPT (intact PTH >500 pg/mL) who were receiving hemodialysis in Japan. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: A Markov model was constructed from the health care system perspective in Japan. Patients were followed up over their lifetime. Dialysis costs were not included in the base case. INTERVENTION: Cinacalcet as an addition to conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone. In both arms, patients underwent parathyroidectomy if intact PTH level was >500 pg/mL for 6 months and they were eligible for surgery. OUTCOMES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: ICERs for cinacalcet for those who were eligible for surgery and those who were not were $352,631/QALY gained and $21,613/QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed that results were fairly robust to variations in model parameters and assumptions. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, cinacalcet was cost-effective in only 0.9% of simulations for those eligible for surgery, but in more than 99.9% of simulations for those ineligible for surgery, if society would be willing to pay $50,000 per additional QALY. LIMITATIONS: Data for the long-term effect of cinacalcet on patient-level outcomes are limited. The model predicted rates for clinical events using data for the surrogate biochemical end points.

9683,Economic evaluation of endoscopic versus open vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting,"A short saphenous vein segment is commonly used as a conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting, and clinicians must decide whether to obtain it by performing open (OVH) or endoscopic vein harvest (EVH). We conducted a health economic evaluation, using data on resource usage collected alongside a randomized controlled trial, to investigate whether EVH is cost-effective compared with OVH.Analyses were performed in accordance with international guidelines for health economic evaluations. We constructed 3 cost-levels as the current literature is inconclusive as to which resource consumptions differ significantly between harvesting methods. Outcomes were measured as purulent infections avoided in the cost-effectiveness analysis and for the cost-utility analysis we estimated quality-adjusted life-years gained. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: ie, the extra cost of obtaining one extra quality-adjusted life-year and the extra cost of avoiding one purulent infection. To handle uncertainties, we performed bias corrected bootstrap analyses on 5,000 resamples and constructed cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $79,391/quality-adjusted life-year and $1,970/purulent infection avoided when costs and outcomes within 35 days postoperatively were compared. Within 35 days postoperatively, EVH was less than 1% cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year.The EVH was not cost-effective within 35 days postoperatively.

Choosing between the three available prostacyclin therapies could be complicated because there are no comparison studies, so the final decision must be driven by factors such as efficacy, administration route, safety profile and economic aspects.This study provides a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility comparison of initiating prostacyclin therapy with three different treatment alternatives (inhaled iloprost [ILO], intravenous epoprostenol [EPO] and subcutaneous treprostinil [TRE]) for patients with PAH. The goal of this work is to help physicians with their therapeutic decision-making.A Markov model was built to simulate a patient cohort with class III PAH according to the classification of the New York Heart Association (NYHA). Four health states corresponding with the NYHA classes plus death were allowed for patients in the model. Changing the treatment was possible when patients worsened from functional class III to IV. The time horizon was 3 years, allowing patients to transition between health states on a 12-week cycle basis. The study perspective was that of the National Health System (NHS) [only direct medical costs were included]. Unitary costs were obtained from the Drug Catalogue and e-Salud Database in 2009 and are given in euros (?). Data on health resources and treatment pathways were informed by a four-member expert panel. Efficacy was obtained from pivotal clinical trials of ILO, EPO and TRE, the latter used in Spain as a foreign medication. Utilities for each health state were obtained from the literature. The final efficacy measure was life-years gained (LYG), and utilities were used to obtain quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and effects were discounted at a 3% rate. To check for the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses were performed.At the end of the 3 years, in the base case of the deterministic analysis, initiating prostacyclin therapy with iloprost was the less costly strategy (?132,840), followed by treprostinil (?359,869) and epoprostenol (?429,775).

9686,Cost effectiveness of lacosamide in the adjunctive treatment of patients with refractory focal epilepsy in belgium,"Lacosamide is an anti-epileptic drug, indicated as adjunctive therapy for patients with focal seizures with or without secondary generalization. This study aims to assess the cost effectiveness of standard anti-epileptic drug therapy plus lacosamide 300?mg/day compared with standard therapy alone from the perspective of the Belgian healthcare payer.The treatment pathway of a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients over 2 years was simulated using a decision tree. Data about health state probabilities, seizure frequency and utility values were taken from lacosamide trials or from the literature. Effectiveness measures included the number of seizures avoided and the number of quality-adjusted life-years gained. Unit costs were taken from national references. Resource use was estimated by a panel of eight neurologists with extensive experience in epilepsy. The price year was 2008. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.Over a 24-month period, standard anti-epileptic drug therapy plus lacosamide led to a reduction of seven seizures, an increase of 0.038 quality-adjusted life-years and a cost decrease of &U20AC;3619 per patient compared with standard therapy alone. Using a willingness to pay of &U20AC;30?000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the net monetary benefit of standard anti-epileptic drug therapy plus lacosamide amounted to &U20AC;4754.

We assess the cost-effectiveness of TT compared to DT in the treatment of untreated patients with G1 CHC. METHODS: We created a Markov Decision Model to evaluate, in an untreated Caucasian patients aged 50 years, weight 70 kg, with G1 CHC and Metavir F2 liver fibrosis score, for a time horizon of twenty years, the cost-effectiveness of the following 5 competing strategies: 1) Boceprevir response-guided therapyy (BOC-RGT); 2) Boceprevir IL28B genotype-guided strategy (BOC-IL28B); 3) Boceprevir rapid virologic response (RVR) guided strategy (BOC-RVR); 4) Telaprevir response-guided theapyy (TVR-RGT); 5) Telaprevir IL28B genotype-guided strategy (TVR-IL28B). Outcomes included life-years gained (LYG), costs (in 2011 euros), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the base case analysis BOC-RVR and TVR-IL28B strategies were the most effective and cost-effective of evaluated strategies. LYG was 4.04 with BOC-RVR, and 4.42 with TVR-IL28B. ICER compared with DT was ?8.304 per LYG for BOC-RVR, and ?11.455 per LYG for TVR-IL28B. The model was highly sensitive to IL28B CC genotype, likelihood of RVR and of sustained virologic response, and BOC/TVR prices. CONCLUSIONS: In untreated G1 CHC patients aged 50 years, TT with first generation protease inhibitors is cost-effective compared with DT. Multiple strategies to reduce costs and improve effectiveness include RVR or genotype-guided treatment.

9692,Cost effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate versus risperidone long-acting injectable and olanzapine pamoate for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in Sweden,"Abstract Objective: To model the cost effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate (paliperidone long-acting injectable; PLAI), a new once-monthly long-acting antipsychotic therapy, compared with risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) and olanzapine pamoate (OLAI), in multi-episode patients (two or more relapses) with schizophrenia in Sweden. Methods: A Markov decision analytic model was developed to simulate the history of a cohort of multi-episode patients transitioning through different health states on a monthly basis over a 5-year time horizon from the perspective of the Swedish healthcare system. Therapeutic strategies consisted of starting treatment with RLAI (mean dose 37.5?mg every 2 weeks), PLAI (mean dose 75?mg equivalent (eq.) every month) or OLAI (150?mg every 2 weeks or 300?mg every 4 weeks). Probability of relapse, level of adherence, side-effects (extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, weight gain and diabetes) and treatment discontinuation (switch) were derived from long-term observational data when feasible. Incremental cost-effectiveness outcomes, discounted at 3% annually, included cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost per relapse avoided (expressed in 2009 Swedish Krona SEK). Results: Relative to RLAI and OLAI, PLAI is economically dominant: more effective (additional QALYs, less relapses) and less costly treatment option over a 5-year time horizon. The results were robust when tested in sensitivity analysis. Limitations: The impact of once-monthly treatment on adherence levels is not yet known, and not all variables that could impact on real-world outcomes and costs were included in this model.

9699,The potential economic value of a Staphylococcus aureus vaccine among hemodialysis patients,"Staphylococcus aureus infections are a substantial problem for hemodialysis patients. Several vaccine candidates are currently under development, with hemodialysis patients being one possible target population. To determine the potential economic value of an S. aureus vaccine among hemodialysis patients, we developed a Markov decision analytic computer simulation model. When S. aureus colonization prevalence was 1%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccination was =$25,217/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Vaccination became more cost-effective as colonization prevalence, vaccine efficacy, or vaccine protection duration increased or vaccine cost decreased. Even at 10% colonization prevalence, a 25% efficacious vaccine costing $100 prevented 29 infections, 21 infection-related hospitalizations, and 9 inpatient deaths per 1000 vaccinated HD patients. Our results suggest that an S. aureus vaccine would be cost-effective (i.e., ICERs=$50,000/QALY) among hemodialysis patients over a wide range of S. aureus prevalence, vaccine costs and efficacies, and vaccine protection durations and delineate potential target parameters for such a vaccine.",2012-01-08932,22464963,Vaccine,Yeohan Song,2012,30 / 24,3675-82,Yes,22464963,"Yeohan Song; Julie H Y Tai; Sarah M Bartsch; Richard K Zimmerman; Robert R Muder; Bruce Y Lee; The potential economic value of a Staphylococcus aureus vaccine among hemodialysis patients, Vaccine, May/21/2012; 30(24):1873-2518; 3675-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Staphylococcus aureus vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,25217,United States,2011,29014.25
9700,Is Anterior Cervical Fusion with a Porous Tantalum Implant A Cost-effective Method to Treat Cervical Disc Disease with Radiculopathy?,"ABSTRACT: Study Design. Retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis.Objective. To determine the relative cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with a porous-tantalum implant compared to autograft with plating, for single-level cervical disc disease with radiculopathy.Summary of Background Data. ACDF with autograft as an interbody spacer is a generally accepted method to treat degenerated cervical discs with radiculopathy. Concerns about donor-site morbidity and the structural characteristics of autograft stimulated investigations of alternative materials. Techniques may differ in their operative risks, complications, outcomes, and resource use.Methods. A retrospective review of clinical outcomes and total cost of illness for 5-years post surgery was performed for 61 consecutive patients enrolled for this study. Twenty-eight were treated with single-level ACDF using either a stand-alone, porous-tantalum implant, without graft inside the implant, and 33 received autograft and plating. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) comparing the two ACDF treatment methods was conducted. This paper reports clinical assessments, quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis.Results. Patients in both cohorts reported improved clinical outcomes, including NDI, VAS, SF-36, ODOM, and Patient Satisfaction at 5-years post-index surgery. The mean cost of illness for the study period, including pre-operative through 5-year post-operative assessments, was 6,806 &OV0556; per patient treated with tantalum and 10,143 &OV0556; per patient receiving autograft and plate. QALYs gained were 9.41 and 7.14 for the tantalum and control cohorts, respectively. The cost per QALY for the tantalum group was 723 &OV0556; and 1,420 &OV0556; for the control group. The ICER of ACDF with a porous-tantalum implant compared to ACDF with autograft and plate was -1,473 &OV0556; per patient per year over the duration of this study.Conclusion. This CEA reports favorable results for ACDF procedures utilizing a tantalum implant. The data reported suggest that using porous tantalum as a standalone device is less costly and more effective than autograft and plate in ACDF procedures.",2012-01-08936,22466632,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Mariano Fern?ndez-Fairen,2012,37 / 20,,No,22466632,"Mariano Fern?ndez-Fairen; Antonio Murcia; Ana Torres; Daniel Hern?ndez-Vaquero; Ann M Menzie; Is Anterior Cervical Fusion with a Porous Tantalum Implant A Cost-effective Method to Treat Cervical Disc Disease with Radiculopathy?, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , Sep/15/2012; 37(20):1528-1159",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Porous tantalum impants vs. Iliac bone autograft and planting,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,0 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-307.05,Euro,2010,-482.31
