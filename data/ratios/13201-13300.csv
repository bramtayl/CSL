13201,Cost-effectiveness of selective neck dissection versus modified radical neck dissection for treating metastases in patients with oral cavity cancer: A modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Choosing between a more or less extensive neck dissection implies a tradeoff between survival, quality of life, and costs. The purpose of this study was to determine if selective neck dissection (level I-III or I-IV) is cost-effective compared with modified radical neck dissection (level I-V) in patients with cT1-2 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with singular nodal disease confined to level I or II. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to model quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs over a lifetime horizon, based on literature. RESULTS: The selective neck dissection strategy resulted in an expected health loss of 0.06 QALY and savings of euro1351 per patient compared to modified radical neck dissection. The results were sensitive to differences in regional failure probabilities between the strategies. CONCLUSION: With the evidence used in this model, selective neck dissection was not cost-effective compared to modified radical neck dissection. Prospective research on regional failure is needed to provide optimal treatment for patients with OSCC. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

13202,Opportunity cost of funding drugs for rare diseases: the cost-effectiveness of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,"BACKGROUND: Both ethical and economics concerns have been raised with respect to the funding of drugs for rare diseases. This article reports both the cost-effectiveness of eculizumab for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and its associated opportunity costs. METHODS: Analysis compared eculizumab plus current standard of care v. current standard of care from a publicly funded health care system perspective. A Markov model covered the major consequences of PNH and treatment. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of the incremental cost per life year and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Opportunity costs were assessed by the health gains foregone and the alternative uses for the additional resources. RESULTS: Eculizumab is associated with greater life years (1.13), QALYs (2.45), and costs (CAN$5.24 million). The incremental cost per life year and per QALY gained is CAN$4.62 million and CAN$2.13 million, respectively. Based on established thresholds, the opportunity cost of funding eculizumab is 102.3 discounted QALYs per patient funded. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. If the acquisition cost of eculizumab was reduced by 98.5%, it could be considered cost-effective. LIMITATIONS: The nature of rare diseases means that data are often sparse for the conduct of economic evaluations. When data were limited, assumptions were made that biased results in favor of eculizumab. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting economic evaluations in the context of rare diseases. Eculizumab may provide substantive benefits to patients with PNH in terms of life expectancy and quality of life but at a high incremental cost and a substantial opportunity cost. Decision makers should fully consider the opportunity costs before making positive reimbursement decisions.",2014-01-16258,24990825,Med Decis Making,Doug Coyle,2014,34 / 8,1016-29,No,24990825,"Doug Coyle; Matthew C Cheung; Gerald A Evans; Opportunity cost of funding drugs for rare diseases: the cost-effectiveness of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, Med Decis Making, ; 34(8):0272-989X; 1016-29",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eculizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,5.00,2134156,Canada,2012,2406291.49
13203,Prevention of group B streptococcal disease in the first 3 months of life: would routine maternal immunization during pregnancy be cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND: A vaccine against group B streptococcus (GBS) that is intended for routine maternal immunization during pregnancy is in clinical development. Addition of vaccination to screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) may further reduce the burden of GBS disease in infancy; its potential cost-effectiveness is unknown, however. METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of routine immunization at week 28 of pregnancy with the trivalent GBS (serotypes Ia, Ib and III) vaccine that is in clinical development. The vaccine was assumed to be used in addition to screening and IAP, and reduce the risk of invasive infection in infancy due to covered serotypes. We estimated the effectiveness of immunization in terms of additional cases of GBS disease prevented, deaths averted, life-years saved, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained; potential reductions in prematurity and stillbirths were not considered. Costs considered included those of acute care for infants with GBS disease, and chronic care for those with long-term disability. The cost of immunization was assumed to be $100 per person. RESULTS: Assuming 85% coverage, routine maternal immunization against GBS added to screening and IAP would prevent an additional 899 cases of GBS disease and an additional 35 deaths among infants in the US. The total annual cost of immunization would be $362.7 million; estimated cost savings from prevention of GBS disease in infancy would be $43.5 million. The cost-effectiveness of immunization was estimated to be $91,321 per QALY gained. Findings were sensitive to assumptions regarding vaccine efficacy and cost. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of a trivalent GBS maternal vaccine to screening and IAP might further reduce the burden of GBS disease among infants in the US, and may be comparable in cost-effectiveness to other vaccines recently approved for use in children and adolescents.",2014-01-16260,24992717,Vaccine,Gerry Oster,2014,32 / 37,4778-85,Yes,24992717,"Gerry Oster; John Edelsberg; Kalin Hennegan; Clement Lewin; Vas Narasimhan; Karen Slobod; Morven S Edwards; Carol J Baker; Prevention of group B streptococcal disease in the first 3 months of life: would routine maternal immunization during pregnancy be cost-effective?, Vaccine, ; 32(37):1873-2518; 4778-85",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Maternal vaccination plus screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of group B streptococcal disease in first 3 months of life vs. Screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis only,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,91321,United States,2012,102942.06
13204,Cost effectiveness of response-guided therapy with peginterferon in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B in Asian countries produces a substantial economic burden. Peginterferon has immunomodulatory effects and a finite course for treatment of hepatitis B, but also a high cost and side effects. The recent introduction of a 12-week stopping rule (stopping treatment after 12 weeks) has increased its appeal as a first-line treatment for hepatitis B. We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of the 12-week stopping rule for peginterferon in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. METHODS: We used Markov modeling, with data from the Hong Kong population, to compare the cost effectiveness of peginterferon therapy with a 12-week stopping rule vs conventional therapy (48 weeks) and with other antiviral agents. RESULTS: For HBeAg-positive patients, stopping peginterferon therapy after 12 weeks had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), of $9501/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), compared with no treatment, making it the most cost-effective option. Conventional (48-week) peginterferon treatment had a CER of $9664/QALY. For HBeAg-negative patients, entecavir had the lowest CER ($34,310/QALY). Entecavir was more cost effective than either peginterferon strategies (CERs of $37,423/QALY for 12 weeks of peginterferon and $38,474/QALY for 48 weeks of treatment).

The recent introduction of a 12-week stopping rule (stopping treatment after 12 weeks) has increased its appeal as a first-line treatment for hepatitis B. We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of the 12-week stopping rule for peginterferon in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. METHODS: We used Markov modeling, with data from the Hong Kong population, to compare the cost effectiveness of peginterferon therapy with a 12-week stopping rule vs conventional therapy (48 weeks) and with other antiviral agents. RESULTS: For HBeAg-positive patients, stopping peginterferon therapy after 12 weeks had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), of $9501/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), compared with no treatment, making it the most cost-effective option. Conventional (48-week) peginterferon treatment had a CER of $9664/QALY. For HBeAg-negative patients, entecavir had the lowest CER ($34,310/QALY). Entecavir was more cost effective than either peginterferon strategies (CERs of $37,423/QALY for 12 weeks of peginterferon and $38,474/QALY for 48 weeks of treatment). CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week stopping rule increases the cost effectiveness of peginterferon therapy, and is the most cost-effective treatment for HBeAg-positive patients.

The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in the treatment of these patients in the UK and Spain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Results from the EMPHASIS-HF trial were used to develop a discrete-event simulation model estimating lifetime direct costs and effects (life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained) of the addition of eplerenone to standard care among patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms. Eplerenone plus standard care compared with standard care alone increased lifetime direct costs per patient by pound4284 for the UK and euro7358 for Spain, with additional quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.22 QALYs for the UK and 1.33 QALYs for Spain.

13218,Cost-effectiveness of silicone and alginate impressions for complete dentures,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of silicone and alginate impressions for complete dentures. METHODS: Cost effectiveness analyses were undertaken alongside a UK single centre, double blind, controlled, crossover clinical trial. Taking the perspective of the healthcare sector, effectiveness is measured using the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L) which provides a single index value for health status that may be combined with time to produce quality adjusted life years (QALYs); and Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-EDENT). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios are presented representing the additional cost per one unit gained. RESULTS: Mean cost was higher in the silicone impression group ( pound388.57 vs. pound363.18). Negligible between-group differences were observed in QALY gains; the silicone group had greater mean OHIP-EDENT gains. The additional cost using silicone was pound3.41 per change of one point in the OHIP-EDENT. CONCLUSIONS: The silicone group was more costly, driven by the cost of materials. Changes in the EQ-5D and QALY gains over time and between arms were not statistically significant. Change in OHIP-EDENT score showed greater improvement in the silicone group and the difference between arms was statistically significant. Given negligible QALY gains and low level of resource use, results must be treated with caution. It is difficult to make robust claims about the comparative cost-effectiveness. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Silicone impressions for complete dentures improve patients' quality of life (OHIP-EDENT score). The extra cost of silicone impressions is pound30 per patient. Dentists, patients and health care funders need to consider the clinical and financial value of silicone impressions. Different patients, different dentists, different health funders will have individual perceptions and judgements. ISRCTN01528038. NIHR-RfPB grant PB-PG-0408-16300.

13219,Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in severe persistent asthma in Spain: a real-life perspective,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab compared with routine clinical practice in the treatment and control of severe persistent asthma. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis using pre- and post-treatment with omalizumab after 10 months of 47 patients diagnosed with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma attended by the Pneumology Service, Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria, Malaga. Effectiveness was assessed by the number of emergency room (ER) visits for exacerbations and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. The costs of treatment with omalizumab and ER visits were analyzed using the National Health System perspective. Results are expressed in cost per QALY gained and cost per ER visit avoided (costs euro2012). RESULTS: Exacerbations with ER visits decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after 10 months of omalizumab treatment compared with the previous 10 months [7.94 (6.52-9.37) vs 0.19 (0.03-0.35)]. Health utilities increased significantly (p < 0.001) during the same period [0.5967 (0.5722-0.6212) vs 0.7566 (0.7232-0.7900)], representing 0.1333 (0.1053-0.1612) QALYs gained (p < 0.001).The mean cost per patient was euro1850.78 (1519.46-2182.10) in the 10 months before treatment and euro5431.87 (4930.72-5933.02) after 10 months of omalizumab treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro462.08/exacerbation avoided (347.65-606.22) and euro26 864.89/QALY gained (21 632.07-33 859.49).

13220,Cost-effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the costs of treatment and the duration of survival, adjusted for quality of life, for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with immediate radical cystectomy (RC) or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with intent for subsequent RC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review of our institutional review board-approved database identified patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated at our institution from 2004 to 2011. Patients were divided into those receiving RC alone and those receiving NAC before planned RC. Patients who refused RC following NAC were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. Survival duration was converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs of treatment per QALY were determined. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients (65.4%) received RC alone and 63 (34.6%) received NAC, 38 of whom proceeded to cystectomy as planned. Mean total costs were $42,890 and $52,429 for RC and NAC, respectively (P = 0.005). The 5-year overall survival was 31.7% and 42.5% for the RC-only group and the NAC group, respectively (P = 0.034). The 5-year overall survival measured in QALYs was 21.9% and 42.9% for the RC-only and the NAC groups, respectively (P = 0.021). The increased cost for NAC was $5,840 per additional life year gained (95% CI: $1,772-$9,909) and $6,187 per additional QALY gained (95% CI: $1,877-$10,498). CONCLUSIONS: The use of NAC is associated with a significant increase in quality-adjusted survival. The additional cost per QALY gained is approximately $6,000.

13221,Cost-effectiveness of Community Health Workers in controlling diabetes epidemic on the U.S.-Mexico border,"OBJECTIVES: This study attempted to evaluate clinical outcomes and long-term cost-effectiveness of an intervention involving Community Health Workers (CHW's, a.k.a. promotoras de salud in Spanish) in assisting Mexican-American diabetes type-2 patients with controlling their condition. The intervention has been carried out in Hidalgo County, TX which is situated on the U.S.-Mexico border. STUDY DESIGN: The design of the study is experimental. The sample (n = 30) was recruited from Mexican-American diabetes patients aged 30 or above. The intervention group received monthly visits from CHW's, while the control group did not. METHODS: Incremental lifetime health outcomes and related expenditures were calculated using the CDC Diabetes Cost-Effectiveness Model (DCEM) which is a probabilistic computer simulation model of disease progression and cost-effectiveness for type 2 diabetes patients. The DCEM allows projection of lifetime healthcare costs and Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). RESULTS: The intervention group showed a significant improvement in glycemic control and cholesterol management after two years of intervention. The intervention is expected to reduce long-term complications, resulting in an increase in residual life-years and quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio has been estimated to be $13,810, which is below the level of comparable studies. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention has a substantial impact on the medical costs of type 2 diabetes treatment.

13222,Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of revision fusion for lumbar pseudoarthrosis: defining the value of surgery,"STUDY DESIGN: Single cohort study of patients undergoing revision fusion for lumbar pseudoarthrosis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 2-year comprehensive costs of revision arthrodesis for lumbar pseudoarthrosis at our institution and determine the associated cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in this patient population. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The proportion of lumbar spine operations involving a fusion procedure has increased over the past 2 decades. Similarly, there has been a corresponding increase in the incidence and prevalence of pseudoarthrosis. However, the cost-effectiveness of revision surgery for pseudoarthrosis-associated back pain has yet to be examined. METHODS: Forty-seven patients undergoing revision instrumented arthrodesis for pseudoarthrosis-associated back pain were included. Two-year total back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and health-state values (QALYs, calculated from EuroQuol 5D with US valuation) were assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost) and patient and care-giver work-day losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). The mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after revision surgery was assessed. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) duration of time between prior fusion and development of symptomatic pseudoarthrosis was 2.69+/-3.09 years. None of the patients developed symptomatic pseudoarthrosis after 2 years of revision surgery. A mean cumulative 2-year gain of 0.35 QALYs was reported. The mean (+/-SD) total 2-year cost of revision fusion was $41,631+/-$9691 (surgery cost: $23,865+/-$270; outpatient resource utilization cost: $4885+/-$2301; indirect cost: $12,879+/-$8171). Revision instrumented arthrodesis was associated with a mean 2-year cost per QALY gained of $118,945. CONCLUSIONS: Revision arthrodesis was associated with improved 2-year quality of life in patients with pseudoarthrosis-related back pain. Nevertheless, in our experience revision surgery was shown to be marginally cost-effective at $118,945 per QALY gained.",2014-01-16272,24999554,J Spinal Disord Tech,Owoicho Adogwa,2015,28 / 3,,No,24999554,"Owoicho Adogwa; Scott L Parker; David Shau; Stephen K Mendelhall; Oran Aaronson; Joseph Cheng; Clinton J Devin; Matthew J McGirt; Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of revision fusion for lumbar pseudoarthrosis: defining the value of surgery, J Spinal Disord Tech , 2015 Apr; 28(3):1539-2465",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Revision posterior pedicle screw instrumented fusion procedure vs. None,Not Stated,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,118945,United States,2012,134081.35
13223,Cost-effectiveness of follow-up of pulmonary nodules incidentally detected on cardiac computed tomographic angiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nodules (PNs) are often detected incidentally during coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography, which is increasingly being used to evaluate patients with chest pain symptoms. However, the efficiency of following up on incidentally detected PN is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined demographic and clinical characteristics of stable symptomatic patients referred for coronary CT angiography in whom incidentally detected PNs warranted follow-up. A validated lung cancer simulation model was populated with data from these patients, and clinical and economic consequences of follow-up per Fleischner guidelines versus no follow-up were simulated. Of the 3665 patients referred for coronary CT angiography, 591 (16%) had PNs requiring follow-up. The mean age of patients with PNs was 59+/-10 years; 66% were male; 67% had ever smoked; and 21% had obstructive coronary artery disease. The projected overall lung cancer incidence was 5.8% in these patients, but the majority died of coronary artery disease (38%) and other causes (57%). Follow-up of PNs was associated with a 4.6% relative reduction in cumulative lung cancer mortality (absolute mortality: follow-up, 4.33% versus non-follow-up, 4.54%), more downstream testing (follow-up, 2.34 CTs per patient versus non-follow-up, 1.01 CTs per patient), and an average increase in quality-adjusted life of 7 days. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were $154 700 to follow up the entire cohort and $129 800 per quality-adjusted life-year when only smokers were included. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up of PNs incidentally detected in patients undergoing coronary CT angiography for chest pain evaluation is associated with a small reduction in lung cancer mortality.

13225,Peritoneal dialysis and in-centre haemodialysis: a cost-utility analysis from a UK payer perspective,"BACKGROUND: With limited healthcare resources available, cost-effective provision of dialysis to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is important. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of varying levels of peritoneal dialysis (PD) use versus current practice among incident ESRD patients requiring dialysis. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of increasing uptake of PD to 39 and 50 % versus current practice of 22 % PD from a UK National Health Service perspective for the year of 2013-2014. A scenario with 5 % PD was also considered. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Five- and 10-year discounted total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient for the current scenario (22 % PD) were pound96,307 and 2.104, and pound133,339 and 3.301, respectively. Use of PD in 39 % of patients resulted in 5- and 10-year total per-patient cost savings of pound3,180 and pound4,102 versus current usage alongside total per-patient QALY increases of 0.017 and 0.020. Use of PD in 50 % of patients resulted in 5- and 10-year per-patient cost savings of pound5,238 and pound6,758 versus current usage alongside per-patient QALY increases of 0.029 and 0.033. Thus, increasing use of PD was associated with marginally better outcomes and lower costs. Cost savings were driven by lower treatment costs and reduced transport requirements for PD versus haemodialysis. Reducing PD use was associated with higher costs and a small reduction in QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest increasing PD use among incident dialysis patients would be cost-effective, associated with reduced costs and potential modest improvements in quality of life.",2014-01-16298,25017433,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Catrin Treharne,2014,12 / 4,409-20,Yes,25017433,"Catrin Treharne; Frank Xiaoqing Liu; Murat Arici; Lydia Crowe; Usman Farooqui; Peritoneal dialysis and in-centre haemodialysis: a cost-utility analysis from a UK payer perspective, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 12(4):1179-1896; 409-20",QALY,United Arab Emirates,Not Stated,Not Stated,Peritoneal dialysis (PD) (39% uptake) and in-centre haemodialysis haemodialysis (HD) vs. peritoneal dialysis (PD) (22% uptake),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 10 years",3.50,3.50,-204818.19,United Kingdom,2013,-355925.43

METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques compared with other treatments, principally surgical stripping, in terms of recurrence of varicose veins, Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), pain and quality of life.

RESULTS: The literature search conducted in July 2011 identified 1453 unique citations: 31 RCTs (51 papers) satisfied the criteria for effectiveness review. Differences between treatments were negligible in terms of clinical outcomes, so the treatment with the lowest cost appears to be most cost-effective. Total FS costs were estimated to be lowest, and FS was marginally more effective than surgery. However, relative effectiveness was sensitive to the model time horizon.

13229,Cost-utility analysis of daily versus intermittent inhaled corticosteroids in mild-persistent asthma,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the many benefits that have been demonstrated by the continuous administration of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in persistent asthma, a new strategy for mild-asthma is emerging, consisting of using intermittent or as-needed ICS treatment in conjunction with short-acting beta2 agonists in response to symptoms. However, no previous studies have reported an economic evaluation comparing these two therapeutic strategies. METHODS: A Markov-type model was developed in order to estimate costs and health outcomes of a simulated cohort of pediatric patients with persistent asthma treated over a 12-month period. Effectiveness parameters were obtained from a systematic review of the literature. Cost data were obtained from official databases provided by the Colombian Ministry of Health. The main outcome was the variable ""quality-adjusted life-years"" (QALYs). RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, the model showed that compared to intermittent ICS, daily therapy with ICS had lower costs (US$437.02 vs. 585.03 and US$704.62 vs. 749.81 average cost per patient over 12 months for school children and preschoolers, respectively), and the greatest gain in QALYs (0.9629 vs. 0.9392 QALYs and 0.9238 vs. 0.9130 QALYS for school children and preschoolers, respectively), resulting in daily therapy being considered dominant.

Some jurisdictions have already extended HPV vaccination to school-aged boys. Thus, exploration of the cost-utility of adding boys' vaccination is relevant. We modeled the incremental health gain and costs for extending the current girls-only program to boys, intensifying the current girls-only program to achieve 73% coverage, and extension of the intensive program to boys. METHODS: A Markov macro-simulation model, which accounted for herd immunity, was developed for an annual cohort of 12-year-olds in 2011 and included the future health states of: cervical cancer, pre-cancer (CIN I to III), genital warts, and three other HPV-related cancers. In each state, health sector costs, including additional health costs from extra life, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were accumulated. The model included New Zealand data on cancer incidence and survival, and other cause mortality (all by sex, age, ethnicity and deprivation). RESULTS: At an assumed local willingness-to-pay threshold of US$29,600, vaccination of 12-year-old boys to achieve the current coverage for girls would not be cost-effective, at US$61,400/QALY gained (95% UI $29,700 to $112,000; OECD purchasing power parities) compared to the current girls-only program, with an assumed vaccine cost of US$59 (NZ$113). This was dominated though by the intensified girls-only program; US$17,400/QALY gained (95% UI: dominant to $46,100). Adding boys to this intensified program was also not cost-effective; US$128,000/QALY gained, 95% UI: $61,900 to $247,000).Vaccination of boys was not found to be cost-effective, even for additional scenarios with very low vaccine or program administration costs - only when combined vaccine and administration costs were NZ$125 or lower per dose was vaccination of boys cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adding boys to the girls-only HPV vaccination program in New Zealand is highly unlikely to be cost-effective.

Some jurisdictions have already extended HPV vaccination to school-aged boys. Thus, exploration of the cost-utility of adding boys' vaccination is relevant. We modeled the incremental health gain and costs for extending the current girls-only program to boys, intensifying the current girls-only program to achieve 73% coverage, and extension of the intensive program to boys. METHODS: A Markov macro-simulation model, which accounted for herd immunity, was developed for an annual cohort of 12-year-olds in 2011 and included the future health states of: cervical cancer, pre-cancer (CIN I to III), genital warts, and three other HPV-related cancers. In each state, health sector costs, including additional health costs from extra life, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were accumulated. The model included New Zealand data on cancer incidence and survival, and other cause mortality (all by sex, age, ethnicity and deprivation). RESULTS: At an assumed local willingness-to-pay threshold of US$29,600, vaccination of 12-year-old boys to achieve the current coverage for girls would not be cost-effective, at US$61,400/QALY gained (95% UI $29,700 to $112,000; OECD purchasing power parities) compared to the current girls-only program, with an assumed vaccine cost of US$59 (NZ$113).

13239,Improving adherence to lipid-lowering therapy in a community pharmacy intervention program: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies has been shown to improve adherence to chronic therapies. Long-term impact on clinical outcomes or medical cost savings, however, remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care intervention program in Dutch community pharmacies that improved patients' adherence to lipid-lowering therapy. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed using a time-dependent Markov model from the health care payer perspective. Participants were patients initiating lipid-lowering therapy for primary prevention (40%) or secondary prevention (60%) of cardiovascular events (CVEs). The intervention was the pharmaceutical care program MeMO (Medication Monitoring and Optimisation) in 9 community pharmacies in the Netherlands, based on continuous monitoring and optimization of lipid-lowering therapy in new patients. The follow-up period of the program was 1 year. The main outcome of the intervention program was discontinuation of lipid-lowering therapy. This outcome was extrapolated in the economic model to lifelong costs, quality of life, reductions in cardiovascular events, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Patients in the MeMO program had a lower risk for therapy discontinuation, RR = 0.49 (0.37 to 0.66); the effectiveness was similar in primary and secondary prevention. In a cohort of 1,000 primary and secondary prevention patients, the MeMO program resulted in a reduction of 7 nonfatal strokes, 2 fatal strokes, 16 nonfatal myocardial infarctions (MIs), 7 fatal MIs, and 16 revascularizations over patients' lifetime. Additional medication, disease management, and intervention costs in the MeMO program were euro411,000; the cost savings due to reduced CVEs were euro443,000. The MeMO program resulted in 84 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and net cost savings of euro32,000. Clinical benefits and cost savings were highest in the secondary prevention population. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies can improve statin therapy adherence, resulting in better prevention of CVEs. The MeMO program resulted in considerable clinical benefits and net cost savings.

13242,Cost-effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of alternate treatment strategies using second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for different sequences of treatments for 40-year-old patients with schizophrenia. We considered first-line treatment with one of the four SGAs: olanzapine (OLZ), risperidone (RSP), quetiapine (QTP), and ziprasidone (ZSD). Patients could switch to another of these antipsychotics as second-line therapy, and only clozapine (CLZ) was allowed as third-line treatment. We derived parameter estimates from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study and published sources. RESULTS: The ZSD-QTP strategy (first-line treatment with ZSD, change to QTP if ZSD is discontinued, and switch to CLZ if QTP is discontinued) was most costly while yielding the greatest QALYs, with an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of $542,500 per QALY gained compared with the ZSD-RSP strategy. However, the ZSD-RSP strategy had an ICER of $5,200/QALY gained versus the RSP-ZSD strategy and had the greatest probability of being cost-effective given a willingness-to-pay threshold between $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY. All other treatment strategies were more costly and less effective than another strategy or combination of other strategies. Results varied by different time horizons adopted.

13253,Long-term air humidification therapy is cost-effective for patients with moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the cost-effectiveness of long-term humidification therapy (LTHT) added to usual care for patients with moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis. METHODS: Resource usage in a 12-month clinical trial of LTHT was estimated from hospital records, patient diaries, and the equipment supplier. Health state utility values were derived from the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. All patients who remained in the trial for 12 months and who had at least 90 days of diary records were included (87 of 108). RESULTS: Clinical costs were NZ $3973 (95% confidence interval [CI] $1614-$6332) for the control group and NZ $3331 (95% CI $948-$6920) for the intervention group. The mean health benefit per patient was -6.9 SGRQ units (95% CI -13.0 to -7.2; P < 0.05) or +0.0678 quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI 0.001-0.135). With the intervention costing NZ $2059 annually, the mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year was NZ $20,902 (US $18,907) and the bootstrap median was NZ $19,749 (2.5th percentile -$40,923, 97.5th percentile $221,275). At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of NZ $30,000, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 61%, ranging from 49% to 72% as the cost of LTHT was varied by +/-30%. At a WTP of NZ $20,000, the probability was 49% (range 34%-61%). CONCLUSIONS: LTHT is moderately cost-effective for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis at a WTP threshold that is acceptable for public funding of medicines in New Zealand.

13254,Modelling outcomes of complex treatment strategies following a clinical guideline for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by a sequence of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological response modifiers (BRMs). In most of the Western countries, the drug sequences are determined based on disease activity and treatment history of the patients. A model for realistic patient outcomes should reflect the treatment pathways relevant for patients with specific characteristics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at developing a model that could simulate long-term patient outcomes and cost effectiveness of treatment strategies with and without inclusion of BRMs following a clinical guideline for treatment decisions. METHODS: Discrete event simulation taking into account patient characteristics and treatment history was used for model development. Treatment effect on disease activity, costs, health utilities and times to events were estimated using Dutch observational studies. Long-term progression of physical functioning was quantified using a linear mixed-effects model. Costs and health utilities were estimated using two-part models. The treatment strategy recommended by the Dutch Society for Rheumatology where both DMARDs and BRMs were available (Strategy 2) was compared with the treatment strategy without BRMs (Strategy 1). Ten thousand theoretical patients were tracked individually until death. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 1,000 sets of parameters sampled from appropriate probability distributions. RESULTS: The simulated changes over time in disease activity and physical functioning were plausible. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of Strategy 2 compared with Strategy 1 was <euro>124,011. At a willingness-to-pay threshold higher than <euro>119,167, Strategy 2 dominated Strategy 1 in terms of cost effectiveness but the probability that the Strategy 2 is cost effective never exceeded 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to model the outcomes of complex treatment strategies based on a clinical guideline for the management of RA. Following the Dutch guideline and using real-life data, inclusion of BRMs in the treatment strategy for RA appeared to be less favourable in our model than in most of the existing models that compared drug sequences independent of patient characteristics and used data from randomised controlled clinical trials. Despite complexity and demand for extensive data, our modelling approach can help to identify the knowledge gaps in clinical guidelines for RA management and priorities for future research.",2014-01-16322,24972589,Pharmacoeconomics,An Tran-Duy,2014,32 / 10,1015-28,Yes,24972589,"An Tran-Duy; Annelies Boonen; Wietske Kievit; Piet L C M van Riel; Mart A F J van de Laar; Johan L Severens; Modelling outcomes of complex treatment strategies following a clinical guideline for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 32(10):1179-2027; 1015-28",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Eight synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and two anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and two non-TNF biological response modifiers (BRMs): vs. Eight synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,124011,Euro,2012,179754.95
13255,Edoxaban versus warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, has been found non-inferior to warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), with a lower rate of intracranial bleeding. The aim of our investigation was to assess the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban versus warfarin from the perspective of the Italian health-care system. A Markov decision model was used to evaluate lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life expectancy of NVAF patients treated with warfarin or edoxaban. Transition probabilities were obtained from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, cost estimates were based on Italian prices and tariffs, utilities were obtained from the literature. One-way and second-order sensitivity analyses were performed. In the base case, lifetime costs were euro18,658 for edoxaban and euro14,060 for warfarin. Discounted quality-adjusted survival was 9.022 years for edoxaban and 8.425 years for warfarin, leading to an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro7,713 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results were sensitive to time horizon, time in therapeutic range of warfarin and to the relative impact of warfarin versus edoxaban therapy onto quality of life. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed edoxaban to be cost-effective versus warfarin in 92.3 % of the simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro25,000 per QALY.

13256,Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus vitamin K antagonists for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation: a French payer perspective,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is the main cause of stroke, but the risk can be reduced, usually with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. The RE-LY atrial fibrillation study demonstrated that the rates of stroke and systemic embolism with dabigatran (an oral direct thrombin inhibitor) were similar to or lower than those with warfarin. AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness, from a French payer perspective, of dabigatran (150 or 110mg bid for patients<or>/=80 years, respectively) versus warfarin. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was modeled using a Markov model in a cohort of 10,000 patients with atrial fibrillation followed over their lifetime. Events accounted for included ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, transient ischemic attack, hemorrhage, myocardial infarction and death. The model patient population matched the RE-LY patients. Dabigatran was compared with ""trial-like"" warfarin and ""real-world"" prescribing. Risks of clinical events were obtained from RE-LY. Event and follow-up costs were based on the French national tariff or published literature. Clinical events, QALYs, total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: The ICERs of dabigatran compared with ""trial-like"" warfarin and ""real-world"" prescribing were euro15,838/QALY and euro7473/QALY, respectively.

13257,Cost-utility of reduction mammaplasty assessed for the Brazilian public health system,"BACKGROUND: Economic evaluation is important for making decisions about resource allocation. Few cost-utility or cost-effectiveness studies on breast hypertrophy have been reported in the medical literature. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to determine the cost-utility of reduction mammaplasty in the Brazilian national health care system. METHODS: This randomized controlled study was conducted in a university-affiliated hospital. Sixty patients with breast hypertrophy were enrolled prospectively and were assigned randomly to either the control group (n = 30 patients who received follow-up for 6 months) or the treatment group (n = 30 patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty). Direct costs were recorded, and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was administered to both groups at the beginning of the study (preoperatively for the treatment group) and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Utility was determined with Instrument 6D of the Brazilian version of the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-6D), from the SF-36 data. RESULTS: At the 6-month follow-up, the treatment group showed an improvement in utility, with an average direct cost of approximately pound104. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction mammaplasty performed in the Brazilian national health care system provides a cost-utility ratio equivalent to approximately pound142 per 1 quality-adjusted life year.",2014-01-16325,24973340,Aesthet Surg J,Carlos Delano Mundim Araujo,2014,34 / 8,1198-204,No,24973340,"Carlos Delano Mundim Araujo; Daniela Francescato Veiga; Bernardo Sergio Hochman; Luiz Eduardo Felipe Abla; Ana Carolina Salles Oliveira; Neil Ferreira Novo; Joel Veiga-Filho; Lydia Masako Ferreira; Cost-utility of reduction mammaplasty assessed for the Brazilian public health system, Aesthet Surg J, ; 34(8):1527-330X; 1198-204",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Reduction mammaplasty vs. None,Not Stated,59 Years,18 Years,Female,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,142,United Kingdom,2014,255.9
13258,Twelve-month cost-effectiveness of telephone-delivered collaborative care for treating depression following CABG surgery: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the 12-month cost-effectiveness of a collaborative care (CC) program for treating depression following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery versus physicians' usual care (UC). METHODS: We obtained 12 continuous months of Medicare and private medical insurance claims data on 189 patients who screened positive for depression following CABG surgery, met criteria for depression when reassessed by telephone 2 weeks following hospitalization (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire >/=10) and were randomized to either an 8-month centralized, nurse-provided and telephone-delivered CC intervention for depression or to their physicians' UC. RESULTS: At 12 months following randomization, CC patients had $2068 lower but statistically similar estimated median costs compared to UC (P=.30) and a variety of sensitivity analyses produced no significant changes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CC was -$9889 (-$11,940 to -$7838) per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and there was 90% probability it would be cost-effective at the willingness to pay threshold of $20,000 per additional QALY. A bootstrapped cost-effectiveness plane also demonstrated a 68% probability of CC ""dominating"" UC (more QALYs at lower cost).

13259,Cost effectiveness of tiotropium in patients with asthma poorly controlled on inhaled glucocorticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists,"BACKGROUND: A considerable proportion of patients with asthma remain uncontrolled or symptomatic despite treatment with a high dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs). Tiotropium Respimat((R)) added to usual care improves lung function, asthma control, and the frequency of non-severe and severe exacerbations, in a population of adult asthma patients who are uncontrolled despite treatment with ICS/LABA. OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the cost effectiveness of tiotropium therapy as add-on to usual care in asthma patients that are uncontrolled despite treatment with ICS/LABA combination from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model was developed which considers levels of asthma control and exacerbations. The model analysed cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); sensitivity and scenario analyses were also conducted to test the robustness of the base case outcomes. All costs are given at 2012 prices. RESULTS: The model found that in this category of asthma with unmet need, add-on tiotropium therapy generated an incremental 0.24 QALYs and pound5,238 costs over a lifetime horizon, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound21,906 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis suggested that findings were most dependent on the costs of managing uncontrolled asthma and the cost of treatment with tiotropium. CONCLUSION: In this modelled analysis of two clinical trials, tiotropium was found to be cost effective when added to usual care in patients who remain uncontrolled despite treatment with high-dose ICS/LABA.

13260,Cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy expansion strategies in Vietnam,"This study determines an optimal strategy for scaling up ART in Vietnam by examining three initiation thresholds [350 cells/mm(3), 500 cells/mm(3), and treat all people living with HIV (PLHIV) regardless of CD4 cell counts] and treatment commencement rates among treatment-eligible PLHIV ranging from 5% to 100% within 12 months of diagnosis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using a Markov model, based on data from a cohort of 3449 patients who initiated ART between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009 in 13 outpatient clinics across six provinces in Vietnam. Our analyses indicated that raising treatment eligibility criteria, in line with WHO guidelines (CD4 </=500 cells/mm(3)) or removing CD4-based criteria would both be cost-effective in Vietnam. However, the cost-effective strategy from an economic viewpoint is first to increase coverage substantially among those with lowest CD4 levels, and only when coverage increases towards saturation should initiation criteria be lifted. Universal coverage under current guidelines would cost an additional $85 million and $96 million per year if the treatment threshold was 500 cells/mm(3). These scenarios would avert 15,000 and 22,000 HIV-related deaths in 2010-2019, with ICERs of $500-$660 per QALY gained.

13261,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Qsymia for Weight Loss,"BACKGROUND: Phase 3 clinical trial results reveal that Qsymia is a clinically effective long-term treatment for obesity, but whether this treatment is cost-effective compared to a diet and lifestyle intervention has yet to be explored. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) for health-related quality of life improvements. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Estimates are based on cost and quality of life outcomes from a 56-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial undertaken in 93 health centers in the US. Participants were overweight and obese adults (aged 18-70 years) with a body-mass index of 27-45 kg/m(2) and two or more comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes or pre-diabetes or abdominal obesity). The intervention was diet and lifestyle advice plus the recommended dose of Qsymia (phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg) vs. control, which included diet and lifestyle advice plus placebo. The study was from the payer perspective. Costs included the prescription cost, medication cost offsets and physician appointment costs. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained (QALYs). The main outcome measure was incremental cost per QALY gained of the intervention relative to control. RESULTS: Our base-case model, in which participants take Qsymia for 1 year with benefits linearly decaying over the subsequent 2 years, generates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $48,340 per QALY gained. Using the base-case assumptions, probabilistic sensitivity analyses reveal that the ICER is below $50,000 per QALY in 54 % of simulations. However, results are highly dependent on the extent to which benefits are maintained post medication cessation. If benefits persist for only 1 year post cessation, the ICER increases to $74,480. CONCLUSION: Although base-case results suggest that Qsymia is cost-effective, this result hinges on the time on Qsymia and the extent to which benefits are maintained post medication cessation.

13262,"Population health impact and cost-effectiveness of monitoring inactive chronic hepatitis B and treating eligible patients in Shanghai, China","Inactive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers make up the largest group of hepatitis B virus-infected patients, and China bears the largest total CHB burden of any country. We therefore assessed the population health impact and cost-effectiveness of a strategy of lifelong monitoring for inactive CHB and treatment of eligible patients in Shanghai, China. We used a computer simulation model to project health outcomes among a population cohort of CHB based on age-specific prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and cirrhosis. Using a Markov model we simulated patients' progression through a discrete series of health states, and compared current practice to a monitor and treat (M&T) strategy. We measured lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (both discounted at 3% per year), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and clinical outcomes such as development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We estimated that there are 1.5 million CHB-infected persons in Shanghai. The M&T strategy costs US$20,730 per patient and yields a discounted QALY of 15.45, which represents incremental costs and health benefits of US$275 and 0.10 QALYs compared to current practice, and an ICER of US$2,996 per QALY gained. In the base case, we estimated that the M&T strategy will reduce HCC and CHB-related mortality by only around 1%. If variables such as adherence to monitoring and treatment could be substantially improved the M&T strategy could reduce HCC by 70% and CHB-related mortality by 83%. CONCLUSION: Lifelong monitoring of inactive CHB carriers is cost-effective in Shanghai according to typical benchmarks for value for money, but achieving substantial population-level health gains depends on identifying more CHB-infected cases in the population, and increasing rates of treatment, monitoring, and treatment adherence.",2014-01-16347,24990105,Hepatology,Mehlika Toy,2014,60 / 1,46-55,No,24990105,"Mehlika Toy; Joshua A Salomon; Hao Jiang; Honglian Gui; Hui Wang; Jiangshe Wang; Jan Hendrik Richardus; Qing Xie; Population health impact and cost-effectiveness of monitoring inactive chronic hepatitis B and treating eligible patients in Shanghai, China, Hepatology, ; 60(1):0270-9139; 46-55",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Monitor and treat (M&T) consisting of regular monitoring of inactive cases, twice yearly monitoring of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and (alanine aminotransferase) ALT levels and treatment with entecavir vs. Standard/Usual Care- No monitoring; treatment with entecavir",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2996,United States,2010,3555.96

Both the WHO and the Ministry of Health in Israel prioritize seasonal influenza vaccination primarily on the basis of age and specific co-morbidities. Here we consider whether the targeting of individuals previously infected with pneumonia for influenza vaccination would be a cost-effective addition to the current policy.

13269,"Economic evaluation of a hospital-initiated intervention for smokers with chronic disease, in Ontario, Canada","INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking causes many chronic diseases that are costly and result in frequent hospitalisation. Hospital-initiated smoking cessation interventions increase the likelihood that patients will become smoke-free. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC), an intervention that includes in-hospital counselling, pharmacotherapy and posthospital follow-up, compared to usual care among smokers hospitalised with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), heart failure (HF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We completed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a decision-analytic model to assess smokers hospitalised in Ontario, Canada for AMI, UA, HF, and COPD, their risk of continuing to smoke and the effects of quitting on re-hospitalisation and mortality over a 1-year period. We calculated short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness ratios. Our primary outcome was 1-year cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: From the hospital payer's perspective, delivery of the OMSC can be considered cost effective with 1-year cost per QALY gained of $C1386, and lifetime cost per QALY gained of $C68.

13270,"Economic evaluation of a hospital-initiated intervention for smokers with chronic disease, in Ontario, Canada","INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking causes many chronic diseases that are costly and result in frequent hospitalisation. Hospital-initiated smoking cessation interventions increase the likelihood that patients will become smoke-free. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC), an intervention that includes in-hospital counselling, pharmacotherapy and posthospital follow-up, compared to usual care among smokers hospitalised with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), heart failure (HF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We completed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a decision-analytic model to assess smokers hospitalised in Ontario, Canada for AMI, UA, HF, and COPD, their risk of continuing to smoke and the effects of quitting on re-hospitalisation and mortality over a 1-year period. We calculated short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness ratios. Our primary outcome was 1-year cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: From the hospital payer's perspective, delivery of the OMSC can be considered cost effective with 1-year cost per QALY gained of $C1386, and lifetime cost per QALY gained of $C68.

13274,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin and aspirin in Sweden for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation,"INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the major risk factors for stroke, imposing a substantial burden to the Swedish health care system. Apixaban has demonstrated superiority to warfarin and aspirin in stroke prevention amongst patients with AF in two large randomised clinical trials. The aim of this study was to assess the economic implications of apixaban against warfarin and aspirin in these patients from a Swedish societal perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort model was constructed to characterise the consequences of anticoagulant treatment with regards to thromboembolic and bleeding events, as well as the associated health care costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients with AF treated with apixaban, warfarin or aspirin. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per QALY gained of apixaban relative to warfarin (among patients suitable for warfarin treatment) and aspirin (among patients unsuitable for warfarin treatment) were calculated. Costs (in 2011 SEKs) and QALYs were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: The model estimated the ICER of apixaban versus warfarin amongst patients who are suitable for warfarin therapy to be SEK 33,458/QALY gained and that of apixaban versus aspirin amongst those unsuitable for warfarin therapy to be SEK 41,453/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicate that apixaban is an optimal treatment option compared with warfarin and aspirin, when the willingness-to-pay is above SEK 35,000 and SEK 45,000 per QALY, respectively.

13276,Cost effectiveness of a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in Oman,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RGE) is the leading cause of diarrhea in young children in Oman, incurring substantial healthcare and economic burden. We propose to formally assess the potential cost effectiveness of implementing universal vaccination with a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) on reducing the health care burden and costs associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis (RGE) in Oman METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare two birth cohorts, including children who were administered the RV5 vaccination versus those who were not, in a hypothetical group of 65,500 children followed for their first 5 years of life in Oman. The efficacy of the vaccine in reducing RGE-related hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) and office visits, and days of parental work loss for children receiving the vaccine was based on the results of the Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial (REST). The outcome of interest was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from health care system and societal perspectives. RESULTS: A universal RV5 vaccination program is projected to reduce, hospitalizations, ED visits, outpatient visits and parental work days lost due to rotavirus infections by 89%, 80%, 67% and 74%, respectively. In the absence of RV5 vaccination, RGE-related societal costs are projected to be 2,023,038 Omani Rial (OMR) (5,259,899 United States dollars [USD]), including 1,338,977 OMR (3,481,340 USD) in direct medical costs. However, with the introduction of RV5, direct medical costs are projected to be 216,646 OMR (563,280 USD). Costs per QALY saved would be 1,140 OMR (2,964 USD) from the health care payer perspective. An RV5 vaccination program would be considered cost saving, from the societal perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Universal RV5 vaccination in Oman is likely to significantly reduce the health care burden and costs associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis and may be cost-effective from the payer perspective and cost saving from the societal perspective.",2014-01-16362,24941946,BMC Infect Dis,Salah Thabit Al Awaidy,2014,14 /,334,No,24941946,"Salah Thabit Al Awaidy; Berhanu G Gebremeskel; Idris Al Obeidani; Said Al Baqlani; Wisam Haddadin; Megan A O'Brien; Cost effectiveness of a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in Oman, BMC Infect Dis, ; 14():1471-2334; 334",QALY,Oman,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal vaccination program using pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) vs. None,Not Stated,4 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oman,2012,Not Stated
13277,Real-world cost-effectiveness of cetuximab in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,"Clinical trial EMR 62202-006 demonstrates prolonged median locoregional control (24.4 vs. 14.9 months), progression-free survival (17.1 vs. 12.4 months) and overall survival (49.0 vs. 29.3 months) for patients who receive cetuximab added to the comparator radiotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA SCCHN). In the Netherlands, hospitals receive reimbursement for cetuximab conditional on cost-effectiveness in daily practice. To estimate the real-world incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for radiotherapy + cetuximab over radiotherapy alone in first line treatment of LA SCCHN, a Markov model is constructed with health states ""alive without progression"", ""alive following progression"" and ""death"". Transition probabilities per month are estimated from clinical trial data and retrospectively collected real-world data from two Dutch head and neck cancer treatment centres (2007-2010, n = 141). 5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons are used, without and with discounting (4 % costs, 1.5 % effects) to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Two scenarios explore different assumptions on prognosis of real-world versus trial patients. Adding cetuximab to radiotherapy results in increased costs and health gains in both scenarios and across each of the time horizons. Incremental costs per QALY gained range between <euro>14,624 and <euro>38,543 in the base-case. For a willingness to pay of <euro>80,000 per QALY, the acceptability curves for the different scenarios show probabilities between 0.76 and 0.87 of radiotherapy + cetuximab being cost-effective compared to radiotherapy alone.

METHODS: The IHE Cohort Model of Type 2 Diabetes was used to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes from a societal perspective. Model input data were obtained from two clinical trials, the Swedish National Diabetes Register and the literature. Cost data reflected year 2013 price level. The robustness of results was checked with one-way-sensitivity analysis and probability sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The cost per QALY gained for liraglutide (1.2 mg) compared to SU (glimepiride 4 mg), both as add-on to metformin, ranged from SEK 226,000 to SEK 255,000 in analyzed patient cohorts. The cost per QALY for liraglutide (1.2 mg) vs sitagliptin (100 mg) as second-line treatment was lower, ranging from SEK 149,000 to SEK 161,000. Costs of preventive treatment were driving costs, but there was also a cost offset from reduced costs of complications of approximately 20%. Notable cost differences were found for nephropathy, stroke, and heart failure. The predicted life expectancy with liraglutide increased the cost of net consumption for liraglutide. LIMITATIONS: The analysis was an ex-ante analysis using model input data from clinical trials which may not reflect effectiveness in real-world clinical practice in broader patient populations. This limitation was explored in the sensitivity analysis. The lack of specific data on loss of production due to diabetes complications implied that these costs may be under-estimated. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment strategies with liraglutide 1.2 mg improved the expected quality-of-life and increased costs when compared to SU and to sitagliptin for second-line add-on treatments.

13286,Cost-effectiveness of telecare for people with social care needs: the Whole Systems Demonstrator cluster randomised trial,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: to examine the costs and cost-effectiveness of 'second-generation' telecare, in addition to standard support and care that could include 'first-generation' forms of telecare, compared with standard support and care that could include 'first-generation' forms of telecare. DESIGN AND METHODS: a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial with nested economic evaluation. A total of 2,600 people with social care needs participated in a trial of community-based telecare in three English local authority areas. In the Whole Systems Demonstrator Telecare Questionnaire Study, 550 participants were randomised to intervention and 639 to control. Participants who were offered the telecare intervention received a package of equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, additional to their standard health and social care services. The control group received usual health and social care. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The analyses took a health and social care perspective. RESULTS: cost per additional QALY was pound297,000. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay of pound30,000 per QALY gained was only 16%. Sensitivity analyses combining variations in equipment price and support cost parameters yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of pound161,000 per QALY. IMPLICATIONS: while QALY gain in the intervention group was similar to that for controls, social and health services costs were higher. Second-generation telecare did not appear to be a cost-effective addition to usual care, assuming a commonly accepted willingness to pay for QALYs.

13287,Measuring the population impact of introducing stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in Canada,"BACKGROUND: The Cancer Risk Management Model (CRMM) was used to estimate the health and economic impact of introducing stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Canada. METHODS: The CRMM uses Monte Carlo microsimulation representative of all Canadians. Lung cancer outputs were previously validated internally (Statistics Canada) and externally (Canadian Cancer Registry). We updated costs using the Ontario schedule of fees and benefits or the consumer price index to calculate 2013 Canadian dollars, discounted at a 3% rate. The reference model assumed that for stage I NSCLC, 75% of patients undergo surgery (lobectomy, sublobar resection, or pneumonectomy), 12.5% undergo radiotherapy (RT), and 12.5% undergo best supportive care (BSC). SABR was introduced in 2008 as an alternative to sublobar resection, RT, and BSC at rates reflective of the literature. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated; a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 (all amounts are in Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was used from the health care payer perspective. RESULTS: The total cost for 25,085 new cases of lung cancer in 2013 was calculated to be $608,002,599. Mean upfront costs for the 4,318 stage I cases were $7,646.98 for RT, $8,815.55 for SABR, $12,161.17 for sublobar resection, $16,266.12 for lobectomy, $22,940.59 for pneumonectomy, and $14,582.87 for BSC. SABR dominated (higher QALY, lower cost) RT, sublobar resection, and BSC. RT had lower initial costs than SABR that were offset by subsequent costs associated with recurrence.

13293,Meta- and cost-effectiveness analysis of commercial weight loss strategies,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of clinically proven nonsurgical commercial weight loss strategies for those with BMIs between 25 and 40. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review to identify randomized controlled trials of commercially available weight loss studies of at least 1 year in duration. Using the results of these trials and publicly available cost data, we quantified the incremental cost per kilogram of weight loss and per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We then use probabilistic sensitivity analyses to quantify uncertainty in our results. RESULTS: Based on the literature review, two lifestyle programs (Weight Watchers and Vtrim), one meal replacement program (Jenny Craig), and three pharmaceutical products (Qsymia, Lorcaserin, and Orlistat) were included in the analysis. Average cost per kilogram of weight lost ranged from $155 (95% CI: $110-$218) for Weight Watchers to $546 (95% CI: $390-$736) for Orlistat. The incremental cost per QALY gained for Weight Watchers and Qsymia was $34,630 and $54,130, respectively. All other interventions were prohibitively expensive or inferior in that weight loss could be achieved at a lower cost through one or a combination of the other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that, in the absence of other considerations and at current market prices, Weight Watchers and Qsymia represent the two most cost-effective strategies for nonsurgical weight loss.",2014-01-16393,24962106,Obesity (Silver Spring),Eric A Finkelstein,2014,22 / 9,1942-51,No,24962106,"Eric A Finkelstein; Eliza Kruger; Meta- and cost-effectiveness analysis of commercial weight loss strategies, Obesity (Silver Spring), ; 22(9):1930-7381; 1942-51",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Weight Watchers program- weekly in-person or online group meetings vs. low-cost/low-intensity intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,34630,United States,2013,38473.3
