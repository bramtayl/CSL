1201,Cost-effectiveness of surgery for small abdominal aortic aneurysms on the basis of data from the United Kingdom small aneurysm trial,"PURPOSE: Although the United Kingdom small aneurysm trial reported no survival benefit for early operation in patients with small (4. 0-5.5 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the trial lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful gains in life expectancy, particularly for specific subgroups. We used decision analysis to better characterize the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of early surgery. METHODS: We used a Markov model to assess the marginal cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] saved) of early surgery relative to surveillance for small AAAs, using data from the UK Trial. Subgroup analyses were performed by patient age and AAA diameter. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the effect of elective operative mortality on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In our baseline analysis, early operations provided a small survival advantage (0.14 QALYs) at a small incremental cost of $1510. Thus, despite a small survival benefit, early surgery appeared cost-effective ($10, 800/QALY). The small cost differential resulted from the large proportion of patients who underwent surveillance, who eventually underwent AAA repair, and therefore incurred the cost of the surgical procedures. The survival advantage and cost-effectiveness of early operation increased with lower operative mortality, younger age, and larger AAA diameter. CONCLUSION: Despite the negative conclusions of the UK trial, early surgery may be cost-effective for patients with small AAAs, particularly younger patients (<72 years of age) with larger AAAs (> or = 4.5 cm). Because the gains in life expectancy are relatively small, however, clinical decision making should be strongly guided by patient preferences.",2000-01-02126,10664490,J Vasc Surg,M L Schermerhorn,2000,31 / 2,217-26,No,10664490,"M L Schermerhorn; J D Birkmeyer; D A Gould; J L Cronenwett; Cost-effectiveness of surgery for small abdominal aortic aneurysms on the basis of data from the United Kingdom small aneurysm trial, J Vasc Surg, 2000-Feb; 31(2):0741-5214; 217-26",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early surgical repair vs. Watchful waiting,Not Stated,76 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,1997,Not Stated

1207,The cost-effectiveness of repairing ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms,"BACKGROUND: Although advances in technology have reduced the operative risk of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, the surgical repair of ruptured AAAs is associated with a much poorer prognosis and a higher cost. Accordingly, it has been suggested that patients with predictably high rates of morbidity and mortality from ruptured AAA may not benefit from surgical intervention.Methods and Results: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed with the use of a Markov decision-analytic model to compute long-term survival in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients with ruptured AAAs managed with either a strategy of open surgical repair or no intervention. Probability estimates for the various outcomes were based on a review of the literature. Average costs of (1) the immediate hospitalization ($28,356) and (2) complications resulting from the procedure were based on the average use of resources as reported in the literature and from a hospital's cost accounting system. Our measure of outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. For our base-case analysis, the repair of ruptured AAAs was cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,754. (Society is usually willing to pay for interventions with cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $60,000; for example, the costeffectiveness ratios for coronary artery bypass grafting and dialysis are $9500 and $54,400, respectively.) In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness of repairing ruptured AAAs was influenced only by alterations in the operative mortality. If the operative mortality exceeded 88%, repair of ruptured AAAs was no longer cost-effective. As an independent variable, increasing age had no substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness, although it is reported to be associated with increased operative mortality. It was necessary that the patient's cost of the initial hospitalization for ruptured AAA exceed $195,000 before repairing ruptured AAAs was no longer cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that despite the high cost and poor outcomes, the surgical repair of ruptured AAAs is still cost-effective when compared with no intervention. The cost of repairing ruptured AAAs falls within society's acceptable limits and therefore should not be a consideration in the management of patients with AAAs.",2000-01-02127,10917983,J Vasc Surg,S T Patel,2000,32 / 2,247-57,No,10917983,"S T Patel; P Korn; P B Haser; H L Bush; K C Kent; The cost-effectiveness of repairing ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms, J Vasc Surg, 2000-Aug; 32(2):0741-5214; 247-57",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,surgical repair vs. No intervention,Not Stated,72 Years,72 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,10754,United States,1997,17341.14
1208,Health and economic benefits of increased beta-blocker use following myocardial infarction,"CONTEXT: beta-blockers are underused in patients who have myocardial infarction (MI), despite the proven efficacy of these agents. New evidence indicates that beta-blockers can have benefit in patients with conditions that have been considered relative contraindications. Understanding the consequences of underuse of beta-blockers is important because of the implications for current policy debates over quality-of-care measures and Medicare prescription drug coverage. OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential health and economic impact of increased use of beta-blockers in patients who have had MI. DESIGN AND SETTING: We used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model, a computer-simulation Markov model of CHD in the US population, to estimate the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of increased beta-blocker use from current to target levels among survivors of MI aged 35 to 84 years. Simulations included 1 cohort of MI survivors in 2000 followed up for 20 years and 20 successive annual cohorts of all first-MI survivors in 2000-2020. Mortality and morbidity from CHD were derived from published meta-analyses and recent studies. This analysis used a societal perspective. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevented MIs, CHD mortality, life-years gained, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in 2000-2020. RESULTS: Initiating beta-blocker use for all MI survivors except those with absolute contraindications in 2000 and continuing treatment for 20 years would result in 4300 fewer CHD deaths, 3500 MIs prevented, and 45,000 life-years gained compared with current use. The incremental cost per QALY gained would be $4500. If this increase in beta-blocker use were implemented in all first-MI survivors annually over 20 years, beta-blockers would save $18 million and result in 72,000 fewer CHD deaths, 62,000 MIs prevented, and 447,000 life-years gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy would always be less than $11,000 per QALY gained, even under unfavorable assumptions, and may even be cost saving. Restricting beta-blockers only to ideal patients (those without absolute or relative contraindications) would reduce the epidemiological impact of beta-blocker therapy by about 60%. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulation indicates that increased use of beta-blockers after MI would lead to impressive gains in health and would be potentially cost saving.

1210,Cost-utility analysis of screening intervals for diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"CONTEXT: Annual eye screening for patients with diabetes mellitus is frequently proposed as a measure of quality of care. However, the benefit of annual vs less frequent screening intervals has not been well evaluated, especially for low-risk patients. OBJECTIVE: To examine the marginal cost-effectiveness of various screening intervals for eye disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, stratified by age and level of glycemic control. DESIGN: Markov cost-effectiveness model. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical patients based on the US population of diabetic patients older than 40 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient time spent blind, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs of annual vs less frequent screening compared by age and level of hemoglobin A1c. RESULTS: Retinal screening in patients with type 2 diabetes is an effective intervention; however, the risk reduction varies dramatically by age and level of glycemic control. On average, a high-risk patient who is aged 45 years and has a hemoglobin A1c level of 11% gains 21 days of sight when screened annually as opposed to every third year, while a low-risk patient who is aged 65 years and has a hemoglobin A1c level of 7% gains an average of 3 days of sight. The marginal cost-effectiveness of screening annually vs every other year also varies; patients in the high-risk group cost an additional $40530 per QALY gained, while those in the low-risk group cost an additional $211570 per QALY gained. In the US population, retinal screening annually vs every other year for patients with type 2 diabetes costs $107510 per QALY gained, while screening every other year vs every third year costs $49760 per QALY gained.

1213,Cost-utility analysis of screening intervals for diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"CONTEXT: Annual eye screening for patients with diabetes mellitus is frequently proposed as a measure of quality of care. However, the benefit of annual vs less frequent screening intervals has not been well evaluated, especially for low-risk patients. OBJECTIVE: To examine the marginal cost-effectiveness of various screening intervals for eye disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, stratified by age and level of glycemic control. DESIGN: Markov cost-effectiveness model. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical patients based on the US population of diabetic patients older than 40 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient time spent blind, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs of annual vs less frequent screening compared by age and level of hemoglobin A1c. RESULTS: Retinal screening in patients with type 2 diabetes is an effective intervention; however, the risk reduction varies dramatically by age and level of glycemic control. On average, a high-risk patient who is aged 45 years and has a hemoglobin A1c level of 11% gains 21 days of sight when screened annually as opposed to every third year, while a low-risk patient who is aged 65 years and has a hemoglobin A1c level of 7% gains an average of 3 days of sight. The marginal cost-effectiveness of screening annually vs every other year also varies; patients in the high-risk group cost an additional $40530 per QALY gained, while those in the low-risk group cost an additional $211570 per QALY gained. In the US population, retinal screening annually vs every other year for patients with type 2 diabetes costs $107510 per QALY gained, while screening every other year vs every third year costs $49760 per QALY gained.

1214,Cost-utility analysis of the cochlear implant in children,"CONTEXT: Barriers to the use of cochlear implants in children with profound deafness include device costs, difficulty assessing benefit, and lack of data to compare the implant with other medical interventions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the quality of life and cost consequences for deaf children who receive a cochlear implant. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using preintervention, postintervention, and cross-sectional surveys conducted from July 1998 to May 2000. SETTING: Hearing clinic at a US academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of 78 profoundly deaf children (average age, 7.5 years) who received cochlear implants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct and total cost to society per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using the time-trade-off (TTO), visual analog scale (VAS), and Health Utilities Index-Mark III (HUI), discounting costs and benefits 3% annually. Parents rated their child's health state at the time of the survey and immediately before and 1 year before implantation. RESULTS: Recipients had an average of 1.9 years of implant use. Mean VAS scores increased by 0. 27, from 0.59 before implantation to 0.86 at survey. In a subset of participants, TTO scores increased by 0.22, from 0.75 to 0.97 (n = 40) and HUI scores increased by 0.39, from 0.25 to 0.64 (n = 22). Quality-of-life scores were no different 1 year before and immediately before implantation. Discounted direct costs were $60,228, yielding $9,029 per QALY using the TTO, $7,500 per QALY using the VAS, and $5,197 per QALY using the HUI. Including indirect costs such as reduced educational expenses, the cochlear implant provided a savings of $53,198 per child. CONCLUSIONS: Cochlear implants in profoundly deaf children have a positive effect on quality of life at reasonable direct costs and appear to result in a net savings to society.

1215,A cost-utility analysis of pediatric cochlear implantation,"OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to explore the cost-utility of pediatric cochlear implantation, incorporating savings associated with education into the analysis. METHODS: The costs of pediatric cochlear implantation were based on the full costs levied to purchasers, inclusive of complications and maintenance, by a large pediatric cochlear implant program in the United Kingdom. After implantation, profoundly hearing-impaired children have been found to develop hearing threshold levels equivalent to severely hearing-impaired children who wear hearing aids. An independent study calculated the educational costs for severely hearing-impaired and profoundly hearing-impaired children. From this study, savings in educational costs that would result from enabling the profoundly hearing-impaired to function as severely hearing-impaired were determined. Cost-utility was established conservatively by applying to children the known gains in utility reported by adults with cochlear implants. RESULTS: The discounted costs of creating a pediatric cochlear implant user and of maintaining the child over the first 12 years were 48,757 pound silver($78,011). The discounted difference in education costs associated with a profoundly hearing-impaired child (HL >95 dB) as compared with a severely hearing-impaired child (HL 70-95 dB) over the same period was 26,781 pound silver($42,850). These represent the potential savings in educational costs associated with pediatric cochlear implantation. Assuming implantation at age 4 years, the discounted net average cost of pediatric cochlear implantation over compulsory school years (ages 4-16) was 21,976 pound silver ($35,162). Cochlear implants have been shown to improve the quality of life in adults by 0.23 points per annum (where quality of life is rated on a scale from 0 to 1). Applying this weight to children receiving implantation at age 4 years, and assuming a life expectancy of 74 years, the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain is calculated to be 16.33. The cost per undiscounted QALY gain was estimated to be 1,345.70 pound silver ($2153.12) and per discounted QALY gain to be 10,341 pound silver ($16,545.60). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence, based on conservative assumptions, to support the view that pediatric cochlear implantation is a cost-effective health care intervention in profoundly hearing-impaired young children.",2000-01-02131,10646733,Laryngoscope,C O'Neill,2000,110 / 1,156-60,No,10646733,"C O'Neill; G M O'Donoghue; S M Archbold; C Normand; A cost-utility analysis of pediatric cochlear implantation, Laryngoscope, 2000-Jan; 110(1):0023-852X; 156-60",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cochlear implantation vs. No cochlear implantation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,6.00,10341,United Kingdom,1998,27212.66
1216,Incremental cost effectiveness of laser photocoagulation for subfoveal choroidal neovascularization,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a patient preference-based, incremental cost-effectiveness analysis for laser treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization. DESIGN: Computer-based econometric modeling. METHODS: The cost effectiveness of laser photocoagulation therapy was compared with the natural course of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization. The model applied long-term visual data from previous clinical trials, utility analysis (which reflects patient perceptions of quality of life associated with a health state), decision analysis with Markov modeling, and the economic principles of present value analysis with discounting to account for the time value of money. DATABASE: Data from patients eligible for treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization obtained by researchers in the Macular Photocoagulation Study were used for the analysis. INTERVENTION: Modeled laser therapy for subfoveal choroidal neovasacularization in patients with age-related macular degeneration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY gained) associated with laser therapy. RESULTS: Laser photocoagulation therapy for subfoveal choroidal neovascularization, as compared with no treatment, resulted in a mean gain of 0.257 QALYs per treated patient. Using a yearly discount rate of 3% to account for the time value of money and inflation, the resultant $/QALY gained was $5629. Sensitivity analysis used in the cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in a $/QALY gained of $4974 with no gained discount rate and $11,633 with a yearly discount rate of 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental expense of laser therapy for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization appears to be highly cost effective.

1217,Cost effectiveness analysis of different strategies of management of chronic hepatitis C infection in children,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C virus infection in the pediatric patients is commonly encountered by clinicians, and although interferon-based therapy has been shown to be reasonably effective in children no formal economic analysis of such treatment strategies is available. METHODS: With a Markov cycle tree simulation model, a cost effectiveness analysis was done to compare interferon-based treatment strategies for chronic HCV infection in children with a strategy of no treatment in a cohort of 10-year-old otherwise healthy children. Clinical probabilities used in the model was obtained from available literature, and cost estimates were obtained from two teaching hospitals. Cost per patient, quality-adjusted life years gained in each strategy and incremental cost-effective ratio were the primary outcome measures compared. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis the treatment strategies dominated the strategy of no treatment. A 12-month treatment strategy was better than the 6-month treatment strategy. Combination therapy for 6 months with interferon and ribavirin was at least equally if not more effective than 12-month monotherapy. All treatment strategies decreased the number of patients developing decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and also number of orthotopic liver transplants in the lifetime of the model cohort.

1219,Long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis with interferon-beta may be cost effective,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating disease that can occur in early life, progressing to rapid disability and loss of physical, psychosocial and economic functioning, significantly affecting quality of life. The traditional treatment for MS has been symptomatic, treating acute relapses without affecting the underlying disease. The introduction of interferon-beta (IFN beta) has offered significant clinical benefits by reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disease progression. Although the costs of this treatment are high, the costs to society of caring for a patient disabled by MS are greater, and if IFN beta can delay disease progression in the longer term, the economic impact would be substantial. Previous pharmacoeconomic studies of IFN beta have suggested that benefits can only be achieved at extremely high cost, with reported cost-effectiveness measures of up to 1 million pounds sterling (Pound) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) [1995 values]. However, these studies have considered only the short term benefits of IFN beta treatment: over 2 to 3 years, the impact of treatment on patients' quality of life is relatively small, and cost-utility analyses that do not consider longer term benefits nor include societal costs may be misleading. The model reported here is based on the hypothesis that the delay in disease progression seen in short term clinical trials is likely to continue if treatment is continued. The model also assumes that the delay in disease progression, which represents a reduction in brain atrophy, will result in lasting clinical benefits even if treatment is stopped. These assumptions are strongly supported by clinical trial data and the treatment hypothesis itself. A delay in disease progression will result in a significant improvement in functioning and quality of life, and if the costs associated with increased disability can be postponed, even long term treatment of MS with IFN beta can be shown to be cost effective. Using resource utilisation costs derived from an economic evaluation of MS in the UK, it was possible to calculate the impact of delaying disease progression in terms of both health service and societal costs. An estimate of mean disease progression in patients with MS treated with IFN beta-1a compared with patients who did not receive disease-modifying agents suggested that significant cost savings would be realised after about 12 years' treatment with IFN beta-1a. The application of utility scores to the disease progression curves also facilitated estimates of cost effectiveness, with cost per QALY values ranging from 27,036 Pounds after 2 years' treatment with IFN beta-1a to 37,845 Pounds after 20 years' treatment (1995 values).",2000-01-02135,11010603,Pharmacoeconomics,M Kendrick,2000,18 / 1,45-53,Yes,11010603,"M Kendrick; K I Johnson; Long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis with interferon-beta may be cost effective, Pharmacoeconomics, 2000-Jul; 18(1):1179-2027; 45-53",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuing treatment with interferon beta-1a vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,6.00,6.00,Not Stated,United Kingdom,1995,Not Stated
1220,Cost effectiveness of zanamivir for the treatment of influenza in a high risk population in Australia,"OBJECTIVE: To use data from a clinical trial of zanamivir, a new antiviral drug, to estimate the costs and effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies for a high-risk population in Australia visiting a physician for treatment of influenza or influenza-like illness within 36 hours of symptom onset. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a modelling study using data from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with centres in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Cost data were taken from standard Australian sources. METHODS: Efficacy data from the clinical trial were used to populate a computer model designed to estimate the costs and health outcomes associated with alternative treatments for influenza and influenza-like illness. Only patients who consulted the physician within 36 hours of symptom onset were included in this trial. Cost data were used to translate the clinical data into treatment cost estimates. RESULTS: Treatment with zanamivir for this high risk population results in an incremental cost of $A14.20 per day of symptoms avoided in the base case. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is $A11,715. The results are sensitive to several parameter values, including the influenza-positive rate and the impact of zanamivir on days to alleviate symptoms and hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza is costly for the high risk population who seek physician treatment. Treatment with zanamivir for this population is cost effective based on an $A78,000 per QALY benchmark.

1221,Antiviral therapies for herpes zoster infections. Are they economically justifiable?,"Antiviral treatment of herpes zoster is controversial because of uncertain benefits and relatively high costs. Most studies show that antiviral therapy lessens acute herpes zoster symptoms and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Current clinical recommendations support antiviral treatment of severely symptomatic herpes zoster in all adults, and mild herpes zoster in those 50 or 60 years of age or older. However, it is unclear if these recommended strategies are cost effective. Published studies of herpes zoster costs and the effect of antiviral therapy on costs and quality of life have significant variation in study design and results, as well as many shortcomings in the data. Thus, definitive economic recommendations cannot be made based on the present data. Another approach, which we have used, is to develop a 'reference case' analysis using decision-analysis techniques and the available data to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of antiviral treatment in patients of differing age and herpes zoster severity. In the baseline analysis, parameter values and assumptions were consistently slightly biased against antiviral use. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We assumed that antiviral treatment did not change PHN risk, but decreased PHN duration in patients older than 50 years. PHN risk increased with age and with acute herpes zoster severity as seen in published data. Mild acute herpes zoster was assumed to have a utility value of 0.9 and severe acute herpes zoster a value of 0.7 on a scale where 0 = death and 1 = perfect health.

1231,Prostate cancer staging: should MR imaging be used?--A decision analytic approach,"PURPOSE: To determine the appropriate use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for preoperative staging of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review was performed by using the principles of evidence-based medicine and medical technology assessment. A decision analytic model was used to compare (a) the strategy that radical prostatectomy is performed on the basis of clinical staging with (b) the strategy that extracapsular disease detected at MR imaging contraindicates radical prostatectomy in patients who were considered surgical candidates on the basis of clinical staging. RESULTS: After review of the literature, expert panel opinion did not recommend MR staging. No studies in which therapeutic efficacy was addressed were found. The decision analytic model indicated that the strategy including MR staging decreased costs (MR imaging, $10,568; radical prostatectomy, $11,669) and resulted in almost equal life expectancy (MR imaging, 12.59 years; radical prostatectomy, 12.60 years) and quality-adjusted life-years ([QALYs] MR imaging, 12.53; radical prostatectomy, 12.52). Results of sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the MR strategy was both more effective and less costly if the prior probability of extracapsular disease was at least 39% when considering QALY and 50% when considering unadjusted life expectancy. CONCLUSION: It is not yet conclusively determined whether preoperative MR staging is appropriate, but results of decision analysis suggest that MR staging is cost-effective for men with moderate or high prior probability of extracapsular disease.",2000-01-02139,10796923,Radiology,G J Jager,2000,215 / 2,445-51,No,10796923,"G J Jager; J L Severens; J R Thornbury; J J de La Rosette; S H Ruijs; J O Barentsz; Prostate cancer staging: should MR imaging be used?--A decision analytic approach, Radiology, 2000-May; 215(2):0033-8419; 445-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Magnetic Resonance Imaging vs. Radical prostatectomy performed on the basis of clinical staging,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,1998,Not Stated

1236,Incremental cost-effectiveness of laser therapy for choroidal neovascularization associated with histoplasmosis,"PURPOSE: Laser photocoagulation has been shown in a large clinical trial to be efficacious in reducing the degree of vision loss occurring secondary to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with ocular histoplasmosis. Nevertheless, data are lacking concerning the impact of the therapy on quality of life and its value to stakeholders in health care. Recently, information concerning the utility value of visual states has become available. Accordingly, the authors undertook to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of laser photocoagulation for the treatment of extrafoveal CNV occurring in eyes with ocular histoplasmosis. METHODS: Design--A computer simulation, econometric model is presented to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of laser photocoagulation therapy, as compared with the natural course of the disease, for the treatment of patients with extrafoveal CNV associated with ocular histoplasmosis. The model applies long-term visual data from previous clinical trials, utility analysis (which reflects patient perceptions of quality of life), decision analysis with Markov modeling, and present value analysis with discounting to account for the time value of money. Outcome measure--Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from treatment. RESULTS: Laser photocoagulation therapy for extrafoveal CNV associated with ocular histoplasmosis costs $4167 1999 US dollars (at a 3% discount rate) for each quality-adjusted life-year gained from treatment. Sensitivity analysis shows that changing the discount rate substantially alters the cost-effectiveness, with a value of $1339 at a 0% discount rate and $56,250 at a 10% discount rate.

1237,Cost-effectiveness of fusion with and without instrumentation for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis,"STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness study was performed from the societal perspective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs and benefits of laminectomy alone and laminectomy with concomitant lumbar fusion for patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Costs, probabilities, and utilities were estimated from the literature. Short-term risks considered were perioperative complications, the probability of the fusion healing, and the probability that surgery will relieve symptoms. Long-term risks considered were recurrence of symptoms and reoperation. METHODS: The 10-year costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (reported as dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained) were calculated using a Markov model. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all variables using clinically plausible ranges. RESULTS: Laminectomy with noninstrumented fusion costs $56,500 per quality-adjusted year of life versuslaminectomy without fusion. The cost-effectiveness of laminectomy with noninstrumented fusion was most sensitive to the increase in quality-of-life associated with relief of severe stenosis symptoms. The cost-effectiveness ratio of instrumented fusion compared with noninstrumented fusion was $3,112,800 per quality-adjusted year of life. However, if the proportion of patients experiencing symptom relief after instrumented fusion was 90% as compared with 80% for patients with noninstrumented fusion, then the cost-effectiveness ratio of instrumented fusion compared with noninstrumented fusion would be $82,400 per quality-adjusted year of life. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of laminectomy with noninstrumented fusion compares favorably with other surgical interventions, although it depends greatly on the true effectiveness of these surgeries to alleviatesymptoms and on how patients value the quality-of-life effect of relieving severe stenosis symptoms.

1238,Cost-effectiveness of fusion with and without instrumentation for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis,"STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness study was performed from the societal perspective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs and benefits of laminectomy alone and laminectomy with concomitant lumbar fusion for patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Costs, probabilities, and utilities were estimated from the literature. Short-term risks considered were perioperative complications, the probability of the fusion healing, and the probability that surgery will relieve symptoms. Long-term risks considered were recurrence of symptoms and reoperation. METHODS: The 10-year costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (reported as dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained) were calculated using a Markov model. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all variables using clinically plausible ranges. RESULTS: Laminectomy with noninstrumented fusion costs $56,500 per quality-adjusted year of life versuslaminectomy without fusion. The cost-effectiveness of laminectomy with noninstrumented fusion was most sensitive to the increase in quality-of-life associated with relief of severe stenosis symptoms. The cost-effectiveness ratio of instrumented fusion compared with noninstrumented fusion was $3,112,800 per quality-adjusted year of life.

1239,Cost and outcome of mechanical ventilation for life-threatening stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hospital mortality rates of 50% to 90% have been reported for stroke patients treated with mechanical ventilation. These data have raised serious questions about the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. We sought to determine how often stroke patients are mechanically ventilated, identify predictors of 30-day survival among ventilated patients, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. METHODS: We identified mechanically ventilated patients in a population-based multiethnic cohort of 510 incidence stroke patients who were hospitalized between July 1993 and June 1996. Factors affecting 30-day survival were identified in a multiple logistic regression analysis. We calculated the cost per patient discharged alive, life-year saved, and quality-adjusted life-year saved using a zero-cost, zero-life assumption. RESULTS: Ten percent of patients (n=52) were mechanically ventilated. Thirty-day mortality was 65% overall and did not differ significantly by stroke subtype. Glasgow Coma Scale score on the day of intubation (P:<0.01) and subsequent neurological deterioration (P:=0.02) were identified as predictors of 30-day mortality. The cost (1996 US dollars) of hospitalization per patient discharged alive was $89 400; the cost per year of life saved was $37 600; and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved was $174 200. Functional status of most survivors was poor; at 6 months, half were severely disabled and completely dependent. In a worst-case scenario of quality of life preferences, mechanical ventilation resulted in a net deficit of meaningful survival. CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of mechanically ventilated stroke patients die during their hospitalization, and most survivors are severely disabled. Survival is particularly unlikely if patients are deeply comatose or clinically deteriorate after intubation. In our multiethnic urban population, mechanical ventilation for stroke was relatively cost-effective for extending life but not for preserving quality of life.",2000-01-02143,11022062,Stroke,S A Mayer,2000,31 / 10,2346-53,No,11022062,"S A Mayer; D Copeland; G L Bernardini; B Boden-Albala; L Lennihan; S Kossoff; R L Sacco; Cost and outcome of mechanical ventilation for life-threatening stroke, Stroke, 2000-Oct; 31(10):1524-4628; 2346-53",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mechanical ventilation (MV) vs. No mechanical ventilation (MV),Not Stated,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,174200,United States,1996,287347.84
1240,A model of the health and economic impact of posttransfusion hepatitis C: application to cost-effectiveness analysis of further expansion of HCV screening protocols,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to decide the value of further expansion of the screening protocols for HCV in blood donors. However, such analyses are hampered by imperfect knowledge of the health and economic repercussions of posttransfusion hepatitis C (PTHC). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov model representing the outcomes of patients transfused with HCV-infective blood was used to estimate the health and economic impact of PTHC and to calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio of various HCV screening methods. RESULTS: Median survival for hypothetical patients with PTHC and for controls without hepatitis was 11.25 and 11.75 years, respectively. Overall, 12.3 percent of patients receiving HCV-infective blood will develop chronic hepatitis, 9.3 percent will progress to liver failure, and 9. 25 percent will eventually die of liver disease after a median time of 20.75 years (range, 6-70). Ninety-one percent of the infected blood recipients had no reduction in life expectancy due to PTHC, and the average loss per patient was 0.754 years. The present value of the lifetime health costs incurred by patients with PTHC is $6330 per case. HCV antibody testing increases the patients' life expectancy by 20.4 hours per blood collection tested, and it results in net savings by decreasing the number of patients that will require treatment for liver disease in the future. Adding HCV NAT increases the patients' life expectancy by 0.08 hours per blood collection tested, at a cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,829,611 per QALY gained.

1242,Cost-effectiveness of epoetin and autologous blood donationin reducing allogeneic blood transfusions incoronary artery bypass graft surgery,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery accounts for a substantial portion of all allogeneic units of blood transfused. Drugs and autologous blood donation (ABD) are alternative or adjunctive methods for reducing complications and costs induced by allogeneic blood transfusions. Recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) has the potential to decrease perioperative need for allogeneic blood during CABG, but its high cost calls for a careful economic evaluation before it can be recommended for widespread use. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision tree was used to compare a hypothetical strategy of no epoetin with one in which epoetin was utilized to control blood transfusion needs in CABG; each strategy was tested with and without ABD. The impact of these strategies on both the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs ($US) was calculated. RESULTS: Using epoetin alone and with ABD, respectively, avoided the transfusion of 0.61 and 1.35 units of allogeneic blood per patient and saved 0.000086 and 0.000146 QALYs per patient. This made cost-effectiveness (CE) higher than $7 million and $5 million for each QALY saved, respectively. ABD alone cost more than $1 million per QALY saved. If the risk of bacterial infections following allogeneic transfusions was included in the model, epoetin alone cost $6288 per QALY saved, while ABD, both alone and with epoetin, saved money. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the existing evidence, neither of the blood-saving strategies modeled was a cost-effective means of avoiding the deleterious health effects of perioperative blood transfusions in CABG.

1247,Estimating the benefits of solitary pancreas transplantation in nonuremic patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a theoretical analysis,"BACKGROUND: The goal of early pancreas transplantation in type 1 diabetes mellitus is to achieve euglycemia and thereby prevent the renal, retinal, and vascular complications of this disease. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the conditions and assumptions that would make early solitary pancreas a viable therapeutic option. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare outcomes for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and early overt nephropathy assigned to either standard insulin therapy or solitary pancreas transplantation. Probabilities for development of end stage renal disease (ESRD), blindness, mortality, and direct health care costs were taken from the literature. Utility scores for the relevant health states were determined by the standard gamble method on 16 type 1 diabetic patients suitable for pancreas transplantation. RESULTS: Assuming a baseline graft life expectancy for the pancreas of 10 years, early pancreas transplantation could provide 0.42 more life years and 2.2 more quality adjusted life years (discounted at 3%) to patients above standard insulin therapy. The model was sensitive to estimates of pancreas graft life expectancy (<8 years being inadequate to extend patient life), timing of pancreas transplantation with respect to rate of progression to ESRD, and drug nephrotoxicity rates. The incremental costs (charges) for early pancreas transplantation over standard therapy were estimated to be modestly high (about $56,600/quality adjusted life year for the baseline case). Pancreas transplant costs were also a very sensitive parameter in the cost utility analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The success of early solitary pancreas transplantation may well be at the stage to consider a trial in selected type 1 diabetic patients at risk for renal and retinal disease.",2000-01-02146,11045657,Transplantation,B A Kiberd,2000,70 / 7,1121-7,No,11045657,"B A Kiberd; T Larson; Estimating the benefits of solitary pancreas transplantation in nonuremic patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a theoretical analysis, Transplantation, 2000-Oct-15; 70(7):0041-1337; 1121-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Solitary pancreas transplantation vs. Conventional exogenous insulin therapy,Not Stated,40 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,56553,United States,1995,96040.28
1248,Cost effectiveness of microwave thermotherapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: part II--results,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of transurethral microwave thermotherapy relative to medical therapy (alpha-blocking agents) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for patients with moderate-to-severe benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective for a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old men with moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms. We calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of thermotherapy relative to medical therapy and TURP during 5 years after treatment initiation. Event probabilities were obtained from published reports, a consensus panel, and the Targis System (Urologix) randomized clinical trial. Costs were estimated using the national Medicare reimbursement schedules. Costs are reported in 1999 U.S. dollars. Total thermotherapy procedure costs were estimated at $2629. Quality-of-life and utility estimates were obtained by interviewing 13 patients with moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms. On the basis of their risk attitudes, patients were classified into risk-averse or non-risk-averse groups. The costs and health effects were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: In a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 non-risk-averse patients who were candidates for all three modalities, the 5-year costs were highest for patients undergoing TURP and lowest for those receiving medical therapy ($7334 and $6294, respectively). The thermotherapy group exhibited the highest 5-year utility value (53.52 quality-adjusted life-months). Compared with medical therapy, thermotherapy resulted in an additional 0.23 quality-adjusted life-months, with an incremental cost of $741. This yielded an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of $38,664 for thermotherapy compared with medical therapy. Thermotherapy had a higher utility (difference of 1.71 quality-adjusted life-months) and lower cost (difference of $299) compared with TURP and thus was dominant over TURP. The results were similar for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 risk-averse patients.

On the basis of their risk attitudes, patients were classified into risk-averse or non-risk-averse groups. The costs and health effects were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: In a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 non-risk-averse patients who were candidates for all three modalities, the 5-year costs were highest for patients undergoing TURP and lowest for those receiving medical therapy ($7334 and $6294, respectively). The thermotherapy group exhibited the highest 5-year utility value (53.52 quality-adjusted life-months). Compared with medical therapy, thermotherapy resulted in an additional 0.23 quality-adjusted life-months, with an incremental cost of $741. This yielded an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of $38,664 for thermotherapy compared with medical therapy. Thermotherapy had a higher utility (difference of 1.71 quality-adjusted life-months) and lower cost (difference of $299) compared with TURP and thus was dominant over TURP. The results were similar for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 risk-averse patients.

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective for a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old men with moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms. We calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of thermotherapy relative to medical therapy and TURP during 5 years after treatment initiation. Event probabilities were obtained from published reports, a consensus panel, and the Targis System (Urologix) randomized clinical trial. Costs were estimated using the national Medicare reimbursement schedules. Costs are reported in 1999 U.S. dollars. Total thermotherapy procedure costs were estimated at $2629.

International Hepatitis Interventional Therapy Group,"OBJECTIVE: Initial therapy with ribavirin and interferon alpha-2b results in a higher sustained virological response than interferon alone, but this regimen is expensive. We aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of 24- or 48-wk initial treatment with combination therapy versus interferon alone for patients who have chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: Data from recent randomized clinical trials comparing combination therapy to interferon alone were applied to a previously published computer cohort simulation to project lifelong clinical and economic outcomes. Natural history and economic estimates were based on published literature, expert panel estimates, and actual variable cost and reimbursement data. RESULTS: Using treatment stopping rules, sustained viral negative response rates would be 33.1% and 39.8% for patients receiving 24 versus 48 wk of ribavirin/interferon, compared with 14.3% for 48 wk of interferon alone.

1255,Cost-utility of one-time colonoscopic screening for colorectal cancer at various ages,"OBJECTIVE: One-time colonoscopy has been recommended as a possible colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategy. Because the incidence of colorectal neoplasia increases with age, the effectiveness and cost of this strategy depend on the age at which screening occurs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the age-dependent cost-utility of one-time colonoscopic screening. METHODS: We constructed a computer simulation model of the natural history of colorectal neoplasia. This model was used to compare the cost-utility of no screening and age-based strategies employing one-time colonoscopic screening (age ranges evaluated: 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 yr). RESULTS: We determined that one-time colonoscopic screening in men age <60 yr and in women age <65 yr dominates never screening and screening at older ages. For both sexes, one-time colonoscopic screening between 50 and 54 yr of age is associated with a marginal cost-utility of less than $10,000 per additional quality-adjusted life-year compared to screening between 55 and 60 yr of age. One-time colonoscopic screening between 45 and 49 yr of age is either dominated (women) or associated with a marginal cost-utility of $69,000/per quality-adjusted life-year (men) compared to screening between 50 and 54 yr of age. The marginal cost-utility of one-time colonoscopic screening is relatively insensitive to plausible changes in the cost of colonoscopy, the cost of CRC treatment, the sensitivity of colonoscopy for colorectal neoplasia, the utility values representing the morbidity associated with the CRC-related health states, and the discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: One-time colonoscopic screening between 50 and 54 yr of age is cost-effective compared to no screening and screening at older ages in both men and women.

The marginal cost-utility of one-time colonoscopic screening is relatively insensitive to plausible changes in the cost of colonoscopy, the cost of CRC treatment, the sensitivity of colonoscopy for colorectal neoplasia, the utility values representing the morbidity associated with the CRC-related health states, and the discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: One-time colonoscopic screening between 50 and 54 yr of age is cost-effective compared to no screening and screening at older ages in both men and women.

1261,Cost-utility of one-time colonoscopic screening for colorectal cancer at various ages,"OBJECTIVE: One-time colonoscopy has been recommended as a possible colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategy. Because the incidence of colorectal neoplasia increases with age, the effectiveness and cost of this strategy depend on the age at which screening occurs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the age-dependent cost-utility of one-time colonoscopic screening. METHODS: We constructed a computer simulation model of the natural history of colorectal neoplasia. This model was used to compare the cost-utility of no screening and age-based strategies employing one-time colonoscopic screening (age ranges evaluated: 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 yr). RESULTS: We determined that one-time colonoscopic screening in men age <60 yr and in women age <65 yr dominates never screening and screening at older ages. For both sexes, one-time colonoscopic screening between 50 and 54 yr of age is associated with a marginal cost-utility of less than $10,000 per additional quality-adjusted life-year compared to screening between 55 and 60 yr of age.

1263,Cost effectiveness of ribavirin/interferon alfa-2b after interferon relapse in chronic hepatitis C,"PURPOSE: Many patients with chronic hepatitis C who are treated with interferon suffer a relapse after an initial response. About half of these patients have a sustained virological response to retreatment with the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of retreatment with combination therapy versus interferon alone for patients who have previously relapsed after interferon. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data from a randomized trial among 345 relapsed patients that compared combination therapy with interferon alone were used to project lifelong clinical and economic outcomes. Natural history and economic estimates (discounted at 3% per year) were based upon published literature, expert panel estimates, and cost and reimbursement data. RESULTS: Compared with retreatment with interferon alone, combination therapy should prolong life expectancy by about 2 discounted quality-adjusted life years (3 life years, undiscounted) while increasing costs modestly. The results were robust, maintaining an advantage to combination therapy in sensitivity analysis for all subgroups and with reasonable variations in all model parameters. CONCLUSION: For patients with chronic hepatitis C who relapse after an initial response to interferon alone, retreatment with the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b should prolong life and be cost effective.",2000-01-02150,10759092,Am J Med,J B Wong,2000,108 / 5,366-73,No,10759092,"J B Wong; G L Davis; S G Pauker; Cost effectiveness of ribavirin/interferon alfa-2b after interferon relapse in chronic hepatitis C, Am J Med, 2000-Apr-01; 108(5):0002-9343; 366-73",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Six months treatment with combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b vs. Treatment with combination of interferon and placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,140,United States,1995,237.75
1264,Cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal cancer in human immunodeficiency virus-negative homosexual and bisexual men,"PURPOSE: Homosexual and bisexual men are at an increased risk for human papillomavirus-induced squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer of the anus. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in these high-risk patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate alternative screening strategies using anal cytology in a hypothetical cohort of homosexual and bisexual men. Data were obtained from prospective cohort studies, national databases, Medicare reimbursement rates, and the published literature. Model outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, total lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The undiscounted life expectancy gain associated with anal cytology screening every 3 years was 5.5 months.

1268,The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of high-dose palliative radiotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: To compute cost-effectiveness/cost-utility (CE/CU) ratios, from the treatment clinic and societal perspectives, for high-dose palliative radiotherapy treatment (RT) for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) against best supportive care (BSC) as comparator, and thereby demonstrate a method for computing CE/CU ratios when randomized clinical trial (RCT) data cannot be generated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Unit cost estimates based on an earlier reported 1989-90 analysis of treatment costs at the Vancouver Island Cancer Centre, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, are updated to 1997-1998 and then used to compute the incremental cost of an average dose of high-dose palliative RT. The incremental number of life days and quality-adjusted life days (QALDs) attributable to treatment are from earlier reported regression analyses of the survival and quality-of-life data from patients who enrolled prospectively in a lung cancer management cost-effectiveness study at the clinic over a 2-year period from 1990 to 1992. RESULTS: The baseline CE and CU ratios are $9245 Cdn per life year (LY) and $12,836 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively, from the clinic perspective; and $12,253/LY and $17,012/QALY, respectively, from the societal perspective. Multivariate sensitivity analysis for the CE ratio produces a range of $5513-28,270/LY from the clinic perspective, and $7307-37,465/LY from the societal perspective. Similar calculations for the CU ratio produce a range of $7205-37, 134/QALY from the clinic perspective, and $9550-49,213/QALY from the societal perspective.

1270,A cost-outcome analysis of adjuvant postmastectomy locoregional radiotherapy in premenopausal node-positive breast cancer patients,"PURPOSE: To calculate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios for adjuvant postmastectomy locoregional radiotherapy in premenopausal node-positive breast cancer patients and to place these ratios in the context of generally accepted medical expenditures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A spreadsheet-based activity costing model using 1997 Canadian (cdn) capital, operating, and administrative costs has been used to identify, from the institutional perspective, the incremental cost of adding radiotherapy to surgery and chemotherapy for this group of patients. Outcome data were derived from two recently published clinical trials and were converted to discounted incremental life years and quality-adjusted life years gained. Recommended health economics principles were employed in the quantification of both costs and outcomes, and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Three referenced publications provide a context within which to evaluate the calculated cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. RESULTS: The incremental cost of adjuvant radiotherapy for this group of patients is calculated to be approximately $7,000cdn in 1997 Canadian dollars and in the Canadian socialized health-care environment. Based on published work the discounted incremental outcome benefit is calculated to be 0.5 life years or 0.45 quality-adjusted life years at ten years. Thus, cost effectiveness and cost-utility ratios are estimated to be $14,000cdn and $15,600cdn, respectively.

1271,Cost-utility analysis of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"OBJECTIVES: Interferon beta-1b has recently become available for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). This study aims at estimating the cost-effectiveness of this new treatment that has been shown in a clinical trial to reduce the progression of the disease. Effectiveness is measured as the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from the reduction in progression. Because the clinical trial period will only capture part of the treatment's effect in terms of QALYs gained, since benefits achieved during the trial will have an effect beyond it, the cost-effectiveness analysis involves modeling over the longer term using complementary data. METHODS: A Markov model with states based on disability expressed by EDSS scores was used. Transition probabilities were calculated directly from clinical trial data for the first 3 years and then extrapolated to 10 years. Mean costs and utilities for each Markov state were calculated from a population-based cross-sectional study in Sweden. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY is SEK 342,700 (US $39,250; US $1 = SEK 8.73, March 10, 2000) when all costs (direct, informal care, and indirect) are included (discounted 3%). When indirect costs are excluded, the cost per QALY is SEK 542,000 ($62,100). CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis in SPMS requires that the effect of treatment beyond clinical trials be included. Also, analysis should be done from a societal perspective, since many of the costs occur outside the healthcare system. The cost-utility ratios estimated in this analysis are at or below the mean threshold value indicated in a recent survey of health economists ($60,000).",2000-01-02154,11028132,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,G Kobelt,2000,16 / 3,768-80,No,11028132,"G Kobelt; L Jönsson; F Henriksson; S Fredrikson; B Jönsson; Cost-utility analysis of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2000; 16(3):0266-4623; 768-80",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon beta-1b vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,39250,United States,1998,62321.05
1272,Pamidronate in prevention of bone complications in metastatic breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: Pamidronate is effective in reducing bony complications in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have known osteolytic lesions. However, pamidronate does not increase survival and is associated with additional financial costs and inconvenience. We conducted a post-hoc evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of pamidronate using the results of two randomized trials that evaluated pamidronate 90 mg administered intravenously every month versus placebo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trials differed only in the initial systemic therapy administered (hormonal or chemotherapy). Total skeletal related events (SREs), including surgery for pathologic fracture, radiation for fracture or pain control, conservatively treated pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia, were taken directly from the trials. Using a societal perspective, direct health care costs were assigned to each SRE. Each group's monthly survival was equal and was projected to decline using observed median survivals. The cost of pamidronate reflected the average wholesale price of the drug plus infusion. The value or disutility of an adverse event per month was evaluated using a zero value (events avoided) or an assigned one (range, 0.2 to 0.8). RESULTS: The cost of pamidronate therapy exceeded the cost savings from prevented adverse events.

1273,Pamidronate in prevention of bone complications in metastatic breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: Pamidronate is effective in reducing bony complications in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have known osteolytic lesions. However, pamidronate does not increase survival and is associated with additional financial costs and inconvenience. We conducted a post-hoc evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of pamidronate using the results of two randomized trials that evaluated pamidronate 90 mg administered intravenously every month versus placebo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trials differed only in the initial systemic therapy administered (hormonal or chemotherapy). Total skeletal related events (SREs), including surgery for pathologic fracture, radiation for fracture or pain control, conservatively treated pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia, were taken directly from the trials. Using a societal perspective, direct health care costs were assigned to each SRE. Each group's monthly survival was equal and was projected to decline using observed median survivals. The cost of pamidronate reflected the average wholesale price of the drug plus infusion. The value or disutility of an adverse event per month was evaluated using a zero value (events avoided) or an assigned one (range, 0.2 to 0.8). RESULTS: The cost of pamidronate therapy exceeded the cost savings from prevented adverse events. The difference between the treated and placebo groups was larger with hormonal systemic therapy than with chemotherapy (additional $7,685 compared with $3,968 per woman). The projected net cost per SRE avoided was $3,940 with chemotherapy and $9,390 with hormonal therapy.

1274,Cost-effectiveness of adding an electron-beam boost to tangential radiation therapy in patients with negative margins after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer,"PURPOSE: Electron-beam boosts (EBB) are routinely added after conservative surgery and tangential radiation therapy (TRT) for early-stage breast cancer. We performed an incremental cost-utility analysis to evaluate their cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A Markov model examined the impact of adding an EBB to TRT from a societal perspective. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). On the basis of the Lyon trial, the EBB was assumed to reduce local recurrences by approximately 2% at 10 years but to have no impact on survival. Patients' utilities were used to adjust for quality of life. Given the small absolute benefit of the EBB, baseline utilities were assumed to be the same with or without it, an assumption evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. Direct medical, time, and travel costs were considered. RESULTS: Adding the EBB led to an additional cost of $2,008, an increase of 0.0065 QALYs and, therefore, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of over $300,000/QALY. In a sensitivity analysis, the ratio was moderately sensitive to the efficacy and cost of the EBB and highly sensitive to patients' utilities for treatment without it. Even if patients do value a small risk reduction, the mean cost-effectiveness ratio estimated by the Monte Carlo simulation remains high, at $70,859/QALY (95% confidence interval, $53,141 to $105,182/QALY). CONCLUSION: On the basis of currently available data, the cost-effectiveness ratio for the EBB is well above the commonly cited threshold for cost-effective care ($50,000/QALY). The EBB becomes cost-effective only if patients place an unexpectedly high value on the small absolute reduction in local recurrences achievable with it.",2000-01-02156,10637242,J Clin Oncol,J A Hayman,2000,18 / 2,287-95,No,10637242,"J A Hayman; B E Hillner; J R Harris; L J Pierce; J C Weeks; Cost-effectiveness of adding an electron-beam boost to tangential radiation therapy in patients with negative margins after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer, J Clin Oncol, 2000-Jan; 18(2):0732-183X; 287-95",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tangenital radiation vs. Treatment without electron-beam boost,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,308923,United States,1995,524623.82
1275,Mammography screening for older women with and without cognitive impairment,"No upper age limit exists for Medicare benefits for mammography screening, but benefits for women older than age 75 remain unclear. From a clinical perspective, it would be useful to know if there is an upper age limit for women beyond which screening for breast cancer will not extend life. Using a decision-analysis model, the author examined the utility of screening using cohorts of women age 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 and older, with and without cognitive impairment. The analysis evaluated different scenarios of the benefit of biennial screening versus no screening for women who had no prior screening and women who had participated in a regular screening program. Screening increased Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) at all ages. Marginal savings in life expectancy adjusted for quality of life for women with no prior screening ranged from 43.5 days for healthy 75 to 79-year-old women to 25.9 days for women older than age 85. Among cognitively impaired women who were never screened, savings ranged from 20 to 5.5 days for the three age cohorts. Biennial screening among women who had been screened continuously resulted in substantially smaller life expectancy savings, from 3.3 days for healthy individuals age 75 to 79 to less than 1 day for women older than age 85. Cost effectiveness analysis indicated the reduction in costs associated with managing recurrent disease gained by early diagnosis with mammography was greatest among the population with no prior screening. Although the increase in QALYs was consistently lower for cognitively impaired women than for their healthy counterparts, the presence of cognitive impairment did not alter the finding that screening increased QALYs.",2000-01-02157,11272962,J Gerontol Nurs,D C Messecar,2000,26 / 4,14-24; quiz 52-3,No,11272962,"D C Messecar; Mammography screening for older women with and without cognitive impairment, J Gerontol Nurs, 2000-Apr; 26(4):0098-9134; 14-24; quiz 52-3",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mammogram every 2 years vs. No screen,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,1989,Not Stated
1276,Cost-effectiveness of androgen suppression therapies in advanced prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: The costs and side effects of several antiandrogen therapies for advanced prostate cancer differ substantially. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of antiandrogen therapies for advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model based on a formal meta-analysis and literature review. The base case was assumed to be a 65-year-old man with a clinically evident, local recurrence of prostate cancer. The model used a societal perspective and a time horizon of 20 years. Six androgen suppression strategies were evaluated: diethylstilbestrol (DES), orchiectomy, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA), a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, and combinations of an NSAA with an LHRH agonist or orchiectomy. Outcome measures were survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: DES, the least expensive therapy, had a discounted lifetime cost of $3600 and the lowest quality-adjusted survival, 4.6 QALYs. At a cost of $7000, orchiectomy was associated with 5.1 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $7500/QALY relative to DES. All other strategies-LHRH agonists, NSAA, and both combined androgen blockade strategies-had higher costs and lower quality-adjusted survival than orchiectomy. These results were sensitive to the quality of life associated with orchiectomy and the efficacy of combined androgen blockade, and they changed little when prostate-specific antigen results were used to guide therapy. Under a wide range of other assumptions, the cost-effectiveness of orchiectomy relative to DES was consistently less than $20 000/QALY. Androgen suppression therapies were most cost-effective if initiated after patients became symptomatic from prostate metastases. CONCLUSIONS: For men who accept it, orchiectomy is likely to be the most cost-effective androgen suppression strategy.

1281,Decision framework for chemotherapeutic interventions for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Best supportive care has long been considered to be the standard therapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There is now evidence from randomized trials that a number of chemotherapy regimens can palliate cancer-related symptoms and modestly improve survival. We show how cost-effectiveness analyses can be used to make choices between different (ambulatory) chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: Clinical algorithms describing the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of metastatic NSCLC were incorporated into Statistics Canada's Population Health Model. Using consistent methodology, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of several chemotherapeutic interventions: a combination of vindesine (VDS) plus cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16) plus cisplatin, vinblastine (VLB) plus cisplatin, vinorelbine (Navelbine; NVB) plus cisplatin, paclitaxel (Taxol) plus cisplatin, and gemcitabine (GEM) and NVB alone. We calculated the total chemotherapy costs in 1995 Canadian dollars, the cost per case, the average life-years saved, and the cost per life-year saved. Using the Population Health Model, we then constructed an advanced decision framework that rank-ordered the various treatment regimens so as to optimize benefit below various cost-effectiveness thresholds. RESULTS: One regimen (VLB plus cisplatin) appears to result in better survival and lower health care expenditures than best supportive care. By use of cost-effectiveness thresholds of $25,000 and $50,000 per life-year gained, NVB plus cisplatin is the preferred regimen. When quality of life is considered, however, GEM is preferred to NVB plus cisplatin at a threshold value of $50,000. At thresholds of $75 000 and $100,000, paclitaxel plus cisplatin at a dose of 135 mg/m(2) is the preferred regimen. At thresholds of $50,000 and above, best supportive care is the least preferred regimen. CONCLUSIONS: This decision framework allows the comparison of different treatment regimens based on various cost-effectiveness thresholds. Our analysis also supports the use of chemotherapy regimens and the abandonment of best supportive care as the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC.

1284,Decision framework for chemotherapeutic interventions for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Best supportive care has long been considered to be the standard therapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There is now evidence from randomized trials that a number of chemotherapy regimens can palliate cancer-related symptoms and modestly improve survival. We show how cost-effectiveness analyses can be used to make choices between different (ambulatory) chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: Clinical algorithms describing the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of metastatic NSCLC were incorporated into Statistics Canada's Population Health Model. Using consistent methodology, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of several chemotherapeutic interventions: a combination of vindesine (VDS) plus cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16) plus cisplatin, vinblastine (VLB) plus cisplatin, vinorelbine (Navelbine; NVB) plus cisplatin, paclitaxel (Taxol) plus cisplatin, and gemcitabine (GEM) and NVB alone. We calculated the total chemotherapy costs in 1995 Canadian dollars, the cost per case, the average life-years saved, and the cost per life-year saved. Using the Population Health Model, we then constructed an advanced decision framework that rank-ordered the various treatment regimens so as to optimize benefit below various cost-effectiveness thresholds. RESULTS: One regimen (VLB plus cisplatin) appears to result in better survival and lower health care expenditures than best supportive care. By use of cost-effectiveness thresholds of $25,000 and $50,000 per life-year gained, NVB plus cisplatin is the preferred regimen. When quality of life is considered, however, GEM is preferred to NVB plus cisplatin at a threshold value of $50,000. At thresholds of $75 000 and $100,000, paclitaxel plus cisplatin at a dose of 135 mg/m(2) is the preferred regimen. At thresholds of $50,000 and above, best supportive care is the least preferred regimen. CONCLUSIONS: This decision framework allows the comparison of different treatment regimens based on various cost-effectiveness thresholds. Our analysis also supports the use of chemotherapy regimens and the abandonment of best supportive care as the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC.

METHODS: Clinical algorithms describing the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of metastatic NSCLC were incorporated into Statistics Canada's Population Health Model. Using consistent methodology, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of several chemotherapeutic interventions: a combination of vindesine (VDS) plus cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16) plus cisplatin, vinblastine (VLB) plus cisplatin, vinorelbine (Navelbine; NVB) plus cisplatin, paclitaxel (Taxol) plus cisplatin, and gemcitabine (GEM) and NVB alone. We calculated the total chemotherapy costs in 1995 Canadian dollars, the cost per case, the average life-years saved, and the cost per life-year saved. Using the Population Health Model, we then constructed an advanced decision framework that rank-ordered the various treatment regimens so as to optimize benefit below various cost-effectiveness thresholds. RESULTS: One regimen (VLB plus cisplatin) appears to result in better survival and lower health care expenditures than best supportive care. By use of cost-effectiveness thresholds of $25,000 and $50,000 per life-year gained, NVB plus cisplatin is the preferred regimen. When quality of life is considered, however, GEM is preferred to NVB plus cisplatin at a threshold value of $50,000. At thresholds of $75 000 and $100,000, paclitaxel plus cisplatin at a dose of 135 mg/m(2) is the preferred regimen. At thresholds of $50,000 and above, best supportive care is the least preferred regimen. CONCLUSIONS: This decision framework allows the comparison of different treatment regimens based on various cost-effectiveness thresholds. Our analysis also supports the use of chemotherapy regimens and the abandonment of best supportive care as the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC.
