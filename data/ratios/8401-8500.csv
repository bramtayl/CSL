Time horizon was lifetime, LCIG treatment was assumed to last maximal 5 years after which patients revert to SC. Model comprised 12 aPD health states according to H&Y status and daily time spent in OFF state. Cost analyses are reported from a UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. Uncertainties were assessed through one-way sensitivity analyses. COMPARATORS: LCIG, providing patients with continuous dopaminergic stimulation to maximise functional ON time during the day and SC, defined as medically determined best available oral medication.Cost-effectiveness, based on quality adjusted life years gained, presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Lifetime analysis yields an incremental cost per QALY of ?36,024 for LCIG compared to SC (incremental cost ?39,644, QALY gain 1.1). Results were sensitive to time on treatment, health state on treatment initiation, and estimates of long term benefit (OWSA results from ?32,127 to ?66,421 per QALY). Findings must be considered in the context of the study limitations which were mainly due to data availability constraints.LCIG is an effective treatment, reducing OFF time and improving quality of life in advanced PD. It provides value for money in levodopa-responsive aPD patients with severe motor fluctuations when no other treatment options are effective or suitable. Given LCIG is an orphan drug, it is reasonable to suggest that it may be considered cost-effective in the UK setting.

8433,Cost effectiveness of ulcerative colitis treatment in Germany: a comparison of two oral formulations of mesalazine,"The treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) can place a substantial financial burden on healthcare systems. The anti-inflammatory compound 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; mesalazine) is the recommended first-line treatment for patients with UC. In this analysis, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of two oral formulations of 5-ASA (Mezavant? and Asacol?) is examined in the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate, active UC in Germany.A Markov cohort model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of Mezavant compared with Asacol over a 5-year period in the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). Drug pricing details for 2009 were applied throughout the model, and overall resource use was determined and also fitted to 2009 from published results of a large cross sectional study of German SHI patients. Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was the primary endpoint for this study. Remission rates were obtained using data from a randomised, phase III trial of Mezavant with an active Asacol reference arm and a long-term, open label, safety and tolerability trial of Mezavant. Uncertainty in the study model was assessed using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses applying a Monte Carlo simulation.Over a 5-year period, healthcare costs for patients receiving Mezavant were 624 Euro lower than for patients receiving Asacol. Additionally, patients receiving Mezavant gained 0.011 QALYs or 18 more days in remission compared with Asacol. One-way sensitivity analyses suggest that these results are driven by both differences in the acquisition cost between mesalazine formulations and differences in treatment efficacy. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses suggest a probability of 76% for cost savings and higher QALYs with Mezavant compared with Asacol. If adherence and its influence on the remission rates and the risk of developing colorectal cancer were included in the model, the results might have even been more favorable to Mezavant due to its once daily dosing regimen.This model suggests that patients treated with Mezavant may achieve increased time in remission and higher QALYs, with lower direct costs to the SHI when compared with Asacol.

8444,Cost-effectiveness of etanercept treatment in early active rheumatoid arthritis followed by dose adjustment,"To explore the cost-effectiveness of early biologic treatment, followed by dose-reduction in the case of remission, of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), compared with standard treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in Sweden.Effectiveness (function, disease activity, erosions) in early RA for both alternatives was taken from a clinical trial comparing etanercept (ETA) combined with MTX to MTX alone. Patients discontinuing treatment can switch to another or their first biologic treatment. For patients in remission (Disease Activity Score [DAS28] < 2.6), ETA is reduced to half the dose. Return to full dose occurs when DAS28 reaches = 3.2 again. Costs and utilities by level of functional capacity from an observational study are used. The model is analyzed as a micro-simulation and results are presented from the societal perspective for Sweden, for 10 years; costs (?2008) and effects are discounted at 3 percent. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the perspective, the time horizon, switching, and dose-reduction.The main analysis conservatively assumes 50 percent switching at discontinuation. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with early ETA/MTX treatment is ?13,500 (societal perspective, incremental cost of ?15,500 and incremental QALYs of 1.15). With 75 percent switching, the cost per QALY gained was ?10,400. Over 20 years, the cost per QALY gained was ?8,200. Results were further sensitive to the time patients remained on half dose and the perspective.

8445,Favourable cost-benefit in an early defibrillation programme using dual dispatch of ambulance and fire services in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"AIMS: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is fatal without treatment, and time to defibrillation is an extremely important factor in relation to survival. We performed a cost-benefit analysis of dual dispatch defibrillation by ambulance and fire services in the County of Stockholm, Sweden. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of dual dispatch defibrillation. The increased survival rates were estimated from a real-world implemented intervention, and the monetary value of a life (<euro> 2.2 million) was applied to this benefit by using results from a recent stated-preference study. The estimated costs include defibrillators (including expendables/maintenance), training, hospitalisation/health care, fire service call-outs, overhead resources and the dispatch centre. The estimated number of additional saved lives was 16 per year, yielding a benefit-cost ratio of 36. The cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was estimated to be <euro> 13,000, and the cost per saved life was <euro> 60,000. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention of dual dispatch defibrillation by ambulance and fire services in the County of Stockholm had positive economic effects. For the cost-benefit analysis, the return on investment was high and the cost-effectiveness showed levels below the threshold value for economic efficiency used in Sweden.

8446,Cost-effectiveness of risk stratification for preventing type 2 diabetes using a multi-marker diabetes risk score,"Personalized medicine requires diagnostic tests that stratify patients into distinct groups that may differentially benefit from targeted treatment approaches. This study compared the costs and benefits of two approaches for identifying those at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes for entry into a diabetes prevention program. The first approach identified high risk patients using impaired fasting glucose (IFG). The second approach used the PreDx Diabetes Risk Score (DRS) to further stratify IFG patients into high-risk and moderate-risk groups.A Markov model was developed to simulate the incidence and disease progression of diabetes and consequent costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY), comparing alternative approaches for identifying high-risk patients. We modeled direct medical costs, including the costs of the stratification testing, over a 10-year time horizon from a US payer perspective.Stratification of IFG patients by the DRS method leads to improved identification and prevention among those at highest risk. At 5 years, the number needed to treat (NNT) in the IFG-only approach was 39 patients to prevent one case of diabetes compared to an NNT of 15 in the IFG?+?DRS approach. When compared to IFG alone, the IFG?+?DRS approach results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $17,100/QALY gained at 5 years and would become cost saving in 10 years.

Men are often advised to do pelvic-floor exercises, but evidence to support this is inconclusive. Our aim was to establish if formal one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training reduces incontinence.We undertook two randomised trials in men in the UK who were incontinent 6 weeks after radical prostatectomy (trial 1) or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP; trial 2) to compare four sessions with a therapist over 3 months with standard care and lifestyle advice only. Randomisation was by remote computer allocation. Our primary endpoints, collected via postal questionnaires, were participants' reports of urinary incontinence and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) after 12 months. Group assignment was masked from outcome assessors, but this masking was not possible for participants or caregivers. We used intention-to-treat analyses to compare the primary outcome at 12 months. This study is registered, number ISRCTN87696430.In the intervention group in trial 1, the rate of urinary incontinence at 12 months (148 [76%] of 196) was not significantly different from the control group (151 [77%] of 195; absolute risk difference [RD] -1?9%, 95% CI -10 to 6). In trial 2, the difference in the rate of urinary incontinence at 12 months (126 [65%] of 194) from the control group was not significant (125 [62%] of 203; RD 3?4%, 95% CI -6 to 13). Adjusting for minimisation factors or doing treatment-received analyses did not change these results in either trial. No adverse effects were reported. In both trials, the intervention resulted in higher mean costs per patient (?180 and ?209 respectively) but we did not identify evidence of an economically important difference in QALYs (0?002 [95% CI -0?027 to 0?023] and -0?00003 [-0?026 to 0?026]).In settings where information about pelvic-floor exercise is widely available, one-to-one conservative physical therapy for men who are incontinent after prostate surgery is unlikely to be effective or cost effective.

Adjuvant chemotherapy reduces this risk; however, increasingly effective regimens are associated with higher costs and toxicity profiles, making it likely that different regimens may be cost-effective for women with differing prognoses. To investigate this we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of four treatment strategies: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) (a first generation regimen), (3) chemotherapy using Epirubicin-CMF (E-CMF) or fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC60) (a second generation regimens), and (4) chemotherapy with FEC60 followed by docetaxel (FEC-D) (a third generation regimen). These adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were used in three large UK-led randomised controlled trials (RCTs).A Markov model was used to simulate the natural progression of early breast cancer and the impact of chemotherapy on modifying this process. The probability of a first recurrent event within the model was estimated for women with different prognostic risk profiles using a parametric regression-based survival model incorporating established prognostic factors. Other probabilities, treatment effects, costs and quality of life weights were estimated primarily using data from the three UK-led RCTs, a meta-analysis of all relevant RCTs, and other published literature. The model predicted the lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of the four strategies for women with differing prognoses. Sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of uncertain parameters and model assumptions.For women with an average to high risk of recurrence (based upon prognostic factors and any other adjuvant therapies received), FEC-D appeared most cost-effective assuming a threshold of ?20,000 per QALY for the National Health Service (NHS). For younger low risk women, E-CMF/FEC60 tended to be the optimal strategy and, for some older low risk women, the model suggested a policy of no chemotherapy was cost-effective. For no patient group was CMF chemotherapy the preferred option. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated cost-effectiveness results to be particularly sensitive to the treatment effect estimate for FEC-D and the future price of docetaxel.To our knowledge, this analysis is the first cost-effectiveness comparison of no chemotherapy, and first, second, and third generation adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer patients with differing prognoses.

To investigate this we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of four treatment strategies: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) (a first generation regimen), (3) chemotherapy using Epirubicin-CMF (E-CMF) or fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC60) (a second generation regimens), and (4) chemotherapy with FEC60 followed by docetaxel (FEC-D) (a third generation regimen). These adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were used in three large UK-led randomised controlled trials (RCTs).A Markov model was used to simulate the natural progression of early breast cancer and the impact of chemotherapy on modifying this process. The probability of a first recurrent event within the model was estimated for women with different prognostic risk profiles using a parametric regression-based survival model incorporating established prognostic factors. Other probabilities, treatment effects, costs and quality of life weights were estimated primarily using data from the three UK-led RCTs, a meta-analysis of all relevant RCTs, and other published literature. The model predicted the lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of the four strategies for women with differing prognoses. Sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of uncertain parameters and model assumptions.For women with an average to high risk of recurrence (based upon prognostic factors and any other adjuvant therapies received), FEC-D appeared most cost-effective assuming a threshold of ?20,000 per QALY for the National Health Service (NHS). For younger low risk women, E-CMF/FEC60 tended to be the optimal strategy and, for some older low risk women, the model suggested a policy of no chemotherapy was cost-effective. For no patient group was CMF chemotherapy the preferred option. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated cost-effectiveness results to be particularly sensitive to the treatment effect estimate for FEC-D and the future price of docetaxel.To our knowledge, this analysis is the first cost-effectiveness comparison of no chemotherapy, and first, second, and third generation adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer patients with differing prognoses.

8475,Until which age should women be vaccinated against HPV infection? Recommendation based on cost-effectiveness analyses,"Cervical cancer is caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Several countries have implemented vaccination programs against HPV for teenage girls before sexual debut. However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that vaccination of older women is highly effective as well. Accordingly, it has been suggested that these older women should also be offered vaccination.

8476,Cost effectiveness of cetuximab concurrent with radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer in Taiwan: a decision-tree analysis,"Concomitant chemotherapy with radiotherapy is considered to be the standard of care for patients with head and neck cancer and good performance status. However, published reports on the cost effectiveness of this therapeutic approach are extremely rare.The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of cetuximab combined with radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.A decision-tree analysis was used to compare cetuximab combined with radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck from the perspective of the national health payer (the Bureau of National Health Insurance [BNHI]) in Taiwan. The model was based on individual patient data extracted from an international phase III trial. The direct medical costs of care were estimated by clinical expert panels based on the reimbursement price of the BNHI (2007 values). One-way sensitivity analyses were performed while varying the costs and clinical parameters. Results: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for patients receiving radiotherapy in combination with cetuximab compared with radiotherapy alone was $US36?992/QALY in the base-case analysis (2007 values). The sensitivity analysis showed the highest net benefit for radiotherapy alone if the cost of cetuximab increased by 50%.This study demonstrated that the addition of cetuximab to high-dose radiotherapy regimens is likely to be cost effective in Taiwan because the incremental cost per QALY is below the commonly accepted cost-effectiveness threshold.",2011-01-08017,21744880,Clin Drug Investig,Agnes L F Chan,2011,31 /,717-26,Yes,21744880,"Agnes L F Chan; Henry W C Leung; Shiao-Feng Huang; Cost effectiveness of cetuximab concurrent with radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer in Taiwan: a decision-tree analysis, Clin Drug Investig, ; 31 ():1173-2563; 717-26",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cetuximab plus radiotherapy vs. Radiotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,36992,United States,2007,46174.61

This paper estimates the costs and public health impacts of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine programs, varying estimates of serotype replacement and herd immunity effects as key parameters in the analysis. Based in part on a 2008 analysis also presented here, Singapore has approved the PCV-7, PHiD-10, and PCV-13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccines as part of its National Childhood Immunisation Programme.An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model populated with Singapore-specific population parameters, vaccine costs, treatment costs, and disease incidence data. The vaccinated infant and child cohort of 226,000 was 6% of the Singapore resident population of 3.8 million. Vaccine efficacy estimates were constructed for PCV-7, PHiD-10, and PCV-13 vaccines based on their serotype coverage in Singapore and compared to 'no vaccination'. The model estimated impacts over a five-year time horizon with 3% per year discounting of costs and health effects. Costs were presented in 2010 U.S. dollars (USD) and Singapore dollars (SGD). Sensitivity analyses included varying herd immunity, serotype replacement rates, vaccine cost, and efficacy against acute otitis media.Under base case assumptions for the revised analysis (i.e., herd effects in the unvaccinated population equivalent to 20% of direct effects) PCV-13 prevented 834 cases and 7 deaths due to pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia in the vaccinated population, and 952 cases and 191 deaths in the unvaccinated population over the 5-year time horizon. Including herd effects, the cost-effectiveness ratio for PCV-13 was USD $37,644 (SGD $51,854) per QALY. Without herd effects, however, the ratio was USD $204,535 (SGD $281,743) per QALY. The PCV-7 cost per QALY including herd effects was USD $43,275 (SGD $59,610) and for PHiD-10 the ratios were USD $45,100 (SGD $62,125).

However, widespread replacement of d4T by Tenofovir (TDF) or Zidovudine (AZT) is hampered by cost concerns.We established the cost-effectiveness of alternative first-line regimens using primary utilization, cost, and outcome data from a program in a rural district in Lesotho. We calculated cost per patient-year, incremental costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per life year, and per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained. Uncertainty was assessed using multiway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Our study included 1260 patients representing 1635 patient-years on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Patients on d4T experienced more toxicities; toxicities with the biggest impact on quality of life were moderate neuropathy and severe lipodystrophy. The cost per patient-year ranged from US $266 on d4T to US $353 on TDF. Inpatient care and essential drug costs were higher for patients on d4T than on AZT or TDF. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results suggest that AZT-based ART is weakly dominated by a combination of d4T- and TDF-based ART.This is one of the first analyses to investigate the cost-effectiveness of TDF using primary data in a resource-poor setting. Although TDF-based first-line ART is more costly than d4T, it is also more effective.

8486,Cost and cost-effectiveness of switching from d4T or AZT to a TDF-based first-line regimen in a resource-limited setting in rural Lesotho,"Latest World Health Organization guidelines recommend shifting away from Stavudine (d4T)-based regimens due to severe side effects. However, widespread replacement of d4T by Tenofovir (TDF) or Zidovudine (AZT) is hampered by cost concerns.We established the cost-effectiveness of alternative first-line regimens using primary utilization, cost, and outcome data from a program in a rural district in Lesotho. We calculated cost per patient-year, incremental costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per life year, and per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained. Uncertainty was assessed using multiway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Our study included 1260 patients representing 1635 patient-years on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Six hundred eight patients were on TDF, 290 were on AZT, and 362 were on d4T. Patients on d4T experienced more toxicities; toxicities with the biggest impact on quality of life were moderate neuropathy and severe lipodystrophy. The cost per patient-year ranged from US $266 on d4T to US $353 on TDF. Inpatient care and essential drug costs were higher for patients on d4T than on AZT or TDF.

8487,Economic evaluation of policy options for prevention and control of cervical cancer in Thailand,"The Thai healthcare setting has seen patients with cervical cancer experience an increasing burden of morbidity and mortality, a stagnation in the performance of cervical screening programmes and the introduction of a vaccine for the prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.This study aims to identify the optimum mix of interventions that are cost effective, from societal and healthcare provider perspectives, for the prevention and control of cervical cancer.A computer-based Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was used to simulate an age-stratified cohort of women in Thailand. The strategy comparators, including both control and prevention programmes, were (i) conventional cytology screening (Pap smears); (ii) screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA); and (iii) HPV-16, -18 vaccination. Input parameters (e.g. age-specific incidence of HPV infection, progression and regression of the infection, test performance of screening methods and efficacy of vaccine) were synthesized from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Costs (year 2007 values) and outcomes were evaluated separately, and compared for each combination. The screening strategies were started from the age of 30-40 years and repeated at 5- and 10-year intervals. In addition, HPV vaccines were introduced at age 15-60 years.All of the screening strategies showed certain benefits due to a decreased number of women developing cervical cancer versus 'no intervention'. Moreover, the most cost-effective strategy from the societal perspective was the combination of VIA and sequential Pap smear (i.e., VIA every 5 years for women aged 30-45 years, followed by Pap smear every 5 years for women aged 50-60 years). This strategy was dominant, with a QALY gain of 0.01 and a total cost saving of Baht (Bt) 800, compared with doing nothing. From the societal perspective, universal HPV vaccination for girls aged 15 years without screening resulted in a QALY gain of 0.06 at an additional cost of Bt 8,800, based on the cost of Bt 15,000 for a full immunization schedule. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing HPV vaccinations for girls aged 15 years with the current national policy of Pap smears for women aged 35-60 years every 5 years, was approximately Bt 18,1000 per QALY gained.

The strategy comparators, including both control and prevention programmes, were (i) conventional cytology screening (Pap smears); (ii) screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA); and (iii) HPV-16, -18 vaccination. Input parameters (e.g. age-specific incidence of HPV infection, progression and regression of the infection, test performance of screening methods and efficacy of vaccine) were synthesized from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Costs (year 2007 values) and outcomes were evaluated separately, and compared for each combination. The screening strategies were started from the age of 30-40 years and repeated at 5- and 10-year intervals. In addition, HPV vaccines were introduced at age 15-60 years.All of the screening strategies showed certain benefits due to a decreased number of women developing cervical cancer versus 'no intervention'. Moreover, the most cost-effective strategy from the societal perspective was the combination of VIA and sequential Pap smear (i.e., VIA every 5 years for women aged 30-45 years, followed by Pap smear every 5 years for women aged 50-60 years).

8498,Cost-benefit estimation of cadaveric kidney transplantation: the case of a developing country,"In this paper we have estimated the cost savings for the health care system and quality-of-life improvement for patients from an increased number of kidney transplants in Chile. We compared the present value of dialysis and transplantation costs and quality of life over a 20-year horizon.We used Markov models and introduced some degree of uncertainty in the value of some of the parameters that built the model. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated the confidence intervals for our results.Our estimates suggested that a kidney transplant showed an expected savings value of US$28,000 for the health care system. If the quality-of-life improvement was also considered, the expected savings rise to US$ 102,000. These results imply that increasing donation rate by 1 donor per million population would achieve an estimated cost saving of US$827,000 per year, or near US$3 million per year considering the effect on the quality of life.These results demonstrated that kidney transplantation along with a better quality of life for patients are a cost-saving decision for developing countries.",2011-01-08056,21839259,Transplant Proc,J Dom?nguez,2011,43 /,2300-4,No,21839259,"J Dom?nguez; R Harrison; R Atal; Cost-benefit estimation of cadaveric kidney transplantation: the case of a developing country, Transplant Proc, ; 43():0041-1345; 2300-4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Kidney transplantation vs. Dialysis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-9395.97,United States,2009,-11335.02
8499,Pharmacoeconomic analysis of capecitabine versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin as adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer in Taiwan,"To assess the cost-effectiveness of oral capecitabine compared with intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer in Taiwan from payer (Bureau of National Health Insurance [BNHI]) perspectives.A health state-transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs and effectiveness of capecitabine versus 5-FU/LV. The time horizons studied were: treatment duration (24 weeks) plus 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 120 months, and lifetime. Costs were expressed in Taiwanese new dollars (NT$). Clinical outcomes, medical resource use, and utilities were extracted from published sources. Unit costs were estimated from BNHI fee schedules, published sources, and local expert opinion. Outcomes and future costs were discounted at 3%. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-month (QALM). The effects of uncertainty were explored through a one-way sensitivity analysis.For the 24-week time period, drug acquisition costs were higher for capecitabine than 5-FU/LV (NT$114,405 vs. NT$4,904 per patient); however, these were offset by the higher administration costs of 5-FU/LV (NT$2,573 vs. NT$204,201 per patient). Overall direct costs for the 24-week treatment period were less with capecitabine than 5-FU/LV (NT$129,327 vs. NT$233,873 per patient). Cost savings with capecitabine were also evident when longer time horizons were considered. Over a lifetime, the projected survival benefit for capecitabine was 7 QALMs.From the perspectives of the BNHI and society in Taiwan, capecitabine not only saves costs but also improves health outcomes compared with 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer.",2011-01-08057,21839401,Value Health,Tzu-Chi Hsu,0,14 /,647-51,Yes,21839401,"Tzu-Chi Hsu; Hong-Hwa Chen; Ming-Chin Yang; Hwei-Ming Wang; Jye-Hann Chuang; Shu-Wen Jao; Hsin-Chieh Chiang; Chung-Yu Wen; Jen-Hao Tseng; Li-Tzong Chen; Pharmacoeconomic analysis of capecitabine versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin as adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer in Taiwan, Value Health, ; 14 ():1098-3015; 647-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjuvant therapy with capecitabine vs. Standard treatment- adjuvant therapy with intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LU) for 6-8 months (either weekly or monthly),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-177372,Taiwan,2007,-6739.35
8500,Estimating health and economic benefits from using prescription omega-3 fatty acids in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia,"Patients with increased triglyceride levels compared to those with normal levels are at higher risk for coronary heart disease. In patients with severe (=500 mg/dl) hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), clinical trials have demonstrated that prescription ?-3 fatty acids (P-OM3s) 4 g/day can decrease triglyceride levels by 45%. However, the precise health and economic benefits of decreasing SHTG with P-OM3 are unknown. We used the previously validated Archimedes model to simulate a 20-year trial involving subjects 45 to 75 years old with SHTG. The trial consisted of an intervention arm (P-OM3 4 g/day) and a control arm. Simulation results for the control arm indicated that subjects with SHTG are at about 2 times higher risk for myocardial infarction than those with normal triglyceride levels. Using estimates from previous epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses with OM3s, the model predicted 29% to 36% decreases in various measurements of adverse cardiac events for the intervention arm. The model also predicted a decrease in ischemic stroke of 24% (95% confidence interval 15 to 33). For the 20-year simulated trial, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the currently available P-OM3 approved by the Food and Drug Administration was $47,000. Results remained robust under different clinical assumptions. In our model P-OM3 was effective in decreasing triglyceride levels and cardiovascular disease risk in patients with SHTG. In conclusion, P-OM3 medication is cost effective in our simulated trial and comparable to other cost-effective cardiovascular interventions.",2011-01-08063,21840433,Am J Cardiol,Stuart Samuel,2011,108 /,691-7,No,21840433,"Stuart Samuel; Barbara Peskin; Bhakti Arondekar; Peter Alperin; Susan Johnson; Ian Blumenfeld; Glenda Stone; Terry A Jacobson; Estimating health and economic benefits from using prescription omega-3 fatty acids in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, Am J Cardiol, ; 108 ():0002-9149; 691-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Omega-3 fatty acids (4g/day) vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,75 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,47000,United States,2006,60337.88
