1801,Benefits and costs of using HPV testing to screen for cervical cancer,"CONTEXT: Despite quality assurance standards, Papanicolaou (Pap) test characteristics remain less than optimal. OBJECTIVE: To compare the societal costs and benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, Pap testing, and their combination to screen for cervical cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A simulation model of neoplasia natural history was used to estimate the societal costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with 18 different general population screening strategies: Pap plus HPV testing, Pap testing alone, and HPV testing alone every 2 or 3 years among hypothetical longitudinal cohorts of US women beginning at age 20 years and continuing to 65 years, 75 years, or death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved of each screening strategy. RESULTS: Maximal savings in lives were achieved by screening every 2 years until death with combined HPV and Pap testing at an incremental cost of $76 183 per QALY compared with Pap testing alone every 2 years. Stopping biennial screening with HPV and Pap testing at age 75 years captures 97.8% of the benefits of lifetime screening at a cost of $70 347 per QALY. Combined biennial HPV and Pap testing to age 65 years captures 86.6% of the benefits achievable by continuing to screen until age 75 years. Human papillomavirus screening alone was equally effective as Pap testing alone at any given screening interval or age of screening cessation but was more costly and therefore was dominated. In sensitivity analyses, HPV testing would be more effective and less costly than Pap testing at a cost threshold of $5 for an HPV test. CONCLUSIONS: Screening with HPV plus Pap tests every 2 years appears to save additional years of life at reasonable costs compared with Pap testing alone. Applying age limits to screening is a viable option to maintain benefits while reducing costs.",2002-01-01045,11988058,JAMA,Jeanne S Mandelblatt,2002,287 / 18,2372-81,No,11988058,"Jeanne S Mandelblatt; William F Lawrence; Sharita Mizell Womack; Denise Jacobson; Bin Yi; Yi-Ting Hwang; Karen Gold; James Barter; Keerti Shah; Benefits and costs of using HPV testing to screen for cervical cancer, JAMA, 2002-May-08; 287(18):1538-3598; 2372-81",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pap test and HPV test every 2 years until the age of 100 vs. Pap test and HPV test every 2 years until the age of 75,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,76183,United States,2000,114500.57
1802,To reuse or not to reuse? An economic evaluation of hemodialyzer reuse versus conventional single-use hemodialysis for chronic hemodialysis patients,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reusing hemodialyzers for patients with kidney failure on dialysis employing either a heated citric acid or formaldehyde sterilization method, in comparison to the standard practice of single-use dialysis. METHODS: A meta-analysis of all relevant studies was performed to determine whether hemodialyzer reuse was associated with an increased relative risk of mortality or hospitalization. A decision tree was constructed to model the effect of three different dialysis strategies (single-use dialysis, heated citric acid, and formaldehyde dialyzer reuse) on the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of ""typical"" hemodialysis patients. The cost of heated citric acid reuse was estimated from a center experienced with the technique. The cost of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care, survival data, and patient utilities were estimated from published sources. RESULTS: There was evidence of a higher relative risk of hospitalization (but not mortality) for hemodialyzer reuse compared with single-use dialysis. Depending on the assumptions used, the cost savings that could be expected by switching from single-use dialysis to heated citric acid reuse were small, ranging from CAN $0-739 per patient per year.

1812,Cost-utility analysis of interferon beta-1B in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis using natural history disease data,"OBJECTIVES: Different cost-effectiveness analyses have been presented for interferon beta-1b (IFNB) in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). All studies have used modeling techniques since any effect on progression of disability achieved during a clinical trial will last beyond the trial. Different approaches to extrapolation have been taken, but generally they have been based on disease progression and relapse rates in clinical trials. The problem with this approach is that the population in clinical trials is a selected group of patients, which has the potential to bias results. A better method for extrapolation is to use epidemiologic data. The objective of this study is to incorporate natural history data for MS into a previously presented cost-utility model and to compare the two methods of extrapolation. METHODS: Clinical trial data were used to model disease progression during the first 3 years in the model. To extrapolate beyond the trial (10 years), data on progression of disability were available from a geographically based epidemiologic study of the natural history of MS in Canada. There were 568 patients who had converted to SPMS during the follow-up that were included in the data set. Mean costs and utilities for each Markov state were calculated from a population-based cross-sectional study in Sweden. RESULTS: The extrapolation using clinical trial data appears to have underestimated the progression of disability in the long term and thus also the potential benefit of treatment. Using the epidemiologic data, the incremental cost per QALY is SEK 257,000 (US $25,700; US $1 = SEK 10; November 2000) when all costs (direct, informal care, and indirect) are included (discounted 3%). This compares to SEK 342,000 in the previous model. The lower cost-effectiveness ratio is mostly due to a larger QALY gain with treatment than in the previous model (0.217 compared with 0.162). CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis in SPMS requires that the effect of treatment beyond clinical trials be included. The method of extrapolation clearly affects the results, and when available, epidemiologic data should be used. Using the longitudinal data from Canada, the cost-utility ratios for IFNB-1b in the treatment of SPMS appear well within the acceptable range.",2002-01-01049,11987436,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Gisela Kobelt,2003,18 / 4,127-38,No,11987436,"Gisela Kobelt; L Jönsson; Carolin Miltenburger; B Jönsson; Cost-utility analysis of interferon beta-1B in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis using natural history disease data, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2002; 18(4):0266-4623; 127-38",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with interferon beta-1b vs. Placebo (no treatment),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,257200,Sweden,2000,42282.64
1813,Changes in quality of life and the cost-utility associated with cochlear implantation in patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: A group of 20 patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome was identified at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The major objective of this study was to explore the improvements in quality of life associated with cochlear implantation in patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, as well as the cost-utility of cochlear implantation in this group. SETTING: A total of 70 patients were identified with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome through analysis of thin-section computed tomography of the temporal bone over the past 6 years at this medical center. Data collected from the medical records for each patient included demographic data, hearing-related statistics, implantation data, and audiometric data. Sixteen children and adults with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome had undergone cochlear implantation before the beginning of this study, and the remaining 54 children and adults were identified as undergoing treatment of progressive or fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss. Health utility indexes used in this analysis were taken through the use of the Ontario Health Utility Index, Mark III. The range of costs used for cost-utility analysis was derived from the costs of cochlear implantation at this medical center, as well as from costs associated with implantation published in the medical literature. METHODS: Participants were selected from the total population of patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome at this center who were postlingually deafened and who currently had severe hearing loss. Two groups were formed. These groups comprised either cochlear implant patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome or patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome currently using hearing aids. Ten of the 16 cochlear implant patients and 10 of the remaining 54 patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome met these criteria. Mark III health utility indexes were distributed to patients in each group and scored. Those health utility indexes not completed by the patients were scored by proxy, using the audiologist at this center who was the most familiar with the patient. Changes in quality of life associated with cochlear implantation were derived by comparison of the health utility index results of the two groups. Cost-utility measures were then made using discounted costs per quality-of-life years (QALYs) (5%), and a sensitivity analysis was performed that evaluated changes in scoring done by proxy. The cost-utility results were then compared with the cost-utilities derived from similar studies and associated with other disease states. RESULTS: Although both groups of patients had significant hearing loss, the hearing aid group had a better mean pure-tone average. The mean pure-tone average for the hearing aid group was 70.8 dB (SD 24.4), and the mean pure-tone average for the cochlear implant group was 107.0 dB (SD 21.7). Seven of the 20 health utility indexes were scored by proxy. Results from the base case indicate a 0.20 gain in health utility from cochlear implantation (hearing aid = 0.62, cochlear implant = 0.82, p = 0.037), resulting in a discounted cost per QALY of $12,774. Sensitivity analysis of the proxy scoring indicated that decreasing the hearing score one level on the health utility index resulted in a gain in health utility with cochlear implantation of 0.15, resulting in a discounted cost per QALY of $17,832. A decrease of the hearing score by two levels on the health utility survey resulted in no significant gain in quality of life with cochlear implantation. CONCLUSION: This study found an improvement in quality of life associated with cochlear implantation in postlingually deafened patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome. By weighing this improvement in quality of life against the significant difference noted between the pure-tone averages of each group, further strength can be given to this conclusion. This gain in quality of life, as well as the results derived for the cost-utility of cochlear implantation, was similar to that in previous published studies of cochlear implantation in all types of patients. These results also indicate a favorable cost-utility when compared with published data about other disease states. As patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome progress to profound levels of hearing loss, these results indicate that cochlear implantation can be offered as a beneficial, life-improving therapy.",2002-01-01051,11981389,Otol Neurotol,Bradford G Bichey,2002,23 / 3,323-7,No,11981389,"Bradford G Bichey; Jon M Hoversland; Michael K Wynne; Richard T Miyamoto; Changes in quality of life and the cost-utility associated with cochlear implantation in patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, Otol Neurotol, 2002-May; 23(3):1531-7129; 323-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cochlear implantation vs. Use of hearing aids,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,5.00,12774,United States,2000,19198.91
1814,The cost utility of bisphosphonate treatment in established osteoporosis,"BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is an important and costly problem. Bisphosphonate therapy prevents hip and other fractures among women with established osteoporosis, but there are few published economic evaluations of this treatment. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of risedronate, a recently launched bisphosphonate for the prevention of fractures among women with established osteoporosis. METHODS: A state transition Markov model of established post-menopausal osteoporosis based upon randomized clinical trial data was developed. Uncertainty underlying model parameters and outcomes was dealt with using traditional sensitivity analysis and stochastic sensitivity analysis to produce quasi-95%CIs. We focussed on patients aged approximately 75 years, since this population most closely matches the randomized controlled trial, and is typical of osteoporosis patients in the UK. RESULTS: The baseline model of treating a cohort of 1000 75-year-old women for 3 years with risedronate and then modelling the costs and benefits over their expected lifetimes, produced net savings of pound sterling 786 000 for the treatment group per 1000 treated women, (95%CI pound sterling 1.55m savings to pound sterling 47000 extra costs). Restricting the horizon of the analysis to only three years led to a small net cost of pound sterling 138 000 per 1000 treated women (95%CI pound sterling 196 000 savings to pound sterling 477 000 extra costs) with a net increment in Quality Adjusted Life years (QALYs) of 16 per 1000 treated women.

1815,The cost utility of bisphosphonate treatment in established osteoporosis,"BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is an important and costly problem. Bisphosphonate therapy prevents hip and other fractures among women with established osteoporosis, but there are few published economic evaluations of this treatment. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of risedronate, a recently launched bisphosphonate for the prevention of fractures among women with established osteoporosis. METHODS: A state transition Markov model of established post-menopausal osteoporosis based upon randomized clinical trial data was developed. Uncertainty underlying model parameters and outcomes was dealt with using traditional sensitivity analysis and stochastic sensitivity analysis to produce quasi-95%CIs. We focussed on patients aged approximately 75 years, since this population most closely matches the randomized controlled trial, and is typical of osteoporosis patients in the UK. RESULTS: The baseline model of treating a cohort of 1000 75-year-old women for 3 years with risedronate and then modelling the costs and benefits over their expected lifetimes, produced net savings of pound sterling 786 000 for the treatment group per 1000 treated women, (95%CI pound sterling 1.55m savings to pound sterling 47000 extra costs). Restricting the horizon of the analysis to only three years led to a small net cost of pound sterling 138 000 per 1000 treated women (95%CI pound sterling 196 000 savings to pound sterling 477 000 extra costs) with a net increment in Quality Adjusted Life years (QALYs) of 16 per 1000 treated women. This resulted in a cost per QALY of pound sterling 8625 per treated woman. CONCLUSIONS: In this example, the use of risedronate therapy in 75-year-old women at high risk of hip fracture leads to an improvement in quality of life with possible cost savings.

1816,Utility and cost-effectiveness of preoperative autologous blood donation in gynecologic and gynecologic oncology patients,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate utility and cost-effectiveness of preoperative autologous blood donation in gynecologic and gynecologic oncology patients. METHODS: Pheresis unit records were retrospectively reviewed to identify all women who performed autologous blood donation. Clinical charts were abstracted. Use rate (number of units used/number of units donated) and quality-adjusted life years were calculated. Statistical analysis consisted of chi(2), Student t, and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: A total of 106 women with benign (n = 63) and malignant disease (n = 43) donated 143 units (1.4 units per patient) of which 126 (88%) were discarded. Fifteen patients (14%) were transfused a total of 24 units, 17 autologous (71%) and seven allogeneic (29%). Those transfused had a significantly higher estimated blood loss (700 mL versus 275 mL, P <.001), lower nadir hemoglobin (7.9 versus 9.6, P <.001), and longer hospital stay (4.9 days versus 4.0 days, P =.05). Despite similar estimated blood loss (370 mL versus 310 mL), the use rate for malignant versus benign disease was significantly greater (0.31 versus 0.07, P =.005). Radical versus nonradical surgery had a significantly higher estimated blood loss (620 mL versus 250 mL, P =.001) and use rate (0.26 versus 0.11, P =.001) as well. Estimated cost per quality-adjusted life years for autologous blood donation for each category exceeded $1,000,000. CONCLUSION: Autologous blood donation is an expensive medical practice and does not guarantee that exposure to allogeneic blood will not occur. If pursued, it should be directed towards those who have a known malignancy or those for whom radical surgery is anticipated. Other methods of blood conservation may be safer and more cost-effective.",2002-01-01054,11978286,Obstet Gynecol,Neil S Horowitz,2002,99 / 5 Pt 1,771-6,No,11978286,"Neil S Horowitz; Randall K Gibb; Nicole E Menegakis; David G Mutch; Janet S Rader; Thomas J Herzog; Utility and cost-effectiveness of preoperative autologous blood donation in gynecologic and gynecologic oncology patients, Obstet Gynecol, 2002-May; 99(5 Pt 1):0029-7844; 771-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous blood transfusion plus allogeneic blood transfusion if autologous supplies are insufficient vs. Allogeneic blood transfusion,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,1029167,United States,2000,1546804.53
1817,Prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus-related Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia: using simulation modeling to inform clinical guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have experienced a dramatic decrease in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), necessitating reassessment of clinical guidelines for prophylaxis. METHODS: A simulation model of HIV infection was used to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for alternative CD4 cell count criteria for stopping primary PCP prophylaxis in patients with CD4 cell count increases receiving HAART and alternative agents for second-line PCP prophylaxis in those intolerant of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). The target population was a cohort of HIV-infected patients in the United States with initial CD4 cell counts of 350/microL who began PCP prophylaxis after their first measured CD4 lymphocyte count less than 200/microL. Data were from randomized controlled trials and other published literature. RESULTS: For patients with CD4 cell count increases during HAART, waiting to stop prophylaxis until the first observed CD4 cell count was greater than 300/microL prevented 9 additional cases per 1000 patients and cost $9400 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared with stopping prophylaxis at 200/microL. For patients intolerant of TMP/SMX, using dapsone increased QALE by 2.7 months and cost $4500 per QALY compared with no prophylaxis. Using atovaquone rather than dapsone provided only 3 days of additional QALE and cost more than $1.5 million per QALY.

1825,State AIDS Drug Assistance Programs: equity and efficiency in an era of rapidly changing treatment standards,"BACKGROUND: The 54 state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) provide medications to HIV-infected persons with limited resources. Eligibility and coverage vary, raising concerns about health inequities. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative clinical and economic performance of ADAP programs. RESEARCH DESIGN: A state-transition simulation model of HIV disease was used to explore the clinical consequences and lifetime costs associated with selected state policies. Clinical data came from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 320, and other published randomized trials. Cost data came from the national AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey, and the 1999 Red Book. ADAP data came from National Association of State and Territorial AIDS Directors reports and interviews. MEASURES: Projected life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, total lifetime direct medical costs, cost-effectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: ADAPs vary considerably in terms of formulary policies, health outcomes, expected costs, and cost-efficiency. Conservative projections, based on a cohort with starting mean CD4 count of 250 cells/microL, yield life expectancies ranging from 5.36 to 6.81 life years (4.69-6.01 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). Total per person lifetime direct medical costs range from $81,200 to $112,700; higher costs reflect increased spending on medications. Expected costs per QALY gained range from $7000 to $28,000.

1831,Testing for factor V Leiden in patients with pulmonary or venous thromboembolism: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Survivors of venous thromboembolism who have the factor V Leiden mutation have an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), but the cost-effectiveness of testing for factor VLeiden has not been assessed. METHODS: We used a Markov state transition decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of factor V Leiden testing and treatment strategies in survivors of VTE using a societal perspective for costs, effectiveness-measured in quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Data sources included the English language literature using MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement and other sources. The analysis examined 3 hypothetical cohorts of 35-year-old women having suffered their 1st episode of VTE. Interventions included oral anticoagulant therapy for 6 months versus testing. Patients found to have the factor V Leiden mutation were then treated with either 3 years or lifelong oral anticoagulant therapy. RESULTS: Total costs for testing followed by 3 years of treatment were $9,676, whereas those for no testing were $10,392 and those for testing followed by lifelong therapy were $13,179. Testing followed by 3 years of treatment increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by roughly 0.15 years. In sensitivity analyses using a more plausible constant risk model of recurrent VTE, testing followed by lifelong anticoagulation was the favored strategy. However, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio was highly dependent on the rate of recurrent VTE, the risk of major hemorrhage, prevalence of factor V Leiden, patient age, and the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Testing followed by lifelong anticoagulation is unlikely to be a cost-effective strategy in patient populations with a very low prevalence of factor V Leiden; for those with a lower risk for recurrent VTE, such as patients with a clear precipitant; or for patients with risk factors for bleeding while receiving anticoagulant therapy. The only patients for whom testing followed by lifelong anticoagulant therapy may be a reasonable strategy are those with no obvious precipitant for VTE (i.e., idiopathic VTE) who are at low risk for bleeding complications from oral anticoagulant therapy. These results highlight the need for further clinical investigation and the development of multivariable models predicting the risk of recurrent VTE based on factor V Leiden status, idiopathic versus precipitated VTE, treatment, and the coinheritance of other common thrombophilias, such as the prothrombin gene mutation.",2002-01-01058,11958494,Med Decis Making,Mark H Eckman,2002,22 / 2,108-24,No,11958494,"Mark H Eckman; Sushil K Singh; John K Erban; Grace Kao; Testing for factor V Leiden in patients with pulmonary or venous thromboembolism: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Med Decis Making, 2002 Mar-Apr; 22(2):0272-989X; 108-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screen for the Factor V Leiden mutation and treat all carriers with oral anti-coagulant (warfarin) for 3 yrs vs. Six months standard oral anti-coagulant therapy (warfarin) without testing,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,-4773.33,United States,1999,-7415.31

1836,The cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Our aim was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in these patients. The specific strategies evaluated were: no vaccination, targeted vaccination, and universal vaccination. METHODS: Clinical estimates were based on published data. Costs estimates were based on published data and institutional Medicare reimbursement rates. Health-related quality-of-life weights were derived from published data and expert estimates. The target population consisted of patients 45 yr of age with chronic hepatitis C followed every 6 months until death. We adopted a societal perspective. RESULTS: Compared with no vaccination, targeted vaccination was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $51,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of universal vaccination compared with targeted vaccination was $3,900,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. The results were particularly sensitive to the incidence of hepatitis A, probability of fulminant hepatic failure, and costs of hepatitis A antibody screening and vaccination.

1838,Development of a decision-analytic model of stroke care in the United States and Europe,"OBJECTIVE: Stroke places a huge burden on society in terms of premature death, disability, and costs of care. Increasingly, the cost-effectiveness of new interventions needs to be demonstrated before their widespread implementation. Clinical trials are unable to measure the long-term impact of such new interventions in stroke care, and a modeling approach is necessary. The Stroke Outcome Model has been developed in four countries: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States as a flexible tool for this purpose. METHOD: The decision-analytic model represents the management of acute stroke and long-term care and prevention of recurrence for stroke survivors. The latter consists of semi-Markov state-transition processes, with health states defined by therapy, disability, and occurrence of further stroke. Sources of clinical data include trials, meta-analyses, and prospective cohort studies such as the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project and the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study. Resource use data were obtained from published sources and expert clinician panels. Outcome measures used were strokes averted, life years, and quality-adjusted life-years gained. RESULTS: The model has been used to undertake economic analyses of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of recurrent strokes, and of stroke unit care and thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke. From a health- and social-care perspective, new interventions were found to be cost saving or to provide health benefits at modest additional cost. Results were sensitive to the cost perspective, time horizon, baseline risk of stroke recurrence, and choice of effectiveness measure.

1841,Outcome and cost-effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest in octogenarians,"CONTEXT: Octogenarians are the fastest growing segment of the population and little is known about the results of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after in-hospital cardiac arrest in this population. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of CPR after in-hospital cardiac arrest in octogenarians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Years of life saved. DESIGN: Effectiveness data were obtained from a review of 91,372 hospital discharges from January 1st, 1993 until June 30th, 1996. Cardiac arrest was reported in 956 patients. The study group consisted of 474 patients > or = 80 years old. CPR costs included equipment and training, physician and nursing time and medications. Post-CPR expenses included in-hospital true cost, repeat hospitalizations, physician office visits, nursing home, rehabilitation, and chronic care hospital costs. Life expectancy of the patients who were still alive at the end of the study was estimated from census data. A utility of 0.8 was used to calculate quality-adjusted-life years saved (QALYS). We used a societal perspective for analysis. RESULTS: The study population was 86 +/- 4.8 years old (range 80-103), and 42% were male. Fifty-four patients (11%) were discharged alive, 35 to a chronic care facility and 19 to their home. Assuming that a cardiac arrest without CPR has 100% mortality, 12 octogenarians required treatment with CPR in order to save one life to hospital discharge. Similarly, 29 octogenarian patients with cardiac arrest have to be treated with CPR to net one long-term survivor (mean survival 21 months, with a range from 9 to 48 months). The cost-effectiveness ratio, after estimating the life expectancy of octogenarian survivors, was USD 50,412 per year of life saved, and USD 63,015 per QALYS. However, a utility of 0.5 yielded a cost of USD 100,825 per QALYS. CONCLUSION: In comparison with other life-saving strategies, CPR in octogenarians is effective. The favorable cost-effectiveness ratio is highly dependent on the patients"" preference for quality rather than quantity of life, as expressed by the utility assumptions.",2002-01-01093,11893823,Cardiology,David Paniagua,2002,97 / 1,6-11,No,11893823,"David Paniagua; Francisco Lopez-Jimenez; Juan C Londoño; Carol M Mangione; Kirsten Fleischmann; Gervasio A Lamas; Outcome and cost-effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest in octogenarians, Cardiology, 2002; 97(1):0008-6312; 6-11",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiac pulmonary resuscitation vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,80 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,63015,United States,1988,137861.16
1842,Cost-effectiveness of cadaveric and living-donor liver transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Cadaveric liver transplantation (5-year survival >80%) represents the standard of care for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Because the demand for cadaveric organs exceeds their availability, living-donor liver transplantation has gained increasing acceptance. Our aim was to assess the marginal cost-effectiveness of cadaveric and living-donor orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in adults with ESLD. METHODS: Using a Markov model, outcomes and costs of ESLD treated (1) conservatively, (2) with cadaveric OLT alone, and (3) with cadaveric OLT or living-donor OLT were computed. The model was validated with published data. The case-based scenario consisted of data on all 15 ESLD patients currently on our waiting list (3 women, 12 men; median age, 48 years [range, 33-59 years]) and on the outcome of all OLT performed for ESLD at our institution since 1995 (n=51; actuarial 5-year survival 93%). Living-donor OLT was allowed in 15% during the first year of listing; fulminant hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. RESULTS: Cadaveric OLT gained on average 6.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient compared with conservative treatment, living-donor OLT, an additional 1.3 QALYs compared with cadaveric OLT alone. Marginal cost-effectiveness of a program with cadaveric OLT alone and a program with cadaveric and living-donor OLT combined were similar (E 22,451 and E 23,530 per QALY gained). Results were sensitive to recipient age and postoperative survival rate.

1844,Managing toxic thyroid adenoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of therapeutic strategies for patients with toxic thyroid adenoma. DESIGN: A decision analytic model was used to examine strategies, including thyroid lobectomy after a 3-month course of antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine (RAI), and lifelong ATDs followed by either RAI (ATD-RAI) or surgery (ATD-surgery) in patients suffering severe drug reactions. METHODS: Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years. Data on the prevalence of co-incident thyroid cancer, complications and treatment efficacies were derived from a systematic review of the literature (1966-2000). Costs were examined from the health care system perspective. Costs and effectiveness were examined at their present values.

RESULTS: For a 40-year-old woman, surgery was both the most effective and the least costly strategy (Euro 1391),while ATD-RAI cost the most (Euro 5760). RAI was more effective than surgery if surgical mortality exceeded 0.6% (base-case 0.001%). RAI become less costly for women of more than 72 years (more than 66 in discounted analyses).

1847,Tamoxifen plus chemotherapy versus tamoxifen alone as adjuvant therapies for node-positive postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: a stochastic economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: There remains uncertainty around the appropriate choice of adjuvant therapies to offer postmenopausal women with node-positive early breast cancer. OBJECTIVE AND STUDY DESIGN: To present the results derived from a discrete event simulation (DES) model that compared tamoxifen plus chemotherapy versus tamoxifen alone in node-positive postmenopausal women diagnosed with early breast cancer. METHODS: The data populating the model were mainly derived from the existing literature, which was analysed to specify probability distributions describing the uncertainty around the true value of each input parameter. The specified probability distributions facilitated the stochastic analysis of the decision model, whereby distributions of the model""s outputs [aggregate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] were estimated. RESULTS: The baseline results show that the addition of chemotherapy to tamoxifen in this patient group is relatively cost effective (under pound 4000 per additional QALY), but the distribution of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio shows a wide range, including 10% of observations in which tamoxifen dominates tamoxifen plus chemotherapy.

1848,An economic evaluation of lung transplantation,"OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained with lung transplantation relative to medical treatment for end-stage lung disease in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Patients on the transplant waiting list were used to represent medical treatment. Four-year national survival data were extrapolated to 15 years by means of parametric techniques. Quality-adjusted life-years were derived by means of utility scores obtained from a cross-section of patients. Resource consumption and costs were based on local and national sources. Costs and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 6%. RESULTS: Across a 15-year period lung transplantation yielded mean benefits (relative to medical treatment) of 2.1, 3.3, and 3.6 quality-adjusted life-years for single-lung, double-lung, and heart-lung transplantation, respectively. During the same period the mean cost of medical treatment was estimated at $73,564, compared with $176,640, $180,528, and $178,387 for single-lung, double-lung, and heart-lung transplantation, respectively. The costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were $48,241 for single-lung, $32,803 for double-lung, and $29,285 for heart-lung transplantation. Sensitivity analysis found the principal determinants of cost-effectiveness to be quality of life and maintenance costs after transplantation.

The costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were $48,241 for single-lung, $32,803 for double-lung, and $29,285 for heart-lung transplantation. Sensitivity analysis found the principal determinants of cost-effectiveness to be quality of life and maintenance costs after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation results in survival and quality of life gains but remains expensive, with cost-effectiveness limited by substantial mortality and morbidity and high costs. The cost-effectiveness of lung transplantation can be improved with lowered immunosuppression costs and improvements in quality of life after transplantation.",2002-01-01098,11882810,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,Ani C Anyanwu,2002,123 / 3,411-8; discussion 418-20,No,11882810,"Ani C Anyanwu; Alistair McGuire; Chris A Rogers; Andrew J Murday; An economic evaluation of lung transplantation, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 2002-Mar; 123(3):0022-5223; 411-8; discussion 418-20",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Heart-lung transplantation vs. Medical treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,6.00,6.00,17856,United Kingdom,1999,44859.64
1851,Cost-effectiveness of ancrod treatment of acute ischaemic stroke: results from the Stroke Treatment with Ancrod Trial (STAT),"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper describes a recent randomized controlled trial in which 42% of patients receiving ancrod attained a favourable outcome in comparison with 34% of controls. Although the above effect size corresponds to a number needed to treat (to achieve a favourable outcome) of approximately 13, intuition does not necessarily suggest what would be the overall impact of a treatment with this level of efficacy. METHODS: The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ancrod. Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from the Stroke Treatment with Ancrod Trial (STAT) trial was carried out. The participants were 495 patients with data on functional status at the conclusion of follow-up. Short-term results were based upon utilization and quality of life observed during the trial; these were merged with expected long-term results obtained through simulation using the Stroke Policy Model. The main outcome measure was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Ancrod treatment resulted in both better quality-adjusted life expectancy and lower medical costs than placebo as supported by sensitivity analysis. The cost differential was primarily attributable to the long-term implications of ancrod""s role in reducing disability. CONCLUSIONS: If ancrod is even modestly effective, it will probably be cost-effective (and, indeed, cost-saving) as well. The net population-level impact of even modestly effective stroke treatments can be substantial.",2002-01-01100,11882102,J Eval Clin Pract,Gregory P Samsa,2002,8 / 1,61-70,No,11882102,"Gregory P Samsa; David B Matchar; G Rhys Williams; David E Levy; Cost-effectiveness of ancrod treatment of acute ischaemic stroke: results from the Stroke Treatment with Ancrod Trial (STAT), J Eval Clin Pract, 2002-Feb; 8(1):1356-1294; 61-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Administration of ancrod within 3 hours of symptom onset vs. Administration of placebo within 3 hours of symptom onset,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-129533.33,United States,1996,-213668.9
1852,Incremental cost-effectiveness of initial cataract surgery,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a reference case, cost-utility analysis of initial cataract surgery using the current literature on cataract outcomes and complications. DESIGN: Computer-based econometric modeling. METHODS: Visual acuity data of patients treated and observed over a 4-month postoperative period was obtained from the US National Cataract Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT). The results from this prospective study were combined with other studies that investigated the complication rates of cataract surgery to complete the cohort of patients and outcomes. These synthesized data were incorporated with time-tradeoff utility values, decision analysis, and econometric modeling to account for the time value of money. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was calculated for the study group undergoing cataract extraction in the first eye when the vision was the same in both eyes. This was divided into the cost of the procedure to find the year 2000 nominal US dollars spent per quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY) gained. RESULTS: Initial cataract surgery, compared with observation, resulted in a mean gain of 1.776 QALYs per patient treated. A 3% annual discount rate was used to account for the benefit over time, yielding 1.25 QALYs gained. The mean cost of treatment (also discounted at a 3% annual rate) of each patient totaled 2525 US dollars. The cost divided by the discounted benefit resulted in $2020/QALY gained for this procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Initial cataract surgery seems to be highly cost-effective compared with procedures across multiple medical specialties. This information, incorporating patient preferences into evidenced-based medicine, will play an increasingly important role in the evaluation of health care in the future.",2002-01-01103,11874769,Ophthalmology,Brandon G Busbee,2002,109 / 3,606-12; discussion 612-3,No,11874769,"Brandon G Busbee; Melissa M Brown; Gary C Brown; Sanjay Sharma; Incremental cost-effectiveness of initial cataract surgery, Ophthalmology, 2002-Mar; 109(3):0161-6420; 606-12; discussion 612-3",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Initial cataract surgery vs. Observation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2020,United States,2000,3035.99
1853,Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon beta in multiple sclerosis: a Markov process analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of preventive treatment with interferon beta (IFNB) versus no preventive treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: The setting for this study was the United Kingdom. A lifetime Markov process model was constructed to model the average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the costs of both treatment strategies. Data for the construction of the model came from published literature, including large multicenter randomized clinical trials in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Costs were obtained from published sources. RESULTS: The results of the baseline analysis from the National Health Service (NHS) perspective showed that the use of interferon beta as preventive treatment for MS increased the total average discounted cost from 51,214 Pounds to 221,436 Pounds per patient. The undiscounted effectiveness increased from 24.9 QALYs to 28.2 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 51,582 Pounds per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of this model for other interferons. CONCLUSION: The study showed that preventive treatment with interferon beta in patients with multiple sclerosis may not be fully justified from a health-economic perspective, although interferon beta is associated with an improved effectiveness compared with no preventive treatment.",2002-01-01104,11873383,Value Health,Mark J C Nuijten,2002,5 / 1,44-54,Yes,11873383,"Mark J C Nuijten; J Hutton; Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon beta in multiple sclerosis: a Markov process analysis, Value Health, 2002 Jan-Feb; 5(1):1098-3015; 44-54",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Preventive treatment with interferon beta vs. Usual care,Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,6.00,Not Stated,51582,United Kingdom,1998,135739.64
1854,Routine duplex surveillance does not improve the outcome after carotid endarterectomy: a decision and cost utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Doppler ultrasound (duplex) tests are commonly applied after carotid endarterectomy to detect possible recurrent stenosis. The appropriate frequency and the benefits are unknown. We investigated the costs and effects of various follow-up strategies to determine the optimal strategy after carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: Using decision-analytic methods, a Monte Carlo Markov model was constructed. Probabilities and costs were obtained by systematic literature review. From empirical data regarding restenosis, a disease model was constructed to test the effect of various follow-up strategies using duplex testing and angiography. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), probability of stroke, and costs (for both the Dutch and the American situation). RESULTS: The average quality-adjusted life expectancy for a 66-year-old patient was 6.31 years for the symptom-guided strategy (with duplex scanning only being performed in case of symptoms of cerebral ischemia). The mean lifetime costs for this strategy were $5 600 for the US and 4 600 Euro for the Netherlands. The cumulative probability of stroke was 13%. Yearly routine duplex tests up to 5 years after operation resulted in similar QALYs and a similar probability of stroke, but higher costs ($7 300 for the US and 5 600 Euro for The Netherlands situation). No other strategy, including routine duplex surveillance, increased QALYs. When MR instead of conventional angiography was used as confirmatory test, no improvement was observed either. CONCLUSIONS: Routine duplex surveillance does not result in an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy, but it does increase costs.

1855,Surgery and adjuvant therapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis: cost analysis,"In a prospective, randomized, controlled trial the effect of high dose intravenous antithrombin III and intraabdominal donor serum was analyzed in 36 patients with diffuse secondary peritonitis. The direct cost for treatment was 25,370 euros per patient, and the post acute hospital care costs and societal costs were 6273 euros. The cost for intensive care of these patients accounted for approximately 83% of the direct costs, while the expenditures for operating theater and general wards accounted for 9% each. The most expensive factors were staff, medication, and blood products. The hospital incurred a deficit of 3696 euros for each patient after reimbursement from public health insurance companies. Quality of life as assessed by the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQI) showed a good outcome. On average 11 quality adjusted life years (QALY) were achieved. The cost per QALY was 2631 euros. Use of adjuvant therapy was associated with a reduced duration of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, times on mechanical respiration, and hemofiltration; the cost of treatment was reduced by 6614 euros per patient. The additional cost of antithrombin III (5155 euros) was more than offset by the savings made when adjuvant therapy was used.",2002-01-01109,11865366,World J Surg,K Welcker,2002,26 / 3,307-13,No,11865366,"K Welcker; Jens Lederle; Markus Schorr; M Siebeck; Surgery and adjuvant therapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis: cost analysis, World J Surg, 2002-Mar; 26(3):0364-2313; 307-13",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Appropriate surgical intervention plus adjuvant therapy of antithrombin III and fresh frozen donor serum vs. Appropriate surgical intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,6614,Euro,2000,9177.01

DESIGN: Computer-based economic model utilizing data from the Medicare health insurance system in the United States. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis compared vitreoretinal surgery using expanding gases and silicone oil therapy to the natural course of retinal detachment associated with severe PVR. The model applies long-term published visual data from the Silicone Study Group, time tradeoff utility analysis, decision analysis with Markov modeling, and discounting of costs and health benefits as per the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The major outcome measure was in year 2000 United States dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (dollars/QALY) gained. RESULTS: Vitreoretinal surgery for retinal detachment complicated by severe PVR, as compared with no treatment, resulted in a mean gain of 0.128-0.200 discounted (3% annual rate) quality-adjusted life-years per treated patient. Silicone oil (dollars/QALY gained of 40,252 dollars) was slightly more cost-effective than perfluoropropane (C(3)F(8)) gas (dollars/QALY gained of 46,926 dollars) in eyes with PVR without previous vitrectomy, whereas C(3)F(8) gas (dollars/QALY gained of 46,162 dollars) was more cost-effective than silicone oil (dollars/QALY gained of 62,383 dollars) with previous vitrectomy and PVR.

1860,The clinical and economic impact of competing management strategies for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,"BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder in the primary care setting. Traditional management strategies consist of sequentially intensive therapeutic trials followed by invasive diagnostic testing for nonresponders. A high dose proton pump inhibitor trial (the ""proton pump inhibitor test"") has been shown to be an accurate diagnostic alternative, and may be an efficient initial approach to patients with GERD symptoms. AIM: To examine the clinical, economic and policy implications of alternative management strategies for GERD. METHODS: Decision analysis was used to calculate the clinical and economic outcomes of competing management strategies. The traditional strategy incorporates sequential therapeutic trials with more intensive therapy (""step-up"" approach) followed by sequential invasive diagnostic testing of nonresponders. The ""proton pump inhibitor test"" strategy includes an initial ""proton pump inhibitor test"" (7 days of omeprazole; 40 mg AM + 20 mg PM daily) followed by less intensive therapeutic trials in those testing positive (""step-down"" approach) with sequential invasive diagnostic testing as needed. Cost estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement and average wholesale drug prices. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic review of the published medical literature. Model results are reported as the average and incremental cost-per-symptom free patient and cost-per-quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: The average cost per patient was 1045 US dollars for the traditional step-up management strategy, compared to 1172 US dollars for the ""proton pump inhibitor test"" and step-down strategy. The percentage of patients who were symptom-free at 1 year was 50% for the traditional management strategy compared to 75% for the ""proton pump inhibitor test"" strategy. The ""proton pump inhibitor test"" strategy results in QALY gains of 0.01-0.05 depending on the utility estimate employed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the ""proton pump inhibitor test"" strategy is 510 US dollars per additional symptomatic cure over 1 year, and between 2822-10,160 US dollars per QALY gained. The traditional management strategy resulted in a greater than 5-fold increase in the utilization of upper endoscopy, which was partially offset by a 47% reduction in the use of ambulatory 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring. The reduced effectiveness of the traditional management strategy may be attributed in part to a 118% increase in the use of ""high-dose"" H2RAs while reducing the use of standard dose proton pump inhibitors by only 42% and ""high-dose"" proton pump inhibitors by 57%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this analysis, strategies utilizing the initial PPI test followed by a ""step-down"" approach may result in improved symptom relief and quality of life over 1 year, and more appropriate utilization of invasive diagnostic testing at a small marginal increase in total costs. These findings warrant a prospective trial comparing these competing management strategies.",2002-01-01111,11860409,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,Joshua J Ofman,2002,16 / 2,261-73,No,11860409,"Joshua J Ofman; G H Dorn; M B Fennerty; R Fass; The clinical and economic impact of competing management strategies for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 2002-Feb; 16(2):0269-2813; 261-73",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"""Proton pump inhibitor-test"" strategy - an initial ""proton"" pump inhibitor test follwed by less intensive therapeutic trials in those testing positive and sequential invasive diagnostic testing as needed vs. Traditional ""step-up"" approach",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,12700,United States,1997,20479.13
1861,Cost-utility analysis of hepatitis A prevention among health-care workers in Israel,"This study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of different strategies of preventing hepatitis A (HA) among physicians, nurses, and paramedical staff by means of cost-effectiveness analysis. The strategies compared were passive immunization during a hepatitis A outbreak, systematic mass vaccination of all workers, and screening for antibodies to HA virus followed by vaccination of nonimmune employees. To predict the prevented number of HA cases, an epidemiological model was incorporated based on our previous nationwide study on clinical HA cases, seroepidemiological survey, and other scientific medical literature. Under the model assumptions, the lowest cost per prevented HA case ($6240) was achieved by screening prior vaccination among 18- to 39-year-old physicians and paramedical workers, and highest ($61,858) by mass vaccination of nurses over age 39 years. Because the price per prevented case may show that mass vaccination is highly cost-effective, especially among 18- to 39-year-old physicians and paramedical workers ($6399 and $8196, respectively), the cost per gained quality-adjusted life-year seems less attractive ($56,532 and $61,350, respectively). This cost per saved quality-adjusted life-year is similar to many other medical interventions but is markedly higher than other primary prevention vaccines, which are mostly associated with a negative ratio. In view of the conducted study, and taking $60,000 as a limit cost per saved quality-adjusted life-year, we propose selective vaccination for physicians and for paramedical workers.

1863,Cost-utility analysis of hepatitis A prevention among health-care workers in Israel,"This study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of different strategies of preventing hepatitis A (HA) among physicians, nurses, and paramedical staff by means of cost-effectiveness analysis. The strategies compared were passive immunization during a hepatitis A outbreak, systematic mass vaccination of all workers, and screening for antibodies to HA virus followed by vaccination of nonimmune employees. To predict the prevented number of HA cases, an epidemiological model was incorporated based on our previous nationwide study on clinical HA cases, seroepidemiological survey, and other scientific medical literature. Under the model assumptions, the lowest cost per prevented HA case ($6240) was achieved by screening prior vaccination among 18- to 39-year-old physicians and paramedical workers, and highest ($61,858) by mass vaccination of nurses over age 39 years. Because the price per prevented case may show that mass vaccination is highly cost-effective, especially among 18- to 39-year-old physicians and paramedical workers ($6399 and $8196, respectively), the cost per gained quality-adjusted life-year seems less attractive ($56,532 and $61,350, respectively).

1865,Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic indomethacin in very-low-birth-weight infants,"OBJECTIVE: To perform cost-effectiveness analysis to facilitate the decision-making process surrounding use of indomethacin in preterm infants to lower the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and death. METHODS: A MEDLINE literature search from 1966 to July 2000 was performed to identify relevant randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), as well as cohort and retrospective case-control studies. A decision tree was built representing the choice to use or not use indomethacin, and the potential outcome costs. Probabilities of being in each chance node were obtained from this search. Where data probabilities were not clear, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: There was no difference in the expected survival per year; however, there was a significant difference when effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in 11 and 10 years for the indomethacin and control groups, respectively. The indomethacin treatment cost was $95,157 and that of the control groups was $99,955. The cost effectiveness per life expectancy of being in the indomethacin and control groups was $7142 and $7727, respectively. The sensitivity analysis for PDA closure and prevention of IVH for infants eventually developing PDA versus those without PDA showed no difference. The cost-effectiveness analysis per QALY was $8443 for the indomethacin treatment and $9168 for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic use of indomethacin is less costly and more effective within an important range of certainty. However, this analysis does not include several potentially confounding factors, such as antenatal steroid use or indomethacin-induced renal toxicity. Depending on the frequency with which these factors arise, economic projections may be considerably altered against the early use of indomethacin.",2002-01-01115,11847937,Ann Pharmacother,Martin P Moya,2002,36 / 2,218-24,No,11847937,"Martin P Moya; Ronald N Goldberg; Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic indomethacin in very-low-birth-weight infants, Ann Pharmacother, 2002-Feb; 36(2):1060-0280; 218-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic use of indomethacin to lower incidence vs. Standard treatment,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-4798,United States,2000,-7211.24
1866,Cost-effectiveness of gemfibrozil for coronary heart disease patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: the Department of Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial,"BACKGROUND: Although numerous clinical trials and economic analyses have established the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of lowering cholesterol for the prevention of coronary heart disease, there are few data on the role of raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and lowering triglyceride levels. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program HDL-C Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) was a multicenter, randomized trial of gemfibrozil, an agent that raised HDL-C levels and lowered triglyceride levels, yet had no effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The study showed that gemfibrozil therapy significantly reduced major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) in patients with coronary heart disease, low HDL-C levels, and low LDL-C levels. OBJECTIVE: To report the results of a cost-effectiveness study based on the results of the VA-HIT. METHODS: The cost per year of life gained with gemfibrozil therapy was calculated. Hazard functions were estimated, and the resulting probabilities were used in a Markov model simulation to estimate the effect of gemfibrozil on life expectancy and costs over a simulated lifetime. Sensitivity analyses were used to account for uncertainty. RESULTS: Using the prices of gemfibrozil that were negotiated by the VA, gemfibrozil was cost saving. Using drug prices found outside the VA, a quality-adjusted life-year saved by gemfibrozil therapy cost between $6300 and $17 100. CONCLUSIONS: Gemfibrozil reduces major cardiovascular events in male coronary heart disease patients with low levels of HDL-C and low levels of LDL-C and would result in cost saving at annual drug costs of $100 or less in 1998 dollars. Even at the higher drug prices represented by the average wholesale price in the United States, the cost of a life-year saved is well below the threshold that would be deemed cost-effective. To our knowledge, this is the first economic analysis based on clinical trial data to assess the cost-effectiveness of raising HDL-C levels and lowering triglyceride levels in a setting in which LDL-C levels were not lowered.",2002-01-01120,11802751,Arch Intern Med,John A Nyman,2002,162 / 2,177-82,No,11802751,"John A Nyman; Melissa S Martinson; David Nelson; Sean Nugent; Dorothea Collins; Janet Wittes; Carol L Fye; Timothy J Wilt; Sander J Robins; Hanna Bloomfield Rubins; Cost-effectiveness of gemfibrozil for coronary heart disease patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: the Department of Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial, Arch Intern Med, 2002-Jan-28; 162(2):0003-9926; 177-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gemfibrozil treatment vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-716.67,United States,1998,-1137.92
1867,Antihypertensive treatment with and without benazepril in patients with chronic renal insufficiency: a US economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic analysis in the US of antihypertensive treatment with and without benazepril in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. DESIGN: A four-state Markov model, using clinical data obtained from a 3-year randomised clinical trial [the Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibition in Progressive Renal Insufficiency (AIPRI) study] plus its extension study (median 3.6 years), and cost data obtained from published US sources. The period of analysis was 7 years following randomisation. PERSPECTIVE: Healthcare payer. SETTING: Clinical data were obtained from multiple medical centres in three European countries as described in the published studies. Key economic data were obtained from the US Healthcare Financing Administration""s End Stage Renal Disease programme. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In the clinical studies on which this economic analysis was based, patients with chronic renal insufficiency of various aetiologies were randomised to antihypertensive therapy with or without concomitant benazepril. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Over 7 years of analysis, patients randomised to antihypertensive treatment with concomitant benazepril therapy incurred on average USD12991 (1999 values) lower medical costs than patients prescribed antihypertensive treatment without benazepril, and obtained an additional 0.091 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were greater for the benazepril arm than the placebo arm for all years of analysis after the first. Rank order stability of results favouring the benazepril therapy arm was found in sensitivity analyses of changes in key model parameters. Additional economic and health benefits favouring patients receiving benazepril would be seen if underlying model rates of dialysis and transplantation were increased, as may be appropriate to reflect treatment practice differences in the US relative to European countries. CONCLUSIONS: Benazepril therapy as a component of antihypertensive treatment of persons with chronic renal insufficiency initially costs money, but investment costs are recouped quickly and return on investment continues to grow. The impact of end-stage renal disease on patient health and healthcare costs is great. Thus, the quality-adjusted survival benefits and overall cost savings seen in benazepril recipients over a prolonged period (2 to 7 years) indicate that the strategy of prescribing benazepril to reduce progression of renal disease in patients with renal insufficiency is both clinically and economically beneficial compared with current antihypertensive regimens without ACE inhibition.",2002-01-01128,11817991,Pharmacoeconomics,Thomas J Hogan,2002,20 / 14,37-47,Yes,11817991,"Thomas J Hogan; William J Elliott; Arnold H Seto; George L Bakris; Antihypertensive treatment with and without benazepril in patients with chronic renal insufficiency: a US economic evaluation, Pharmacoeconomics, 2002; 20(14):1179-2027; 37-47",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine antihypertensive treatment plus benazepril vs. Routine antihypertensive treatment plus placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,7 Years,3.00,3.00,-141206.52,United States,1999,-219362.54
1868,Incremental cost-effectiveness of laser therapy for visual loss secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion,"PURPOSE: To ascertain the incremental cost-effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for improving visual loss associated with branch retinal vein occlusion. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis incorporating data from the Branch Vein Occlusion Study Group was performed using patient-based preferences obtained from time tradeoff utility analysis, decision analysis with Markov modeling, and economic modeling with future value analysis. The cost-effectiveness results are expressed in dollars/QALY (dollars expended per quality-adjusted life-year) gained. This unique model takes into account the visual acuity in the better seeing eye and the recurrent risk for visual loss in the contralateral eye. RESULTS: Laser therapy for macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion was associated with an incremental dollars/QALY gained of 6118 dollars (in year 2000 U.S. dollars). Two-way sensitivity analysis, varying the discount rate and the proportion of patients developing a vascular occlusion in the contralateral eye, revealed a range of dollars/QALY gained from 3370 dollars to 19,299 dollars. CONCLUSIONS: Laser therapy appears to be a cost-effective intervention for improving visual loss associated with macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion.

DESIGN: Decision analysis model using a Markov approach to simulate disease progression. SETTING: UK secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of patients with hepatitis C. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Discounted cost per QALY for combination therapy over no treatment was 3791 pounds.

1871,Outcomes and cost-effectiveness of alternative staging strategies for non-small-cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: To identify the optimal strategy for staging the mediastinum of patients with known non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stratified by tumor (T) classification. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic model to compare the health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of three staging strategies: (1) chest computed tomography alone, (2) selective mediastinoscopy, and (3) routine mediastinoscopy. The overall effectiveness and cost of each strategy was a function of the proportion of patients accurately staged and the risks, benefits, and costs of the diagnostic tests and treatments used. Probability estimates and costs were derived from primary data and the literature. We adopted a societal perspective and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Both mediastinoscopy strategies correctly identified more patients with mediastinal involvement (N2/N3 disease) and assigned them to multimodal regimens. Routine mediastinoscopy maximized quality-adjusted life expectancy in all patients, irrespective of T classification, and this result was robust to varying the model estimates over their reported ranges. In T1 patients, selective mediastinoscopy cost $24,500 per QALY gained, compared with $78,800 per QALY gained for routine mediastinoscopy. In T2 and T3 patients, the ICER of routine mediastinoscopy was more favorable ($42,800 and $53,400 per QALY gained, respectively). CONCLUSION: Routine mediastinoscopy maximizes quality-adjusted life expectancy in patients with known NSCLC, and its ICER compares favorably with other currently accepted medical technologies.

RESULTS: Both mediastinoscopy strategies correctly identified more patients with mediastinal involvement (N2/N3 disease) and assigned them to multimodal regimens. Routine mediastinoscopy maximized quality-adjusted life expectancy in all patients, irrespective of T classification, and this result was robust to varying the model estimates over their reported ranges. In T1 patients, selective mediastinoscopy cost $24,500 per QALY gained, compared with $78,800 per QALY gained for routine mediastinoscopy. In T2 and T3 patients, the ICER of routine mediastinoscopy was more favorable ($42,800 and $53,400 per QALY gained, respectively). CONCLUSION: Routine mediastinoscopy maximizes quality-adjusted life expectancy in patients with known NSCLC, and its ICER compares favorably with other currently accepted medical technologies. The survival benefit and cost-effectiveness of this strategy are greater in patients with T2 and T3 tumors and are likely to improve with advances in multimodal therapy.",2002-01-01147,11773178,J Clin Oncol,Nestor F Esnaola,2002,20 / 1,263-73,No,11773178,"Nestor F Esnaola; Sophia N Lazarides; Steven J Mentzer; Karen M Kuntz; Outcomes and cost-effectiveness of alternative staging strategies for non-small-cell lung cancer, J Clin Oncol, 2002-Jan-01; 20(1):0732-183X; 263-73",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine mediastinoscopy vs. Selective mediastinoscopy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,53400,United States,1999,82956.23
1876,Outcomes of tamoxifen chemoprevention for breast cancer in very high-risk women: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To estimate the effects on survival, quality-adjusted survival, and health care costs of using tamoxifen for primary prevention in subgroups of women at very high risk for breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A decision analysis was performed using a hypothetical cohort of women that included subgroups with atypical hyperplasia, Gail risk greater than 5, lobular carcinoma-in-situ, or two or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Data sources were the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results program, time trade-off preference ratings, the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, and the United States Health Care Financing Administration. RESULTS: Our model predicted that tamoxifen would prolong the average survival of cohort members initiating use at ages 35, 50, and 60 years by 70, 42, and 27 days, respectively. It would prolong survival even more for those in the higher-risk groups, especially those with atypical hyperplasia (202, 89, and 45 days). Tamoxifen use was also projected to extend quality-adjusted survival by 158, 80, and 50 days in the atypical hyperplasia group. For younger women in the highest risk groups, chemoprevention with tamoxifen was estimated to have cost savings or be cost-effective, both with and without quality adjustments. CONCLUSION: Chemoprevention with tamoxifen may be particularly beneficial to women with atypical hyperplasia, 5-year Gail model risk greater than 5%, lobular carcinoma-in-situ, or two or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer. The benefits may be greater if tamoxifen is initiated before age 50 years rather than after and if the breast cancer risk reduction conferred by tamoxifen lasts longer than 5 years.

RESULTS: Our model predicted that tamoxifen would prolong the average survival of cohort members initiating use at ages 35, 50, and 60 years by 70, 42, and 27 days, respectively. It would prolong survival even more for those in the higher-risk groups, especially those with atypical hyperplasia (202, 89, and 45 days). Tamoxifen use was also projected to extend quality-adjusted survival by 158, 80, and 50 days in the atypical hyperplasia group. For younger women in the highest risk groups, chemoprevention with tamoxifen was estimated to have cost savings or be cost-effective, both with and without quality adjustments. CONCLUSION: Chemoprevention with tamoxifen may be particularly beneficial to women with atypical hyperplasia, 5-year Gail model risk greater than 5%, lobular carcinoma-in-situ, or two or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer. The benefits may be greater if tamoxifen is initiated before age 50 years rather than after and if the breast cancer risk reduction conferred by tamoxifen lasts longer than 5 years.

1891,Intermittent claudication: cost-effectiveness of revascularization versus exercise therapy,"PURPOSE: To compare the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies for intermittent claudication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By combining data from the literature and original patient data, a Markov decision model was developed to evaluate the societal cost-effectiveness. Patients presented with previously untreated intermittent claudication, and treatment options were exercise, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (with stent placement, if necessary), and/or bypass surgery. Treatment strategies were defined as the initial therapy in combination with secondary treatment options should the initial therapy fail. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life days, expected lifetime costs (in 1995 U.S. dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Compared with an exercise program, revascularization (either angioplasty or bypass surgery) improved effectiveness by 33-61 quality-adjusted life days among patients with no history of coronary artery disease. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $38,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained when angioplasty was performed whenever feasible, as compared with exercise alone, and $311,000 with additional bypass surgery. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to age, history of coronary artery disease, estimated health values for no or mild claudication versus severe claudication, and revascularization costs. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, on average, the expected gain in effectiveness achieved with bypass surgery for intermittent claudication is small compared with the costs.

1895,Treatment with atorvastatin to the National Cholesterol Educational Program goal versus 'usual' care in secondary coronary heart disease prevention. The GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation (GREACE) study,"BACKGROUND: Atorvastatin is very effective in reducing plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. However, there is no long-term survival study that evaluated this statin. PATIENTS-METHODS: To assess the effect of atorvastatin on morbidity and mortality (total and coronary) of patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD), 1600 consecutive patients were randomised either to atorvastatin or to 'usual' medical care. The dose of atorvastatin was titrated from 10 to 80 mg/day, in order to reach the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goal of LDL-C <100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). All patients were followed up for a mean period of 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoints of the study were defined as death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, revascularisation (coronary morbidity) and stroke. Secondary endpoints were the safety and efficacy of the hypolipidaemic drugs as well as the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin. RESULTS: The mean dosage of atorvastatin was 24 mg/day. This statin reduced total chlesterol by 36%, LDL-C by 46%, triglycerides by 31%, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) by 44%, while it increased HDL-C by 7%; all these changes were significant. The NCEP LDL-C and non-HDL-C treatment goals were reached by 95% (n = 759) and 97% (n = 776), respectively, of patients on atorvastatin. Only 14% of the 'usual' care patients received any hypolipidaemic drugs throughout the study and 3% of them reached the NCEP LDL-C treatment goal. The cost per quaility-adjusted life-year gained with atorvastatin was estimated at $US 8350. During this study 196 (24.5%) CHD patients on 'usual' care had a CHD recurrent event or died vs. 96 (12%) CHD patients on atorvastatin; risk ratio (RR) 0.49, confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.73, p < 0.0001. In detail, atorvastatin reduced, in comparison to 'usual' care, total mortality (RR 0.57, CI 0.39-0.78, p = 0.0021), coronary mortality (RR 0.53, CI 0.29-0.74, p = 0.0017), coronary morbidity (RR 0.46, CI 0.25-0.71, p < 0.0001), and stroke (RR 0.53, CI 0.30-0.82, p = 0.034). All subgroups of patients (women, those with diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, age 60 to 75 years, congestive heart failure, recent unstable angina or prior revascularisation) benefited from treatment with atorvastatin. Withdrawal of patients because of side-effects from the atorvastatin group was low (0.75%) and similar to that of the 'usual' care group (0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment of CHD patients with atorvastatin to achieve NCEP lipid targets significantly reduces total and coronary mortality, coronary morbidity and stroke, in comparison to patients receiving 'usual' medical care.

1896,"Economic analysis of galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in the Netherlands","BACKGROUND: The economic impact of dementia on the Dutch health and social services is substantial. OBJECTIVE: To predict the long-term economic impact of galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, in the treatment of Dutch patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: A pharmacoeconomic model was used to predict long-term outcomes. It has two components: an initial module based on clinical trials of galantamine and a subsequent module that predicts when a patient will deteriorate to a level where full time care (FTC) is needed. The analyses take a broad perspective that includes all formal (paid) care, not just those covered by the Dutch health care system. Direct cost estimates were based on resource use profiles of patients with Alzheimer's disease in the Netherlands. Key inputs were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: After 10.5 years all patients are predicted to require FTC. For every hundred patients starting treatment on galantamine at the mild to moderate stage, it is predicted that 18 person-years of FTC will be avoided (14.4 discounted) and about 5 quality-adjusted years of life will be gained (3.9 discounted). Net savings for those starting treatment with galantamine are estimated at NLG 3,050 (1,676 UDS). The cost of galantamine accounts for only about 5.0% of the total cost of care for treated Alzheimer's patients. The direction of these results remained unchanged when input values and assumptions were tested in sensitivity analyses.

1899,Prophylactic cranial irradiation revisited: cost-effectiveness and quality of life in small-cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: To investigate the therapeutic usefulness and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who had achieved a complete remission. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients diagnosed in Saskatchewan with SCLC between 1987 and 1998 inclusive. Patients who achieved a complete remission were divided into two groups, depending on whether they underwent PCI (PCI+ and PCI-, respectively). The quality-of-life-adjusted survival was estimated by the Q-TWiST method (quality time without symptoms and toxicity). The mean incremental costs per month of incremental OS were calculated in a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Among the 98 complete remission patients, the median OS for PCI+ and PCI- patients was 20.0 and 19.0 months, respectively (p > 0.05, nonsignificant). The median disease-free survival was 14.7 and 10.0 months, respectively (p < 0.05). The difference in the mean Q-TWiST survival was significant (p < 0.01). The mean marginal cost was $18,834/PCI+ patient and $17,885/PCI- patient (p > 0.05, nonsignificant).
