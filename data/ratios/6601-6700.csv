6601,Cost-effectiveness of switching to biphasic insulin aspart from human premix insulin in a US setting,"Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of switching to biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp 30) from human premix insulin for type 2 diabetes patients in the United States (US) setting. Methods: The previously published and validated IMS Core Diabetes Model was used to project life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and costs over 30 years. Patient characteristics and treatment effects were based on Canadian patients included the IMPROVE observational study (n = 311). Mean glycohaemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was 8.4%, duration of diabetes 16 years and prevalence of complications high at baseline. Simulations were conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer, with costs accounted in 2008 US dollars ($). Results: BIAsp 30 was projected to improve life expectancy by 0.202 years and QALE by 0.301 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), due to a reduced incidence of most diabetes-related complications. BIAsp 30 was associated with increased lifetime direct medical costs ($76,517 vs. 67,518) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $29,870 per QALY gained. Long-term outcomes were sensitive to the impact of BIAsp 30 on hypoglycaemia and changes in HbA(1c). Conclusions: BIAsp 30 may represent a cost-effective treatment option in the US setting for advanced type 2 diabetes patients experiencing poor glycaemic control or hypoglycaemia on human premix insulin. Limitations: The application of treatment effect data derived from a Canadian cohort to the US setting was a limitation of the cost-effectiveness analysis.

6602,Analytic model comparing the cost utility of TVT versus duloxetine in women with urinary stress incontinence,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to assess cost utility of duloxetine versus tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) as a second-line treatment for urinary stress incontinence. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the cost utility based on a 2-year follow-up period. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation was performed by assuming a disutility rate of 0.05. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, although duloxetine was a cheaper option, TVT gave a considerably higher QALY gain. When a longer follow-up period was considered, TVT had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound7,710 ($12,651) at 10 years. If the QALY gain from cure was 0.09, then the ICER for duloxetine and TVT would both fall within the indicative National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence willingness to pay threshold at 2 years, but TVT would be the cost-effective option having extended dominance over duloxetine.

6606,Cost-Utility Analysis of Topical Intranasal Steroids for Otitis Media with Effusion Based on Evidence from the GNOME Trial,"ABSTRACT Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of topical intranasal steroids for the treatment of otitis media with effusion (OME) in primary care from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted based on evidence from the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled GPRF [General Practice Research Framework] Nasal Steroids for Otitis Media with Effusion (GNOME) trial. Participants comprised 217 children aged 4-11 years who had at least one episode of otitis media or related ear problem in the previous 12 months and had tympanometrically confirmed bilateral OME. Children were randomly allocated to receive either mometasone furoate 50 microg or placebo spray once daily into each nostril for 3 months. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for topical steroids compared with placebo. The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to present cost-effectiveness acceptability curves at alternative willingness to pay thresholds. Results: Children receiving topical steroids accrued nonsignificantly higher costs (incremental cost/child: pound11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: - pound199 to pound222) and nonsignificantly fewer QALYs (incremental QALY gain/child: -0.0166, 95% CI: -0.0652 to 0.0320) than those receiving placebo. Topical steroids had a 24.19% probability of being cost-effective at a pound20,000 per QALY gained threshold, a 23.82% probability of being more effective and a 46.25% probability of being less costly. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses showed incremental costs and benefits to be highly sensitive to the methods used and the patient group considered, although differences between groups did not reach statistical significance in any analysis. Conclusions: Topical steroids are unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment for OME in general practice.",2010-01-05972,20345546,Value Health,Stavros Petrou,2010,/,,Yes,20345546,"Stavros Petrou; Cost-Utility Analysis of Topical Intranasal Steroids for Otitis Media with Effusion Based on Evidence from the GNOME Trial, Value Health, 2010-Mar-22; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Topical steroids; 50 ug mometasone furoate nasal spray vs. Placebo nasal spray,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,9 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-660.59,United Kingdom,2006,-1563.27
6607,The Cost-Effectiveness of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Type 1 Diabetes,"AbstractObjective: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been found to improve glucose control in type 1 diabetes patients. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of CGM versus standard glucose monitoring in type 1 diabetes. Research Design and Methods: This societal cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in trial populations where CGM has produced a significant glycemic benefit (HbA(1C) >/=7.0% cohort- adults >/=25 years, HbA(1C)<7.0% cohort- all ages). Trial data were integrated into a simulation model of type 1 diabetes complications. The main outcome was the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: During the trials, CGM patients experienced an immediate quality of life benefit (HbA(1C)>/=7.0% cohort : 0.70 quality-adjusted life weeks (QALWs) p=0.49; HbA(1C)<7.0% cohort: 1.39 QALWs, p=0.04) and improved glucose control. In the long-term CEA for the HbA(1C)>/=7.0% cohort, CGM was projected to reduce the lifetime probability of microvascular complications; the average gain in QALYs was 0.60. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $98,679/QALY (95% confidence intervals (CI), -60K (4(th) quadrant), -87K (2(nd) quadrant)). For the HbA(1C)<7.0% cohort, the average gain in QALYs was 1.11. The ICER was $78,943/QALY (95% CI, 15k (1(st) quadrant), -291K (2(nd) quadrant)). If the benefit of CGM had been limited to the long-term effects of improved glucose control, the ICER would exceed $700,000/QALY. If test strip use had been 2 per day with CGM long-term, the ICER for CGM would improve significantly.

6612,Controlling hypertension immediately post stroke: a cost utility analysis of a pilot randomised controlled trial,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure (BP) levels are common following acute stroke. However, there is considerable uncertainty if and when antihypertensive therapy should be initiated. METHOD: Economic evaluation alongside a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial (National Research Register Trial Number N0484128008) of 112 hypertensive patients receiving an antihypertensive regimen (labetalol or lisinopril) within 36 hours post stroke versus 59 receiving placebo. Outcomes were incremental cost per incremental: QALY, survivor, and patient free from death or severe disability (modified Rankin scale score < 4) at three months and 14 days post stroke. RESULTS: Actively treated patients on average had superior outcomes and lower costs than controls at three months. From the perspective of the acute hospital setting, there was a 96.5% probability that the incremental cost per QALY gained at three months is below pound30,000, although the probability may be overstated due to data limitations. CONCLUSION: Antihypertensive therapy when indicated immediately post stroke may be cost-effective compared with placebo from the acute hospital perspective.

Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nsNSAIDS + PPIs relative to alternative gastroprotective regimens in the prevention of GI complications among elderly patients (aged >/=65y). Methods: An incremental cost-utility analysis, comparing PPIs with alternative gastroprotective regimens was conducted using a decision analytical model. Clinical outcomes, costs, and utilities were derived from recently published studies. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results to variation in model inputs and assumptions. Results: The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of PPIs, relative to nsNSAID alone, was $206,315 per QALY gained. Other co-prescribed treatment options had higher costs per QALY gained. In patients with a history of a complicated or uncomplicated ulcer, PPIs had ICURs of $24,277 and $40,876 respectively.

6616,Cost-utility analysis of proton pump inhibitors and other gastro-protective agents for prevention of gastrointestinal complications in elderly patients taking non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents,"Abstract Background: Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) among elderly patients using non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) has increased - the price of PPIs is higher than the majority of alternative treatment strategies. Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nsNSAIDS + PPIs relative to alternative gastroprotective regimens in the prevention of GI complications among elderly patients (aged >/=65y). Methods: An incremental cost-utility analysis, comparing PPIs with alternative gastroprotective regimens was conducted using a decision analytical model. Clinical outcomes, costs, and utilities were derived from recently published studies. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results to variation in model inputs and assumptions. Results: The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of PPIs, relative to nsNSAID alone, was $206,315 per QALY gained. Other co-prescribed treatment options had higher costs per QALY gained. In patients with a history of a complicated or uncomplicated ulcer, PPIs had ICURs of $24,277 and $40,876 respectively.

6617,Cost-effectiveness of a programme to detect and provide better care for female victims of intimate partner violence,"OBJECTIVE: Primary care clinicians often fail to detect women who are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). Our aim was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a programme in primary care to detect and support such women. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of education and support for primary care clinicians to increase their identification of survivors of IPV and to refer them to a specialist advocacy agency or a psychologist with specialist skills. The programme was implemented in three general practices in the United Kingdom (with an additional practice acting as a control) and provided cost data and rates of identification and referral. Other cost data and the effectiveness of IPV advocacy came from published sources. RESULTS: The model gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of approximately pound2,450 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Although the ratio increased in some of the sensitivity analyses, most were under a conventional willingness to pay threshold ( pound30,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: While there is considerable uncertainty in the underlying parameters, a training programme for primary care teams to increase identification and referral of women experiencing IPV is likely to be cost-effective.",2010-01-05984,20308226,J Health Serv Res Policy,Rosana Norman,2010,/,,No,20308226,"Rosana Norman; Cost-effectiveness of a programme to detect and provide better care for female victims of intimate partner violence, J Health Serv Res Policy, 2010-Mar-22; ():1355-8196",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Program in primary care to detect and support women who are victims of intimate partner violence vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,10 Years,Not Stated,3.50,2450,United Kingdom,2005,5910.26
6618,Potential cost-effectiveness of denosumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women,"Denosumab has recently been shown to be safe and to significantly reduce the risk of vertebral, hip and non-vertebral fractures in the ""Fracture REduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis every 6Months"" (FREEDOM) Trial. Besides the clinical profile of a new drug, it becomes increasingly important to assess whether the drug represents good value for money. This study aims to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of denosumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women. An updated version of a validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the cost (euro2009) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of a 3-year denosumab treatment compared with no treatment. The model was populated with cost and epidemiological data for Belgium from a health-care perspective and the base-case population was defined from the FREEDOM Trial. The effect of denosumab after treatment cessation was conservatively assumed to decline linearly over 1year. Uncertainty was investigated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In particular, additional analyses were performed in populations (over 60years) where osteoporosis medications are currently reimbursed in many European countries, i.e. with bone mineral density (BMD) T-score</=-2.5 or prevalent vertebral fracture. In the base-case analysis, the cost per QALY gained of denosumab compared with no treatment was estimated at euro28,441. This value decreased to euro15,532 and to euro11,603 for women with a BMD T-score of -2.5 or prevalent vertebral fracture, respectively. Additional analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness of denosumab fall below commonly accepted threshold of euro30,000per QALY gained for women with a BMD T-score </=-2.5 or prevalent vertebral fracture, over the entire age range examined (60-80years). The results were robust under a wide range of plausible assumptions. In conclusion, this study suggests, on the basis of currently available data, that denosumab is cost-effective compared with no treatment for postmenopausal Belgian women with low bone mass and who are similar to patients included in the FREEDOM Trial.

6621,The cost-effectiveness of particle therapy in non-small cell lung cancer: Exploring decision uncertainty and areas for future research,"PURPOSE: To review and synthesize all available evidence in order to explore the cost-effectiveness of particle therapy (carbon-ions, protons) compared to the best current treatments for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the value of additional research. The present study focuses on stage I NSCLC, as no data is available for more advanced stages. METHODS: A probabilistic decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to synthesize all available evidence. Comparative treatments were carbon-ions, protons, conventional radiotherapy (CRT) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) for inoperable stage I NSCLC; and carbon-ions and SBRT for operable stage I NSCLC. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was calculated to support research decisions. RESULTS: For inoperable stage I NSCLC, carbon-ion therapy costed euro67.257 per quality-adjusted-life-year gained compared to SBRT. Both treatments dominated protons and CRT. Considerable uncertainty surrounded these results, resulting in a high EVPI. For operable stage I NSCLC SBRT dominated carbon-ion therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the considerable uncertainty in stage I NSCLC, and the lack of data on more advanced stages, it is recommended not to adopt particle therapy as standard treatment in NSCLC yet. More evidence is needed to reduce the decision uncertainty and to support evidence-based treatment decisions. It might be worthwhile to invest in a particle facility for clinical research.

6623,Defining Patients at High Risk for Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage after Drug-Eluting Stent Placement: A Cost Utility Analysis,"Introduction: The study goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stent (DES) placement with consideration of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk. DES reduce the need for future coronary revascularization, but require prolonged dual anti-platelet (DAT) therapy, which may increase the risk for GI bleeding. While DES have been found to be cost-effective in patients at average risk for GI bleeding, they may not be the most cost-effective strategy in higher risk patients. Methods: A Markov model was created to compare DES with bare metal stents (BMS). Patients were a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old individuals with coronary artery stenosis that required nonemergent percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCI). The primary outcomes were the threshold incremental risks of GI bleeding from DAT based on willingness to pay (WTP) of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: For a WTP of $100,000, the relative risk of GI bleeding from DAT could be as high as 10.8 (when compared to aspirin alone) before DES would no longer be cost-effective. In patients with two risk factors for GI bleeding, the threshold relative risk could be as low as 1.6. Conclusion: In average-risk patients, the risk of GI bleeding from DAT can be substantial without affecting the cost-effectiveness of DES. However, DES are unlikely to be cost-effective in patients with two or more risk factors for GI bleeding.

6624,The value of new chemotherapeutic agents for metastatic colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: New chemotherapeutic agents for patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer have been singled out as examples of high-cost/low-value medical care. We measure trends in life expectancy and lifetime medical costs in this patient population between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2005. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we constructed a sample of 4665 patients aged 66 and older diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2005, who received chemotherapeutic agents. We estimated life expectancy and lifetime medical costs based on observed short-term survival rates and costs. RESULTS: Life expectancy increased by 6.8 months and lifetime costs by $37 100 (2006 dollars). The implied cost per life-year gained is $66 200 (95% confidence interval, $48 100-$84 200). After discounting life-years and costs and adjusting for patients' health utility and out-of-pocket payments, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained is $99 100 (95% confidence interval, $72 300-$125 900). CONCLUSIONS: New chemotherapeutic agents are associated with improvements in survival time but also with substantial costs. The cost-effectiveness ratio for these drugs as a group is below commonly cited estimates of the willingness-to-pay for a life-year. However, open-ended coverage policies for new chemotherapeutic agents may prove difficult to sustain as costs continue to rise.",2010-01-05997,20233802,Arch Intern Med,David H Howard,2010,170 / 6,537-42,No,20233802,"David H Howard; The value of new chemotherapeutic agents for metastatic colorectal cancer, Arch Intern Med, 2010-Mar-22; 170(6):0003-9926; 537-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with chemotherapeutic agents vs. No treatment of chemotherapeutic agents,Not Stated,66 Years,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,99100,United States,2006,127223.07

A health-state transition model, based on two randomized phase III studies of erlotinib or docetaxel versus best supportive care, was used to estimate total direct costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the subsequent net monetary benefit. Erlotinib was associated with a reduction in total costs ( pound13 730 versus pound13 956) and improved outcomes (total QALYs of 0.238 versus 0.206) compared with docetaxel. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of this analysis. In summary, erlotinib appeared to generate similar overall survival, an increase in QALYs and a small reduction in total NHS costs compared with docetaxel, due to lower adverse event and drug administration costs. Consequently, from a health economics perspective for the treatment of relapsed stage III - IV NSCLC patients in the UK, erlotinib has advantages over docetaxel.",2010-01-05998,20233509,J Int Med Res,Gavin Lewis,2010,38 / 1,9-21,No,20233509,"Gavin Lewis; Cost-effectiveness of Erlotinib versus Docetaxel for Second-line Treatment of Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer in the United Kingdom, J Int Med Res, 2010 Jan-Feb; 38(1):0300-0605; 9-21",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Erlotinib vs. Docetaxel,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.50,3.50,-7062.5,United Kingdom,2008,-15743.93

METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed to compare the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs associated with HRA versus THA from the healthcare system perspective over a 30-year time horizon. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of patient characteristics, clinical outcome probabilities, quality of life and costs on the discounted incremental costs, incremental clinical effectiveness, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of HRA compared to THA. RESULTS: MoM HRA was associated with modest improvements in QALYs at a small incremental cost, and had an ICER less than $50,000 per QALY gained for men younger than 65 and for women younger than 55. MoM HRA and THA failure rates, device costs, and the difference in quality of life after conversion from HRA to THA compared to primary THA had the largest impact on costs and quality of life.

However, the cost effectiveness of MoM HRA compared with THA is unclear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MoM HRA to THA. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed to compare the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs associated with HRA versus THA from the healthcare system perspective over a 30-year time horizon. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of patient characteristics, clinical outcome probabilities, quality of life and costs on the discounted incremental costs, incremental clinical effectiveness, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of HRA compared to THA. RESULTS: MoM HRA was associated with modest improvements in QALYs at a small incremental cost, and had an ICER less than $50,000 per QALY gained for men younger than 65 and for women younger than 55.

6632,Cost-effectiveness of school-based asthma screening in an urban setting,"BACKGROUND: Much has been done to promote population-based childhood asthma screening; however, concerns remain regarding its cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of school-based asthma screening strategies. METHODS: A 5 health state Markov approach (symptom-free, symptom, exacerbation recovery, emergency department, and hospitalization day) was used to evaluate school-based screening in a simulated population of urban elementary-age school children. Two questionnaire and 2 multistage strategies incorporating spirometry or spirometry with exercise testing were evaluated from the societal perspective by using 365 daily cycles. The outcome was 2006 dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The most efficient strategy identified children with previously diagnosed but poorly controlled asthma at a cost of $150,000 per QALY (95% CI, $65,800-$318,000). Uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness estimate was primarily a result of the symptom day preference weight estimate (44%), the probability of confirmation after screening (17%), the adequacy of asthma control in the population (9%), and the estimated treatment effect on symptoms (6%). Screening generated an additional 21 symptom-free day equivalents per child identified with previously diagnosed but not well controlled asthma and led to $85.55, $12.36, and $2.58 in additional screening, daily treatment, and indirect costs and $5.01 less in emergency department and hospitalization costs. CONCLUSION: Population-based asthma screening is not cost-effective at $50,000 per QALY and has only a 20% chance of being cost-effective at $100,000 per QALY. The most efficient approach is to screen for previously diagnosed but poorly controlled asthma.

6633,Surveillance Colonoscopy is Cost-Effective for Patients with Adenomas who are at High Risk for Colorectal Cancer,"BACKGROUND & AIMS:: Guidelines recommend that patients with colon adenomas undergo periodic surveillance colonoscopy. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these recommendations. METHODS:: We developed a Markov model based on published literature to study various surveillance strategies from the perspective of a long-term payer. We modeled a cohort of patients who were 50 years of age with newly diagnosed colonic adenomas and followed them until death. Thirty percent of the population was assumed to be at high risk for colorectal cancer (i.e. had an advanced adenoma). Costs (2008 US dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured. RESULTS:: Performing colonoscopies every 3 years in high-risk patients and every 10 years in low-risk patients (3/10 strategy) was more costly but also more effective than no surveillance, with an ICER of $5,743 per QALY gained. Compared to this 3/10 strategy, a 3/5 strategy was considerably more costly but only marginally more effective, with an ICER of $296,266 per QALY. A 3/3 strategy was more costly and less effective than a 3/5 strategy (dominated). Results were most sensitive to the annual probability of advanced adenoma formation and the relative risk (RR) of advanced adenoma formation in high-risk versus low-risk patients. Assuming that the probability of advanced adenoma formation was 1.3% per year (base: 0.5%), the ICER of the 3/5 strategy was below $50,000 per QALY gained if the RR of advanced adenoma formation was less than 2.4 (base: 3.9).

6636,Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among healthcare workers during an influenza pandemic,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) among healthcare workers compared with nonuse of PPV during an influenza pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Markov modeling was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PPV in previously unvaccinated healthcare workers during an influenza pandemic. METHODS: Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence rates were incorporated into the model, which assumed that IPD events occurred at twice the usual rate during a year of pandemic influenza. Societal and hospital perspectives were examined. Assumptions were that pneumococcal disease transmission from healthcare worker to patient did not occur, heightened IPD risk occurred for only 1 year, and PPV did not prevent noninvasive pneumonia, all of which potentially bias against vaccination. RESULTS: From a societal standpoint, PPV of healthcare workers during an influenza pandemic is economically reasonable, costing $2935 per quality-adjusted life-year gained; results were robust to variation in multiple sensitivity analyses. However, from the hospital perspective, vaccinating healthcare workers was expensive, costing $1676 per employee absence day avoided, given an IPD risk that (although increased) would remain less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating all healthcare workers to protect against pneumococcal disease during a pandemic influenza outbreak is likely to be economically reasonable from the societal standpoint. However, PPV is expensive from the hospital perspective, which might prevent implementation of a PPV program unless it is externally subsidized.",2010-01-06013,20225915,Am J Manag Care,Kenneth J Smith,2010,16 / 3,200-6,No,20225915,"Kenneth J Smith; Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among healthcare workers during an influenza pandemic, Am J Manag Care, 2010-Mar; 16(3):1096-1860; 200-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccination of healthcare workers with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine during an influenza pandemic vs. No vaccination of healthcare workers,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,2935,United States,2006,3767.91
6637,Modeled economic evaluation of alternative strategies to reduce sudden cardiac death among children treated for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"BACKGROUND: Stimulants are widely used to treat children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and may increase the risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examined the cost-effectiveness of pretreatment screening with ECG for reducing SCD risk in children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder who are candidates for stimulant medication. Method and Results- We constructed a state-transition Markov model with 10 annual cycles spanning 7 to 17 years of age. Taking a societal perspective, we compared the cost-effectiveness of 3 screening strategies: (1) performing a history and physical examination with cardiology referral if abnormal (current standard of care); (2) performing a history and physical examination plus ECG after negative history and physical examination, with cardiology referral if either is abnormal; and (3) performing a history and physical examination plus ECG, with cardiology referral only if ECG is abnormal. Children identified with SCD-associated cardiac abnormalities would be restricted from stimulants and from playing competitive sports. The expected incremental cost-effectiveness over strategy 1 was $39,300 and $27,200 per quality-adjusted life-year for strategies 2 and 3, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation found that the chance of incremental cost-effectiveness was 55% for strategy 2 and 71% for strategy 3 (willingness to pay < or =$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year). Both strategies 2 and 3 would avert 13 SCDs per 400,000 children seeking stimulant treatment for ADHD, for a cost of $1.6 million per life for strategy 2 and $1.2 million per life for strategy 3. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to current practice, adding ECG screening to history and physical examination pretreatment screening for children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder has borderline cost-effectiveness for preventing SCD.

STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic model was created to compare a policy of universal SMA screening to that of no screening. The primary outcome was incremental cost per maternal quality-adjusted life year. Probabilities, costs, and outcomes were estimated through literature review. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of our model to changes in baseline assumptions. RESULTS: Universal screening for SMA is not cost-effective at $4.9 million per quality-adjusted life year. In all, 12,500 women need to be screened to prevent 1 case of SMA, at a cost of $5.0 million per case averted. Our results were most sensitive to the baseline prevalence of disease. CONCLUSION: Universal prenatal screening for SMA is not cost-effective.

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modeling and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the comparison between second-generation regimens without prophylactic G-CSF and third-generation regimens with prophylactic G-CSF. The comparisons consisted of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, a second-generation regimen, versus docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) with G-CSF, a third-generation regimen; and doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T) q3wk, a second-generation regimen, versus dose-dense (DD) AC-T q2wk with G-CSF, a third-generation regimen. Patients were stratified by the age at which chemotherapy was started into cohorts aged 35, 45, and 55 years. Outcomes were estimated in terms of life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs). ICER calculations were done from a societal perspective. We also estimated the budget impact, which included the additional public medical expenditures that would cover all subsequent changes after the additional cost of choosing third-generation regimens if G-CSF were approved for use in third-generation regimens for breast cancer. Costs were calculated using prescription drug prices as of 2006. RESULTS: Estimated ICER values for TAC with prophylactic G-CSF were yen956,471/LY and yen919,443/ QALY for age 35 years, yen1,125,540/LY and yen1,078,967/QALY for age 45 years, and yen1,302,746/LY and yen1,224,896/QALY for age 55 years. Values for DD AC-T q2wk with prophylactic G-CSF were yen291,931/LY and yen311,232/QALY for age 35 years, yen357,354/LY and yen380,148/QALY for age 45 years, and yen377,011/LY and yen399,761/QALY for age 55 years.

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modeling and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the comparison between second-generation regimens without prophylactic G-CSF and third-generation regimens with prophylactic G-CSF. The comparisons consisted of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, a second-generation regimen, versus docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) with G-CSF, a third-generation regimen; and doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T) q3wk, a second-generation regimen, versus dose-dense (DD) AC-T q2wk with G-CSF, a third-generation regimen. Patients were stratified by the age at which chemotherapy was started into cohorts aged 35, 45, and 55 years. Outcomes were estimated in terms of life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs). ICER calculations were done from a societal perspective. We also estimated the budget impact, which included the additional public medical expenditures that would cover all subsequent changes after the additional cost of choosing third-generation regimens if G-CSF were approved for use in third-generation regimens for breast cancer. Costs were calculated using prescription drug prices as of 2006.

RESULTS: Getting children vaccinated by the end of October rather than when they are currently getting vaccinated could save society between $6.4 million and $9.2 million plus 653 and 926 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and third-party payers between $4.1 million and $6.1 million plus 647 to 942 QALYs each year. Decision makers may want to continue offering influenza vaccination to children at least through the end of December. Vaccinating with trivalent inactivated virus vaccine was more cost-effective than vaccinating with live attenuated influenza vaccine for every month.

6658,Potential clinical and economic impact of nonadherence with osteoporosis medications,"This study aims to estimate the potential clinical and economic implications of therapeutic adherence to bisphosphonate therapy. A validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the impact of varying adherence to bisphosphonate therapy on outcomes (the number of fractures and the quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), health-care costs, and the cost-effectiveness of therapy compared with no treatment. Adherence was divided into persistence and compliance, and multiple scenarios were considered for both concepts. Analyses were performed for women aged 65 years with a bone mineral density T-score of -2.5. Health outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of therapy improved significantly with increasing compliance and/or persistence. In the case of real-world persistence and with a medical possession ratio (MPR; i.e., the number of doses taken divided by the number of doses prescribed) of 100%, the QALY gain and the number of fractures prevented represented only 48 and 42% of the values estimated assuming full persistence, respectively. These proportions fell to 27 and 23% with an MPR value of 80%. The costs per QALY gained, for branded bisphosphonates (and generic alendronate), were estimated at 19,069 euros (4,871 euros), 32,278 euros (11,985 euros), and 64,052 euros (30,181 euros) for MPR values of 100, 80, and 60%, respectively, assuming real-world persistence. These values were 16,997 euros (2,215 euros), 24,401 euros (6,179 eruos), and 51,750 euros (20,569 euros), respectively, assuming full persistence.

6665,Potential clinical and economic impact of nonadherence with osteoporosis medications,"This study aims to estimate the potential clinical and economic implications of therapeutic adherence to bisphosphonate therapy. A validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the impact of varying adherence to bisphosphonate therapy on outcomes (the number of fractures and the quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), health-care costs, and the cost-effectiveness of therapy compared with no treatment. Adherence was divided into persistence and compliance, and multiple scenarios were considered for both concepts. Analyses were performed for women aged 65 years with a bone mineral density T-score of -2.5. Health outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of therapy improved significantly with increasing compliance and/or persistence. In the case of real-world persistence and with a medical possession ratio (MPR; i.e., the number of doses taken divided by the number of doses prescribed) of 100%, the QALY gain and the number of fractures prevented represented only 48 and 42% of the values estimated assuming full persistence, respectively. These proportions fell to 27 and 23% with an MPR value of 80%.

Objectives - To calculate cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for lacosamide as adjunctive treatment for patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures as compared to no adjunctive treatment. Materials and methods - A decision-tree simulation model was constructed to calculate the number of seizures and health-care utilization for treated and untreated with lacosamide, respectively. Prices from 2007 were used for all costs. Results - All results were calculated for a 24-, 18-, 12- and 6-months follow-up. The cost per additional QALY was estimated to euro 27,641 (24 months). Using a willingness-to-pay threshold for a QALY of euro 50,000 the net marginal value of using lacosamide was estimated to about euro 850,000 per 1000 patients. Conclusions - The estimated cost per QALY gained falls within the range of reported estimates of the willingness-to-pay for an additional QALY. The results imply that lacosamide is cost-effective in the treatment of uncontrolled partial-onset seizures (1 euro approximately 9.6 SEK).",2010-01-06040,20199516,Acta Neurol Scand,K Bolin,2010,/,,No,20199516,"K Bolin; Lacosamide as treatment of epileptic seizures - cost utility results for Sweden, Acta Neurol Scand, 2010-Mar-01; ():1600-0404",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lacosamide as an adjunctive therapy vs. Usual care,Not Stated,16 Years,16 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,27641,Euro,2007,47304.95
6678,The Health Technology Assessment of bivalent HPV vaccine Cervarix in Italy,"INTRODUCTION: Health Technology Assessment (HTA) approach was applied to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in the Italian context. METHODS: Epidemiology and costs of HPV infection and related diseases, vaccine efficacy, clinical and economic impact of the HPV vaccination and women's knowledge and attitudes towards vaccination were assessed. RESULTS: HPV infections pooled prevalence in Italy was 19% (95%CI: 10-30%) and cervical cancer incidence was 9.8/100,000 per year. The mean costs for in situ and invasive carcinoma hospitalisation were estimated respectively in euro1745.87 and euro2616.16. HPV vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy and good safety profile. The meta-analysis on efficacy results in preventing persistent cervical infections by HPV16 and 18 for both HPV vaccines resulted in 87% (95%CI: 80-91%) and 78% (95%CI: 62-87%). Modelling the impact of vaccination with bivalent vaccine, it would reduce cancer cases by 67% and be cost-effective, with a cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained of euro22,055.

6679,Cost Effectiveness of 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors for the Prevention of Prostate Cancer in Multiple Patient Populations,"Although 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) have demonstrated that they reduce the risk of prostate cancer (PCa), they have not demonstrated cost effectiveness in the patient populations in which they have been examined. A decision-analytic model was created to explore economic benefits from a third-party payer perspective of the use of 5ARIs in preventing PCa in men with different risk factors for developing the disease. A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of men annually through health states (e.g. healthy male, benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], PCa, PCa recurrence) over a man's lifetime. Men with risk factors were treated with a 5ARI and compared with patients given no chemoprevention. Men from the general population were examined along with higher-risk men who had been referred to a PCa centre. Baseline risk was estimated via published risk data, risk factor analyses and risk equations. Clinical efficacy, morality, costs and utilities were obtained from published literature. Outcomes of the model included number of prostate cancers, incremental costs, incremental QALYs, incremental cost per QALY and number needed to treat. Along with sensitivity and scenario analyses, a validation of outcomes was performed. All costs were valued in $US, year 2009 values. Costs were discounted at 3% per annum. Men receiving 5ARIs benefited through a reduction in the number of PCas. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of $US50 000 per QALY, chemoprevention with 5ARIs was cost effective ($US37 900 per QALY) in men from the general population who were aged 50 years with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and who were aged 50 years with PCa family history and elevated PSA ($US31 065 per QALY). Chemoprevention with 5ARIs was not cost effective in men aged 50 years with no additional risk factors, men aged 50 years with abnormal digital rectal examinations (DREs), and men aged 50 years with a family history ($US86 511, $US85 577 and $US84 950 per QALY, respectively). In higher-risk men, chemoprevention could be expected to be cost effective ($US18 490 to $US11 816 per QALY, depending on risk scenario). Results were sensitive to changes in utilities, assumed PCa risk reduction with 5ARIs, and patient age. When considering common risk factors associated with PCa, prevention with 5ARIs is expected to be cost effective in 50-year-old men with elevated PSA. As a man's risk increases, the cost effectiveness of 5ARI chemoprevention improves.",2010-01-06044,20196623,Pharmacoeconomics,Stephanie R Earnshaw,2010,/,,Yes,20196623,"Stephanie R Earnshaw; Cost Effectiveness of 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors for the Prevention of Prostate Cancer in Multiple Patient Populations, Pharmacoeconomics, 2010-Mar-03; ():1179-2027",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,hemoprevention 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) to avert prostate cancer.

6680,Population Strategies to Decrease Sodium Intake and the Burden of Cardiovascular Disease: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Sodium consumption raises blood pressure, increasing the risk for heart attack and stroke. Several countries, including the United States, are considering strategies to decrease population sodium intake. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 2 population strategies to reduce sodium intake: government collaboration with food manufacturers to voluntarily cut sodium in processed foods, modeled on the United Kingdom experience, and a sodium tax. Design: A Markov model was constructed with 4 health states: well, acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute stroke, and history of MI or stroke. Data Sources: Medical Panel Expenditure Survey (2006), Framingham Heart Study (1980 to 2003), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial, and other published data. Target Population: U.S. adults aged 40 to 85 years. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Outcome Measures: Incremental costs (2008 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and MIs and strokes averted. Results of Base-case Analysis: Collaboration with industry that decreases mean population sodium intake by 9.5% averts 513 885 strokes and 480 358 MIs over the lifetime of adults aged 40 to 85 years who are alive today compared with the status quo, increasing QALYs by 2.1 million and saving $32.1 billion in medical costs. A tax on sodium that decreases population sodium intake by 6% increases QALYs by 1.3 million and saves $22.4 billion over the same period. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results are sensitive to the assumption that consumers have no disutility with modest reductions in sodium intake.

6681,Population Strategies to Decrease Sodium Intake and the Burden of Cardiovascular Disease: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Sodium consumption raises blood pressure, increasing the risk for heart attack and stroke. Several countries, including the United States, are considering strategies to decrease population sodium intake. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 2 population strategies to reduce sodium intake: government collaboration with food manufacturers to voluntarily cut sodium in processed foods, modeled on the United Kingdom experience, and a sodium tax. Design: A Markov model was constructed with 4 health states: well, acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute stroke, and history of MI or stroke. Data Sources: Medical Panel Expenditure Survey (2006), Framingham Heart Study (1980 to 2003), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial, and other published data. Target Population: U.S. adults aged 40 to 85 years. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Outcome Measures: Incremental costs (2008 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and MIs and strokes averted. Results of Base-case Analysis: Collaboration with industry that decreases mean population sodium intake by 9.5% averts 513 885 strokes and 480 358 MIs over the lifetime of adults aged 40 to 85 years who are alive today compared with the status quo, increasing QALYs by 2.1 million and saving $32.1 billion in medical costs. A tax on sodium that decreases population sodium intake by 6% increases QALYs by 1.3 million and saves $22.4 billion over the same period. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results are sensitive to the assumption that consumers have no disutility with modest reductions in sodium intake. Limitation: Efforts to reduce population sodium intake could result in other dietary changes that are difficult to predict. Conclusion: Strategies to reduce sodium intake on a population level in the United States are likely to substantially reduce stroke and MI incidence, which would save billions of dollars in medical expenses.

6682,"A cost-utility analysis of nonsurgical management, total wrist arthroplasty, and total wrist arthrodesis in rheumatoid arthritis","PURPOSE: Management of end-stage rheumatoid wrist disease remains controversial. Total wrist arthrodesis provides reliable pain relief and stability and is the most commonly applied management strategy. Total wrist arthroplasty is a motion-preserving alternative that is gaining popularity. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis comparing nonsurgical management, total wrist arthroplasty, and total wrist arthrodesis for the rheumatoid wrist. METHODS: A time trade-off utility survey was developed to investigate patient and physician preferences for the potential outcomes of total wrist arthroplasty and total wrist arthrodesis. The study sample consisted of rheumatoid patients (N = 49) recruited as part of an ongoing prospective study and a national random sample of hand surgeons and rheumatologists (N = 109). A decision tree was created using utility values derived from the survey, and the expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each procedure were determined. Using the societal perspective, costs were based on the Medicare fee schedules for the Current Procedural Terminology codes associated with total wrist arthroplasty and total wrist arthrodesis and their potential complications. Costs per QALY were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Patients and physicians both showed a preference for surgical management over nonsurgical management. Application of cost data indicated that the incremental cost per additional QALY gained for total wrist arthroplasty over nonsurgical management was $2,281 and the incremental cost per QALY gained with total wrist arthroplasty over total wrist arthrodesis was $2,328, which is substantially less than the national standard of $50,000/QALY deemed acceptable for adoption. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of rigorous outcome data, cost-utility analysis is a useful tool to guide treatment decisions. Total wrist arthroplasty and total wrist arthrodesis are both extremely cost-effective procedures. This study incorporated patient and physician utilities to demonstrate that total wrist arthroplasty has only a small incremental cost over the traditional total wrist arthrodesis procedure. Based on this economic model, total wrist arthroplasty may be worthy of further consideration, and cost should not be considered prohibitive.

6685,Group cognitive behavioural treatment for low-back pain in primary care: a randomised controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Low-back pain is a common and costly problem. We estimated the effectiveness of a group cognitive behavioural intervention in addition to best practice advice in people with low-back pain in primary care. METHODS: In this pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial with parallel cost-effectiveness analysis undertaken in England, 701 adults with troublesome subacute or chronic low-back pain were recruited from 56 general practices and received an active management advisory consultation. Participants were randomly assigned by computer-generated block randomisation to receive an additional assessment and up to six sessions of a group cognitive behavioural intervention (n=468) or no further intervention (control; n=233). Primary outcomes were the change from baseline in Roland Morris disability questionnaire and modified Von Korff scores at 12 months. Assessment of outcomes was blinded and followed the intention-to-treat principle, including all randomised participants who provided follow-up data. This study is registered, number ISRCTN54717854. FINDINGS: 399 (85%) participants in the cognitive behavioural intervention group and 199 (85%) participants in the control group were included in the primary analysis at 12 months. The most frequent reason for participant withdrawal was unwillingness to complete questionnaires. At 12 months, mean change from baseline in the Roland Morris questionnaire score was 1.1 points (95% CI 0.39-1.72) in the control group and 2.4 points (1.89-2.84) in the cognitive behavioural intervention group (difference between groups 1.3 points, 0.56-2.06; p=0.0008). The modified Von Korff disability score changed by 5.4% (1.99-8.90) and 13.8% (11.39-16.28), respectively (difference between groups 8.4%, 4.47-12.32; p<0.0001). The modified Von Korff pain score changed by 6.4% (3.14-9.66) and 13.4% (10.77-15.96), respectively (difference between groups 7.0%, 3.12-10.81; p<0.0001). The additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from cognitive behavioural intervention was 0.099; the incremental cost per QALY was 1786 pound sterling, and the probability of cost-effectiveness was greater than 90% at a threshold of 3000 pound sterling per QALY. There were no serious adverse events attributable to either treatment. INTERPRETATION: Over 1 year, the cognitive behavioural intervention had a sustained effect on troublesome subacute and chronic low-back pain at a low cost to the health-care provider.

6686,Cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5fu/lv)-the folfox regimen-was compared with that of 5fu/lv alone as adjuvant therapy for patients with stage iii colon cancer, from the perspective of the Cancer Care Ontario New Drug Funding Program. In the mosaic (Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer) trial, the folfox regimen significantly improved disease-free survival. The mosaic trial formed the basis of the present analysis. METHODOLOGY: Extrapolated patient-level data from the mosaic trial were used to model patient outcomes from treatment until death. Utilities were obtained from the literature. Resource utilization data were derived from the mosaic trial and supplemented with data from the literature. Unit costs were obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, the London Health Sciences Centre, and the literature. RESULTS: Lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for folfox compared with 5fu/lv were CA$14,266 per disease-free year, CA$23,598 per life-year saved, and CA$24,104 per quality adjusted life-year (qaly) gained, discounting costs and outcomes at 5% per annum. These results were stable for a wide range of inputs; only utility values associated with relapse seemed to influence the cost-effectiveness ratios observed. CONCLUSIONS: With an incremental cost of CA$24,104 per qaly gained, folfox is a cost-effective adjuvant treatment for stage iii colon cancer.

6687,Cost effectiveness of tac versus fac in adjuvant treatment of node-positive breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: This economic analysis aimed to determine, from the perspective of a Canadian provincial government payer, the cost-effectiveness of docetaxel (Taxotere: Sanofi-Aventis, Laval, QC) in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (tac) compared with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (fac) following primary surgery for breast cancer in women with operable, axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer. METHODS: A Markov model looking at two time phases-5-year treatment and long-term follow-up-was constructed. Clinical events included clinical response (based on disease-free survival and overall survival) and rates of febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, diarrhea, and infections. Health states were ""no recurrence,"" ""locoregional recurrence,"" ""distant recurrence,"" and ""death."" Costs were based on published sources and are presented in 2006 Canadian dollars. Model inputs included chemotherapy drug acquisition costs, chemotherapy administration costs, relapse and follow-up costs, costs for management of adverse events, and costs for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) prophylaxis. A 5% discount rate was applied to costs and outcomes alike. Health utilities were obtained from published sources. RESULTS: For tac as compared with fac, the incremental cost was $6921 per life-year (ly) gained and $6,848 per quality-adjusted life-year (qaly) gained. The model was robust to changes in input variables (for example, febrile neutropenia rate, utility). When g-csf and antibiotics were given prophylactically before every cycle, the incremental ratios increased to $13,183 and $13,044 respectively.

6689,Cost-effectiveness of coronary CT angiography versus myocardial perfusion SPECT for evaluation of patients with chest pain and no known coronary artery disease,"Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for individuals with chest pain without known coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Assessment by Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography of Individuals Undergoing Invasive Coronary Angiography-eligible population. Materials and Methods: A decision analysis was performed in which the following were compared: coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography followed by invasive coronary angiography for positive or equivocal findings (coronary CT angiography only), coronary CT angiography followed by invasive coronary angiography for positive findings and myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for equivocal findings (coronary CT angiography first), myocardial perfusion SPECT followed by invasive coronary angiography for positive/equivocal findings (myocardial perfusion SPECT only), myocardial perfusion SPECT followed by invasive coronary angiography for positive findings and coronary CT angiography for equivocal findings (myocardial perfusion SPECT first), and invasive coronary angiography. Analyses were conducted from the payer perspective for a near-term diagnostic period and a long-term lifetime period. The base case was a 55-year-old man with 30% risk of obstructive CAD. Results: By using the base case for near-term cost per correct diagnosis, a coronary CT angiography-first strategy was the least expensive, followed by coronary CT angiography only (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = $17516). For long-term cost-effectiveness, a coronary CT angiography-only strategy demonstrated a favorable ICER of $20429 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) relative to the least expensive coronary CT angiography-first strategy. Both myocardial perfusion SPECT-only and myocardial perfusion SPECT-first strategies were more costly and less effective than either coronary CT angiographic strategy. Long-term results were sensitive to coronary CT angiographic sensitivity, myocardial perfusion SPECT sensitivity, and CAD prevalence. Coronary CT angiography-first and coronary CT angiography-only strategies remained dominant up to a baseline coronary CT angiography test cost of $1100 and 80% CAD prevalence. Conclusion: With a $20000 threshold level for cost per correct diagnosis and $50000 per QALY, a coronary CT angiography-only approach is the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy for evaluation of patients who have stable chest pain without known CAD with intermediate CAD prevalence.

6691,Cost-effectiveness of breast MR imaging and screen-film mammography for screening BRCA1 gene mutation carriers,"Purpose: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening strategies in which MR imaging and screen-film mammography were used, alone and in combination, in women with BRCA1 mutations. Materials and Methods: Because this study did not involve primary data collection from individual patients, institutional review board approval was not needed. By using a simulation model, we compared three annual screening strategies for a cohort of 25-year-old BRCA1 mutation carriers, as follows: (a) screen-film mammography, (b) MR imaging, and (c) combined MR imaging and screen-film mammography (combined screening). The model was used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lifetime costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Input parameters were obtained from the medical literature, existing databases, and calibration. Costs (2007 U.S. dollars) and quality-of-life adjustments were derived from Medicare reimbursement rates and the medical literature. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of uncertainty in parameter estimates on model results. Results: In the base-case analysis, annual combined screening was most effective (44.62 QALYs), and had the highest cost ($110973), followed by annual MR imaging alone (44.50 QALYs, $108641), and annual mammography alone (44.46 QALYs, $100336). Adding annual MR imaging to annual mammographic screening cost $69125 for each additional QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when the screening MR imaging cost increased to $960 (base case, $577), or breast cancer risk by age 70 years decreased below 58% (base case, 65%), or the sensitivity of combined screening decreased below 76% (base case, 94%), the cost of adding MR imaging to mammography exceeded $100000 per QALY. Conclusion: Annual combined screening provides the greatest life expectancy and is likely cost-effective when the value placed on gaining an additional QALY is in the range of $50000-$100000.

Materials and Methods: Because this study did not involve primary data collection from individual patients, institutional review board approval was not needed. By using a simulation model, we compared three annual screening strategies for a cohort of 25-year-old BRCA1 mutation carriers, as follows: (a) screen-film mammography, (b) MR imaging, and (c) combined MR imaging and screen-film mammography (combined screening). The model was used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lifetime costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Input parameters were obtained from the medical literature, existing databases, and calibration. Costs (2007 U.S. dollars) and quality-of-life adjustments were derived from Medicare reimbursement rates and the medical literature. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of uncertainty in parameter estimates on model results. Results: In the base-case analysis, annual combined screening was most effective (44.62 QALYs), and had the highest cost ($110973), followed by annual MR imaging alone (44.50 QALYs, $108641), and annual mammography alone (44.46 QALYs, $100336). Adding annual MR imaging to annual mammographic screening cost $69125 for each additional QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when the screening MR imaging cost increased to $960 (base case, $577), or breast cancer risk by age 70 years decreased below 58% (base case, 65%), or the sensitivity of combined screening decreased below 76% (base case, 94%), the cost of adding MR imaging to mammography exceeded $100000 per QALY.
