9501,Cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin in comparison with generic atorvastatin and simvastatin in a Swedish population at high risk of cardiovascular events,"To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin therapy compared with generic simvastatin and generic atorvastatin in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality in a Swedish population with Framingham risk =20%.A PROBABILISTIC MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL BASED ON DATA FROM JUPITER (THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF STATINS IN PREVENTION: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) was used to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus simvastatin or atorvastatin 40 mg for the prevention of cardiovascular death and morbidity. The three- stage model included cardiovascular event prevention simulating the 4 years of JUPITER, initial prevention beyond the trial, and subsequent cardiovascular event prevention. A Swedish health care payer perspective (direct costs only) was modeled for a lifetime horizon, with 2008/2009 as the costing period. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with rosuvastatin 20 mg over simvastatin or atorvastatin 40 mg ranged from SEK88,113 (rosuvastatin 20 mg versus simvastatin 40 mg; Framingham risk =30%; net avoidance of 34 events/1000 patients) to SEK497,542 (versus atorvastatin 40 mg: Framingham risk =20%; net avoidance of 11 events/1000 patients) over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of SEK500,000/QALY, rosuvastatin 20 mg would be cost-effective for approximately 75%-85% of simulations relative to atorvastatin or simvastatin 40 mg. Sensitivity analyses indicated the findings to be robust.Rosuvastatin 20 mg is cost-effective over a lifetime horizon compared with generic simvastatin or atorvastatin 40 mg in patients at high cardiovascular risk in Sweden.",2012-01-08742,22347800,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Sanjay K Gandhi,2012,4 /,1-11,No,22347800,"Sanjay K Gandhi; Marie M Jensen; Kathleen M Fox; Lee Smolen; Anders G Olsson; Thomas Paulsson; Cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin in comparison with generic atorvastatin and simvastatin in a Swedish population at high risk of cardiovascular events, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 4 ():1178-6981; 1-11",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rosuvastatin therapy (20mg daily) vs. Simvastatin therapy (40mg daily),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,88113,Sweden,2009,13976.92

9514,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of beclomethasone/formoterol versus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol in patients with moderate to severe asthma,"Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by acute symptomatic episodes with variable severity and duration. Pharmacological asthma management aims to achieve and maintain control without side effects, thus improving quality of life and reducing the economic impact. Recently, a clinical trial showed the non-inferiority of beclomethasone/formoterol (BDP/F) versus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S) in adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma. However, this study did not provide evidence on costs and did not quantify quality-of-life parameters.The objective of the present study was to assess the cost effectiveness and cost utility of BDP/F versus FP/S in patients with moderate to severe asthma from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS).A Markov model (MM) was used, with five health states for the different levels of asthma control: successful control, sub-optimal control, outpatient-managed exacerbation, inpatient-managed exacerbation, and death. Model data were derived from the ICAT SE study and from expert panels. Three outcomes were considered: time spent in successful control state, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).The model shows that BDP/F treatment led to a slight increase of weeks in successful control compared with FP/S, with a lower cost. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis highlights that in 64% and 68% of the Monte Carlo simulations, BDP/F outperformed FP/S in terms of weeks in successful control and QALYs. Considering the expected cost of the two strategies, in 90% of simulations BDP/F was the least expensive choice. In particular, BDP/F was cost saving as compared with FP/S in about 63% and 59% of simulations as shown by the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis, respectively.Overall, from the Italian NHS perspective, BDP/F treatment is associated with a reduction in cost and offers a slight increase of effectiveness in terms of weeks spent in successful control and QALYs.",2012-01-08753,22352412,Clin Drug Investig,Simone Gerzeli,2012,32 /,253-65,Yes,22352412,"Simone Gerzeli; Carla Rognoni; Silvana Quaglini; Maria Caterina Cavallo; Giovanni Cremonesi; Alberto Papi; Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of beclomethasone/formoterol versus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol in patients with moderate to severe asthma, Clin Drug Investig, ; 32 ():1173-2563; 253-65",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Beclomethasone/formoterol vs. Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-18475,Euro,2010,-29020.33

9526,Cost effectiveness of gene expression profiling for early stage breast cancer: A decision-analytic model,"BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling (GEP) is being used increasingly for risk stratification to identify women with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, early stage breast cancer who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The authors of this report evaluated the cost effectiveness of recurrence score-guided treatment using 2 commercially available GEP tests, Oncotype DX (Genomic Health, Redwood City, Calif) and MammaPrint (Agendia Inc., Irvine, Calif), from a third-party payer's perspective. METHODS: A 10-year Markov model was developed to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of treatment decisions guided by either Oncotype DX or MammaPrint in a hypothetical cohort of women with early stage, lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who may experience recurrence. Outcomes included no recurrence, recurrence, and death. The costs considered included gene test costs, the costs of adjuvant chemotherapy and other chemotherapy (including premedication, oncology visits, and monitoring for adverse events), the cost of treating recurrence, costs associated with the treatment of adverse events, and end-of-life care costs. RESULTS: The model demonstrated that the patients who received the Oncotype DX test to guide treatment spent $27,882 (in US dollars) and gained 7.364 QALYs, whereas patients who received the MammaPrint test to guide treatment spent $21,598 and gained 7.461 QALYs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results were robust to changes in all parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggested that MammaPrint is a more cost-effective GEP test compared with Oncotype DX at a threshold willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY. Because Oncotype DX is the most frequently used GEP in clinical practice in the United States, the authors concluded that the current findings have implications for health policy, particularly health insurance reimbursement decisions.

The authors of this report optimized budgetary allocations by comparing cost-effectiveness data for different preventive and management strategies throughout the disease course for breast cancer in Hong Kong (HK) Chinese women. METHODS: Nesting a state-transition Markov model within a generalized cost-effectiveness analytic framework, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared to estimate average cost-effectiveness ratios for the following interventions at the population level: biennial mass mammography (ages 40-69 years or ages 40-79 years), reduced waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (by 15% or by 25%), adjuvant endocrine therapy (either upfront aromatase inhibitor [AI] therapy or sequentially with tamoxifen followed by AI) in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive disease, targeted immunotherapy in those with tumors that over express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and enhanced palliative services (either at home or as an inpatient). Usual care for eligible patients in the public sector was the comparator. RESULTS: In descending order, the optimal allocation of additional resources for breast cancer would be the following: a 25% reduction in waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (in US dollars: $5000 per QALY); enhanced, home-based palliative care ($7105 per QALY); adjuvant, sequential endocrine therapy ($17,963 per QALY); targeted immunotherapy ($62,092 per QALY); and mass mammography screening of women ages 40 to 69 years ($72,576 per QALY).

9535,Cost-utility of the 21-gene recurrence score assay in node-negative and node-positive breast cancer,"The 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX(?): RS) appears to augment clinico-pathologic prognostication and is predictive of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in node-negative (N-) and node-positive (N+), endocrine-sensitive breast cancer. RS is a costly assay that is associated with good 'value for money' in N- disease, while economic evaluations in N+ disease based on most recent data have not been conducted. We examined the cost-utility (CU) of a RS-guided adjuvant strategy, compared to current practice without RS in N- and N+, endocrine-sensitive, breast cancer from a Canadian health care system perspective. A generic state-transition model was developed to compute cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 25-year horizon. Patient outcomes with and without chemotherapy in RS-untested cohorts and in those with low, intermediate and high RS were examined based on the reported prognostic and predictive impact of RS in N- and N+ disease. Chemotherapy utilization (current vs. RS-guided), unit costs and utilities were derived from a Nova Scotia Canadian population-based cohort, local unit costs and the literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually, and costs were reported in 2011 Canadian dollars ($). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for key model parameters. Compared to a non-RS-guided strategy, RS-guided adjuvant therapy was associated with $2,585 and $864 incremental costs, 0.27 and 0.06 QALY gains, and resultant CUs of $9,591 and $14,844 per QALY gained for N- and N+ disease, respectively.

9540,Cost-effectiveness of tapentadol prolonged release compared with oxycodone controlled release in the UK in patients with severe non-malignant chronic pain who failed 1st line treatment with morphine,"Abstract Objectives: The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of tapentadol PR (prolonged release) compared with oxycodone CR (controlled release) in severe non-malignant chronic pain patients in whom controlled release morphine was ineffective or not tolerated. Methods: A Markov model was developed to assess costs and benefits over a 1-year time horizon from the National Health Service perspective in the UK. Patients could either continue on 2nd line therapy or switch to 3rd line opioid due to lack of efficacy or poor tolerability. Patients failing also 3rd line therapy entered the final absorbing health state (4th line). Data on tolerability, efficacy, and utilities for tapentadol and oxycodone were obtained from the three comparative phase III clinical trials. Costs of resource consumption associated with opioid treatment were derived from a retrospective database analysis of anonymized patient records. Results: The model results predicted that initiating 2nd line therapy with tapentadol leads to higher effectiveness and lower costs vs oxycodone. For the overall population included in the clinical trials, mean annual costs per patient when treated with tapentadol and oxycodone were ?3543 and ?3656, respectively. Treatment with tapentadol, while cheaper than oxycodone, was more effective (0.6371 vs 0.6237 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for tapentadol and oxycodone, respectively), meaning that tapentadol dominated oxycodone. For the sub-group of opioid-experienced patients with severe pain at baseline the ranking in terms of costs and QALYs remained unchanged. Extensive sensitivity analyses showed that conclusions about the cost-effectiveness are consistent. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness study suggested that initiating 2nd line treatment in patients with severe non-malignant chronic pain in the UK with tapentadol instead of oxycodone improves patients' quality-of-life and is less costly.

9542,Cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatments in postmenopausal women using FRAX thresholds for decision,"PURPOSE: FRAX is a fracture prediction algorithm to determine a patient''s absolute fracture risk. There is a growing consensus that osteoporosis treatment should be based on individual 10-year fracture probability, as calculated in the FRAX algorithm, rather than on T-scores alone. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of five years of branded alendronate therapy in postmenopausal French women with a known FRAX score. METHOD: A Markov cohort state transition model using FRAX values and whenever possible population-specific data and probabilities. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of alendronate versus no treatment in postmenopausal women with FRAX ranging from 10 to 3%. OUTCOMES: Number of women to treat (NNT) for preventing hip fracture, costs, quality-adjusted life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) compared to no treatment at age 70 ranged from euro104,183 to euro413,473 per QALY when FRAX decreased from 10 to 3%. The NNTs for preventing one hip fracture ranged from 97 to 388 according to age (50-80 years) and FRAX. Sensitivity analyses showed that the main determinants of cost-effectiveness were adherence to therapy and cost of treatment. CONCLUSION: Using French costs of branded drug and current estimates of treatment efficacy, alendronate therapy for 70-year-old women with 10-year probability of hip fracture of 10% just meets the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold.

OUTCOMES: Number of women to treat (NNT) for preventing hip fracture, costs, quality-adjusted life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) compared to no treatment at age 70 ranged from euro104,183 to euro413,473 per QALY when FRAX decreased from 10 to 3%. The NNTs for preventing one hip fracture ranged from 97 to 388 according to age (50-80 years) and FRAX. Sensitivity analyses showed that the main determinants of cost-effectiveness were adherence to therapy and cost of treatment. CONCLUSION: Using French costs of branded drug and current estimates of treatment efficacy, alendronate therapy for 70-year-old women with 10-year probability of hip fracture of 10% just meets the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold.

9550,Is dabigatran cost effective compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation?: a critically appraised topic,"Warfarin has provided protection against cardioembolic stroke in the setting of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) for the past 60 years. Dabigatran, the first oral direct thrombin inhibitor to be approved in the United States, promises to provide the same or better stroke protection with reduced risk of intracranial hemorrhage. However, it remains to be seen whether grand-scale adoption of dabigatran will be cost effective.To critically assess current evidence regarding the cost effectiveness of dabigatran for preventing stroke in patients with NVAF compared with warfarin.The objective was addressed through the development of a critically appraised topic that included a clinical scenario, structured question, literature search strategy, critical appraisal, assessment of results, evidence summary, commentary, and bottom-line conclusions. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, a medical librarian, clinical epidemiologists, and content experts in the field of vascular neurology.A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) that followed a hypothetical cohort of NVAF patients 65 years of age or older and CHADS2=1 over their lifetime comparing dabigatran with adjusted-dose warfarin was reviewed. Assuming a willingness to pay a threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), base case results favored high-dose (150 mg bid) dabigatran as a cost-effective alternative to warfarin. Sensitivity analysis asserted that the cost effectiveness of dabigatran improved if it could be obtained for =$13/d or if it was used in populations with high risk of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.Dabigatran 150 mg bid ($12,286 per QALY) is a cost-effective alternative to International Normalized Ratio-adjusted warfarin for the prevention of ischemic stroke in patients 65 years of age or older with NVAF.",2012-01-08777,22367842,Neurologist,Amelia K Adcock,2012,18 /,102-7,No,22367842,"Amelia K Adcock; Joyce K Lee-Iannotti; Maria I Aguilar; Charlene R Hoffman-Snyder; Dean M Wingerchuk; Kay E Wellik; Bart M Demaerschalk; Is dabigatran cost effective compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation?: a critically appraised topic, Neurologist , ; 18 ():1074-7931; 102-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dabigatran (150 mg twice a day) vs. Warfarin,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,45372,United States,2008,54540.68

A Markov model with three health states (pre-progression, post-progression and death) was constructed to estimate direct medical costs and outcomes comparing four treatment options, i.e., gefitinib, erlotinib, pemetrexed and docetaxel. The model followed patients for 2 years with discount rate of 3% annually. Clinical inputs and patients' characteristics were based on a randomized phase III trial (INTEREST). Costs were based on reference prices published by the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, and other information related to treatment from expert opinion and presented in 2010. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of model parameters on results.In the base case model, gefitinib and erlotinib yielded equal quality-adjusted life years (QALY) but 0.0140 and 0.0110 more QALY compared with docetaxel and pemetrexed, respectively.

9559,The cost-effectiveness of screening lung cancer patients for targeted drug sensitivity markers,"New oncology drugs are being developed in conjunction with companion diagnostics with approval restricting their use to certain biomarker-positive subgroups. We examined the impact of different predictive biomarker screening techniques and population enrichment criteria on the cost-effectiveness of targeted drugs in lung cancer, using ALK and crizotinib to build the initial model.Health economic modeling of cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year was based on literature review and expert opinion. The modeled population represented advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), eligible for predictive biomarker screening with prescribing restricted to biomarker-positive patients.For assays costing $1400 per person, cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for ALK screening all advanced NSCLC, excluding treatment cost, is $106,707. This falls to $4756 when only a highly enriched population is screened (increasing biomarker frequency from 1.6 to 35.9%). However, the same enrichment involves missing 56% patients who segregate within the unscreened group. Cheaper screening tests that miss some true positives can be more cost-effective if proportional reductions in cost exceed proportion of subjects missed.

9571,Economic evaluation of vaccination programme of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the birth cohort in Japan,"Aiming to introduce 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PVC-7) into routine vaccination schedule, the government of Japan gives a temporary budget to encourage municipalities in launching public vaccination programme which started on November 26, 2010 and ends on March 31, 2012. This study aims to appraise the 'value for money' of PCV-7 vaccination programme from the societal perspective and the budget impact from the perspective of municipalities, which is responsible for providing routine vaccination. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value of launching such programme with two levels of co-payment, ?1000 (US$13) or ?0, and two scenarios of the uptake of vaccine (vaccinated-alone or co-vaccinated with other vaccines). We found that when vaccinated-alone, ICERs in QALY were ?7,441,000 (US$93,013) or ?9,065,000 (US$113,313), and when co-vaccinated ?7,441,000 (US$93,013) or ?5,489,000 (US$68,613), without or with productivity loss, respectively, regardless of co-payment level of the programme. Co-vaccinated programmes had lower ICER than vaccinated-alone programmes due to the savings in productivity loss. By adopting WHO's classification that an intervention is 'cost-effective' if ICER (in QALY) is between 1 and 3 times of GDP as a criterion, PCV-7 vaccination programme in Japan is concluded as ""cost-effective"" from the perspective of society.

9575,Re-appraisal of the options for colorectal cancer screening in England,"Aims: To use newly available data to estimate the cost-effectiveness and endoscopy requirements of screening options for colorectal cancer(CRC) to inform screening policy in England. Methods: A state transition model simulated the life experience of a cohort of individuals in the general population of England with normal colon/rectal epithelium through to the development of adenomas and CRC and subsequent death. CRC natural history model parameters and screening test characteristics were estimated simultaneously by a process of model calibration. This process fitted to observed data on CRC incidence in the absence of screening, data from existing screening programmes, and data from the UK flexible sigmoidoscopy(FS) screening trial. The costs, effects and resource impact were evaluated for a range of screening options involving the guaiac or immunochemical faecal occult blood test(gFOBT/iFOBT) and FS. Results: The model suggests that screening strategies involving FS or iFOBT may produce additional benefits when compared with the current policy of biennial gFOBT for 60-74 year olds. The age at which a single FS screen results in the greatest Quality Adjusted Life Years(QALY) gain was 55, with similar gains for ages between 52 and 58. Strategies which combined FS and iFOBT showed further benefits and improved economic outcomes. Conclusions: Strategies which combine different screening modalities may provide greater clinical and economic benefits.

Subsequently, the policies were compared for five different scenarios that represent different possible scenarios (risk of cervical cancer, previous screening, quality associated test characteristics, costs of testing, and prevalence of HPV).Various European countries.Unvaccinated women born between 1939 and 1992.Optimal screening strategy in terms of incremental cost effectiveness ratios (costs per quality adjusted life years gained) compared with different cost effectiveness thresholds, for two levels of sensitivity and costs of the HPV test.Primary HPV screening was the preferred primary test over the age of 30 in many considered scenarios. Primary cytology screening was preferred only in scenarios with low costs of cytology and in scenarios with a high prevalence of HPV in combination with high costs of HPV testing.Most European countries should consider switching from primary cytology to HPV screening for cervical cancer. HPV screening must, however, only be implemented in situations where screening is well controlled.",2012-01-08811,22391612,BMJ,Inge M C M de Kok,2012,344 /,e670,No,22391612,"Inge M C M de Kok; Joost van Rosmalen; Joakim Dillner; Marc Arbyn; Peter Sasieni; Thomas Iftner; Marjolein van Ballegooijen; Primary screening for human papillomavirus compared with cytology screening for cervical cancer in European settings: cost effectiveness analysis based on a Dutch microsimulation model, BMJ, ; 344 ():0959-8138; e670",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Primary screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) using automated molecular amplification or hybridisation techniques in women over age 30 years vs. Primary cytology screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Euro,2009,Not Stated
9586,Cost-utility analysis of primary prophylaxis versus secondary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in elderly patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma receiving curative-intent chemotherapy,"The 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline recommended primary prophylaxis (PP) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) instead of secondary prophylaxis (SP) for elderly patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma receiving chemotherapy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of PP when compared with SP.We conducted a cost-utility analysis to compare PP to SP for diffuse aggressive lymphoma. We used a Markov model with an eight-cycle chemotherapy time horizon with a government-payer perspective and Ontario health, economic, and cost data. Data for efficacies of G-CSF, probabilities, and utilities were obtained from published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PP to SP was $700,500 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). One-way sensitivity analyses (willingness-to-pay threshold = $100,000/QALY) showed that if PP were to be cost-effective, the cost of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia (FN) had to be more than $31,138 (2.5 ? > base case), the cost of G-CSF per cycle less than $960 (base case = $1,960), the risk of first-cycle FN more than 47% (base case = 24%), or the relative risk reduction of FN with G-CSF more than 91% (base case = 41%). Our result was robust to all variables. PSA revealed a 10% probability of PP being cost-effective over SP at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY.PP is not cost-effective when compared with SP in this population. PP becomes attractive only if the cost of hospitalization for FN is significantly higher or the cost of G-CSF is significantly lower.",2012-01-08817,22393098,J Clin Oncol,Kelvin K W Chan,2012,30 /,1064-71,No,22393098,"Kelvin K W Chan; Eric Siu; Murray D Krahn; Kevin Imrie; Shabbir M H Alibhai; Cost-utility analysis of primary prophylaxis versus secondary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in elderly patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma receiving curative-intent chemotherapy, J Clin Oncol, ; 30 ():0732-183X; 1064-71",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) along with first cycle of chemotherapy vs. Secondary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) along with first cycle of chemotherapy after a neutropenic event,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,11 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,700500,Canada,2010,807644.33

9595,Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Applying RE-LY to clinical practice in Denmark,"Abstract Objective: To estimate the economic implications of introducing dabigatran etexilate ('dabigatran') for anti-coagulation therapy in Danish patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation based on results of the RE-LY trial. Methods: The lifetime cost and outcomes of dabigatran and warfarin were estimated using a previously published cost-effectiveness model. The model utilizes the data from the RE-LY study to estimate the costs and outcomes of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Cost estimates were based on official Danish tariffs and prices, and published literature on the cost of stroke. In the base-case analysis a conservative approach was adopted applying tariffs from the lowest range for the cost of International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring associated with warfarin. The effectiveness measure of the analysis was quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Results: The model estimated that the mean cost per patient for the remaining life-time is ?16,886 treated with warfarin and ?18,752 treated with dabigatran. This was associated with mean QALYs per patient of 8.32 with warfarin and 8.59 with dabigatran. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ~?7000 per QALY gained is regarded as cost-effective by Danish standards. This conclusion was seen to be robust to realistic variations in input parameters, including adjustment for the RE-LY centres achieving the best INR monitoring quality. Threshold analysis revealed that dabigatran would be cost-saving in settings where the cost of warfarin monitoring exceeds ?744 per year. Limitations: The analysis does not include all aspects of Danish clinical practice anti-coagulation that will influence cost-effectiveness of dabigatran, e.g., this study did not attempt to model quality of anticoagulation monitoring and under-utilization in clinical practice. Conclusions: Based on the outcomes observed in the RE-LY trial, dabigatran represents a cost-effective alternative to warfarin in Denmark for all patients with atrial fibrillation within the licensed indication of dabigatran.",2012-01-08820,22397590,J Med Econ,Lars K Langkilde,2012,/,,Yes,22397590,"Lars K Langkilde; Mikael Bergholdt Asmussen; Mikkel Overgaard; Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

9596,Vitamin K supplementation for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures: is it cost-effective and is future research warranted?,"Lifetime supplementation with vitamin K, vitamin D(3), and calcium is likely to reduce fractures and increase survival in postmenopausal women. It would be a cost-effective intervention at commonly used thresholds, but high uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness estimates persists. Further research on the effect of vitamin K on fractures is warranted. INTRODUCTION: Vitamin K might have a role in the primary prevention of fractures, but uncertainties about its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness persist. METHODS: We developed a state-transition probabilistic microsimulation model to quantify the cost-effectiveness of various interventions to prevent fractures in 50-year-old postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. We compared no supplementation, vitamin D(3) (800?IU/day) with calcium (1,200?mg/day), and vitamin K(2) (45?mg/day) with vitamin D(3) and calcium (at the same doses). An additional analysis explored replacing vitamin K(2) with vitamin K(1) (5?mg/day). RESULTS: Adding vitamin K(2) to vitamin D(3) with calcium reduced the lifetime probability of at least one fracture by 25%, increased discounted survival by 0.7 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.2; 1.3) and discounted costs by $8,956, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $12,268/QALY. At a $50,000/QALY threshold, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 95% and the population expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was $28.9 billion. Adding vitamin K(1) to vitamin D and calcium reduced the lifetime probability of at least one fracture by 20%, increased discounted survival by 0.4 QALYs (95% CrI -1.9; 1.4) and discounted costs by $4,014, yielding an ICER of $9,557/QALY. At a $50,000/QALY threshold, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 80% while the EVPI was $414.9 billion. The efficacy of vitamin K was the most important parameter in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime supplementation with vitamin K, vitamin D(3), and calcium is likely to reduce fractures and increase survival in postmenopausal women.

9600,Cost-effectiveness of universal and risk-based screening for autoimmune thyroid disease in pregnant women,"Hypothyroidism in pregnancy can lead to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Although screening of high-risk women is advocated, universal screening remains controversial.The objective of the study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of universal screening of pregnant women for autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) with screening only high-risk women and with no screening.A decision-analytic model compared the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained among the following: 1) universal screening, 2) high-risk screening, and 3) no screening. Screening consisted of a first-trimester thyroid-stimulating hormone level and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Women with abnormal results underwent further testing and, when indicated, levothyroxine therapy. Randomized controlled trials provided probabilities for adverse obstetrical outcomes. The model accounted for the development of postpartum thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism. Additional scenarios in which therapy prevented cases of decreased child intelligence quotient were explored.Medical consequences of AITD in pregnancy, QALY, and costs were measured.Risk-based screening and universal screening were both cost-effective relative to no screening, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $6,753/QALY and $7,138/QALY, respectively. Universal screening was cost-effective compared with risk-based screening, with an ICER of $7,258/QALY. Screening remained cost-effective in various clinical scenarios, including when only overt hypothyroidism was assumed to have adverse obstetrical outcomes. Universal screening was cost-saving in the scenario of untreated maternal hypothyroidism resulting in decreased child intelligence, with levothyroxine therapy being preventive.Universal screening of pregnant women in the first trimester for AITD is cost-effective, not only compared with no screening but also compared with screening of high-risk women.",2012-01-08823,22399510,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,Chrysoula Dosiou,2012,97 / 5,1536-46,No,22399510,"Chrysoula Dosiou; James Barnes; Alan Schwartz; Roberto Negro; Lawrence Crapo; Alex Stagnaro-Green; Cost-effectiveness of universal and risk-based screening for autoimmune thyroid disease in pregnant women, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, ; 97(5):0021-972X; 1536-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Risk-based screening for autoimmune thyroid disease vs. None,Not Stated,25 Years,25 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,6753,United States,2009,8146.62
