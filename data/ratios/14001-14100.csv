14001,Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatments for chronic hepatitis C in the US,"BACKGROUND: The standard care of treatment of interferon plus ribavirin (plus protease inhibitor for genotype 1) are effective in 50 % to 70 % of patients with CHC. Several new treatments including Harvoni, Olysio + Sovaldi, Viekira Pak, Sofosbuvir-based regimens characterized with potent inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) providing more options for CHC patients. Trials have shown that the new treatments increased the rate to 80 % to 95 %, though with a substantial increase in cost. In particular, current market pricing of a 12-week course of sofosbuvir is approximately US$84,000. We determine the cost-effectiveness of new treatments in comparison with the standard care of treatments. METHODS: A Markov simulation model of CHC disease progression is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies based on genotype. The model calculates the expected lifetime medical costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of hypothetical cohorts of identical patients receiving certain treatments. For genotype 1, we compare: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin + telaprevir for 12 weeks, followed by 12 or 24 weeks treatment of peginterferon + ribavirin dependent on HCV RNA level at week 12; (2) Harvoni treatment, 12 weeks; (3) Olysio + Sovaldi, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (4) Viekira Pak + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (5) sofosbuvir + peginterferon + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with or without cirrhosis. For genotypes 2 and 3, treatment strategies include: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin, 24 weeks for treatment-naive patients; (2) sofosbuvir + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with genotype 2, 24 weeks for genotype 3; (3) peginterferon + ribavirin as initial treatment, 24 weeks for patients with genotype 2/3, follow-up treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12/16 weeks are performed on non-responders and relapsers. RESULTS: Viekira Pak is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients without cirrhosis, whereas Harvoni is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir-based treatments for genotype 1 in general are not cost-effective due to its substantial high costs. Two-phase treatments with 12-week and 16-week follow-ups are cost-effective for genotype 3 patients and for genotype 2 patients with cirrhosis. The results were shown to be robust over a broad range of parameter values through sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: For genotype 1, sofosbuvir-based treatments are not cost-effective compared to Viekira Pak and Harvoni, although a 30 % reduction in sofosbuvir price would change this result. Sofosbuvir + ribavirin are cost-effective as second-phase treatments following peginterferon + ribavirin initial treatment for genotypes 2 and 3.

14009,Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatments for chronic hepatitis C in the US,"BACKGROUND: The standard care of treatment of interferon plus ribavirin (plus protease inhibitor for genotype 1) are effective in 50 % to 70 % of patients with CHC. Several new treatments including Harvoni, Olysio + Sovaldi, Viekira Pak, Sofosbuvir-based regimens characterized with potent inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) providing more options for CHC patients. Trials have shown that the new treatments increased the rate to 80 % to 95 %, though with a substantial increase in cost. In particular, current market pricing of a 12-week course of sofosbuvir is approximately US$84,000. We determine the cost-effectiveness of new treatments in comparison with the standard care of treatments. METHODS: A Markov simulation model of CHC disease progression is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies based on genotype. The model calculates the expected lifetime medical costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of hypothetical cohorts of identical patients receiving certain treatments. For genotype 1, we compare: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin + telaprevir for 12 weeks, followed by 12 or 24 weeks treatment of peginterferon + ribavirin dependent on HCV RNA level at week 12; (2) Harvoni treatment, 12 weeks; (3) Olysio + Sovaldi, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (4) Viekira Pak + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (5) sofosbuvir + peginterferon + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with or without cirrhosis. For genotypes 2 and 3, treatment strategies include: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin, 24 weeks for treatment-naive patients; (2) sofosbuvir + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with genotype 2, 24 weeks for genotype 3; (3) peginterferon + ribavirin as initial treatment, 24 weeks for patients with genotype 2/3, follow-up treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12/16 weeks are performed on non-responders and relapsers. RESULTS: Viekira Pak is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients without cirrhosis, whereas Harvoni is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir-based treatments for genotype 1 in general are not cost-effective due to its substantial high costs. Two-phase treatments with 12-week and 16-week follow-ups are cost-effective for genotype 3 patients and for genotype 2 patients with cirrhosis. The results were shown to be robust over a broad range of parameter values through sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: For genotype 1, sofosbuvir-based treatments are not cost-effective compared to Viekira Pak and Harvoni, although a 30 % reduction in sofosbuvir price would change this result.

The combinations of bevacizumab (BEV) plus paclitaxel (PACL) and BEV plus capecitabine (CAPE) were selected as comparators. METHOD: A Markov model, consisting of three health states, was used to describe disease progression and evaluate the CE of the comparators from a third-party payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Efficacy and safety data as well as utility values considered in the model were extracted from the relevant randomized Phase III clinical trials and other published studies. Direct medical costs referring to the year 2014 were incorporated in the model. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for uncertainty and variation in the parameters of the model. Primary outcomes were patient survival (life-years), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total direct costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). RESULTS: The discounted quality-adjusted survival of patients treated with EVE plus EXE was greater by 0.035 and 0.004 QALYs, compared to BEV plus PACL and BEV plus CAPE, respectively.

14012,Bariatric surgery as a means to decrease mortality in women with type I endometrial cancer - An intriguing option in a population at risk for dying of complications of metabolic syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and utility of a strategy of offering weight loss surgery (WLS) to women with low risk stage I endometrial cancer (EC) and BMI>/=40kg/m(2). METHODS: A modified Markov state transition model was designed to compare routine care to WLS for women with low risk stage I endometrioid EC, age<70, with a mean BMI 40. A time horizon of 15years was used to simulate the overall survival (OS) of 96,232 women treated from 1988-2010 from SEER*Stat data. To simulate the effects of WLS on OS, a hazard ratio (0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.99) representing the OS improvement achieved from this intervention (derived from a prospective trial) was modeled. We assumed that 90% of women undergoing bariatric procedures would experience a reduction in BMI. We assumed that 5% of women not undergoing WLS would achieve weight loss to a BMI of 35. Costs of treatment for obesity-related chronic diseases and quality of life (QOL)-related utilities were modeled from published reports. RESULTS: The mean cost-effectiveness for each strategy was: $69,295 and 8.10 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for routine care versus $100,675 and 9.30 QALYs for WLS. WLS had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $26,080/QALY compared to routine care. At a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, WLS was the strategy of choice in 100% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: WLS is a potentially cost-effective intervention in women with low risk, early stage EC, at least in part due to improved quality of life with weight reduction.",2015-01-17536,26232518,Gynecol Oncol,Robert Neff,2015,138 / 3,597-602,No,26232518,"Robert Neff; Laura J Havrilesky; Junzo Chino; David M O'Malley; David E Cohn; Bariatric surgery as a means to decrease mortality in women with type I endometrial cancer - An intriguing option in a population at risk for dying of complications of metabolic syndrome, Gynecol Oncol, 2015 Sep; 138(3):0090-8258; 597-602",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bariatric surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care,"Low-risk, stage 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer; age less than 70",69 Years,Not Stated,Female,Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,26080,United States,2014,28511.89
14013,Cost-Effectiveness of Florbetapir-PET in Alzheimer's Disease: A Spanish Societal Perspective,"BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other diseases associated with dementia, imposes significant burden to various stakeholders who care for the elderly. Management of AD is complicated by multiple factors including disease-specific features which make it difficult to diagnose accurately during milder stages. Florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography (florbetapir-PET) is an approved imaging tool used to capture beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in brains of cognitively impaired adults undergoing evaluation for AD and other causes of cognitive impairment. It has the potential to help improve healthcare outcomes as it may help clinicians identify patients with AD early so that treatments are initiated when most effective. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Evaluate the potential long-term clinical and economic outcomes of adopting florbetapir-PET--adjunctive to standard clinical evaluation (SCE)--versus SCE alone in the diagnostic assessment of cognitively impaired patients with suspected AD. METHODS: A decision analysis with a ten-year time horizon was developed in compliance with Good Research Practices and CHEERS guidelines. The target population was comprised of Spanish patients who were undergoing initial assessment for cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score=20). Diagnostic accuracy, rate of cognitive decline, effect of drugs on cognition and dwelling status, economic burden (direct and indirect costs), and quality of life (QoL) were based on relevant clinical studies and published literature. Scenario analysis was applied to explore outcomes under different conditions, which included: (i) use of florbetapir-PET earlier in disease progression (MMSE score=22); and (ii) the addition of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET to SCE. RESULTS: Adjunctive florbetapir-PET increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.008 years and increased costs by 36 compared to SCE alone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], 4,769). Use of florbetapir-PET was dominant in alternate scenarios. Sensitivity analyses indicated rates of institutionalization (by MMSE) and MMSE score upon initiation of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) treatment most influenced the primary outcome (ICER) in the base case scenario. Over 82% of probabilistic simulations were cost-effective using the Spanish threshold (30,000/QALY). DISCUSSION: The addition of florbetapir-PET to SCE is expected to improve the accuracy of AD diagnoses for patients experiencing cognitive impairment; it is cost-effective due to decreased healthcare costs and caregiver burden. Prospective studies of the clinical utility of florbetapir-PET are necessary to evaluate the long-term implications of adopting florbetapir-PET on clinical outcomes and costs in real-world settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE: Florbetapir-PET is expected to improve decision-making regarding appropriate and sufficient care for cognitively impaired patients with suspected AD, while cost-effective. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: Earlier and more accurate diagnosis of AD may help to improve patient's health status and reduce treatment costs by effectively allocating healthcare resources and maximizing the benefit of treatments and supportive services. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Use of florbetapir-PET may help accurately identify patients with AD. The development of novel therapeutics for use with companion diagnostics may provide additional benefits by slowing or halting progressive cognitive decline with AD, increase QoL and prolong survival.",2015-01-17540,26231002,J Med Screen,John Hornberger,2015,18 / 2,63-73,No,26231002,"John Hornberger; Steven Michalopoulos; Minghan Dai; Paula Andrade; Tatiana Dilla; Michael Happich; Cost-Effectiveness of Florbetapir-PET in Alzheimer's Disease: A Spanish Societal Perspective, J Med Screen, 2015 Jun; 18(2):1475-5793; 63-73",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Adjunctive Florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography, in addition to Standard Clinical Evaluation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard clinical evaluation",Cognitive impairment with suspected Alzheimer's Disease,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,4769,Euro,2013,7036.84
14014,Universal versus genotype-guided use of direct oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation patients: a decision analysis,"AIM: This study aims to compare clinical and economic outcomes of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype-guided (PG-DOAC) versus universal use of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Outcomes of oral anticoagulation therapy were simulated using life-long Markov modeling. In PG-DOAC, patients with genotype of high or low warfarin sensitivity were treated with DOAC, and patients with normal warfarin sensitivity genotype received warfarin. RESULTS: Expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost of DOAC were higher than PG-DOAC. Incremental cost per QALY (ICER) of DOAC versus PG-DOAC was 314,129 USD/QALY, exceeding willingness-to-pay threshold (50,000 USD/QALY). CONCLUSION: Using individual genotype to guide the use of DOAC versus warfarin appears to be the preferred strategy.

14015,Cost-effectiveness of Lung Cancer Screening in Canada,"IMPORTANCE: The US National Lung Screening Trial supports screening for lung cancer among smokers using low-dose computed tomographic (LDCT) scans. The cost-effectiveness of screening in a publically funded health care system remains a concern. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LDCT scan screening for lung cancer within the Canadian health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cancer Risk Management Model (CRMM) simulated individual lives within the Canadian population from 2014 to 2034, incorporating cancer risk, disease management, outcome, and cost data. Smokers and former smokers eligible for lung cancer screening (30 pack-year smoking history, ages 55-74 years, for the reference scenario) were modeled, and performance parameters were calibrated to the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The reference screening scenario assumes annual scans to age 75 years, 60% participation by 10 years, 70% adherence to screening, and unchanged smoking rates. The CRMM outputs are aggregated, and costs (2008 Canadian dollars) and life-years are discounted 3% annually. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, the reference scenario saved 51000 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CaD $52000/QALY. If smoking history is modeled for 20 or 40 pack-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of CaD $62000 and CaD $43000/QALY, respectively, were generated. Changes in participation rates altered life years saved but not the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is sensitive to changes in adherence. An adjunct smoking cessation program improving the quit rate by 22.5% improves the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to CaD $24000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lung cancer screening with LDCT appears cost-effective in the publicly funded Canadian health care system.

14016,Cost-Effectiveness of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing With Messenger RNA Versus DNA Under United States Guidelines for Cervical Cancer Screening,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing using a hrHPV DNA and a hrHPV messenger RNA (mRNA) assay under current US cervical cancer screening guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model for stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis using published data. We compared screening efficiency using DNA and mRNA testing for the following: (1) cotesting with cytology in women 30 to 65 years, and (2) triage of women with mild cervical cytological abnormalities (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US]) in the United States. Screening end point is histologically confirmed high-grade lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, 3, or invasive cancer). Sensitivity and specificity estimates of DNA and mRNA testing to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, 3, or invasive cancer were obtained from 2 published trials: the US Clinical Evaluation of APTIMA mRNA (CLEAR) study for ASC-US triage and the French APTIMA Screening Evaluation (FASE) study for cotesting. Costs of DNA and mRNA testing were assumed identical. Costs of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical neoplasia and cancer were from previously published estimates, adjusted to 2012 US dollars. Inputs were modeled as distributions for Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model outcomes were costs per life-year saved for each strategy, discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: For both cotesting and ASC-US triage, mRNA testing cost less than DNA testing, whereas life expectancies were widely overlapping. There was a 100% probability that DNA testing was not cost-effective at $100,000/life-year saved threshold for ASC-US triage and a 55% probability that DNA testing was not cost-effective at the same threshold for cotesting. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, mRNA testing for cotesting or ASC-US triage is likely to be more efficient than DNA testing under current US cervical cancer screening guidelines.",2015-01-17551,26225945,Transfusion,Jie Ting,2015,19 / 4,333-9,No,26225945,"Jie Ting; Jennifer S Smith; Evan R Myers; Cost-Effectiveness of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing With Messenger RNA Versus DNA Under United States Guidelines for Cervical Cancer Screening, Transfusion, 2015 Oct; 19(4):1537-2995; 333-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,XX,Unvaccinated women,100 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2012,Not Stated
14017,Long-Term Outcomes of Adding HPV Vaccine to the Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia Treatment Regimen in HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex With Men,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence shows that quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination in men who have sex with men (MSM) who have a history of high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of recurrent HGAIN. We evaluated the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of adding the qHPV vaccine to the treatment regimen for HGAIN in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive MSM aged >/=27 years. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model based on anal histology in HIV-positive MSM comparing qHPV vaccination with no vaccination after treatment for HGAIN, the current practice. The model parameters, including baseline prevalence, disease transitions, costs, and utilities, were either obtained from the literature or calibrated using a natural history model of anal carcinogenesis. The model outputs included lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years, and lifetime risk of developing anal cancer. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of qHPV vaccination compared to no qHPV vaccination and decrease in lifetime risk of anal cancer. We also conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Use of qHPV vaccination after treatment for HGAIN decreased the lifetime risk of anal cancer by 63% compared with no vaccination. The qHPV vaccination strategy was cost saving; it decreased lifetime costs by $419 and increased quality-adjusted life years by 0.16. Results were robust to the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating HIV-positive MSM aged >/=27 years with qHPV vaccine after treatment for HGAIN is a cost-saving strategy.

14018,A cost-utility analysis of cervical cancer screening and human papillomavirus vaccination in the Philippines,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer cases and deaths among Filipino women because of inadequate access to screening and treatment services. This study aims to evaluate the health and economic benefits of HPV vaccination and its combination with different screening strategies to find the most optimal preventive strategy in the Philippines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using an existing semi-Markov model to evaluate different screening (i.e., Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid) and vaccination strategies against HPV infection implemented alone or as part of a combination strategy at different coverage scenarios. The model was run using country-specific epidemiologic, cost and clinical parameters from a health system perspective. Sensitivity analysis was performed for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection and costs of vaccination, screening and treatment. RESULTS: Across all coverage scenarios, VIA has been shown to be a dominant and cost-saving screening strategy with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging from dominant to Php 61,059 (1443 USD) per QALY gained. VIA can reduce cervical cancer cases and deaths by 25%. Pap smear screening was found to be not cost-effective due to its high cost in the Philippines. Adding HPV vaccination at a cost of 54 USD per vaccinated girl on top of VIA screening was found to be potentially cost-effective using a threshold of 1 GDP per capita (i.e., Php 120,000 or 2835 USD/ QALY) with the most favorable assumption of providing lifelong immunity against high-risk oncogenic HPV types 16/18. The highest incremental QALY gain was achieved with 80% coverage of the combined strategy of VIA at 35 to 45 years old done every five years following vaccination at 11 years of age with an ICER of Php 33,126 (783 USD). This strategy may result in a two-thirds reduction in cervical cancer burden. HPV vaccination is not cost-effective when vaccine protection lasts for less than 20 years. CONCLUSION: High VIA coverage targeting women aged 35-45 years old at five-year intervals is the most efficient and cost-saving strategy in reducing cervical cancer burden in the Philippines. Adding a vaccination program at high coverage among 11-year-old girls is potentially cost-effective in the Philippines assuming a life-long duration of vaccine efficacy.",2015-01-17555,26223975,BMC Public Health,Anna Melissa Guerrero,2015,15 /,730,No,26223975,"Anna Melissa Guerrero; Anne Julienne Genuino; Melanie Santillan; Naiyana Praditsitthikorn; Varit Chantarastapornchit; Yot Teerawattananon; Marissa Alejandria; Jean Anne Toral; A cost-utility analysis of cervical cancer screening and human papillomavirus vaccination in the Philippines, BMC Public Health, 2015; 15():1471-2458; 730",QALY,Philippines,Not Stated,Not Stated,Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) vs. Pap smear at 8 % coverage for women aged 35-55 years old at 5-year intervals,Not Stated,Not Stated,11 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,Not Stated,United States,2013,Not Stated
14019,"An Assessment of the Expected Cost-Effectiveness of Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines in Ontario, Canada Using a Static Model","Ontario, Canada, immunizes against influenza using a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) under a Universal Influenza Immunization Program (UIIP). The UIIP offers IIV3 free-of-charge to all Ontarians over 6 months of age. A newly approved quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) offers wider protection against influenza B disease. We explored the expected cost-utility and budget impact of replacing IIV3 with IIV4, within the context of Ontario's UIIP, using a probabilistic and static cost-utility model. Wherever possible, epidemiological and cost data were obtained from Ontario sources. Canadian or U.S. sources were used when Ontario data were not available. Vaccine efficacy for IIV3 was obtained from the literature. IIV4 efficacy was derived from meta-analysis of strain-specific vaccine efficacy. Conservatively, herd protection was not considered. In the base case, we used IIV3 and IIV4 prices of $5.5/dose and $7/dose, respectively. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the price of IIV4, as well as standard univariate and multivariate statistical uncertainty analyses. Over a typical influenza season, relative to IIV3, IIV4 is expected to avert an additional 2,516 influenza cases, 1,683 influenza-associated medical visits, 27 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 5 influenza-associated deaths. From a societal perspective, IIV4 would generate 76 more Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and a net societal budget impact of $4,784,112. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for this comparison was $63,773/QALY. IIV4 remains cost-effective up to a 53% price premium over IIV3. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that IIV4 was cost-effective with a probability of 65% for a threshold of $100,000/QALY gained. IIV4 is expected to achieve reductions in influenza-related morbidity and mortality compared to IIV3. Despite not accounting for herd protection, IIV4 is still expected to be a cost-effective alternative to IIV3 up to a price premium of 53%.

14020,Cost-effectiveness analysis of dabigatran and anticoagulation monitoring strategies of vitamin K antagonist,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists are commonly used for the prevention of thromboembolic events. Patient self-monitoring of vitamin K antagonists has proved superior to usual care. Dabigatran has been shown, relative to warfarin, to reduce thromboembolic events without increasing bleeding. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare vitamin K self-monitoring strategies to dabigatran including effectiveness and costs of monitoring and complications (thromboembolism and major bleeding). The model was used to project the incidence of these complications, life years, quality-adjusted life years, and health system costs with anticoagulant treatment throughout life. The analysis was conducted from the health system perspective and from the societal perspective. RESULTS: Low quality evidence suggests that self-monitoring is at least as effective as dabigatran for the outcomes of thrombosis, bleeding and death. Moderate quality evidence that patient self-monitoring is more effective than other forms of monitoring degree of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, reducing the relative risk of thromboembolism by 41 % and death by 34 %. The cost per quality adjusted year gained relative to other warfarin monitoring strategies is well below 30,000 euro in the short term, and is a dominant alternative from the fourth year. In comparison with dabigatran, the lower annual cost and its equivalence in terms of effectiveness made self-monitoring the dominant option. These results were confirmed in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We have moderate quality evidence that self-monitoring of vitamin K antagonists is a cost-effective alternative compared with hospital and primary care monitoring, and low quality evidence, compared with dabigatran.

14024,The Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Japan: A Markov Modeling Study,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of screening and subsequent intervention for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Japan. METHODS: The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and subsequent intervention for AMD were assessed using a Markov model. The Markov model simulation began at the age of 40 years and concluded at the age of 90 years. The first-eye and second-eye combined model assumed an annual state-transition probability, development of prodromal symptoms, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and reduction in visual acuity. Anti-vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (anti-VEGF) intravitreal injection therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) were performed to treat CNV. Intake of supplements was recommended to patients who had prodromal symptoms and unilateral AMD. Data on prevalence, morbidity, transition probability, utility value of each AMD patient, and treatment costs were obtained from published clinical reports. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, screening for AMD every 5 years, beginning at the age of 50 years, showed a decrease of 41% in the total number of blind patients. The screening program reduced the incidence of blindness more than did the additional intake of supplements. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of screening versus no screening was 27,486,352 Japanese yen (JPY), or 259,942 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the sensitivity analysis, prodromal symptom-related factors for AMD had great impacts on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The lowest ICER obtained from the best scenario was 4,913,717 JPY (46,470 USD) per QALY, which was approximately equal to the willingness to pay in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologic screening for AMD in adults is highly effective in reducing the number of patients with blindness but not cost-effective as demonstrated by a Markov model based on clinical data from Japan.",2015-01-17585,26214804,PLoS One,Hiroshi Tamura,2015,10 / 7,e0133628,No,26214804,"Hiroshi Tamura; Rei Goto; Yoko Akune; Yoshimune Hiratsuka; Shusuke Hiragi; Masakazu Yamada; The Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Japan: A Markov Modeling Study, PLoS One , 2015; 10(7):1932-6203; e0133628",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ophthalmologic screening program for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) vs. None,Risk for developing Age-related macular degeneration (AMD),90 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"50 Years, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,27486352,Japan,2014,284958.28
14025,The health and economic impact of vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) during an annual influenza epidemic and influenza pandemic in China,"BACKGROUND: China has experienced several severe outbreaks of influenza over the past century: 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009. Influenza itself can be deadly; however, the increase in mortality during an influenza outbreak is also attributable to secondary bacterial infections, specifically pneumococcal disease. Given the history of pandemic outbreaks and the associated morbidity and mortality, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of a PCV7 vaccination program in China from the context of typical and pandemic influenza seasons. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was employed to evaluate the impact of a 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) infant vaccination program on the incidence, mortality, and cost associated with pneumococcal disease during a typical influenza season (15% flu incidence) and influenza pandemic (30% flu incidence) in China. The model incorporated Chinese data where available and included both direct and indirect (herd) effects on the unvaccinated population, assuming a point in time following the initial introduction of the vaccine where the impact of the indirect effects has reached a steady state, approximately seven years following the implementation of the vaccine program. Pneumococcal disease incidence, mortality, and costs were evaluated over a one year time horizon. Healthcare costs were calculated using a payer perspective and included vaccination program costs and direct medical expenditures from pneumococcal disease. RESULTS: The model predicted that routine PCV7 vaccination of infants in China would prevent 5,053,453 cases of pneumococcal disease and 76,714 deaths in a single year during a normal influenza season.The estimated incremental-cost-effectiveness ratios were yen12,281 (US$1,900) per life-year saved and yen13,737 (US$2,125) per quality-adjusted-life-year gained. During an influenza pandemic, the model estimated that routine vaccination with PCV7 would prevent 8,469,506 cases of pneumococcal disease and 707,526 deaths, and would be cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: Routine vaccination with PCV7 in China would be a cost-effective strategy at limiting the negative impact of influenza during a typical influenza season. During an influenza pandemic, the benefit of PCV7 in preventing excess pneumococcal morbidity and mortality renders a PCV7 vaccination program cost-saving.",2015-01-17596,26206275,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,Ronald Caldwell,2015,15 /,284,No,26206275,"Ronald Caldwell; Craig S Roberts; Zhijie An; Chieh-I Chen; Bruce Wang; The health and economic impact of vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) during an annual influenza epidemic and influenza pandemic in China, J Manag Care Spec Pharm, 2015; 15():2376-1032; 284",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) vs. None,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,3.00,3.00,-1345.33,China,2011,-239.55
14026,Cost effectiveness of nonoperative management versus laparoscopic appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis,"BACKGROUND: Appendectomy remains the gold standard in the treatment of acute, uncomplicated appendicitis in the United States. Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that nonoperative management is safe and efficacious. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree to compare nonoperative management of appendicitis with laparoscopic appendectomy in otherwise healthy adults. Model variables were abstracted from a literature review, data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data, the Medicare Physician Fee schedule, and the American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator. Uncertainty surrounding parameters of the model was assessed via 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Operative management cost $12,213 per patient. Nonoperative management without interval appendectomy (IA) was the dominant strategy, costing $1,865 less and producing 0.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Nonoperative management with IA cost $4,271 more than operative management, but yielded only 0.01 additional QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis suggested operative management would become the preferred strategy if the recurrence rate was >40.5% or the total cost of appendectomy was decreased to <$5,468.

14028,Cost-utility analysis of the use of prophylactic mesh augmentation compared with primary fascial suture repair in patients at high risk for incisional hernia,"BACKGROUND: Although hernia repair with mesh can be successful, prophylactic mesh augmentation (PMA) represents a potentially useful preventative technique to mitigate incisional hernia risk in select high-risk patients. The efficacy, cost-benefit, and societal value of such an intervention are not known. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-utility of using prophylactic mesh to augment fascial incisions. METHODS: A decision tree model was employed to evaluate the cost-utility of using PMA relative to primary suture closure (PSC) after elective laparotomy. The authors adopted the societal perspective for cost and utility estimates. A systematic review of the literature on PMA was performed. The costs in this study included direct hospital costs and indirect costs to society, and utilities were obtained through a survey of 300 English-speaking members of the general public evaluating 14 health state scenarios relating to ventral hernia. RESULTS: PSC without mesh demonstrated an expected average cost of $17,182 (average quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] of 21.17) compared with $15,450 (expected QALY was 21.21) for PMA. PSC was associated with an incremental cost-efficacy ratio (ICER) of -$42,444/QALY compared with PMA such that PMA was more effective and less costly. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was performed demonstrating more simulations resulting in ICERs for PSC above the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, supporting the finding that PMA is superior.

14029,Cost-effectiveness of Adolescent Bariatric Surgery,"BACKGROUND: The current estimates of the prevalence of adolescent morbid obesity and severe morbid obesity are about 21% and 6.6%, respectively. Obesity, if left untreated, may result in a variety of comorbid conditions and earlier mortality. Adolescent bariatric surgery is an effective, but expensive means to ameliorate these conditions and the risk of earlier mortality. We aimed to develop a model to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery. METHODS: All adolescents who participated in our bariatric surgery multidisciplinary program from January 2010 to December 2013 were included if they had at least 12 months follow-up after their surgery. Intervention costs included all operative as well as preoperative and 12-month postoperative care. We used the US Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) to estimate the association between reductions in BMI after surgery with future savings from reduced medical care use and with increased health-related quality of life (HRQL). We linked BMI with life expectancy using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Markov cohort model was then used to project health care-related costs (2013 US$), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over time starting at age 18. Incremental costs per QALY of surgery vs. no surgery from a health care system perspective were then estimated. RESULTS: At one year follow-up, mean weight loss was 37.5 (std. = 13.5) kg and the corresponding BMI was 35.4 (reduction of 13.2, p<0.01). Mean total intervention costs/person were $25,854 (std. = 2,044). A unit change in BMI was associated with future medical care savings of $157/year (p<0.01) and with an increase in HRQL of 0.004 (p<0.01) and life expectancy. At a threshold of a 100,000/QALY, bariatric surgery was not cost-effective in the first three years, but became cost-effective after that ($80,065/QALY in year four and $36,570/QALY in year seven). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that bariatric surgery among adolescents may be cost-effective when evaluated over a long period of time.

14030,The value of male human papillomavirus vaccination in preventing cervical cancer and genital warts in a low-resource setting,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate health benefits and incremental cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of pre-adolescent boys and girls compared with girls alone for preventing cervical cancer and genital warts. DESIGN: Model-based economic evaluation. SETTING: Southern Vietnam. POPULATION: Males and females aged >/=9 years. METHODS: We simulated dynamic HPV transmission to estimate cervical cancer and genital warts cases. Models were calibrated to epidemiological data from south Vietnam. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Vaccinating girls alone was associated with reductions in lifetime cervical cancer risk ranging from 20 to 56.9% as coverage varied from 25 to 90%. Adding boys to the vaccination programme yielded marginal incremental benefits (</=3.6% higher absolute cervical cancer risk reduction), compared with vaccinating girls alone at all coverages. At </=25 international dollars (I$) per vaccinated adolescent (I$5 per dose), HPV vaccination of boys was below the threshold of Vietnam''s per-capita GDP (I$2800), with ICERs ranging from I$734 per QALY at 25% coverage to I$2064 per QALY for 90% coverage. Including health benefits from averting genital warts yielded more favourable ICERs, and vaccination of boys at I$10/dose became cost-effective at or below 75% coverage. Using a lower cost-effectiveness threshold of 50% of Vietnam''s GDP (I$1400), vaccinating boys was no longer attractive at costs above I$5 per dose regardless of coverage. CONCLUSION: Vaccination of boys may be cost-effective at low vaccine costs, but provides little benefit over vaccinating girls only. Focusing on achieving high vaccine coverage of girls may be more efficient for southern Vietnam and similar low-resource settings.

14031,Economic analysis of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of urinary tract infections in infants with high-grade hydronephrosis,"BACKGROUND: For infants with hydronephrosis, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) may reduce urinary tract infections (UTIs); however, its value remains controversial. Recent studies have suggested that neonates with severe obstructive hydronephrosis are at an increased risk of UTIs, and support the use of CAP. Other studies have demonstrated the negligible risk for UTIs in the setting of suspected ureteropelvic junction obstruction and have highlighted the limited role of CAP in hydronephrosis. Furthermore, economic studies in this patient population have been sparse. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether the use of CAP is an efficient expenditure for preventing UTIs in children with high-grade hydronephrosis within the first 2 years of life. STUDY DESIGN: A decision model was used to estimate expected costs, clinical outcomes and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of CAP versus no CAP (Fig. 1). Cost data were collected from provincial databases and converted to 2013 Canadian dollars (CAD). Estimates of risks and health utility values were extracted from published literature. The analysis was performed over a time horizon of 2 years. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess uncertainty and robustness. RESULTS: Overall, CAP use was less costly and provided a minimal increase in health utility when compared to no CAP (Table). The mean cost over two years for CAP and no CAP was CAD$1571.19 and CAD$1956.44, respectively. The use of CAP reduced outpatient-managed UTIs by 0.21 infections and UTIs requiring hospitalization by 0.04 infections over 2 years. Cost-utility analysis revealed an increase of 0.0001 QALYs/year when using CAP. The CAP arm exhibited strong dominance over no CAP in all sensitivity analyses and across all willingness-to-pay thresholds. DISCUSSION: The use of CAP exhibited strong dominance in the economic evaluation, despite a small gain of 0.0001 QALYs/year. Whether this slight gain is clinically significant remains to be determined. However, small QALY gains have been reported in other pediatric economic evaluations. Strengths of this study included the use of data from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, in addition to a comprehensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Limitations of this study included the use of estimates for UTI probabilities in the second year of life and health utility values, given that they were lacking in the literature. Spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis and surgical management were also not implemented in this model. CONCLUSION: To prevent UTIs within the first 2 years of life in infants with high-grade hydronephrosis, this probabilistic model has shown that CAP use is a prudent expenditure of healthcare resources when compared to no CAP.",2015-01-17669,26174147,Eur Heart J,H Y V Tu,2015,/,,No,26174147,"H Y V Tu; J Pemberton; A J Lorenzo; L H Braga; Economic analysis of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of urinary tract infections in infants with high-grade hydronephrosis, Eur Heart J, 2015 Jun 20; ():1522-9645",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of urinary tract infections vs. None,Not Stated,2 Years,0 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,5.00,5.00,-3852500,Canada,2013,-4156932.32
14032,Cost-effectiveness of 10-Year Risk Thresholds for Initiation of Statin Therapy for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,"IMPORTANCE: The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol treatment guidelines have wide-scale implications for treating adults without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with statins. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of various 10-year ASCVD risk thresholds that could be used in the ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation model, including lifetime time horizon, US societal perspective, 3% discount rate for costs, and health outcomes. In the model, hypothetical individuals from a representative US population aged 40 to 75 years received statin treatment, experienced ASCVD events, and died from ASCVD-related or non-ASCVD-related causes based on ASCVD natural history and statin treatment parameters. Data sources for model parameters included National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, large clinical trials and meta-analyses for statin benefits and treatment, and other published sources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated ASCVD events prevented and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the current ASCVD threshold of 7.5% or higher, which was estimated to be associated with 48% of adults treated with statins, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $37,000/QALY compared with a 10% or higher threshold. More lenient ASCVD thresholds of 4.0% or higher (61% of adults treated) and 3.0% or higher (67% of adults treated) had ICERs of $81,000/QALY and $140,000/QALY, respectively. Shifting from a 7.5% or higher ASCVD risk threshold to a 3.0% or higher ASCVD risk threshold was estimated to be associated with an additional 161,560 cardiovascular disease events averted. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to changes in the disutility associated with taking a pill daily, statin price, and the risk of statin-induced diabetes. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a higher than 93% chance that the optimal ASCVD threshold was 5.0% or lower using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this microsimulation model of US adults aged 45 to 70 years, the current 10-year ASCVD risk threshold (>/=7.5% risk threshold) used in the ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines has an acceptable cost-effectiveness profile (ICER, $37,000/QALY), but more lenient ASCVD thresholds would be optimal using cost-effectiveness thresholds of $100,000/QALY (>/=4.0% risk threshold) or $150,000/QALY (>/=3.0% risk threshold).

14035,Making a case for high-volume robotic surgery centers: A cost-effectiveness analysis of transoral robotic surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) compared to intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for early stage (T1-2, N0, M0) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov decision tree model with a 5-year time horizon was developed. Comparative groups were: i) TORS with concurrent ipsilateral neck dissection +/- adjunctive IMRT, and ii) primary IMRT. Primary outcome was cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY). Perspective was the United States third party payer. Costs and effects were discounted at a rate of 3.5%. A threshold and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: TORS strategy cost $30,992 and provided 4.81 QALYs/patient. The IMRT strategy cost $26,033 and provided a total of 4.78 QALYs/patient. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for TORS vs. IMRT in the reference case was $165,300/QALY. The probability that TORS is cost-effective compared to IMRT at a maximum willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY is 42%. CONCLUSION: An IMRT strategy for management of early stage OPSCC is more likely to be cost-effective compared to TORS. To improve the value of TORS for early stage OPSCC, consolidating TORS procedures to create high-volume centers of excellence may be a potential strategy to increase incremental effectiveness and reduce incremental costs.

Two BRAF(V600E) targeted therapies, dabrafenib and vemurafenib, have received US approval for treatment of metastatic melanoma in BRAF(V600E) patients, a mutation that affects ~50% of patients. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BRAF inhibitors and traditional chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Methods. A Markov model was developed using a societal perspective. Transition probabilities were derived from two Phase III registration trials comparing each BRAF inhibitor against dacarbazine. Costs were obtained from literature, national databases, and Medicare fee schedules. Utilities were obtained from published literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were run to test the impact of uncertainties. Results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dabrafenib was $149,035/QALY compared to dacarbazine. Vemurafenib was dominated by dabrafenib. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of </=$100,000/QALY, dacarbazine was the optimal treatment in ~85% of simulations. At a WTP threshold of >/=$150,000/QALY, dabrafenib was the optimal treatment. Conclusion.

14039,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a National Newborn Screening Program for Biotinidase Deficiency,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There are conflicting views as to whether testing for biotinidase deficiency (BD) ought to be incorporated into universal newborn screening (NBS) programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding BD to the panel of conditions currently screened under the national NBS program in Spain. METHODS: We used information from the regional NBS program for BD that has been in place in the Spanish region of Galicia since 1987. These data, along with other sources, were used to develop a cost-effectiveness decision model that compared lifetime costs and health outcomes of a national birth cohort of newborns with and without an early detection program. The analysis took the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We undertook extensive sensitivity analyses around the main model assumptions, including a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, NBS for BD led to higher QALYs and higher health care costs, with an estimated incremental cost per QALY gained of $24 677. Lower costs per QALY gained were found when conservative assumptions were relaxed, yielding cost savings in some scenarios. The probability that BD screening was cost-effective was estimated to be >70% in the base case at a standard threshold value.

14040,Management of Malignant Pleural Effusion: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is associated with a significant impact on health-related quality of life. Palliative interventions abound, with varying costs and degrees of invasiveness. We examined the relative cost-utility of 5 therapeutic alternatives for MPE among adults. METHODS: Original studies investigating the management of MPE were extensively researched, and the most robust and current data particularly those from the TIME2 trial were chosen to estimate event probabilities. Medicare data were used for cost estimation. Utility estimates were adapted from 2 original studies and kept consistent with prior estimations. The decision tree model was based on clinical guidelines and authors' consensus opinion. Primary outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each intervention over a less effective alternative over an analytical horizon of 6 months. Given the paucity of data on rapid pleurodesis protocol, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uncertainty surrounding its efficacy in terms of achieving long-term pleurodesis. RESULTS: Except for repeated thoracentesis (RT; least effective), all interventions had similar effectiveness. Tunneled pleural catheter was the most cost-effective option with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45,747 per QALY gained over RT, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Multivariate sensitivity analysis showed that rapid pleurodesis protocol remained cost-ineffective even with an estimated probability of lasting pleurodesis up to 85%.

Palliative interventions abound, with varying costs and degrees of invasiveness. We examined the relative cost-utility of 5 therapeutic alternatives for MPE among adults. METHODS: Original studies investigating the management of MPE were extensively researched, and the most robust and current data particularly those from the TIME2 trial were chosen to estimate event probabilities. Medicare data were used for cost estimation. Utility estimates were adapted from 2 original studies and kept consistent with prior estimations. The decision tree model was based on clinical guidelines and authors' consensus opinion. Primary outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each intervention over a less effective alternative over an analytical horizon of 6 months. Given the paucity of data on rapid pleurodesis protocol, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uncertainty surrounding its efficacy in terms of achieving long-term pleurodesis. RESULTS: Except for repeated thoracentesis (RT; least effective), all interventions had similar effectiveness.

14045,Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of split-septum and single-use prefilled flushing device vs 3-way stopcock on central line-associated bloodstream infection rates in India: a randomized clinical trial conducted by the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC),"BACKGROUND: Three-way stopcocks (3WSCs) are open systems used on intravenous tubing. Split septums (SSs) are closed systems with prepierced septums. Single-use prefilled flushing devices (SUFs) carry a lower risk of contamination than standard intravenous flushing. 3WSC and standard flushing are widely used in developing countries. This is the first randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare rates of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) between patients using an SS + SUF and those using a 3WSC. METHODS: An RCT with 1096 patients in 5 adult intensive care units was conducted between April 2012 and August 2014 to evaluate their impact on CLABSI rates. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network definitions were applied and International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium methodology were followed. RESULTS: The study cohort included 547 patients and 3619 central line (CL)-days for the SS + SUF group, and 549 patients and 4061 CL-days for the 3WSC group. CLABSI rates were 2.21 per 1000 CL-days for SS + SUF and 6.40 per 1000 CL-days for 3WSC (relative risk, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.76; P = .006). The SS + SUF group had significantly better cumulative infection-free catheter survival compared with the 3WSC group (hazard ration, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.73; P = .006). Using an SS + SUF represents savings of $402.88 and an increase in quality-adjusted life years of 0.0008 per patient. For each extra dollar invested in an SS + SUF, $124 was saved. CONCLUSION: The use of SS + SUF is cost-effective and associated with a significantly lower CLABSI rate compared with the use of 3WSC.",2015-01-17699,26164769,J Health Serv Res Policy,Victor Daniel Rosenthal,2015,/,,No,26164769,"Victor Daniel Rosenthal; Farokh Earch Udwadia; Siva Kumar; Aruna Poojary; Rathi Sankar; Pablo Wenceslao Orellano; Shilpa Durgad; Mahendran Thulasiraman; Shweta Bahirune; Shubhangi Kumbhar; Priyanka Patil; Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of split-septum and single-use prefilled flushing device vs 3-way stopcock on central line-associated bloodstream infection rates in India: a randomized clinical trial conducted by the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC), J Health Serv Res Policy, 2015 Jul 8; ():1758-1060",QALY,India,Not Stated,Not Stated,Split septum and single-use prefilled flushing device on IV vs. 3-way stopcock on central line of IV,Patients using IV,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-503600.03,United States,2013,-559490.5
14046,Cost-effectiveness of adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in the Netherlands,"The Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA) demonstrated the efficacy of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in preventing vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia and vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease in elderly subjects. We examined the cost-effectiveness of PCV13-vaccination in the Netherlands.Using a Markov-type model, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of PCV13-vaccination in different age- and risk-groups for pneumococcal disease were evaluated using a societal perspective. Estimates of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, vaccine efficacy and epidemiological data were based on the CAPiTA study and other prospective studies. The base-case was PCV13-vaccination of adults aged 65-74 years compared to no vaccination, assuming no net indirect effects in base-case due to paediatric 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use. Analyses for age- and risk-group specific vaccination strategies and for different levels of hypothetical herd effects from a paediatric PCV programme were also conducted.The ICER for base-case was euro8650 per QALY (95% CI 5750-17 100). Vaccination of high-risk individuals aged 65-74 years was cost-saving and extension to medium-risk individuals aged 65-74 years yielded an ICER of euro2900. Further extension to include medium- and high-risk individuals aged >/=18 years yielded an ICER of euro3100.PCV13-vaccination is highly cost-effective in the Netherlands.

METHODS: Decision trees simulated in-hospital mortality, costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per life year saved, and carbapenem resistance according to 3 empirical antibiotic strategies among adults hospitalized for community-acquired (CA) upper urinary tract infections (UTIs): ceftriaxone (CRO) plus gentamicin (GM) in the intensive care unit (ICU), imipenem (IMP), and individualized choice (IMP or CRO) based on clinical risk factors for CA- extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of CA-ESBL on admission was 5% (range, 1.3%-17.6%); 3% and 97% were admitted to the ICU and medical ward (MW), respectively.

14051,Carboplatin plus pemetrexed offers superior cost-effectiveness compared to pemetrexed in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and performance status 2,"OBJECTIVE: Pemetrexed plus carboplatin offers survival advantage in first line treatment of advanced lung cancer patients with performance status of 2. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of this combined regimen compared to pemetrexed alone in a Brazilian population. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on a randomized phase III trial in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ECOG performance status of 2 (PS2), comparing doublet regimen pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed alone. The perspective adopted was the public health care sector over a three-year period. Direct medical costs and survival time were calculated from patient-level data and utility values were extracted from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainties in the results. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The combined regimen pemetrexed plus carboplatin yielded a gain of 0.16 life year (LY) and 0.12 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to pemetrexed alone. The total cost was 17,674.31 USD for the combined regimen and 15,722.39 USD for pemetrexed alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $12,016.09 per LY gained and $15,732.05 per QALY gained. The factors with the greatest impact on the ICER are pemetrexed price and the time to progression utility value. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed an upper 90% probability of pemetrexed plus carboplatin being cost-effective with a threshold between two and three GDP per capita. Our study suggests superiority of the combined pemetrexed plus carboplatin regimen in terms of efficacy as well as cost-effectiveness in advanced NSCLC patients with a poor performance status of 2.",2015-01-17729,26143106,Lung Cancer,Luciene Schluckebier,2015,89 / 3,274-9,No,26143106,"Luciene Schluckebier; Osvaldo U Garay; Mauro Zukin; Carlos G Ferreira; Carboplatin plus pemetrexed offers superior cost-effectiveness compared to pemetrexed in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and performance status 2, Lung Cancer, 2015 Sep; 89(3):0169-5002; 274-9",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pemetrexed (500mg/m2) plus carboplatin (AUC5) vs. Pemetrexed (500mg/m2) alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"3 Years, Lifetime",5.00,Not Stated,15732.05,United States,2012,17734.03
14052,A Decision Analysis of Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Relative to Novel and Traditional Oral Anticoagulation for Stroke Prevention in Patients with New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a nonpharmacologic approach for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). No direct comparisons to novel oral anticoagulants (OACs) exists, limiting decision making on the optimal strategy for stroke prevention in NVAF patients. Addressing this gap in knowledge is timely given the recent debate by the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the effectiveness of LAAO. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LAAO and novel OACs relative to warfarin in patients with new-onset NVAF without contraindications to OAC. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis using a patient-level Markov micro-simulation decision analytic model was undertaken to determine the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of LAAO and all novel OACs relative to warfarin. Effectiveness and utility data were obtained from the published literature and cost from the Ontario Drug Benefits Formulary and Case Costing Initiative. RESULTS: Warfarin had the lowest discounted QALY (5.13 QALYs), followed by dabigatran (5.18 QALYs), rivaroxaban and LAAO (5.21 QALYs), and apixaban (5.25 QALYs). The average discounted lifetime costs were $15 776 for warfarin, $18 280 for rivaroxaban, $19 156 for apixaban, $20 794 for dabigatran, and $21 789 for LAAO. Apixaban dominated dabigatran and LAAO and demonstrated extended dominance over rivaroxaban. The ICER for apixaban relative to warfarin was $28 167/QALY. Apixaban was preferred in 40.2% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY.

14054,A Decision Analysis of Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Relative to Novel and Traditional Oral Anticoagulation for Stroke Prevention in Patients with New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a nonpharmacologic approach for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). No direct comparisons to novel oral anticoagulants (OACs) exists, limiting decision making on the optimal strategy for stroke prevention in NVAF patients. Addressing this gap in knowledge is timely given the recent debate by the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the effectiveness of LAAO. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LAAO and novel OACs relative to warfarin in patients with new-onset NVAF without contraindications to OAC. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis using a patient-level Markov micro-simulation decision analytic model was undertaken to determine the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of LAAO and all novel OACs relative to warfarin. Effectiveness and utility data were obtained from the published literature and cost from the Ontario Drug Benefits Formulary and Case Costing Initiative. RESULTS: Warfarin had the lowest discounted QALY (5.13 QALYs), followed by dabigatran (5.18 QALYs), rivaroxaban and LAAO (5.21 QALYs), and apixaban (5.25 QALYs). The average discounted lifetime costs were $15 776 for warfarin, $18 280 for rivaroxaban, $19 156 for apixaban, $20 794 for dabigatran, and $21 789 for LAAO. Apixaban dominated dabigatran and LAAO and demonstrated extended dominance over rivaroxaban. The ICER for apixaban relative to warfarin was $28 167/QALY. Apixaban was preferred in 40.2% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY.

14057,Cost-effectiveness of first-line erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer unsuitable for chemotherapy,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib versus supportive care (placebo) overall and within a predefined rash subgroup in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who are unfit for chemotherapy and receive only active supportive care due to their poor performance status or presence of comorbidities. SETTING: Between 2005 and 2009, a total of 670 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomised across 78 hospital sites (centres) in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 670 patients with pathologically confirmed stage IIIb-IV NSCLC, unfit for chemotherapy, predominantly poor performance status (>2 on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG) and estimated life expectancy of at least 8 weeks. Patients were followed until disease progression or death, including a subgroup of patients who developed first cycle rash. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive best supportive care plus oral placebo or erlotinib (150 mg/day) until disease progression, toxicity or death. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Overall survival (OS). SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Progression-free survival (PFS), tumour response and quality adjusted life years (QALY), including within prespecified subgroups. RESULTS: The mean incremental cost per QALY in all patients was pound202,571/QALY. The probability of cost-effectiveness of erlotinib in all patients was <10% at thresholds up to pound100,000. However, within the rash subgroup, the incremental cost/QALY was pound56,770/QALY with a probability of cost-effectiveness of about 80% for cost-effectiveness thresholds between pound50,000 to pound60,000. CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib has about 80% chance of being cost-effective at thresholds between pound50,000- pound60,000 in a subset of elderly poor performance patients with NSCLC unfit for chemotherapy who develop first cycle (28 days) rash.

14059,Cost-effectiveness analysis of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs insulin glargine once daily (QD) as add-on therapy in Chinese patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by oral therapies,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate cost-effectiveness of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs insulin glargine once daily (QD) as add-on therapy in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients not well controlled by oral anti-diabetic (OAD) agents. METHODS: The Cardiff model was populated with data synthesized from three head-to-head randomized clinical trials of up to 30 weeks in China comparing exenatide BID vs insulin glargine as add-on therapies to oral therapies in the Chinese population. The Cardiff model generated outputs including macrovascular and microvascular complications, diabetes-specific mortality, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and QALYs were estimated with a time horizon of 40 years at a discount rate of 3% from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Compared with insulin glargine plus OAD treatments, patients on exenatide BID plus OAD gained 1.88 QALYs, at an incremental cost saving of Chinese Renminbi (RMB) 114,593 (i.e., cost saving of RMB 61078/QALY). The cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The variables with the most impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio included HbA1c level at baseline, health utilities decrement, and BMI at baseline.

14060,Do Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines Represent Good Value for Money in a Lower-Middle Income Country? A Cost-Utility Analysis in the Philippines,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to assess the value for money of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines as part of the immunization program in a lower-middle income country, the Philippines, which is not eligible for GAVI support and lower vaccine prices. It also includes the newest clinical evidence evaluating the efficacy of PCV10, which is lacking in other previous studies. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted. A Markov simulation model was constructed to examine the costs and consequences of PCV10 and PCV13 against the current scenario of no PCV vaccination for a lifetime horizon. A health system perspective was employed to explore different funding schemes, which include universal or partial vaccination coverage subsidized by the government. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Philippine peso (Php) per QALY gained (1 USD = 44.20 Php). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: With universal vaccination at a cost per dose of Php 624 for PCV10 and Php 700 for PCV13, both PCVs are cost-effective compared to no vaccination given the ceiling threshold of Php 120,000 per QALY gained, yielding ICERs of Php 68,182 and Php 54,510 for PCV10 and PCV13, respectively. Partial vaccination of 25% of the birth cohort resulted in significantly higher ICER values (Php 112,640 for PCV10 and Php 84,654 for PCV13) due to loss of herd protection. The budget impact analysis reveals that universal vaccination would cost Php 3.87 billion to 4.34 billion per annual, or 1.6 to 1.8 times the budget of the current national vaccination program.

14065,Do Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines Represent Good Value for Money in a Lower-Middle Income Country? A Cost-Utility Analysis in the Philippines,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to assess the value for money of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines as part of the immunization program in a lower-middle income country, the Philippines, which is not eligible for GAVI support and lower vaccine prices. It also includes the newest clinical evidence evaluating the efficacy of PCV10, which is lacking in other previous studies. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted. A Markov simulation model was constructed to examine the costs and consequences of PCV10 and PCV13 against the current scenario of no PCV vaccination for a lifetime horizon. A health system perspective was employed to explore different funding schemes, which include universal or partial vaccination coverage subsidized by the government. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Philippine peso (Php) per QALY gained (1 USD = 44.20 Php). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: With universal vaccination at a cost per dose of Php 624 for PCV10 and Php 700 for PCV13, both PCVs are cost-effective compared to no vaccination given the ceiling threshold of Php 120,000 per QALY gained, yielding ICERs of Php 68,182 and Php 54,510 for PCV10 and PCV13, respectively. Partial vaccination of 25% of the birth cohort resulted in significantly higher ICER values (Php 112,640 for PCV10 and Php 84,654 for PCV13) due to loss of herd protection. The budget impact analysis reveals that universal vaccination would cost Php 3.87 billion to 4.34 billion per annual, or 1.6 to 1.8 times the budget of the current national vaccination program. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of PCV in the national immunization program is recommended. PCV13 achieved better value for money compared to PCV10.

14066,Cost-utility analysis of certolizumab pegol versus alternative tumour necrosis factor inhibitors available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis in Spain,"BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol, a PEGylated tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor, improves the clinical signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when used in combination with methotrexate or as monotherapy. This study evaluatedthe cost-utility of certolizumab pegol versusTNF-inhibitors plus methotrexate in the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA in Spain. METHODS: A Markov cohort health state transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility (costs and quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of certolizumab pegol versus other TNF-inhibitors licensed in Spain in 2009. Efficacy was measured using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses at 6 months, based on adjusted indirect comparisons from published clinical trials. Utilities were derived from EQ-5D data from certolizumab pegol RA clinical trials. Clinical history and resource use data came from published literature. Unit costs were taken from Spanish databases or published data (cost year 2009). Base case analyses were conducted from the payer perspective, with a lifetime horizon, 3.5 % annual discounting rates for costs and outcomes, and 3 % inflation rate for 2009 onwards. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The average lifetime costs for certolizumab pegol, etanercept, adalimumab (every 2 weeks and weekly) and infliximab (3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) in combination with methotrexate were euro140,971, euro141,197, euro139,148, euro164,741, euro136,961 and euro152,561, respectively. The QALYs gained were 6.578, 6.462, 6.430 (for both adalimumab doses), 6.430, and 6.318 (for both infliximab doses), respectively. At a euro30,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, certolizumab pegol plus methotrexate dominated adalimumab weekly, etanercept, and infliximab 5 mg/kg, and was cost-effective versus adalimumab every 2 weeks and infliximab 3 mg/kg (all with methotrexate), with estimated ICERs of euro12,346/QALY and euro15,414/QALY, respectively. Certolizumab pegol monotherapy was more cost-effective versus adalimumab, and less expensive with similar health gains versus etanercept (6.416 QALYs vs 6.492). Univariate analysis showed ICERs to be sensitive to changes in time horizon, ACR response time point, baseline Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and rate of HAQ-disability index deterioration after discontinuing treatment.

Base case analyses were conducted from the payer perspective, with a lifetime horizon, 3.5 % annual discounting rates for costs and outcomes, and 3 % inflation rate for 2009 onwards. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The average lifetime costs for certolizumab pegol, etanercept, adalimumab (every 2 weeks and weekly) and infliximab (3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) in combination with methotrexate were euro140,971, euro141,197, euro139,148, euro164,741, euro136,961 and euro152,561, respectively. The QALYs gained were 6.578, 6.462, 6.430 (for both adalimumab doses), 6.430, and 6.318 (for both infliximab doses), respectively. At a euro30,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, certolizumab pegol plus methotrexate dominated adalimumab weekly, etanercept, and infliximab 5 mg/kg, and was cost-effective versus adalimumab every 2 weeks and infliximab 3 mg/kg (all with methotrexate), with estimated ICERs of euro12,346/QALY and euro15,414/QALY, respectively. Certolizumab pegol monotherapy was more cost-effective versus adalimumab, and less expensive with similar health gains versus etanercept (6.416 QALYs vs 6.492). Univariate analysis showed ICERs to be sensitive to changes in time horizon, ACR response time point, baseline Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and rate of HAQ-disability index deterioration after discontinuing treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that certolizumab pegol is cost-effective compared with other TNF-inhibitors recommended in Spain for the treatment of RA.",2015-01-17765,26124700,Int J Cardiol,Alvaro Hidalgo-Vega,2015,13 /,11,No,26124700,"Alvaro Hidalgo-Vega; Renata Villoro; Juan Antonio Blasco; Pablo Talavera; Belen Ferro; Oana Purcaru; Cost-utility analysis of certolizumab pegol versus alternative tumour necrosis factor inhibitors available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis in Spain, Int J Cardiol, 2015; 13():1874-1754; 11",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Certolizumab pegol vs. Etanercept,Inadequate response to methotrexate alone,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,8778,Euro,2009,14756.99
14074,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Capitated Patient Navigation Program for Medicare Beneficiaries with Lung Cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a patient navigation (PN) program with capitated payment for Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with lung cancer. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model to capture the disease progression of lung cancer and characterize clinical benefits of PN services as timeliness of treatment and care coordination. Taking a payer's perspective, we estimated the lifetime costs, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and addressed uncertainties in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Model inputs were extracted from the literature, supplemented with data from a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration project. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to usual care, PN services incurred higher costs but also yielded better outcomes. The incremental cost and effectiveness was $9,145 and 0.47 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,312/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that findings were most sensitive to a parameter capturing PN survival benefit for local-stage patients. CE-acceptability curve showed the probability that the PN program was cost-effective was 0.80 and 0.91 at a societal willingness-to-pay of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSION: Instituting a capitated PN program is cost-effective for lung cancer patients in Medicare.

14075,Local anaesthetic wound infiltration in addition to standard anaesthetic regimen in total hip and knee replacement: long-term cost-effectiveness analyses alongside the APEX randomised controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: The Arthroplasty Pain Experience (APEX) studies are two randomised controlled trials in primary total hip (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) at a large UK orthopaedics centre. APEX investigated the effect of local anaesthetic wound infiltration (LAI), administered before wound closure, in addition to standard analgesia, on pain severity at 12 months. This article reports results of the within-trial economic evaluations. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was assessed from the health and social care payer perspective in relation to quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and the primary clinical outcome, the WOMAC Pain score at 12-months follow-up. Resource use was collected from hospital records and patient-completed postal questionnaires, and valued using unit cost estimates from local NHS Trust finance department and national tariffs. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation chained equations. Costs and outcomes were compared per trial arm and plotted in cost-effectiveness planes. If no arm was dominant (i.e., more effective and less expensive than the other), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. The economic results were bootstrapped incremental net monetary benefit statistics (INMB) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. One-way deterministic sensitivity analyses explored any methodological uncertainty. RESULTS: In both the THR and TKR trials, LAI was the dominant treatment: cost-saving and more effective than standard care, in relation to QALYs and WOMAC Pain. Using the pound20,000 per QALY threshold, in THR, the INMB was pound1,125 (95 % BCI, pound183 to pound2,067) and the probability of being cost-effective was over 98 %. In TKR, the INMB was pound264 (95 % BCI, - pound710 to pound1,238), but there was only 62 % probability of being cost-effective. When considering an NHS perspective only, LAI was no longer dominant in THR, but still highly cost-effective, with an INMB of pound961 (95 % BCI, pound50 to pound1,873). CONCLUSIONS: Administering LAI is a cost-effective treatment option in THR and TKR surgeries. The evidence, because of larger QALY gain, is stronger for THR. In TKR, there is more uncertainty around the economic result, and smaller QALY gains. Results, however, point to LAI being cheaper than standard analgesia, which includes a femoral nerve block.

14076,Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus vitamin K antagonists in the management of atrial fibrillation in Argentina,"Apixaban, a novel oral anticoagulant which has been approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, reduces both ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke and produces fewer bleedings than vitamin K antagonist warfarin. These clinical results lead to a decrease in health care resource utilization and, therefore, have a positive impact on health economics of atrial fibrillation. The cost-effectiveness of apixaban has been assessed in a variety of clinical settings and countries. However, data from emergent markets, as is the case of Argentina, are still scarce.We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of apixaban versus warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in patients suitable for oral anticoagulation in Argentina. A Markov-based model including both costs and effects were used to simulate a cohort of patients with NVAF. Local epidemiological, resource utilization and cost data were used and all inputs were validated by a Delphi Panel of local experts. We adopted the payer's perspective with costs expressed in 2012 US Dollars.The study revealed that apixaban is cost-effective compared with warfarin using a willingness to pay threshold ranging from 1 to 3 per capita Gross Domestic Product (11558 - 34664 USD) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 786.08 USD per QALY gained. The benefit is primarily a result of the reduction in stroke and bleeding events.The study demonstrates that apixaban is a cost-effective alternative to warfarin in Argentina.",2015-01-17789,26112219,J Neurosurg Spine,Mariano Anibal Giorgi,2015,5 / 1,52,No,26112219,"Mariano Anibal Giorgi; Christian Caroli; Norberto Damian Giglio; Paula Micone; Eleonora Aiello; Cristina Vulcano; Julia Blanco; Bonnie Donato; Joaquin Mould Quevedo; Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus vitamin K antagonists in the management of atrial fibrillation in Argentina, J Neurosurg Spine, 2015 Dec; 5(1):1547-5646; 52",QALY,Argentina,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Standard/Usual Care- Vitamin K antagonist warfarin,Suitable for the use of oral anticoagulants,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,78608,United States,2012,88611.27

The economic impact of a biomarker-based diagnostic strategy for AKI in pediatric populations undergoing CHD surgery is unknown. The aim of this study was to perform the cost effectiveness analysis of using serum cystatin C (sCysC), urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) and urine liver fatty acid-binding protein (uL-FABP) for the diagnosis of AKI in children after cardiac surgery compared with current diagnostic method (monitoring of serum creatinine (sCr) level). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision analytical model to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness of different biomarker-based diagnostic strategies compared to current diagnostic strategy. The Markov model was created to compare the lifetime cost associated with using of sCysC, uNGAL, uL-FABP with monitoring of sCr level for the diagnosis of AKI. The utility measurement included in the analysis was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The results of the analysis are presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Analysed biomarker-based diagnostic strategies for AKI were cost-effective compared to current diagnostic method. However, uNGAL and sCys C strategies yielded higher costs and lower effectiveness compared to uL-FABP strategy. uL-FABP added 1.43 QALY compared to current diagnostic method at an additional cost of $8521.87 per patient.

14080,Cost-effectiveness of Collaborative Care for Depression in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Clinics,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of the HITIDES intervention. DESIGN: Randomized controlled effectiveness and implementation trial comparing depression collaborative care with enhanced usual care. SETTING: Three Veterans Health Administration (VHA) HIV clinics in the Southern US. SUBJECTS: 249 HIV-infected patients completed the baseline interview; 123 were randomized to the intervention and 126 to usual care. INTERVENTION: HITIDES consisted of an off-site HIV depression care team that delivered up to 12 months of collaborative care. The intervention used a stepped-care model for depression treatment and specific recommendations were based on the Texas Medication Algorithm Project and the VA/Department of Defense Depression Treatment Guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, the Quality of Well Being Scale, and by converting depression-free days to QALYs. The base case analysis used outpatient, pharmacy, patient, and intervention costs. Cost-effectiveness was calculated using incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net health benefit (NHB). ICER distributions were generated using nonparametric bootstrap with replacement sampling. RESULTS: The HITIDES intervention was more effective and cost-saving compared to usual care in 78% of bootstrapped samples. The intervention NHB was positive and therefore deemed cost-effective using an ICER threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV clinic settings this intervention was more effective and cost-saving compared to usual care.

METHODS: The ARAMIS-DTG model is a microsimulation model with a lifetime analytic time horizon and a monthly cycle length. Markov health states were defined by HIV health state (with or without opportunistic infection). DTG was compared to efavirenz (EFV), raltegravir (RAL), darunavir/ritonavir, rilpivirine (RPV), elvitegravir/cobicistat, atazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in TN patients and to RAL in TE patients. The initial cohort, the main efficacy data and safety data were derived from phase III clinical trials. Treatment algorithms were based on expert opinion. Costs normalized to the year 2013 included antiretroviral treatment cost, testing, adverse event, HIV and cardiovascular disease care and were derived from the literature. RESULTS: Dolutegravir was estimated to be the dominant strategy compared with all comparators in both TN and TE patients. Treatment with DTG was associated with additional quality-adjusted life-years that ranged from 0.17 (vs. RAL) to 0.47 (vs. EFV) in TN patients and was 0.60 in TE patients over a lifetime. Cost savings ranged from Can$1393 (vs. RPV) to Can$28,572 (vs. RAL) in TN patients and amounted to Can$3745 in TE patients. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the model.

METHODS: The ARAMIS-DTG model is a microsimulation model with a lifetime analytic time horizon and a monthly cycle length. Markov health states were defined by HIV health state (with or without opportunistic infection). DTG was compared to efavirenz (EFV), raltegravir (RAL), darunavir/ritonavir, rilpivirine (RPV), elvitegravir/cobicistat, atazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in TN patients and to RAL in TE patients. The initial cohort, the main efficacy data and safety data were derived from phase III clinical trials. Treatment algorithms were based on expert opinion. Costs normalized to the year 2013 included antiretroviral treatment cost, testing, adverse event, HIV and cardiovascular disease care and were derived from the literature. RESULTS: Dolutegravir was estimated to be the dominant strategy compared with all comparators in both TN and TE patients. Treatment with DTG was associated with additional quality-adjusted life-years that ranged from 0.17 (vs. RAL) to 0.47 (vs. EFV) in TN patients and was 0.60 in TE patients over a lifetime. Cost savings ranged from Can$1393 (vs. RPV) to Can$28,572 (vs. RAL) in TN patients and amounted to Can$3745 in TE patients. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the model.

14089,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Rivaroxaban in the Secondary Prevention of Acute Coronary Syndromes in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, coronary heart disease accounts for 7 million deaths each year. In Sweden, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of hospitalization and is responsible for 1 in 4 deaths. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) in combination with standard antiplatelet therapy (ST-APT) versus ST-APT alone, for the secondary prevention of ACS in adult patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers without a prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), from a Swedish societal perspective, based on clinical data from the global ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial, literature-based quality of life data and costs sourced from Swedish national databases. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to capture rates of single and multiple myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major, minor, and ""requiring medical attention"" bleeds, revascularization events, and associated costs and utilities in patients who were stabilized after an initial ACS event. Efficacy and safety data for the first 2 years came from the ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial. Long-term probabilities were extrapolated using safety and effectiveness of acetylsalicylic acid data, which was estimated from published literature, assuming constant rates in time. Future cost and effects were discounted at 3.0%. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the base case, the use of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID was associated with improvements in survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), yielding an incremental cost per QALY of 71,246 Swedish Krona (SEK) (<euro>8045). The outcomes were robust to changes in inputs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID to be cost-effective in >99.9% of cases, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of SEK 500,000 (<euro>56,458). CONCLUSION: Compared with ST-APT alone, the use of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID in combination with ST-APT can be considered a cost-effective treatment option for ACS patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers without a prior history of stroke/TIA in Sweden.

14090,The cost-effectiveness of UGT1A1 genotyping before colorectal cancer treatment with irinotecan from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance,"BACKGROUND: The evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of UGT1A1*28 genotyping is ambiguous and does not allow drawing valid conclusions for Germany. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of UGT1A1 genotyping in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing irinotecan-based chemotherapy compared to no testing from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model with a life time horizon was developed. No testing was compared to two genotype-dependent therapy strategies: 1) dose reduction by 25%; and 2) administration of a prophylactic G-CSF growth factor analog for homozygous and heterozygous patients. Probability, quality of life and cost parameters used in this study were based on published literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: Strategy 1 dominated all remaining strategies. Compared to no testing, it resulted in only marginal QALY increases (0.0002) but a cost reduction of euro580 per patient. Strategy 2 resulted in the same health gains but increased costs by euro10 773. In the probabilistic analysis, genotyping and dose reduction was the optimal strategy in approximately 100% of simulations at a threshold of euro50 000 per QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis shows that uncertainty for this strategy originated primarily from costs for irinotecan-based chemotherapy, from the prevalence of neutropenia among heterozygous patients, and from whether dose reduction is applied to both homozygotes and heterozygotes or only to the former. CONCLUSION: This model-based synthesis of the most recent evidence suggests that pharmacogenetic UGT1A1 testing prior to irinotecan-based chemotherapy dominates non-personalized colon cancer care in Germany.

14092,BMI and Healthcare Cost Impact of Eliminating Tax Subsidy for Advertising Unhealthy Food to Youth,"INTRODUCTION: Food and beverage TV advertising contributes to childhood obesity. The current tax treatment of advertising as an ordinary business expense in the U.S. subsidizes marketing of nutritionally poor foods and beverages to children. This study models the effect of a national intervention that eliminates the tax subsidy of advertising nutritionally poor foods and beverages on TV to children aged 2-19 years. METHODS: We adapted and modified the Assessing Cost Effectiveness framework and methods to create the Childhood Obesity Intervention Cost Effectiveness Study model to simulate the impact of the intervention over the 2015-2025 period for the U.S. population, including short-term effects on BMI and 10-year healthcare expenditures. We simulated uncertainty intervals (UIs) using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and discounted outcomes at 3% annually. Data were analyzed in 2014. RESULTS: We estimated the intervention would reduce an aggregate 2.13 million (95% UI=0.83 million, 3.52 million) BMI units in the population and would cost $1.16 per BMI unit reduced (95% UI=$0.51, $2.63). From 2015 to 2025, the intervention would result in $352 million (95% UI=$138 million, $581 million) in healthcare cost savings and gain 4,538 (95% UI=1,752, 7,489) quality-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating the tax subsidy of TV advertising costs for nutritionally poor foods and beverages advertised to children and adolescents would likely be a cost-saving strategy to reduce childhood obesity and related healthcare expenditures.",2015-01-17838,26094233,Am J Prev Med,Kendrin R Sonneville,2015,49 / 1,124-34,No,26094233,"Kendrin R Sonneville; Michael W Long; Zachary J Ward; Stephen C Resch; Y Claire Wang; Jennifer L Pomeranz; Marj L Moodie; Rob Carter; Gary Sacks; Boyd A Swinburn; Steven L Gortmaker; BMI and Healthcare Cost Impact of Eliminating Tax Subsidy for Advertising Unhealthy Food to Youth, Am J Prev Med, 2015 Jul; 49(1):0749-3797; 124-34",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Elimination of the tax subsidy of TV advertising costs for nutritionally poor foods and beverages advertised vs. Current tax practice,Not Stated,19 Years,2 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"10 Years, 2 years",3.00,3.00,-75490.71,United States,2014,-82530.02
14093,Cost Effectiveness of a Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Excise Tax in the U.S,"INTRODUCTION: Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption through taxation is a promising public health response to the obesity epidemic in the U.S. This study quantifies the expected health and economic benefits of a national sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax of $0.01/ounce over 10 years. METHODS: A cohort model was used to simulate the impact of the tax on BMI. Assuming ongoing implementation and effect maintenance, quality-adjusted life-years gained and disability-adjusted life-years and healthcare costs averted were estimated over the 2015-2025 period for the 2015 U.S. POPULATION: Costs and health gains were discounted at 3% annually. Data were analyzed in 2014. RESULTS: Implementing the tax nationally would cost $51 million in the first year. The tax would reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 20% and mean BMI by 0.16 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]=0.06, 0.37) units among youth and 0.08 (95% UI=0.03, 0.20) units among adults in the second year for a cost of $3.16 (95% UI=$1.24, $8.14) per BMI unit reduced. From 2015 to 2025, the policy would avert 101,000 disability-adjusted life-years (95% UI=34,800, 249,000); gain 871,000 quality-adjusted life-years (95% UI=342,000, 2,030,000); and result in $23.6 billion (95% UI=$9.33 billion, $54.9 billion) in healthcare cost savings. The tax would generate $12.5 billion in annual revenue (95% UI=$8.92, billion, $14.1 billion). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed tax could substantially reduce BMI and healthcare expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy.

14094,Cost-Effectiveness of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy versus Primary Surgery in Elderly Patients with Advanced Ovarian Cancer,"BACKGROUND: The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer has increased in recent years. There is uncertainty about NAC's effectiveness and no study of its cost-effectiveness compared with that of standard primary debulking surgery (PDS). OBJECTIVES: To seek answers to three important questions: 1) What is the lifetime cost of treating elderly patients with advanced ovarian cancer, based on the primary treatment received? 2) Are the extra costs expended by the NAC group worth any extra survival advantage? 3) Would NAC potentially benefit a particular subgroup and serve as a cost-effective first-line treatment approach? METHODS: A cohort of elderly women (>/=65 years) with stage III/IV ovarian cancer was identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2009. Cost analysis was conducted from a payer perspective, and direct medical costs incurred by Medicare were integrated for each patient. Cumulative treatment costs were estimated with a phase-of-care approach, and effectiveness was measured as years of survival. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and propensity-score-adjusted net monetary benefit regression was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NAC per life-year gained. Analyses were further stratified by risk group categorization on the basis of tumor stage, patient age, and comorbidity score. RESULTS: Average lifetime cost for treatment with NAC was $17,417 more than with PDS. With only 0.1 incremental life-year gained, the ICER estimate was $174,173. Stratification, however, helped to delineate the treatment effect. Patients in the high-risk subgroup incurred $34,390 and 0.8 life-years more than did patients in the PDS subgroup, with a corresponding ICER of $42,987. In the non-high-risk subgroup, NAC use was dominated by PDS (more costly, less effective).

14096,Cost-Effectiveness of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy versus Primary Surgery in Elderly Patients with Advanced Ovarian Cancer,"BACKGROUND: The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer has increased in recent years. There is uncertainty about NAC's effectiveness and no study of its cost-effectiveness compared with that of standard primary debulking surgery (PDS). OBJECTIVES: To seek answers to three important questions: 1) What is the lifetime cost of treating elderly patients with advanced ovarian cancer, based on the primary treatment received? 2) Are the extra costs expended by the NAC group worth any extra survival advantage? 3) Would NAC potentially benefit a particular subgroup and serve as a cost-effective first-line treatment approach? METHODS: A cohort of elderly women (>/=65 years) with stage III/IV ovarian cancer was identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2009. Cost analysis was conducted from a payer perspective, and direct medical costs incurred by Medicare were integrated for each patient. Cumulative treatment costs were estimated with a phase-of-care approach, and effectiveness was measured as years of survival. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and propensity-score-adjusted net monetary benefit regression was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NAC per life-year gained. Analyses were further stratified by risk group categorization on the basis of tumor stage, patient age, and comorbidity score. RESULTS: Average lifetime cost for treatment with NAC was $17,417 more than with PDS. With only 0.1 incremental life-year gained, the ICER estimate was $174,173. Stratification, however, helped to delineate the treatment effect. Patients in the high-risk subgroup incurred $34,390 and 0.8 life-years more than did patients in the PDS subgroup, with a corresponding ICER of $42,987. In the non-high-risk subgroup, NAC use was dominated by PDS (more costly, less effective).

14097,The Continuing Story of the Cost-Effectiveness of Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate versus Transuretheral Resection of the Prostate for the Treatment of Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Obstruction,"BACKGROUND: In 2008, a UK assessment of technologies for benign prostatic obstruction concluded negatively about photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP), and the 2010 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance caused several UK institutions to abandon PVP. OBJECTIVE: To reassess the costs and effects of PVP versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) on the basis of most recent data. METHODS: The same model was used as in 2008. Transition probabilities were estimated using a Bayesian approach updating the 2008 estimates with data from two meta-analyses and data from GOLIATH, the latest and largest trial comparing PVP with TURP. Utility estimates were from the 2008 assessment, and estimates of resource utilization and costs were updated. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years gained, and costs are in UK pounds. The balance between costs and effects was addressed by multivariate sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: If the 2010 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence analysis would have updated the cost-effectiveness analysis with figures from its own meta-analysis, it would have estimated the change in quality-adjusted life-years at -0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.05 to 0.01) instead of at -0.11 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.01) as in the 2008 analysis. The GOLIATH estimate of -0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.02) strengthens the conclusion of near equivalence. Estimates of additional costs vary from pound491 ( pound21- pound1286) in 2008 to pound111 (- pound315 to pound595) for 2010 and to pound109 (- pound204 to pound504) for GOLIATH. PVP becomes cost saving if more than 32% can be carried out as a day case in the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence indicates that PVP can be a cost-effective alternative for TURP in a potentially broad group of patients.",2015-01-17848,26091591,Value Health,J Andrew Thomas,2015,18 / 4,376-86,Yes,26091591,"J Andrew Thomas; Andrea Tubaro; Neil Barber; Andrew Thorpe; Nigel Armstrong; Alexander Bachmann; Ben van Hout; The Continuing Story of the Cost-Effectiveness of Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate versus Transuretheral Resection of the Prostate for the Treatment of Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Obstruction, Value Health, 2015 Jun; 18(4):1098-3015; 376-86",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Photoselective vaporization of the prostate vs. Standard/Usual Care- Transurethral resection of the prostate,Caused by benign prostatic obstruction,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-11100,United Kingdom,2013,-19289.17
14098,Public Health Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Hepatitis A Vaccination in the United States: A Disease Transmission Dynamic Modeling Approach,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination programs in the United States. METHODS: We developed an age-structured population model of hepatitis A transmission dynamics to evaluate two policies of administering a two-dose hepatitis A vaccine to children aged 12 to 18 months: 1) universal routine vaccination as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in 2006 and 2) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices's previous regional policy of routine vaccination of children living in states with high hepatitis A incidence. Inputs were obtained from the published literature, public sources, and clinical trial data. The model was fitted to hepatitis A seroprevalence (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II and III) and reported incidence from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (1980-1995). We used a societal perspective and projected costs (in 2013 US $), quality-adjusted life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and other outcomes over the period 2006 to 2106. RESULTS: On average, universal routine hepatitis A vaccination prevented 259,776 additional infections, 167,094 outpatient visits, 4781 hospitalizations, and 228 deaths annually. Compared with the regional vaccination policy, universal routine hepatitis A vaccination was cost saving. In scenario analysis, universal vaccination prevented 94,957 infections, 46,179 outpatient visits, 1286 hospitalizations, and 15 deaths annually and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,223/quality-adjusted life-year when herd protection was ignored. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predicted that universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination led to significant reductions in hepatitis A mortality and morbidity. Consequently, universal vaccination was cost saving compared with a regional vaccination policy. Herd protection effects of hepatitis A vaccination programs had a significant impact on hepatitis A mortality, morbidity, and cost-effectiveness ratios.",2015-01-17849,26091589,Value Health,Praveen Dhankhar,2015,18 / 4,358-67,Yes,26091589,"Praveen Dhankhar; Chizoba Nwankwo; Matthew Pillsbury; Andreas Lauschke; Michelle G Goveia; Camilo J Acosta; Elamin H Elbasha; Public Health Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Hepatitis A Vaccination in the United States: A Disease Transmission Dynamic Modeling Approach, Value Health, 2015 Jun; 18(4):1098-3015; 358-67",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination vs. Regional childhood hepatitis A vaccination policy,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,"100 Years, 10 years, 50 years",3.00,3.00,17435,United States,2013,19369.97
14099,Economic Impact of Gene Expression Profiling in Patients with Early-Stage Breast Cancer in France,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer can make decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection challenging. Oncotype DX is a validated gene expression profiling test that predicts the likelihood of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in early-stage breast cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the costs of chemotherapy in private hospitals in France, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Oncotype DX from national insurance and societal perspectives. METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted in seven French private hospitals, capturing retrospective data from 106 patient files. Cost estimates were used in conjunction with a published Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of using Oncotype DX to inform chemotherapy decision making versus standard care. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The cost of adjuvant chemotherapy in private hospitals was estimated at EUR 8,218 per patient from a national insurance perspective and EUR 10,305 from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that introducing Oncotype DX improved life expectancy (+0.18 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (+0.17 QALYs) versus standard care. Oncotype DX was found cost-effective from a national insurance perspective (EUR 2,134 per QALY gained) and cost saving from a societal perspective versus standard care. Inclusion of lost productivity costs in the modeling analysis meant that costs for eligible patients undergoing Oncotype DX testing were on average EUR 602 lower than costs for those receiving standard care. CONCLUSIONS: As Oncotype DX was found both cost and life-saving from a societal perspective, the test was considered to be dominant to standard care. However, the delay in coverage has the potential to erode the quality of the French healthcare system, thus depriving patients of technologies that could improve clinical outcomes and allow healthcare professionals to better allocate hospital resources to improve the standard of care for all patients.",2015-01-17857,26086912,PLoS One,Gregory Katz,2015,10 / 6,e0128880,No,26086912,"Gregory Katz; Olivier Romano; Cyril Foa; Anne-Lise Vataire; Jean-Victor Chantelard; Robert Herve; Hugues Barletta; Axel Durieux; Jean-Pierre Martin; Remy Salmon; Economic Impact of Gene Expression Profiling in Patients with Early-Stage Breast Cancer in France, PLoS One , 2015; 10(6):1932-6203; e0128880",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Oncotype DX gene expression profiling prior to personalized chemotherapy treatment, healthcare payer perspective vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard chemotherapy for all risk patients","ER+/HER2- and no node involvement, who received all cycles of chemotherapy within the same private hospital",Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,"30 Years, 10, 20, and 40 years",4.00,4.00,2134.36,Euro,2013,3149.33
