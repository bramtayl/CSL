19301,Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for MSM in low HIV incidence places: should high risk individuals be targeted?,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) targeting high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM) has been shown to be a cost-effective HIV control measure. However, the approach could be a challenge in low HIV incidence places with a low proportion of high-risk MSM. To examine the impact of PrEP in such setting in Asia, we developed an epidemic model and conducted cost-effectiveness analysis using empirical multicentre clinical and HIV sequence data from HIV-infected MSM in Hong Kong, in conjunction with behavioural data of local MSM. Without PrEP, the HIV incidence (per 100 person-years) would increase from 1.1 to 1.6 between 2011 and 2021. PrEP could avert 3-63% of total new infections in a five-year period (2017-2021), the variability of which depends on the implementation strategies and combination with test-and-treat. However, under current market drug price in 2016, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALYG) of PrEP (USD1583136/QALYG) is almost 3 times higher than test-and-treat intervention alone (USD396874/QALYG). Assuming 93% fall of PrEP drug price and in combination with test-and-treat, putting 30% of MSM on non-targeting PrEP would be more feasible, cost-effective (USD268915/QALYG), and could avert more new infections (40%).

19333,Cost-effectiveness of prostate boost with high-dose-rate brachytherapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy in the treatment of intermediate-high risk prostate cancer,"PURPOSE: The recently published ASCENDE-RT randomized clinical trial demonstrated improved biochemical control, albeit with increased toxicity, for a prostate boost with brachytherapy versus external beam radiation therapy alone in patients with intermediate-high risk prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of these two modalities in the treatment of intermediate-high risk prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multistate Markov model was created to model a patient with intermediate-high risk prostate cancer. The two treatment options modeled were (1) 23 fractions of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and two fractions of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (brachytherapy boost) and (2) 44 fractions of IMRT (IMRT alone). Each patient received 1 year of hormone therapy, per the ASCENDE-RT protocol. Model assumptions, including clinical outcomes, toxicity, and utilities were derived from the medical literature. Costs of radiation therapy were estimated using Medicare reimbursement data. RESULTS: The estimated expected lifetime cost of brachytherapy boost was $68,696, compared to $114,944 for IMRT alone. Brachytherapy boost significantly lowered expected lifetime treatment costs because it decreased the incidence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, cutting the use of expensive targeted therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Brachytherapy boost had an expected quality-adjusted life years of 10.8 years, compared to 9.3 years for IMRT alone. One-way sensitivity analyses of our results found brachytherapy boost to be cost-effective over a wide range of cost, utility, and cancer progression rate assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost is a cost-effective treatment for intermediate-high risk prostate cancer compared to IMRT alone.",2018-01-26580,30076108,Brachytherapy,Charles C Vu,2018,/,,No,30076108,"Charles C Vu; Kevin G Blas; Thomas B Lanni; Gary S Gustafson; Daniel J Krauss; Cost-effectiveness of prostate boost with high-dose-rate brachytherapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy in the treatment of intermediate-high risk prostate cancer, Brachytherapy, 2018 Jul 31; ():1538-4721",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,High-dose-rate brachytherapy vs. 44 fractions of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-30832,United States,2016,-33247.62
19334,Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of the subacromial spacer for irreparable and massive rotator cuff tears,"PURPOSE: There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal surgical treatment of irreparable rotator cuff tears (IRCT). This study aimed to assess within the Italian health care system the cost-effectiveness of subacromial spacer as a treatment modality for patients with IRCT. METHODS: An expected-value decision analysis was created comparing costs and outcomes of patients undergoing arthroscopic subacromial spacer implantation, rotator cuff repair (RCR), total shoulder arthroplasty, and conservative treatment for IRCTs. A broad literature search provided input data to extrapolate and inform treatment success and failure rates, costs, and health utility states for these outcomes. The primary outcome assessed was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of subacromial spacer implantation versus shoulder arthroplasty, RCR, and conservative treatment. RESULTS: Subacromial spacer is favorable over both arthroscopic partial repair and shoulder arthroplasty since it costs less than both options and increases effectiveness by 0.06 and 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively. While conservative treatment is the least costly management strategy, subacromial spacer results in a gain of 0.05 QALYs for the additional cost of 522 euro, resulting in an ICER of 10,440 euro/QALY gain, which is below the standard willingness to pay ratio of $50,000 USD. Strategies with an ICER of less than 50,000 USD are considered to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence and reasonably conservative assumptions, subacromial spacer is likely to provide a safe, effective, and cost-effective option for patients with massive IRCTs.

Rigorous long-term surveillance or surgical resection is recommended. The economic consequences of the management have not been fully investigated. METHODS: A Markov decision model compared 4 strategies for low-risk BD-IPMN: I = upfront total pancreatectomy, II = upfront partial pancreatectomy, III = initial surveillance, IV = watchful waiting. Surveillance was based on the Swedish Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer. Probabilities and costs were obtained from the participating unit and from the scientific literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and sensitivity analyses were performed by varying relevant parameters. Survival was reported in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Strategy III was the most cost-effective strategy with an ICER of euro31 682 compared to strategy IV. Strategy I was the most expensive but yielded the best QALY (9.32). Total number of years, annual risk of pancreatic cancer and annual risk of a low-risk BD-IPMN turning into a high-risk lesion had the greatest impact in the model.

19340,Cost-Effectiveness of a Pharmacogenetic Test to Guide Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder,"BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials indicate that pharmacogenetic-guided treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) results in higher treatment response rates by genetically matching patients to medications and avoiding a trial-and-error process. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic test (IDGx) that has demonstrated effectiveness compared with standard of care (SOC) medication management among patients with varied MDD severity. METHODS: Data from a large prospective, randomized controlled trial of treatment-naive patients or patients with inadequately controlled MDD in general practice and psychiatric treatment settings were used to build a Markov state-transition probability model. Analyses were conducted from the societal perspective. Treatment response rates, mortality rates, direct and indirect medical costs, and utility inputs were derived from the reference study and published scientific literature. The cost of the pharmacogenetic test was $2,000. A 3% discount rate was used to discount costs and effects. Univariate one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of input parameters on net monetary benefit. RESULTS: For moderate to severe MDD, the model estimated a cumulative effect over 3 years of 2.07 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the pharmacogenetic-guided treatment group and 1.97 QALYs for the SOC group, including a lower probability of death from suicide (0.328% and 0.351%, respectively). Total costs over 3 years were $44,697 (IDGx) and $47,295 (SOC). This difference includes a savings of $2,918 in direct medical costs and $1,680 in indirect costs. Results were more pronounced when only severely depressed patients were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetic testing among moderate to severe MDD patients improved QALYs and resulted in cost savings.

19342,"Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm","BACKGROUND: A third of deaths in the UK from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are in women. In men, national screening programmes reduce deaths from AAA and are cost-effective. The benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness in offering a similar programme to women have not been formally assessed, and this was the aim of this study. METHODS: We developed a decision model to assess predefined outcomes of death caused by AAA, life years, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a population of women invited to AAA screening versus a population who were not invited to screening. A discrete event simulation model was set up for AAA screening, surveillance, and intervention. Relevant women-specific parameters were obtained from sources including systematic literature reviews, national registry or administrative databases, major AAA surgery trials, and UK National Health Service reference costs. FINDINGS: AAA screening for women, as currently offered to UK men (at age 65 years, with an AAA diagnosis at an aortic diameter of >/=3.0 cm, and elective repair considered at >/=5.5cm) gave, over 30 years, an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound30 000 (95% CI 12 000-87 000) per quality-adjusted life year gained, with 3900 invitations to screening required to prevent one AAA-related death and an overdiagnosis rate of 33%. A modified option for women (screening at age 70 years, diagnosis at 2.5 cm and repair at 5.0 cm) was estimated to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound23 000 (9500-71 000) per quality-adjusted life year and 1800 invitations to screening required to prevent one AAA-death, but an overdiagnosis rate of 55%. There was considerable uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness ratio, largely driven by uncertainty about AAA prevalence, the distribution of aortic sizes for women at different ages, and the effect of screening on quality of life. INTERPRETATION: By UK standards, an AAA screening programme for women, designed to be similar to that used to screen men, is unlikely to be cost-effective. Further research on the aortic diameter distribution in women and potential quality of life decrements associated with screening are needed to assess the full benefits and harms of modified options.

19348,Cost effectiveness of immediate biopsy versus surveillance of intermediate-suspicion thyroid nodules,"BACKGROUND: In an effort to reduce overdiagnosis of low-risk thyroid cancer, recent clinical guidelines increased the size-based biopsy thresholds for thyroid nodules. The cost-effectiveness of these guidelines is largely unknown. We hypothesized that ultrasound surveillance in lieu of immediate fine needle aspiration biopsy would be cost effective for a 1.0 cm thyroid nodule with American Thyroid Association Intermediate Suspicion sonographic features. METHODS: A Markov transition-state model was constructed to compare immediate fine needle aspiration versus ultrasound surveillance. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were used to examine the uncertainty of cost, probability, and utility estimates in the model. RESULTS: Ultrasound surveillance was $1,829 less costly and 0.016 quality-adjusted life years more effective than immediate fine needle aspiration. Immediate fine needle aspiration became cost effective when the probability of malignancy increased from 15% to 84% or the cost of ultrasound increased from $129 to $793. Immediate fine needle aspiration was cost-effective if the quality adjustment factor for observation following a benign fine needle aspiration result exceeded the quality adjustment factor for observation without a biopsy. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound surveillance is more cost-effective than immediate fine needle aspiration for 1.0 cm thyroid nodules with an intermediate-suspicion sonographic pattern.

BACKGROUND: The current recommendation for minimally symptomatic PEHs is watchful waiting. This standard is based on a decision analysis from 2002 that compared the two strategies on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Since that time, the safety of ELHR has improved. A cost-effectiveness study for PEH repair has not been reported. METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to compare the strategies of WW and ELHR for minimally symptomatic PEH. Input variables were estimated from published studies. Cost data was obtained from Medicare. Outcomes for the two strategies were cost and QALY''s. RESULTS: ELHR was superior to the WW strategy in terms of quality of life, but it was more costly. The average cost for a patient in the ELHR arm was 11,771 dollars while for the WW arm it was 2207.

Methods and results: Non-acute patients with 10-90% pre-test probability of coronary artery disease from three high-volume centres in Korea (n = 965) were randomized 1:1 to CCTA or myocardial SPECT as the initial non-invasive imaging test. Medical costs after randomization, the downstream outcome, including all-cause death, acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, and significant bleeding following the initial test and the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire was compared between the two groups. In all, 903 patients underwent the initially randomized study (n = 460 for CCTA, 443 for SPECT). In all, 65 patients underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in the CCTA and 85 in the SPECT group, of which 4 in the CCTA and 30 in the SPECT group demonstrated no stenosis on ICA [6.2% (4/65) vs. 35.3% (30/85), P-value < 0.001]. There was no difference in the downstream clinical events. QALYs gained was higher in the SPECT group (0.938 vs. 0.955, P-value = 0.039) but below the threshold of minimal clinically important difference of 0.08. Overall cost per patient was lower in the CCTA group (USD 4514 vs. 5208, P-value = 0.043), the tendency of which was non-significantly opposite in patients with 60-90% pre-test probability (USD 5807 vs. 5659, P-value = 0.845).

19351,Intracameral moxifloxacin for endophthalmitis prophylaxis after cataract surgery: Cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of intracameral moxifloxacin compared with traditional antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. SETTING: Theoretical surgical center in the United States. DESIGN: Evaluation of technology. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) were calculated for patients having cataract surgery with traditional antibiotic prophylaxis (perioperative topical antibiotics) compared with perioperative topical antibiotics with intracameral moxifloxacin. The base case was a healthy binocular 73-year-old man having first-eye cataract surgery. The incidences and costs were derived from PubMed English literature searches, Medicare reimbursement rates, and average wholesale prices. All costs and benefits were adjusted 3% per annum and for inflation to 2017 United States dollars. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared with traditional prophylaxis, an adjuvant 500 mug intracameral moxifloxacin (for $20) was cost-saving from a societal perspective in the base case; in probabilistic sensitivity analyses, all the values were within the societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), and 6142 (61%) of 10 000 iterations were cost-saving. From a healthcare sector perspective, intracameral moxifloxacin was cost-effective, with an ICUR of $8275/QALY. In cases with posterior capsule tears, a $20 intracameral moxifloxacin was cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective in the U.S., a topical perioperative antibiotic with a 500 mug intracameral moxifloxacin costing $22 dollars or less was cost-effective and cost-saving. From a healthcare sector perspective, a $20 intracameral moxifloxacin was cost-effective but not cost-saving.

METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis that based its assumptions in external data sources, used to extrapolate the quality-of-life related to health, survival, and costs. A Markov model, with stages from 0 (ocular hypertension without glaucoma) to 5 and bilateral blindness, was developed inclusive of Colombians older than 40 years in 2018, from a societal perspective, comparing trabecular micro-bypass stents vs laser trabeculoplasty, timolol + dorzolamide + brimonidine, timolol + dorzolamide + latanoprost, or timolol + dorzolamide + brimatoprost, in terms of clinical and economic outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Both costs and health outcomes had an annual rate discount of 5%. Health outcomes were evaluated in terms of QALYs related with loss of visual acuity. Trabecular micro-bypass costs include the joint use of timolol, and the costs of laser trabeculoplasty include the combined use of timolol + dorzolamide. RESULTS: Trabecular micro-bypass stents were estimated to have 127,971 more discounted QALYs vs laser trabeculoplasty; 405,982 vs timolol + dorzolamide + brimonidine; and 378,287 vs timolol + dorzolamide + latanoprost or timolol + dorzolamide + brimatoprost.

19356,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ribotype-guided fecal microbiota transplantation in Chinese patients with severe Clostridium difficile infection,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) caused by ribotype 002 strain is associated with poor outcomes in Chinese patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective but costly treatment for CDI. We aimed to examine potential cost-effectiveness of ribotype-guided FMT in Chinese patients with severe CDI. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes of ribotype 002-guided FMT versus vancomycin treatment in Chinese patients with severe CDI in the hospital setting. Outcome measures included mortality rate; direct medical cost; and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss for CDI. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine robustness of base-case results. RESULTS: Comparing to vancomycin treatment, ribotype-guided FMT group reduced mortality (11.6% versus 17.1%), cost (USD8,807 versus USD9,790), and saved 0.472 QALYs in base-case analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis found the ribotype-guided FMT group to remain cost-effective when patient acceptance rate of FMT was >0.6% and ribotype 002 prevalence was >0.07%. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ribotype-guided FMT gained higher QALYs at 100% of simulations with mean QALY gain of 0.405 QALYs (95%CI: 0.400-0.410; p<0.001). The ribotype-guided group was less costly in 97.9% of time, and mean cost-saving was USA679 (95%CI: 670-688; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the present model, ribotype-guided FMT appears to be a potential option to save QALYs and cost when comparing with vancomycin.

19360,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of an infant 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine national immunization program in China,"BACKGROUND: The burden of pneumococcal disease in China is high, and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) recently received regulatory approval and is available to Chinese infants. PCV13 protects against the most prevalent serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in China, but will not provide full societal benefits until made broadly available through a national immunization program (NIP). OBJECTIVE: To estimate clinical and economic benefits of introducing PCV13 into a NIP in China using local cost estimates and accounting for variability in vaccine uptake and indirect (herd protection) effects. METHODS: We developed a population model to estimate the effect of PCV13 introduction in China. Modeled health states included meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia (PNE), acute otitis media, death and sequelae, and no disease. Direct healthcare costs and disease incidence data for IPD and PNE were derived from the China Health Insurance and Research Association database; all other parameters were derived from published literature. We estimated total disease cases and associated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and deaths for three scenarios from a Chinese Payer Perspective: (1) direct effects only, (2) direct+indirect effects for IPD only, and (3) direct+indirect effects for IPD and inpatient PNE. RESULTS: Scenario (1) resulted in 370.3 thousand QALYs gained and 12.8 thousand deaths avoided versus no vaccination. In scenarios (2) and (3), the PCV13 NIP gained 383.2 thousand and 3,580 thousand QALYs, and avoided 13.1 thousand and 147.5 thousand deaths versus no vaccination, respectively. In all three scenarios, the vaccination cost was offset by cost reductions from prevented disease yielding net costs of yen29,362.32 million, yen29,334.29 million, and yen13,524.72 million, respectively. All resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios fell below a 2x China GDP cost-effectiveness threshold across a range of potential vaccine prices.

19362,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of an infant 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine national immunization program in China,"BACKGROUND: The burden of pneumococcal disease in China is high, and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) recently received regulatory approval and is available to Chinese infants. PCV13 protects against the most prevalent serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in China, but will not provide full societal benefits until made broadly available through a national immunization program (NIP). OBJECTIVE: To estimate clinical and economic benefits of introducing PCV13 into a NIP in China using local cost estimates and accounting for variability in vaccine uptake and indirect (herd protection) effects. METHODS: We developed a population model to estimate the effect of PCV13 introduction in China. Modeled health states included meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia (PNE), acute otitis media, death and sequelae, and no disease. Direct healthcare costs and disease incidence data for IPD and PNE were derived from the China Health Insurance and Research Association database; all other parameters were derived from published literature. We estimated total disease cases and associated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and deaths for three scenarios from a Chinese Payer Perspective: (1) direct effects only, (2) direct+indirect effects for IPD only, and (3) direct+indirect effects for IPD and inpatient PNE. RESULTS: Scenario (1) resulted in 370.3 thousand QALYs gained and 12.8 thousand deaths avoided versus no vaccination. In scenarios (2) and (3), the PCV13 NIP gained 383.2 thousand and 3,580 thousand QALYs, and avoided 13.1 thousand and 147.5 thousand deaths versus no vaccination, respectively. In all three scenarios, the vaccination cost was offset by cost reductions from prevented disease yielding net costs of yen29,362.32 million, yen29,334.29 million, and yen13,524.72 million, respectively.

19363,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pertussis vaccination during pregnancy in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Both re-emergence of pertussis outbreak among adolescents/adults and recent approval of the extended use of DTaP vaccine for boosting adolescents/adults against pertussis in Japan, have raised the possibility of using aP-containing vaccine in pregnant women to protect neonates and unvaccinated infants. There is a need, therefore, to evaluate the value for money of such possibility. METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of conducting antepartum maternal vaccination (AMV) strategy in Japan. Considering the duration of vaccine effectiveness for infant (single year) and for mother (multiple years), the decision tree model and Markov model was adapted for infant and mother, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared with current no AMV strategy from societal perspective were calculated. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and disease treatment costs were either calculated or extracted from literature. Costs per vaccination was assumed at yen6000/US$54.5. Markov model for mothers with one-year cycle runs up to year four after vaccination, based on the waning of vaccine effectiveness. Infant who survived from pertussis was assumed to live until to his/her life expectancy. RESULTS: AMV strategy reduces disease treatment costs, while the reduction cannot offset the vaccination cost. Incremental QALYs were at 0.0002802, among them 79.5% were from infants, and others from mothers. ICER was yen9,149,317/US$83,176 per QALY gained.

19366,Cost-Effectiveness of PCSK9 Inhibitor Plus Statin in Patients With Triple-Vessel Coronary Artery Disease in Japan,"BACKGROUND: The addition of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor to statin therapy reduces the rate of cardiovascular events. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitor+statin compared with standard therapy (statin monotherapy) in the treatment of triple-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) in Japan.Methods and Results:A Markov model was applied to assess the costs and benefits associated with PCSK9 inhibitor+statin over a projected 30-year period from the perspective of a public healthcare payer in Japan. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), was estimated. The effects on survival and numbers of events were based on the FOURIER trial and the CREDO Kyoto registry. The ICER of PCSK9 inhibitor+statin over standard therapy was 13.5 million (95% confidence interval 7.6-23.5 million) Japanese Yen (JPY) per QALY gained for triple-vessel CAD. The probability of the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitor+statin vs. standard therapy was 0.0008% at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 5 million JPY. In patients with poorly controlled familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) with triple-vessel CAD, the ICER was 3.4 million JPY per QALY gained.

19373,"Cost-effectiveness of sex-neutral HPV-vaccination in Sweden, accounting for herd-immunity and sexual behaviour","INTRODUCTION: The aim was to assess cost-effectiveness of expanding the Swedish HPV-vaccination program to include preadolescent boys, by comparing health-effects and costs of HPV-related disease, with a sex-neutral vaccination program versus only vaccinating girls. METHODS: We used a dynamic compartmental model to simulate the burden of HPV16/18-related disease in Sweden, accounting for indirect effects of vaccination through herd-immunity. The model accounted for sexual behaviour, such as age preferences and men who have sex with men. The main outcome was number of individuals with HPV-related cancers (cervical, genital, anal and oropharyngeal cancer) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Costs included in the analysis were those incurred when treating HPV-related cancer and CIN, production losses during sick-leave, and acquisition and administration of vaccine. Health effects were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The time horizon was set to 100years, and both effects and costs were discounted by 3% annually. Health effects and costs were accumulated over the time horizon and used to create an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: A sex-neutral vaccination program would reduce HPV-related cancer and CIN, both due to direct effects among vaccinated as well as through herd-immunity, further decreasing HPV-related cancer burden annually by around 60 cases among men and women respectively in steady-state. The cost per gained QALY was estimated to 40,000 euro. Applying the procurement price of 2017, sex-neutral vaccination was dominant.

19374,Cost-effectiveness of an Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine in older adults in the United States,"In the United States, herpes zoster (HZ) and related complications are estimated to result in approximately $1.3 billion in medical care costs and $1.7 billion in indirect costs annually. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of a new Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV), containing recombinant varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E and the AS01B Adjuvant System, versus No Vaccine, as well as versus the live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL)) in subjects aged 60+ years of age (YOA) and other age cohorts aged 50+ YOA. A multi-cohort Markov model was developed which follows 1 million individuals over their remaining lifetimes from the year of vaccination with annual cycle lengths. Second dose compliance for RZV was assumed to be 69%. Efficacy and waning parameters were derived from clinical trials for both vaccines. Epidemiological parameters, costs and utility model inputs were derived from US-specific population-based data. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, along with scenario and threshold analysis were carried out to explore the overall uncertainty in the model. The model estimated that, compared to No Vaccine against HZ, RZV would prevent 103,603 HZ cases, 11,197 postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) cases, and 14,455 other complications, at an incremental cost of $11,863 per quality-adjusted life-year saved from a societal perspective. Compared to ZVL, the model estimated that, RZV would prevent 71,638 additional HZ cases, 6403 PHN cases, and over 10,582 other complications, resulting in net total societal cost savings of over $96 million. The results were robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses.

19376,Economic evaluation of the use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation on anti-platelet therapy: A modelling analysis using the healthcare system in the Netherlands,"Aims: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have consistently demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of stroke prevention and safety in terms of bleeding over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The potential use of NOACs in AF patients requiring anti-platelet therapy has only been assessed in small meta-analyses reporting consistent benefits of NOACs over VKAs. However, the prescription costs of NOACs are higher than those of VKAs. The aim of his study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NOACs compared to VKAs in patients with non-valvular AF also requiring anti-platelet therapy with the Dutch healthcare system used as a surrogate of many European healthcare systems. Methods and Results: A decision tree was constructed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of NOACs compared to VKAs in patients with non-valvular AF with an indication for anti-platelet therapy over a horizon of 1 year. Beside the base case analysis, univariate probabilistic sensitivity and two sensitivity analyses were performed: first, we assessed the impact of VKA home monitoring; second, we varied the NOACs price assuming patent expiration. Use of NOACs instead of VKA is associated with a health gain of 0.0171 QALYs and with an incremental cost of euro357, resulting in an ICER of euro20.919, which is almost equal to the generally accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of euro20.000 used in the Netherlands. The probability that NOACs are cost-effective at a conservative willingness-to pay threshold of euro20,000 per QALY was 50%. Introducing home monitoring increased VKAs costs so much that NOACs became the dominant option (less costly and more effective). Price drops associated to patent expiration of NOACs increased its cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that the use of NOACs is a cost-effective alternative of VKAs in patients with AF needing anti-platelet therapy. Our findings in the Netherlands healthcare system are probably consistent with other European populations.",2018-01-26738,30016398,Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,N Bennaghmouch,2018,/,,No,30016398,"N Bennaghmouch; A J W M de Veer; B K Mahmoodi; M Jofre-Bonet; G Y H Lip; K Bode; J M Ten Berg; Economic evaluation of the use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation on anti-platelet therapy: A modelling analysis using the healthcare system in the Netherlands, Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes, 2018 Jul 16; ():2058-1742",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant + antiplatelet therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Vitamin K antagonist + antiplatelet therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,20919.2,Euro,2016,24961.97
19377,Cost-Effectiveness of Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Angiography Screening and Submaximal Angioplasty for Symptomatic Vertebrobasilar Disease,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The VERiTAS (Vertebrobasilar Flow Evaluation and Risk of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke) study demonstrated posterior circulation distal flow status, determined by quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, is a robust predictor of vertebrobasilar stroke risk in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar disease. Flow-compromised high-risk patients may benefit from flow-restoring endovascular procedures, such as submaximal angioplasty. In this study, we examine the cost-effectiveness of quantitative magnetic resonance angiography screening to identify patients who may benefit from submaximal angioplasty to restore vertebrobasilar flow. METHODS: A Markov model was created comparing a no screening strategy with standard medical management alone and a screening strategy involving quantitative magnetic resonance angiography imaging and submaximal angioplasty for treatable patients with low vertebrobasilar flow for a 30-year time horizon. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime costs. Rates of stroke and death were obtained from VERiTAS data, and disability rates and costs were derived from VERiTAS and the literature. A sensitivity analysis was performed with periprocedural stroke rate from angioplasty the primary variable of interest. RESULTS: At a 6% periprocedural stroke risk, the screening strategy saved an average of 0.364 QALYs per patient and a lifetime cost savings of $7312 versus the no screening strategy. Among patients with low flow suitable for intervention, the benefit was substantially higher, averaging 1.485 QALYs saved and lifetime cost savings of $21 294. Across the entire cohort, QALY savings were observed at the end of the first year and economic savings at year 6. The benefit of screening declined at higher periprocedural risk. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography screening and submaximal angioplasty with 6% periprocedural risk in suitable patients is cost effective both in terms of QALY and lifetime costs for patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar occlusive disease. With potential health and economic savings, a clinical trial examining the periprocedural risk of submaximal angioplasty is warranted.

19378,Cost-Effectiveness of Urinary Biomarker Panel in Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment,"PURPOSE: SelectMDx (MDxHealth(R)) is a panel of urinary biomarkers used in conjunction with traditional risk factors to individualize risk prediction for clinically significant prostate cancer. In this study we sought to characterize the effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of American men with elevated prostate specific antigen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov decision analytical model to simulate the chain of events and downstream outcomes associated with ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and a strategy in which the biomarker panel is implemented prior to biopsy. The primary outcome was health outcomes, measured in QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). The secondary outcome was health care costs from the Medicare payer perspective. Multiple 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed to characterize model robustness. RESULTS: The expected mean QALYs per patient under the current standard was 10.796 at a cost of $11,060 during an 18-year horizon. Incorporating the urinary biomarker panel resulted in an expected mean of 10.841 QALYs per patient and a mean cost of $9,366, representing an average of 0.045 QALYs gained at a cost savings of $1,694 per patient. When extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 men per year undergoing biopsy, one would expect that the biomarker panel would result in an incremental 14,035 QALYs gained at a cost savings of $528,323,026 in each yearly cohort. The biomarker panel strategy dominated the current standard across a wide range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of the SelectMDx urinary biomarker panel to guide biopsy decision making improved health outcomes and lowered costs in American men at risk for prostate cancer.

19379,"The impact of demographic changes, exogenous boosting and new vaccination policies on varicella and herpes zoster in Italy: a modelling and cost-effectiveness study","BACKGROUND: The present study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the newly introduced varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination programmes in Italy. The appropriateness of the introduction of the varicella vaccine is highly debated because of concerns about the consequences on HZ epidemiology and the expected increase in the number of severe cases in case of suboptimal coverage levels. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis based on a stochastic individual-based model that considers realistic demographic processes and two different underlying mechanisms of exogenous boosting (temporary and progressive immunity). Routine varicella vaccination is given with a two-dose schedule (15 months, 5-6 years). The HZ vaccine is offered to the elderly (65 years), either alone or in combination with an initial catch-up campaign (66-75 years). The main outcome measures are averted cases and deaths, costs per quality-adjusted life years gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefits associated with the different vaccination policies. RESULTS: Demographic processes have contributed to shaping varicella and HZ epidemiology over the years, decreasing varicella circulation and increasing the incidence of HZ. The recent introduction of varicella vaccination in Italy is expected to produce an enduring reduction in varicella incidence and, indirectly, a further increase of HZ incidence in the first decades, followed by a significant reduction in the long term. However, the concurrent introduction of routine HZ vaccination at 65 years of age is expected to mitigate this increase and, in the longer run, to reduce HZ burden to its minimum. From an economic perspective, all the considered policies are cost-effective, with the exception of varicella vaccination alone when considering a time horizon of 50 years. These results are robust to parameter uncertainties, to the two different hypotheses on the mechanism driving exogenous boosting, and to different demographic projection scenarios.

19384,Interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis screening of solid-organ transplant recipients is cost-effective,"OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease with high mortality for solid-organ transplantation. Preventive therapy of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been considered to reduce TB risk and improve outcomes of transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs); QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold in-Tube (QFT) and T-SPOT((R)).TB (TSPOT)), for kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients in low TB incidence countries. METHODS: Decision trees and Markov models were developed for four strategies; QFT, TSPOT, the tuberculin skin test (TST) and no screening. Targeted populations were hypothetical cohorts of kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients aged 40 years using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. Per-person costs, effectiveness and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated and compared.

METHODS: Decision trees and Markov models were developed for four strategies; QFT, TSPOT, the tuberculin skin test (TST) and no screening. Targeted populations were hypothetical cohorts of kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients aged 40 years using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. Per-person costs, effectiveness and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated and compared. RESULTS: QFT was the most cost-effective (Kidney; US$ 5679, 3.026 QALYs, Liver; US$ 5914, 2.365 QALYs, Lung; US$ 6092, 3.761 QALYs). No screening was the least effective. Cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to BCG vaccination rate, and the costs of screening tests and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TB screening using IGRA with individualized TB risk assessment and follow-up monitoring of drug toxicity during LTBI treatment is recommended for solid organ transplantation, on the basis of the benefits and cost-effectiveness.",2018-01-26753,30009853,J Infect,A Kowada,2018,/,,No,30009853,"A Kowada; Interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis screening of solid-organ transplant recipients is cost-effective, J Infect, 2018 Sep 1; ():1532-2742",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Immunization,Tuberculin skin test vs. None,non-Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated lung transplant recipients,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,8508,United States,2016,9174.58
