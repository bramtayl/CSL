32101,When and what to test for: A cost-effectiveness analysis of febrile illness test-and-treat strategies in the era of responsible antibiotic use,"BACKGROUND: Febrile illness caused by viral and bacterial diseases (e.g., dengue and leptospirosis) often have similar symptoms and are difficult to differentiate without diagnostic tests. If not treated appropriately, patients may experience serious complications. The question of what diagnostic tests to make available to providers in order to inform antibiotic therapy remains an open problem for health services facing limited resources. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We formulated the problem of minimizing the weighted average of antibiotic underuse and overuse to inform the optimal diagnostic test and antibiotic treatment options for given occurrence probabilities of several bacterial and viral infections. We modeled the weight of antibiotic overuse as a monetary penalty per unnecessarily administered course, which we varied in both the base case and sensitivity analysis. Detailed Markov cohort models of febrile illness progression were used to estimate the weight of antibiotic underuse. The model accounted for multiple infections simultaneously and incorporated test, treatment, and other direct and indirect costs, as well as the effect of delays in seeking care and test turnaround times. We used the Markov models to numerically estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), pre-penalty costs, and likelihood of antibiotics overuse per patient for fifteen different strategies in two example settings in Thailand, one with a higher probability of bacterial infections (Northern Thailand, Scenario A) and one with a higher probability of viral infections (Bangkok, Scenario B). We found that empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients always incurs the lowest pre-penalty cost (Scenario A: $47.5/patient, $100.6/patient, $149.5/patient for patients seeking care on day one, day four, and day ten respectively; Scenario B: $94.1/patient, $108.7/patient, $122.1/patient on day one, day four, and day ten respectively), and the lowest DALYs, (Scenario A: 0.2 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient, 1.7 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 0.5 DALYs/patient, 0.7 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). However, such strategy resulted in the highest proportion of antibiotic overuse per patient (Scenario A: 38.1%, 19.3%, 7.5% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 82.9%, 42.1%, 16.3% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). Consequently, empirical antibiotic treatment became suboptimal with antibiotic overuse penalties above $12,800/course, $18,400/course, $23,900/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario A and above $1,100/course, $1,500/course, $1,600/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario B. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients provided the best outcomes if antibiotic overuse was not the primary concern or if presenting with viral disease (such as dengue) was unlikely. Empirical antibiotic treatment to severe patients only was in most cases not beneficial. Otherwise, strategies involving diagnostic tests became optimal. In particular, our results indicated that single test strategies (bacterial RDT or viral PCR) were optimal in regions with a greater probability of presenting with viral infection. PCR-led strategies (e.g., parallel bacterial PCR, or multiplex PCR) are robust under parameter uncertainty (e.g., with uncertain disease occurrence probabilities).",2020-99-39484,31914143,PLoS One,Anthony Zhenhuan Zhang,2020,15 / 1,e0227409,No,31914143,"Anthony Zhenhuan Zhang; Diana Negoescu; Claudia Munoz-Zanzi; When and what to test for: A cost-effectiveness analysis of febrile illness test-and-treat strategies in the era of responsible antibiotic use, PLoS One , 2020; 15(1):1932-6203; e0227409",DALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,antibiotics for severe viral disease vs. None,Bangkok (viral disease is predominant),40 Years,40 Years,Not Stated,Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,-50.14,United States,2018,-51.67

AZM targeted to high-risk children may preserve benefit while minimizing antibiotic exposure. We modeled the cost-effectiveness of MDA to children 1-59 months of age, MDA to children 1-5 months of age, AZM administered at hospital discharge, and the combination of MDA and post-discharge AZM. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Models employed a payer perspective with a 1-year time horizon. Cost-effectiveness was presented as cost per DALY averted and death averted, with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The model included parameters for macrolide resistance, adverse events, hospitalization, and mortality sourced from published data. Assuming a base-case 1.64% mortality risk among children 1-59 months old, 3.1% among children 1-5 months old, 4.4% mortality risk post-discharge, and 13.5% mortality reduction per trial data, post-discharge AZM would avert ~45,000 deaths, at a cost of $2.84/DALY (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.71-5.57) averted. MDA to only children 1-5 months old would avert ~186,000 deaths at a cost of $4.89/DALY averted (95% UI: 2.88-11.42), MDA to all under-5 children would avert ~267,000 deaths a cost of $14.26/DALY averted (95% UI: 8.72-27.08).

32117,Projected impact and cost-effectiveness of community-based versus targeted azithromycin administration strategies for reducing child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa,"BACKGROUND: Trials of mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin (AZM) report reductions in child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AZM targeted to high-risk children may preserve benefit while minimizing antibiotic exposure. We modeled the cost-effectiveness of MDA to children 1-59 months of age, MDA to children 1-5 months of age, AZM administered at hospital discharge, and the combination of MDA and post-discharge AZM. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Models employed a payer perspective with a 1-year time horizon. Cost-effectiveness was presented as cost per DALY averted and death averted, with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The model included parameters for macrolide resistance, adverse events, hospitalization, and mortality sourced from published data. Assuming a base-case 1.64% mortality risk among children 1-59 months old, 3.1% among children 1-5 months old, 4.4% mortality risk post-discharge, and 13.5% mortality reduction per trial data, post-discharge AZM would avert ~45,000 deaths, at a cost of $2.84/DALY (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.71-5.57) averted. MDA to only children 1-5 months old would avert ~186,000 deaths at a cost of $4.89/DALY averted (95% UI: 2.88-11.42), MDA to all under-5 children would avert ~267,000 deaths a cost of $14.26/DALY averted (95% UI: 8.72-27.08). Cost-effectiveness decreased with presumed diminished efficacy due to macrolide resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting AZM to children at highest risk of death may be an antibiotic-sparing and cost-effective, or even cost-saving, strategy to reduce child mortality. However, targeted AZM averts fewer absolute deaths and may not reach all children who would benefit.

32118,Cost-effectiveness analysis of mesh repair for inguinal hernia during a humanitarian surgical mission in rural Nigeria,"Background: Humanitarian short-term surgery missions remain under debate, even though the proportion of the burden of surgical diseases around the world that could be treated based on surgery is constantly rising. The primary objective of this study was to prove the cost-effectiveness (CE) of a hernia repair-teaching mission in the rural setting of Nigeria. Methods:We present a CE analysis (CEA) of a 2-week surgery mission performing inguinal hernias with mesh repair according to the Lichtenstein maneuver. All data were collected prospectively. The contribution to the local health system was measured based on the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Further on, the CEA was analyzed and separated for surgeons from Nigeria and Europe, respectively. Results: During this mission a total of 107 patients with 123 hernias were treated. An average of 6,61 DALYs per patient were averted. The total costs for the mission team amounted to $8485.26, with a total of $19,210.73 from a societal perspective. Singleprocedure costs amounted to $198.87 per patient, with $39.35 per procedure from a patient perspective. The CEA showed $31.04/DALY averted from a societal perspective, $13.71/ DALY averted from a provider perspective, and $6.81/DALY averted from a patient perspective. This was well below the threshold of $2790 (gross domestic product per capita). Sensitivity analysis showed robust results.

32121,Treatment of Patients with Low Back Pain: A Comparison of Physical Therapy and Chiropractic Manipulation,"Low back pain (LBP) is a pandemic and costly musculoskeletal condition in the United States (U.S.). Patients with LBP may endure surgery, injections, and expensive visits to emergency departments. Some suggest that using physical therapy (PT) or chiropractic in the earlier stage of LBP reduces the utilization of expensive health services and lowers the treatment costs. Given that there are costs and benefits with each of these treatments, the remaining question is in a short period of time which of these treatments is optimal. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of chiropractic versus PT in the U.S. A decision tree analytic model was used for estimating the economic outcomes. The findings showed that the total average cost in the chiropractic group was $48.56 lower than the PT group. The findings also showed that the daily adjusted life years (DALY) in the chiropractic group was 0.0043 higher than the PT group. Chiropractic care was shown to be a cost-effective alternative compared with PT for adults with at least three weeks of LBP over six months.",2020-99-37376,32102417,Healthcare (Basel),Nima Khodakarami,2020,8 / 1,,No,32102417,"Nima Khodakarami; Treatment of Patients with Low Back Pain: A Comparison of Physical Therapy and Chiropractic Manipulation, Healthcare (Basel), 2020 Mar 6; 8(1):2227-9032",DALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,chiropractic manipulation vs. physical therapy,pregnant or previously received treatment for back pain were excluded,64 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,11293.02,United States,2018,11639.49
32122,Cost-effectiveness of a market-based home fortification of food with micronutrient powder programme in Bangladesh,"OBJECTIVE: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of home fortification with micronutrient powder delivered in a sales-based programme in reducing the prevalence of Fe deficiency anaemia among children 6-59 months in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Cross-sectional interviews with local and central-level programme staff and document reviews were conducted. Using an activity-based costing approach, we estimated start-up and implementation costs of the programme. The incremental cost per anaemia case averted and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted were estimated by comparing the home fortification programme and no intervention scenarios. SETTING: The home fortification programme was implemented in 164 upazilas (sub-districts) in Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers of child 6-59 months and BRAC staff members including community health workers were the participants for this study. RESULTS: The home fortification programme had an estimated total start-up cost of 35·46 million BDT (456 thousand USD) and implementation cost of 1111·63 million BDT (14·12 million USD). The incremental cost per Fe deficiency anaemia case averted and per DALY averted was estimated to be 1749 BDT (22·2 USD) and 12 558 BDT (159·3 USD), respectively. Considering per capita gross domestic product (1516·5 USD) as the cost-effectiveness threshold, the home fortification programme was highly cost-effective. The programme coverage and costs for nutritional counselling of the beneficiary were influential parameters for cost per DALY averted in the one-way sensitivity analysis.

32125,The cost-effectiveness of a program to reduce intrapartum and neonatal mortality in a referral hospital in Ghana,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a program intended to reduce intrapartum and neonatal mortality in Accra, Ghana. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, time-sequence intervention, retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A program integrating leadership development, clinical skills and quality improvement training was piloted at the Greater Accra Regional Hospital from 2013 to 2016. The number of intrapartum and neonatal deaths prevented were estimated using the hospital''s 2012 stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates as a steady-state assumption. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was calculated as cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. In order to test the assumptions included in this analysis, it was subjected to probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which measures the cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted by the intervention compared to status quo. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2016, there were 45,495 births at the Greater Accra Regional Hospital, of whom 5,734 were admitted to the newborn intensive care unit. The budget for the systems strengthening program was US $1,716,976. Based on program estimates, 307 (±82) neonatal deaths and 84 (±35) stillbirths were prevented, amounting to 12,342 DALYs averted. The systems strengthening intervention was found to be highly cost effective with an ICER of US $139 (±$44), an amount significantly lower than the established threshold of cost-effectiveness of the per capita gross domestic product, which averaged US $1,649 between 2012-2016. The results were found to be sensitive to the following parameters: DALYs averted, number of neonatal deaths, and number of stillbirths. CONCLUSION: An integrated approach to system strengthening in referral hospitals has the potential to reduce neonatal and intrapartum mortality in low resource settings and is likely to be cost-effective.

32126,The economic impact and cost-effectiveness of combined vector-control and dengue vaccination strategies in Thailand: results from a dynamic transmission model,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dengue fever is a major public health problem in tropical/subtropical regions. Prior economic analyses have predominantly evaluated either vaccination or vector-control programmes in isolation and do not really consider the incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of mixed strategies and combination control. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of single and combined approaches in Thailand. METHODS: The impacts of different control interventions were analysed using a previously published mathematical model of dengue epidemiology and control incorporating seasonality, age structure, consecutive infection, cross protection, immune enhancement and combined vector-host transmission. An economic model was applied to simulation results to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 4 interventions and their various combinations (6 strategies): i) routine vaccination of 1-year olds; ii) chemical vector control strategies targeting adult and larval stages separately; iii) environmental management/ public health education and awareness [EM/ PHEA]). Payer and societal perspectives were considered. The health burden of dengue fever was assessed using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Costs and effects were assessed for 10 years. Costs were discounted at 3% annually and updated to 2013 United States Dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out after strategies were rank-ordered by cost, with results presented in a table of incremental analysis. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken; and the impact and cost-effectiveness of Wolbachia was evaluated in exploratory scenario analyses. RESULTS: From the payer and societal perspectives, 2 combination strategies were considered optimal, as all other control strategies were dominated. Vaccination plus adulticide plus EM/ PHEA was deemed cost-effective according to multiple cost-effectiveness criteria. From the societal perspective, incremental differences vs. adulticide and EM/ PHEA resulted in costs of $157.6 million and DALYs lost of 12,599, giving an expected ICER of $12,508 per DALY averted. Exploratory scenario analyses showed Wolbachia to be highly cost-effective ($343 per DALY averted) vs. other single control measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that individual interventions can be cost-effective, but that important epidemiological reductions and economic impacts are demonstrated when interventions are combined as part of an integrated approach to combating dengue fever.

Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken; and the impact and cost-effectiveness of Wolbachia was evaluated in exploratory scenario analyses. RESULTS: From the payer and societal perspectives, 2 combination strategies were considered optimal, as all other control strategies were dominated. Vaccination plus adulticide plus EM/ PHEA was deemed cost-effective according to multiple cost-effectiveness criteria. From the societal perspective, incremental differences vs. adulticide and EM/ PHEA resulted in costs of $157.6 million and DALYs lost of 12,599, giving an expected ICER of $12,508 per DALY averted. Exploratory scenario analyses showed Wolbachia to be highly cost-effective ($343 per DALY averted) vs. other single control measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that individual interventions can be cost-effective, but that important epidemiological reductions and economic impacts are demonstrated when interventions are combined as part of an integrated approach to combating dengue fever.

Prior economic analyses have predominantly evaluated either vaccination or vector-control programmes in isolation and do not really consider the incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of mixed strategies and combination control. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of single and combined approaches in Thailand. METHODS: The impacts of different control interventions were analysed using a previously published mathematical model of dengue epidemiology and control incorporating seasonality, age structure, consecutive infection, cross protection, immune enhancement and combined vector-host transmission. An economic model was applied to simulation results to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 4 interventions and their various combinations (6 strategies): i) routine vaccination of 1-year olds; ii) chemical vector control strategies targeting adult and larval stages separately; iii) environmental management/ public health education and awareness [EM/ PHEA]).

Exploratory scenario analyses showed Wolbachia to be highly cost-effective ($343 per DALY averted) vs. other single control measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that individual interventions can be cost-effective, but that important epidemiological reductions and economic impacts are demonstrated when interventions are combined as part of an integrated approach to combating dengue fever.

32139,The economic impact and cost-effectiveness of combined vector-control and dengue vaccination strategies in Thailand: results from a dynamic transmission model,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dengue fever is a major public health problem in tropical/subtropical regions. Prior economic analyses have predominantly evaluated either vaccination or vector-control programmes in isolation and do not really consider the incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of mixed strategies and combination control. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of single and combined approaches in Thailand. METHODS: The impacts of different control interventions were analysed using a previously published mathematical model of dengue epidemiology and control incorporating seasonality, age structure, consecutive infection, cross protection, immune enhancement and combined vector-host transmission. An economic model was applied to simulation results to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 4 interventions and their various combinations (6 strategies): i) routine vaccination of 1-year olds; ii) chemical vector control strategies targeting adult and larval stages separately; iii) environmental management/ public health education and awareness [EM/ PHEA]). Payer and societal perspectives were considered. The health burden of dengue fever was assessed using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Costs and effects were assessed for 10 years. Costs were discounted at 3% annually and updated to 2013 United States Dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out after strategies were rank-ordered by cost, with results presented in a table of incremental analysis. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken; and the impact and cost-effectiveness of Wolbachia was evaluated in exploratory scenario analyses. RESULTS: From the payer and societal perspectives, 2 combination strategies were considered optimal, as all other control strategies were dominated. Vaccination plus adulticide plus EM/ PHEA was deemed cost-effective according to multiple cost-effectiveness criteria. From the societal perspective, incremental differences vs. adulticide and EM/ PHEA resulted in costs of $157.6 million and DALYs lost of 12,599, giving an expected ICER of $12,508 per DALY averted.

Point-of-care (POC) testing for ART monitoring might alleviate burden on centralised laboratories and improve clinical outcomes, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: We used cost and effectiveness data from the STREAM trial in South Africa (February, 2017-October, 2018), which evaluated POC testing for viral load, CD4 count, and creatinine, with task shifting from professional to lower-cadre registered nurses compared with laboratory-based testing without task shifting (standard of care). We parameterised an agent-based network model, EMOD-HIV, to project the impact of implementing this intervention in South Africa over 20 years, simulating approximately 175?000 individuals per run. We assumed POC monitoring increased viral suppression by 9 percentage points, enrolment into community-based ART delivery by 25 percentage points, and switching to second-line ART by 1 percentage point compared with standard of care, as reported in the STREAM trial. We evaluated POC implementation in varying clinic sizes (10-50 patient initiating ART per month). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and report the mean and 90% model variability of 250 runs, using a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$500 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted for our main analysis. FINDINGS: POC testing at 70% coverage of patients on ART was projected to reduce HIV infections by 4·5% (90% model variability 1·6 to 7·6) and HIV-related deaths by 3·9% (2·0 to 6·0). In clinics with 30 ART initiations per month, the intervention had an ICER of $197 (90% model variability -27 to 863) per DALY averted; results remained cost-effective when varying background viral suppression, ART dropout, intervention effectiveness, and reduction in HIV transmissibility. At higher clinic volumes (=40 ART initiations per month), POC testing was cost-saving and at lower clinic volumes (20 ART initiations per month) the ICER was $734 (93 to 2569). A scenario that assumed POC testing did not increase enrolment into community ART delivery produced ICERs that exceeded the cost-effectiveness threshold for all clinic volumes.

32148,"Cost-Effectiveness of Testing and Treatment for Hepatitis B Virus and Hepatitis C Virus Infections: An Analysis by Scenarios, Regions, and Income","OBJECTIVES: Testing and treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are highly effective, high-impact interventions. This article aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of scaling up these interventions by scenarios, regions, and income groups. METHODS: We modeled costs and impacts of hepatitis elimination in 67 low- and middle-income countries from 2016 to 2030. Costs included testing and treatment commodities, healthcare consultations, and future savings from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas averted. We modeled disease progression to estimate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) by regions and World Bank income groups, according to 3 scenarios: flatline (status quo), progress (testing/treatment according to World Health Organization guidelines), and ambitious (elimination). RESULTS: Compared with no action, current levels of testing and treatment had an ICER of $807/DALY for HBV and -$62/DALY (cost-saving) for HCV. Scaling up to progress scenario, both interventions had ICERs less than the average gross domestic product/capita of countries (HBV: $532/DALY; HCV: $613/DALY). Scaling up from flatline to elimination led to higher ICERs across countries (HBV: $927/DALY; HCV: $2528/DALY, respectively) that remained lower than the average gross domestic product/capita. Sensitivity analysis indicated discount rates and commodity costs were main factors driving results.

RESULTS: Compared with no action, current levels of testing and treatment had an ICER of $807/DALY for HBV and -$62/DALY (cost-saving) for HCV.

32156,Cost-effectiveness of couple-based immunization strategy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus in China: A decision-analytic Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the major route of HBV transmission in many parts of the world. We designed couple-based immunization strategy and aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in China. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to compared current immunization strategy consisting of hepatitis B vaccination (HepB) for all infants and extra hepatitis B immunoglobulin for infants with HBsAg-positive mothers versus couple-based immunization strategy including additional HBV screening for pre-pregnant couples and HepB for high-risk wives. Costs were assessed from a healthcare system perspective. Number of infants with perinatal HBV infection, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were used to access effects. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and performed sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: Based on the birth cohort of 17,578,815 livebirths in China in 2017, couple-based immunization strategy reduced perinatal HBV infection by 18% (9194/51,365) with cost increase of ¥ 41 million, saved 49,986 LYs (ICER: ¥819 per LY saved), gained 48,879 QALYs (ICER: ¥837 per QALY gained) and averted 63,362 DALYs (¥646 per DALY averted) compared with current immunization strategy. These ICERs were below willingness-to-pay levels of China''s once GDP per capita (¥59,660), remaining robust in sensitivity analysis. INTERPRETATION: Under the intermediate endemic of HBV infection in China, implementation of couple-based immunization strategy can improve the efficiency of preventing MTCT of HBV, and is highly cost-effective. This strategy can be a new immunization strategy choice to achieve the target of eliminating hepatitis B by 2030.

32157,"Cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests, compared to microscopic tests, for the diagnosis and treatment of gestational malaria in Colombia from an institutional perspective","BACKGROUND: Gestational malaria is associated with negative outcomes in maternal and gestational health; timely diagnosis is crucial to avoid complications. However, the limited infrastructure, equipment, test reagents, and trained staff make it difficult to use thick blood smear tests in rural areas, where rapid testing could be a viable alternative. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests type III (Plasmodium falciparum/Plasmodium spp P.f/pan) versus microscopic tests for the diagnosis and treatment of gestational malaria in Colombia. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses of gestational malaria diagnosis from an institutional perspective using a decision tree. Standard costing was performed for the identification, measurement and assessment phases, with data from Colombian tariff manuals. The data was collected from Health Situation Analysis, SIVIGILA and meta-analysis. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were estimated. The uncertainty was assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The cost of rapid diagnostic tests in 3,000 pregnant women with malaria was US$66,936 and 1,182 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated. The cost using thick blood smear tests was US$50,838 and 1,023 DALYs, for an incremental cost-effectiveness of US$ 101.2. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis of rapid diagnostic tests determined that they are highly cost-effective in 70% of the cases, even below the US$1,200 threshold; also, they showed an incremental net monetary benefit of $150,000 when payer''s willingness is US$1,000. CONCLUSION: The use of rapid diagnostic tests for timely diagnosis and treatment of gestational malaria is a highly cost-effective strategy in Colombia, with uncertainty analyses supporting the robustness of this conclusion and the increased net monetary benefit that the health system would obtain. This strategy may help in preventing the negative effects on maternal health and the neonate at a low cost.",2020-99-35712,33172472,Malar J,Deisy Cristina Restrepo-Posada,2020,19 / 1,400,No,33172472,"Deisy Cristina Restrepo-Posada; Jaime Carmona-Fonseca; Jaiberth Antonio Cardona-Arias; Cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests, compared to microscopic tests, for the diagnosis and treatment of gestational malaria in Colombia from an institutional perspective, Malar J, 2020 Nov 10; 19(1):1475-2875; 400",DALY,Colombia,Not Stated,Diagnostic,rapid diagnostic malaria test vs. thick blood smear malaria test,pregnant,64 Years,6 Years,Female,Full,,Not Stated,3.00,101.2,United States,2018,104.3

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the surgical management of fractures by surgical residents at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH). Currently, the 5-year surgical training program is supported by the Malawi Ministry of Health, and two universities in the United States and Norway. METHODS: We performed a modeled cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from a public health sector perspective. Cost data were collected from the current residency program and effectiveness data estimated from clinical data derived from operative interventions for fractures between 2013 and 2017 at KCH. Three patient groups were used as the base case; (1) patients of all ages, (2) patients age =18 years, and (3) patients who were <18 years. A Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 trials was conducted for the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The estimated average lifetime cost of training and compensating residency-trained surgeons over a 35-year career was $448,600 (SD $31,167). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for providing surgical care to patients of all ages was $215 (SD $3,666) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), which is below the willingness-to pay-threshold (WTP) of $1,170 per DALY and highly cost-effective at a WTP threshold of $390. Each surgeon is estimated to avert approximately 5,570 DALYs during their career when performing operations to treat fractures.

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the surgical management of fractures by surgical residents at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH). Currently, the 5-year surgical training program is supported by the Malawi Ministry of Health, and two universities in the United States and Norway. METHODS: We performed a modeled cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from a public health sector perspective. Cost data were collected from the current residency program and effectiveness data estimated from clinical data derived from operative interventions for fractures between 2013 and 2017 at KCH. Three patient groups were used as the base case; (1) patients of all ages, (2) patients age =18 years, and (3) patients who were <18 years. A Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 trials was conducted for the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The estimated average lifetime cost of training and compensating residency-trained surgeons over a 35-year career was $448,600 (SD $31,167). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for providing surgical care to patients of all ages was $215 (SD $3,666) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), which is below the willingness-to pay-threshold (WTP) of $1,170 per DALY and highly cost-effective at a WTP threshold of $390. Each surgeon is estimated to avert approximately 5,570 DALYs during their career when performing operations to treat fractures. CONCLUSION: The KCH surgical training program is highly cost-effective at reducing disability at an incremental cost of $215 per averted DALY. This CEA demonstrates that the current surgical training program is cost-effective in reducing morbidity among individuals with fractures.",2020-99-35812,33162013,Injury,Chidera Agwu,2020,/,,No,33162013,"Chidera Agwu; Laura N Purcell; Jared Gallaher; Sven Young; Leonard Banza; Alyssa J Mansfield; Anthony Charles; Cost-Effectiveness analysis of the surgical management of fractures in Malawi: An economic evaluation of a high and low-income country surgical collaboration, Injury, 2020 Nov 2; ():1879-0267",DALY,Malawi,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Surgical, Other",5 year orthopedic surgical training program vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,212.61,United States,2018,219.13
32161,Modeling the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of a combined schoolgirl HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening program among Chinese women,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is common in women and also the main cause of cervical cancer. Based on a dynamic compartmental model, we aimed to evaluate the population impact and cost-effectiveness of strategies that combined cervical cancer screening and HPV schoolgirl vaccination for Chinese women. The effectiveness of interventions was assessed by comparing modeled scenarios to the status quo, where a 3-y cervical cancer screening program remained at a 20% coverage and without a universal HPV vaccination program. Our study demonstrated that increasing screening coverage from 20% to 50% would reduce the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) prevalence to 5.4%, whereas a universal schoolgirl vaccination program using the quadrivalent vaccine (qHPV) with a coverage of 50% would reduce the prevalence to 2.9% by 2069. Scaling-up the cervical screening coverage to 50% will prevent 16,012 (95% CI: 8,791 to 25,913) Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) per year, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 10,958 (95% CI: $169 to $26,973)/DALY prevented. At the current qHPV price, vaccinating 50% of school girls will prevent 13,854 (95% CI: 8,355 to 20,776) DALYs/year, but the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, US$ 83,043, 95% CI: $52,234 to $138,025) exceeds cost-effectiveness threshold (i.e., 3 times GDP per-capita of China: $30,792).

32171,Modeling the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of a combined schoolgirl HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening program among Chinese women,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is common in women and also the main cause of cervical cancer. Based on a dynamic compartmental model, we aimed to evaluate the population impact and cost-effectiveness of strategies that combined cervical cancer screening and HPV schoolgirl vaccination for Chinese women. The effectiveness of interventions was assessed by comparing modeled scenarios to the status quo, where a 3-y cervical cancer screening program remained at a 20% coverage and without a universal HPV vaccination program. Our study demonstrated that increasing screening coverage from 20% to 50% would reduce the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) prevalence to 5.4%, whereas a universal schoolgirl vaccination program using the quadrivalent vaccine (qHPV) with a coverage of 50% would reduce the prevalence to 2.9% by 2069.

32172,Introduction of birth dose of hepatitis B virus vaccine to the immunization program in Ethiopia: an economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality with a very high burden in Africa. The risk of developing chronic infection is marked if the infection is acquired perinatally, which is largely preventable through a birth dose of HBV vaccine. We examined the cost-effectiveness of a birth dose of HBV vaccine in a medical setting in Ethiopia. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model with a Markov process to estimate the costs and effects of a birth dose of HBV vaccine (the intervention), compared with current practices in Ethiopia. Current practice is pentavalent vaccination (DPT-HiB-HepB) administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks after birth. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted to quantify the health benefits while the costs of the intervention were expressed in 2018 USD. Analyses were based on Ethiopian epidemiological, demographic and cost data when available; otherwise we used a thorough literature review, in particular for assigning transition probabilities. RESULTS: In Ethiopia, where the prevalence of HBV among pregnant women is 5%, adding a birth dose of HBV vaccine would present an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 110 per DALY averted. The estimated ICER compares very favorably with a willingness-to-pay level of 0.31 times gross domestic product per capita (about USD 240 in 2018) in Ethiopia. Our ICER estimates were robust over a wide range of epidemiologic, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine coverage and cost parameter inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our cost-effectiveness findings, introducing a birth dose of HBV vaccine in Ethiopia would likely be highly cost-effective. Such evidence could help guide policymakers in considering including HBV vaccine into Ethiopia''s essential health services package.",2020-99-36014,32704237,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Solomon Tessema Memirie,2020,18 /,23,Yes,32704237,"Solomon Tessema Memirie; Hailemichael Desalegn; Mulugeta Naizgi; Mulat Nigus; Lisanu Taddesse; Yared Tadesse; Fasil Tessema; Meseret Zelalem; Tsinuel Girma; Introduction of birth dose of hepatitis B virus vaccine to the immunization program in Ethiopia: an economic evaluation, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2020; 18():1478-7547; 23",DALY,Ethiopia,Not Stated,Immunization,additional birth dose of a hepatitis B vaccine vs. Standard/Usual Care- no additional birth dose of a hepatitis B vaccine,pregnant,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,-122.04,United States,2018,-125.78
32173,Cost-effectiveness of a 12 country-intervention to scale up short course TB preventive therapy among people living with HIV,"INTRODUCTION: In 2017, the Aurum Institute, with support from Unitaid, launched an initiative to expand short-course therapy for the prevention of tuberculosis (TB) in 12 high-burden countries. This study aimed to investigate the importance of ""catalytic"" effects beyond the original project timeframe when estimating cost-effectiveness of such large investments. METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the IMPAACT4TB (I4TB) initiative from a health system perspective, using a 10-year time horizon. We first conservatively estimated costs using a ""top-down"" approach considering only the direct health benefits of providing TB preventive therapy to people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) through I4TB activities. We then re-estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of I4TB incorporating the costs and health benefits of potential catalytic effects beyond the program itself. RESULTS: We estimated that TB preventive therapy through the I4TB initiative alone would prevent 14 201 cases of active TB and 1562 TB deaths over 10 years with an up-front investment of $52.5 million; the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness was $1580 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. If this initiative could achieve its desired catalytic effects, an additional 375 648 cases and 41 321 deaths could be averted, at an incremental cost of $546 million and cost-effectiveness of $713 per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide donors with reasonable evidence of value for money to support investment in short-course TB preventive therapy for people initiating ART in high-burden settings.

32175,Training healthcare workers increases IFA use and adherence: Evidence and cost-effectiveness analysis from Bangladesh,"Iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation programmes are important for preventing and controlling anaemia among pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries. However, frontline health care workers often have limited capacity and knowledge, which can compromise such programmes'' effectiveness. Between 2012 and 2014, Nutrition International and the Government of Bangladesh implemented a programme intended to increase IFA supplement consumption during pregnancy. The programme provided frontline health care workers with training on the benefits of IFA supplementation, the use of interpersonal communication and health promotion materials during antenatal care visits and health management information systems to track reported adherence to IFA supplementation. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study investigates the programme''s effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at increasing IFA supplement consumption and adherence among pregnant women. The difference-in-differences regression analysis comparing outcomes in an intervention and comparison group concluded that the programme increased IFA consumption by an average of 45.05 supplements (P value = 0.018) and increased the share of women that reported adherence to a regime of at least 90 supplements by 40.35 percentage points (P value = 0.020). Knowledge of IFA supplement dosage and benefits also increased among frontline health care workers and pregnant women. The programme cost $47.11 USD (2018) per disability-adjusted life year averted, which is considered highly cost-effective when evaluated against several cost-effectiveness thresholds. This study suggests that the capacity building of frontline health care workers is an effective and cost-effective method of preventing and controlling anaemia among pregnant women in resource-constrained areas.",2020-99-35969,33283461,Matern Child Nutr,Zuzanna Kurzawa,2020,/,e13124,No,33283461,"Zuzanna Kurzawa; Christopher S Cotton; Natasha Mazurkewich; Allison Verney; Jennifer Busch-Hallen; Bahman Kashi; Training healthcare workers increases IFA use and adherence: Evidence and cost-effectiveness analysis from Bangladesh, Matern Child Nutr, 2020 Dec 7; ():1740-8709; e13124",DALY,Bangladesh,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Other, None / Do Nothing",training frontline health care workers on the benefits of iron and folic acid supplementation vs. None,pregnant,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,Not Stated,3.00,47.11,United States,2018,48.56
32176,"An economic case study of the control of dog-mediated rabies by an animal welfare organisation in Jaipur, India","A global strategic plan for the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030 was announced in 2018. The cost-effectiveness of annual mass dog vaccination programmes, as a control and elimination method, has been advocated on many occasions. Complementary methods, such as animal birth control (ABC) activities, have received less attention. This paper provides a case-study of a programme operated by Help in Suffering (HIS) in Jaipur, India from 1994/95 until 2016/17 comprising both ABC and additional vaccination-only activities. The availability of cost data alongside information on dog numbers, dog bites and human rabies cases provided an exceptionally detailed and unique retrospective dataset recording actual events and expenditures. Updated to 2016/17 prices, the total cost of the programme was 658,744 USD. Since 2007/2008, activity costs have been separated and returned costs of 10.78 USD per dog, both sterilised and vaccinated, and 1.86 USD per dog, vaccinated only. Over the course of the programme, the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to premature death and the distress associated with dog bites was estimated to be 36,246 fewer than would have been expected if HIS had not been operating, based on a counterfactual scenario using pre-intervention values. Linking the DALY figure to the cost of the activities undertaken by HIS yields a cost of 26 USD per DALY averted. Discounted at 3%, the DALYs averted equate to 16,587 at a cost of 40 USD per DALY averted. Both cases make it a very cost-effective intervention, in relation to the threshold of investing one year''s gross domestic product (GDP) per DALY averted (1981 USD in 2016/17). The monetary benefit from fewer dog bites and clinical human rabies cases requiring treatment amounted to 5.62 million USD after discounting, which, if attributed to Help in Suffering, yields a monetary benefit-cost ratio of 8.5. Thus, the potential monetary benefits greatly outweigh the programme costs, even without considering the DALYs averted. If a modest notional monetary value of one year''s GDP is assigned to represent the human capital or production value of DALYs averted, the discounted societal economic benefit reaches 38.48 million USD and implies a benefit-cost ratio of 58.4. These economic analyses demonstrate that ABC activities in combination with additional vaccination efforts can be a cost-effective control measure for dog-mediated human rabies.",2020-99-39134,32890917,Prev Vet Med,A J Larkins,2020,183 /,105120,No,32890917,"A J Larkins; J F Reece; A P M Shaw; M V Thrusfield; An economic case study of the control of dog-mediated rabies by an animal welfare organisation in Jaipur, India, Prev Vet Med, 2020 Oct; 183():1873-1716; 105120",DALY,India,Not Stated,"Environmental, Immunization",help in suffering dog-mediated rabies control program vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,39.71,United States,2017,41.93

In 2017, the WHO concluded that long-lasting ITNs (LLINs) with a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), provided additional public health benefit over conventional (pyrethroid-only) LLINs alone in areas of moderate insecticide resistance and endorsed them as a new class of vector control products. We performed an economic appraisal of PBO nets compared with conventional LLINs in 2019 US$ from prevention and health systems perspectives (including treatment cost offsets). We used data from a pragmatic randomized 2012-2014 trial in Nigeria with epidemiological outcomes in an area with confirmed pyrethroid resistance. Each village had 50 months of epidemiologic data, analyzed by village by month, using negative binomial regression. Compared with LLINs, although adding $0.90 per net delivered, PBO nets reduced symptomatic malaria cases by 33.4% (95% CI 10.2-50.6%). From a prevention perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $11 (95% CI $8-$37) per disability-adjusted life year averted. From the health systems perspective, PBO nets were significantly cost-saving relative to conventional LLINs. The benefit-cost analysis found that the added economic benefits of PBO nets over LLINs were $201 (95% CI $61-$304) for every $1 in incremental costs.

Using the example of the Programme Saúde da Familia (PSF) in Brazil, a community-level primary care system intervention, we seek to illustrate these challenges and provide potential solutions. We use a distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) approach to evaluate the impact of the PSF on population health and between-state health inequalities in Brazil. Data on baseline health status, disease prevalence and PSF effectiveness are extracted from the literature and incorporated into a Markov model to estimate the long-term impacts in terms of disability-adjusted life years. The inequality and average health impacts are analysed simultaneously using health-related social welfare functions. Uncertainty is computed using Monte Carlo simulation. The DCEA encountered several challenges in the context of PSIs. Non-randomized, quasi-experimental methods may not be powered to identify treatment effect heterogeneity estimates to inform a decision model. PSIs are more likely to be funded from multiple public sector budgets, complicating the calculation of health opportunity costs. We estimate a cost-per-disability-adjusted life years of funding the PSF of $2640. Net benefits were positive across the likely range of intervention cost. Social welfare analysis indicates that, compared to gains in average health, changes in health inequalities accounted for a small proportion of the total welfare improvement, even at high levels of social inequality aversion. Evidence on the population health and health equity impacts of PSIs can be incorporated into economic evaluation methods, although with additional complexity and assumptions. The case study results indicate that the PSF is likely to be cost-effective but that the inequality impacts are small and highly uncertain.",2020-99-36777,33386400,Health Policy Plan,James Love-Koh,2020,/,,No,33386400,"James Love-Koh; Andrew Mirelman; Marc Suhrcke; Equity and economic evaluation of system-level health interventions: A case study of Brazil's Family Health Program, Health Policy Plan, 2020 Dec 23; ():0268-1080",DALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Care Delivery,community-level primary care intervention vs. Standard/Usual Care- pre-primary care system,"state of Pernambuco, socioeconomically disadvantaged not seeking appropriate care",Not Stated,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,363,United States,2000,545.58
