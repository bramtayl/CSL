14901,Economic evaluation of a psychological intervention for high distress cancer patients and carers: costs and quality-adjusted life years,"OBJECTIVE: This study compared the cost-effectiveness of a psychologist-led, individualised cognitive behavioural intervention (PI) to a nurse-led, minimal contact self-management condition for highly distressed cancer patients and carers. METHODS: This was an economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised trial of highly distressed adult cancer patients and carers calling cancer helplines. Services used by participants were measured using a resource use questionnaire, and quality-adjusted life years were measured using the assessment of quality of life - eight-dimension - instrument collected through a computer-assisted telephone interview. The base case analysis stratified participants based on the baseline score on the Brief Symptom Inventory. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio confidence intervals were calculated with a nonparametric bootstrap to reflect sampling uncertainty. The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis by varying unit costs for resource use and the method for handling missing data. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in overall total costs or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between intervention groups. Bootstrapped data suggest the PI had a higher probability of lower cost and greater QALYs for both carers and patients with high distress at baseline. For patients with low levels of distress at baseline, the PI had a higher probability of greater QALYs but at additional cost. Sensitivity analysis showed the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: The PI may be cost-effective compared with the nurse-led, minimal contact self-management condition for highly distressed cancer patients and carers. More intensive psychological intervention for patients with greater levels of distress appears warranted. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

14902,Cost-effectiveness of a national population-based screening program for type 2 diabetes: the Brazil experience,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) in developing countries remains unknown. The Brazilian government conducted a nationwide population screening program for type 2 diabetes mellitus (BNDSP) in which 22 million capillary glucose tests were performed in individuals aged 40 years and older. The objective of this study was to evaluate the life-time cost-effectiveness of a national population-based screening program for DM2 conducted in Brazil. METHODS: We used a Markov-based cost-effectiveness model to simulate the long-term costs and benefits of screening for DM2, compared to no screening program. The analysis was conducted from a public health care system perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of results to key model parameters. RESULTS: Brazilian National diabetes screening program will yield a large health benefit and higher costs. Compared with no screening, screen detection of undiagnosed diabetes resulted in US$ 31,147 per QALY gained. Results from sensitivity analyses found that screening targeted at hypertensive individuals would cost US$ 22,695/QALY. When benefits from early glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes were considered, the cost per QALY gained would reduce significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In the base case analysis, not considering the intangible benefit of transferring diabetes management to primary care nor the benefit of using statin to treat eligible diabetic patients, CE ratios were not cost-effective considering thresholds proposed by the World Health Organization. However, significant uncertainty was demonstrated in sensitivity analysis. Our results indicate that policy-makers should carefully balance the benefit and cost of the program while considering using a population-based approach to screen for diabetes.",2015-01-20853,26523154,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Cristiana M Toscano,2015,7 /,95,No,26523154,"Cristiana M Toscano; Xiaohui Zhuo; Kumiko Imai; Bruce B Duncan; Carisi A Polanczyk; Ping Zhang; Michael Engelgau; Maria Ines Schmidt; CNDDM Working Group; Cost-effectiveness of a national population-based screening program for type 2 diabetes: the Brazil experience, J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 2015; 7():1468-3083; 95",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Brazil Nationwide Diabetes Screening Program (BNDSP) for type 2 diabetes mellitus vs. None,Not Stated,40 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,31147,United States,2002,44809.26
14903,Cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental patients with prosthetic joints: Comparisons of antibiotic regimens for patients with total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Clinician uncertainty concerning the need for antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent prosthetic joint infection (PJI) after undergoing dental procedures persists. Improved understanding of the potential clinical and economic risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis will help inform the debate and facilitate the continuing evolution of clinical management guidelines for dental patients with prosthetic joints. METHODS: The authors developed a Markov decision model to compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of alternative antibiotic prophylaxis strategies for dental patients aged 65 years who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA). On the basis of the authors' interpretation of previous recommendations from the American Dental Association and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, they compared the following strategies: no prophylaxis, prophylaxis for the first 2 years after arthroplasty, and lifetime prophylaxis. RESULTS: A strategy of foregoing antibiotic prophylaxis before dental visits was cost-effective and resulted in lower lifetime accumulated costs ($11,909) and higher accumulated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (12.375) when compared with alternative prophylaxis strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The results of Markov decision modeling indicated that a no-antibiotic prophylaxis strategy was cost-effective for dental patients who had undergone THA. These results support the findings of case-control studies and the conclusions of an American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs report that questioned general recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.

14905,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pregabalin for treatment of chronic low back pain in patients with accompanying lower limb pain (neuropathic component) in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin for the treatment of chronic low back pain with accompanying neuropathic pain (CLBP-NeP) from the health care payer and societal perspectives. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of pregabalin versus usual care for treatment of CLBP-NeP was evaluated over a 12-month time horizon using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), derived from the five-dimension, five-level EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, was the measure of effectiveness. Medical costs and productivity losses were both calculated. Expected costs and outcomes were estimated via cohort simulation using a state-transition model, which mimics pain state transitions among mild, moderate, and severe pain. Distributions of pain severity were obtained from an 8-week noninterventional study. Health care resource consumption for estimation of direct medical costs for pain severity levels was derived from a physician survey. The ICER per additional QALY gained was calculated and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the assumptions across a range of values. RESULTS: Direct medical costs and hospitalization costs were both lower in the pregabalin arm compared with usual care. The estimated ICERs in the base case scenarios were approximately yen2,025,000 and yen1,435,000 per QALY gained with pregabalin from the payer and societal perspectives, respectively; the latter included indirect costs related to lost productivity. Sensitivity analyses using alternate values for postsurgical pain scores (0 and 5), initial pain severity levels (either all moderate or all severe), and the actual EQ-5D-5L scores from the noninterventional study showed robustness of results, with ICERs that were similar to the base case. Development of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed high probability (>/=75%) of pregabalin being cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Using data and assumptions from routine clinical practice, pregabalin is cost-effective for the treatment of CLBP-NeP in Japan.",2015-01-20896,26504403,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Ataru Igarashi,2015,7 /,505-20,No,26504403,"Ataru Igarashi; Manabu Akazawa; Tatsunori Murata; Toshihiko Taguchi; Alesia Sadosky; Nozomi Ebata; Richard Willke; Koichi Fujii; Jim Doherty; Makoto Kobayashi; Cost-effectiveness analysis of pregabalin for treatment of chronic low back pain in patients with accompanying lower limb pain (neuropathic component) in Japan, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 7():1178-6981; 505-20",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pregabalin treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2024901,Japan,2013,23087.04
14906,Cost-effectiveness analysis of anidulafungin for the treatment of candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis,"BACKGROUND: Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis (C/IC) in the intensive care unit are challenging conditions that are associated with high rates of mortality. New guidelines from the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases strongly recommend echinocandins for the first-line treatment of C/IC. Here, a cost-effectiveness model was developed from the United Kingdom perspective to examine the costs and outcomes of antifungal treatment for C/IC based on the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines. METHODS: Costs and treatment outcomes with the echinocandin anidulafungin were compared with those for caspofungin, micafungin and fluconazole. The model included non-neutropenic patients aged >/=16 years with confirmed C/IC who were receiving intravenous first-line treatment. Patients were categorised as either a clinical success or failure (patients with persistent/breakthrough infection); successfully treated patients switched to oral therapy, while patients categorised as clinical failures switched to a different antifungal class. Other inputs were all-cause mortality at 6 weeks, costs of treatment-related adverse events and other medical resource utilisation costs. Resource use was derived from the published literature and from discussion with clinical experts. Drug-acquisition/administration costs were taken from standard United Kingdom costing sources. RESULTS: The model indicated that first-line anidulafungin could be considered cost-effective versus fluconazole (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio pound813 per life-year gained) for the treatment of C/IC. Anidulafungin was cost-saving versus caspofungin and micafungin due to lower total costs and a higher rate of survival combined with a higher probability of clinical success. DISCUSSION: European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines recommend echinocandins for the first-line treatment of C/IC; our model indicated that anidulafungin marries clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: From the United Kingdom perspective, anidulafungin was cost-effective compared with fluconazole for the treatment of C/IC and was cost-saving versus the other echinocandins.",2015-01-20900,26503366,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,Georg Auzinger,2015,15 /,463,No,26503366,"Georg Auzinger; E Geoffrey Playford; Christopher N Graham; Hediyyih N Knox; David Weinstein; Michal Kantecki; Haran Schlamm; Claudie Charbonneau; Cost-effectiveness analysis of anidulafungin for the treatment of candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis, J Manag Care Spec Pharm, 2015; 15():2376-1032; 463",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fluconazole treatment vs. Anidulafungin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"6 Weeks, Lifetime",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2012,Not Stated
14907,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of quadrivalent influenza vaccines for seasonal influenza prevention: a dynamic modeling study of Canada and the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: The adoption of quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) to replace trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in immunization programs is growing worldwide, thus helping to address the problem of influenza B lineage mismatch. However, the price per dose of QIV is higher than that of TIV. In such circumstances, cost-effectiveness analyses provide important and relevant information to inform national health recommendations and implementation decisions. This analysis assessed potential vaccine impacts and cost-effectiveness of a country-wide switch from TIV to QIV, in Canada and the UK, from a third-party payer perspective. METHODS: An age-stratified, dynamic four-strain transmission model which incorporates strain interaction, transmission-rate seasonality and age-specific mixing in the population was used. Model input data were obtained from published literature and online databases. In Canada, we evaluated a switch from TIV to QIV in the entire population. For the UK, we considered two strategies: Children aged 2-17 years who receive the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) switch to the quadrivalent formulation (QLAIV), while individuals aged > 18 years switch from TIV to QIV. Two different vaccination uptake scenarios in children (UK1 and UK2, which differ in the vaccine uptake level) were considered. Health and cost outcomes for both vaccination strategies, and the cost-effectiveness of switching from TIV/LAIV to QIV/QLAIV, were estimated from the payer perspective. For Canada and the UK, cost and outcomes were discounted using 5 % and 3.5 % per year, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, in an average influenza season, our model predicts that a nationwide switch from TIV to QIV would prevent 4.6 % influenza cases, 4.9 % general practitioner (GP) visits, 5.7 % each of emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations, and 6.8 % deaths in Canada. In the UK (UK1/UK2), implementing QIV would prevent 1.4 %/1.8 % of influenza cases, 1.6 %/2.0 % each of GP and ER visits, 1.5 %/1.9 % of hospitalizations and 4.3 %/4.9 % of deaths. Discounted incremental cost-utility ratios of $7,961 and pound7,989/ pound7,234 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained are estimated for Canada and the UK (UK1/UK2), both of which are well within their respective cost-effectiveness threshold values.

14908,Assessment of the Economic Impact of Belimumab for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in the Italian Setting: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of belimumab, a new biological treatment specifically developed for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), in the Italian setting. SLE is a chronic non-organ specific autoimmune disease characterized by a disregulation of the immune system that involves many organs and systems. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness micro-simulation model with a lifetime horizon originally developed for the UK was adapted to the Italian setting. The analysis compared Standard of Care (SoC) alone vs belimumab plus SoC from a National Healthcare Service (NHS) and societal perspective. Health-economic consequences of treatments and organ damage progression were calculated. When available, Italian data were used, otherwise UK costs were converted using Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs). Utility values were based on the EQ-5D assessments in the belimumab clinical trials (BLISS 52 and 76). Results were discounted with 3% for costs and effects. A maximum belimumab treatment duration of 6 years was assumed and wastage costs were considered. RESULTS: Cost per life year gained (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio, ICER) and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) (Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio, ICUR) were euro22,990 and euro32,859, respectively. These values reduced to euro20,119 and euro28,754, respectively, when indirect costs were included. CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that in the Italian setting and according to the guidelines of the Italian Association of Health Economics (IAHE), belimumab was shown to be cost-effective, in terms of both ICER and ICUR, (euro25-40,000/QALY).",2015-01-20929,26488751,PLoS One,Francesca Pierotti,2015,10 / 10,e0140843,No,26488751,"Francesca Pierotti; Ilaria Palla; Maarten Treur; Lara Pippo; Giuseppe Turchetti; Assessment of the Economic Impact of Belimumab for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in the Italian Setting: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, PLoS One , 2015; 10(10):1932-6203; e0140843",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Belimumab in addition to the standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- glucocorticoids and various immunosuppressants,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,32859,Euro,2010,51614.57
14909,Decision analytic cost-effectiveness model to compare prostate cryotherapy to androgen deprivation therapy for treatment of radiation recurrent prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of salvage cryotherapy (SC) in men with radiation recurrent prostate cancer (RRPC). DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using decision analytic modelling by a Markov model. SETTING AND METHODS: Compared SC and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in a cohort of patients with RRPC (biopsy proven local recurrence, no evidence of metastatic disease). A literature review captured published data to inform the decision model, and resource use data were from the Scottish Prostate Cryotherapy Service. The model was run in monthly cycles for RRPC men, mean age of 70 years. The model was run over the patient lifetime, to assess changes in patient health states and the associated quality of life, survival and cost impacts. Results are reported in terms of the discounted incremental costs and discounted incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained between the 2 alternative interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis used a 10,000 iteration Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: SC has a high upfront treatment cost, but delays the ongoing monthly cost of ADT. SC is the dominant strategy over the patient lifetime; it is more effective with an incremental 0.56 QALY gain (95% CI 0.28 to 0.87), and less costly with a reduced lifetime cost of pound29,719 (euro37,619) (95% CI -51,985 to -9243). For a ceiling ratio of pound30,000, SC has a 100% probability to be cost-effective. The cost neutral point was at 3.5 years, when the upfront cost of SC (plus any subsequent cumulative cost of side effects and ADT) equates the cumulative cost in the ADT arm. Limitations of our model may arise from its insensitivity to parameter or structural uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: The platform for SC versus ADT cost-effective analysis can be employed to evaluate other treatment modalities or strategies in RRPC. SC is the dominant strategy, costing less over a patient's lifetime with improvements in QALYs.

14911,Cost-Effectiveness of a Biopsy-Based 8-Protein Prostate Cancer Prognostic Assay to Optimize Treatment Decision Making in Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 Early Stage Prostate Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 early stage prostate cancer receive invasive treatment but likely derive little or no benefit. A novel 8-protein prognostic assay generates a risk score at time of biopsy that is predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and can inform treatment decisions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the assay to inform treatment decisions compared with usual care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a simulation model to estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost outcomes for the 8-protein assay and usual care strategies. Risk classification outcomes, treatment distributions, costs, health state utilities, and mortality rates were derived from the assay's validation study and the peer-reviewed literature. Outcomes included incremental QALYs, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the most influential inputs and to explore joint uncertainty in outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: The 8-protein assay strategy resulted in 0.04 more QALY and $700 less in costs compared with usual care (and thus was ""dominant""). The cost-effectiveness of the assay strategy was most sensitive to the assay cost, the active surveillance health state utility, and the proportion of low-risk patients receiving active surveillance (vs. treatment) in usual care. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the assay strategy decreased cost and increased QALYs in 86.9% and 58.3% of simulations, respectively. CONCLUSION: Assuming that ongoing prospective studies support the results of retrospective validation studies, the 8-protein prognostic assay strategy for prostate cancer is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to usual guideline-based care in biopsy Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 early stage prostate cancer.",2015-01-20938,26482553,Oncologist,Joshua A Roth,2015,20 / 12,1355-64,No,26482553,"Joshua A Roth; Scott D Ramsey; Josh J Carlson; Cost-Effectiveness of a Biopsy-Based 8-Protein Prostate Cancer Prognostic Assay to Optimize Treatment Decision Making in Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 Early Stage Prostate Cancer, Oncologist, 2015 Dec; 20(12):1083-7159; 1355-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,8-protein prognostic assay vs. Standard/Usual Care- 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend use of molecular assays,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-18250,United States,2014,-19951.76
14912,Cost-effectiveness of Apixaban Compared With Edoxaban for Stroke Prevention in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban 5 mg BID versus high- and low-dose edoxaban (60 mg and 30 mg once daily) as intended starting dose strategies for stroke prevention in patients from a UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A previously developed and validated Markov model was adapted to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of apixaban 5 mg BID versus edoxaban (high and low dose) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. A pairwise indirect treatment comparison was conducted for clinical end points, and price parity was assumed between apixaban and edoxaban. Costs in 2012 British pounds, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, discounted at 3.5% per annum, were estimated. FINDINGS: Apixaban was predicted to increase life expectancy and QALYs versus low- and high-dose edoxaban.

14913,Cost-effectiveness of Apixaban Compared With Edoxaban for Stroke Prevention in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban 5 mg BID versus high- and low-dose edoxaban (60 mg and 30 mg once daily) as intended starting dose strategies for stroke prevention in patients from a UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A previously developed and validated Markov model was adapted to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of apixaban 5 mg BID versus edoxaban (high and low dose) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. A pairwise indirect treatment comparison was conducted for clinical end points, and price parity was assumed between apixaban and edoxaban. Costs in 2012 British pounds, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, discounted at 3.5% per annum, were estimated. FINDINGS: Apixaban was predicted to increase life expectancy and QALYs versus low- and high-dose edoxaban. These gains were achieved at cost-savings versus low-dose edoxaban, thus being dominant and nominal increases in costs versus high-dose edoxaban. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of apixaban versus high-dose edoxaban was pound6763 per QALY gained.

It is unclear whether PMRT is cost-effective for subgroups of patients with positive nodes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of PMRT for subgroups of patients with breast cancer with positive nodes. METHODS: A semi-Markov model was constructed to estimate the expected lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years for patients receiving or not receiving radiation therapy. Clinical and health utilities data were from meta-analyses by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group or randomized clinical trials. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese society. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. FINDINGS: The incremental cost-effective ratio was estimated as $7984, $4043, $3572, and $19,021 per quality-adjusted life-year for patients with positive nodes (pN+), patients with pN1-3, patients with pN1-3 who received systemic therapy, and patients with >4 positive nodes (pN4+), respectively. According to World Health Organization recommendations, these incremental cost-effective ratios were judged as cost-effective.

METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of recommended screening strategies including annual/biennial guaiac fecal occult blood testing (G-FOBT), annual/biennial immunologic FOBT (I-FOBT), and colonoscopy every 10 years in Chinese aged 50 year over a 25-year period. External validity of model was tested against data retrieved from published randomized controlled trials of G-FOBT. Recourse use data collected from Chinese subjects among staging of colorectal neoplasm were combined with published unit cost data ($USD in 2009 price values) to estimate a stage-specific cost per patient. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were quantified based on the stage duration and SF-6D preference-based value of each stage. The cost-effectiveness outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) represented by costs per life-years (LY) and costs per QALYs gained. RESULTS: In base-case scenario, the non-dominated strategies were annual and biennial I-FOBT. Compared with no screening, the ICER presented $20,542/LYs and $3155/QALYs gained for annual I-FOBT, and $19,838/LYs gained and $2976/QALYs gained for biennial I-FOBT. The optimal screening strategy was annual I-FOBT that attained the highest ICER at the threshold of $50,000 per LYs or QALYs gained. CONCLUSION: The Markov model informed the health policymakers that I-FOBT every year may be the most effective and cost-effective CRC screening strategy among recommended screening strategies, depending on the willingness-to-pay of mass screening for Chinese population.

14923,Extending the elderly- and risk-group programme of vaccination against seasonal influenza in England and Wales: a cost-effectiveness study,"BACKGROUND: The present study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of extending the pre-2013 influenza immunisation programme for high-risk and elderly individuals to those at low risk of developing complications following infection with seasonal influenza. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation comparing different extensions of the pre-2013 influenza programme to seven possible age groups of low-risk individuals (aged 2-4 years, 50-64 years, 5-16 years, 2-4 and 50-64 years, 2-16 years, 2-16 and 50-64 years, and 2-64 years). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on four base scenarios (no vaccination, risk group only with coverage as observed between 1995 and 2009, risk group and 65+, and risk group with 75% coverage and 65+). Impact of vaccination is assessed using a transmission model built and parameterised from a previously published study. The study population is all individuals of all ages in England and Wales representing an average total of 52.6 million people over 14 influenza seasons (1995-2009). RESULTS: The influenza programme (risk group and elderly) prior to 2013 is likely to be cost effective (incremental cost effectiveness ratio: 7,475 pound/QALY, net benefit: 253 M pound [15-829]). Extension to any one of the low-risk target groups defined earlier is likely to be cost-effective. However, strategies that do not include vaccination of school-aged children are less likely to be cost-effective. The most efficient strategy is extension to the 5-16 year age group while universal vaccination (extension to all low-risk individuals over 2 years) will achieve the highest net benefit. While extension to the 2-16 year age group is likely to be very cost effective, the cost-effectiveness of extensions beyond 2-16 years is very uncertain. Extension to the 5-16 year age group would likely remain cost-effective even without herd immunity effects to other age groups. As our study includes a strong historical component, our results depend on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remaining at levels similar to the ones achieved in the past over a long-period of time (assumed to vary between 28% and 70% depending of the circulating strains and age groups). CONCLUSIONS: Making use of surveillance data from over a decade in conjunction with a dynamic model, we find that vaccination of children in the United Kingdom is likely to be highly cost-effective, not only for their own benefit but also to reduce the disease burden in the rest of the community.",2015-01-20993,26459265,BMC Med,Marc Baguelin,2015,13 /,236,No,26459265,"Marc Baguelin; Anton Camacho; Stefan Flasche; W John Edmunds; Extending the elderly- and risk-group programme of vaccination against seasonal influenza in England and Wales: a cost-effectiveness study, BMC Med, 2015; 13():1741-7015; 236",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Extension of the influenza vaccination programme to elderly- and risk-group vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,14 Years,3.50,3.50,7475,United Kingdom,2013,12989.78
14924,"Impact on total population health and societal cost, and the implication on the actual cost-effectiveness of including tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonists in management of ankylosing spondylitis: a dynamic population modelling study","BACKGROUND: Sequential treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) that includes tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonists (anti-TNF agents) has been applied in most of the Western countries. Existing cost-effectiveness (CE) models almost exclusively presented the incremental CE of anti-TNF agents using a closed cohort while budget impact studies are mainly lacking. Notwithstanding, information on impact on total population health and societal budget as well as on actual incremental CE for a given decision time span are important for decision makers. This study aimed at quantifying, for different decision time spans starting from January 1, 2014 in the Dutch society, (1) impact of sequential drug treatment strategies without and with inclusion of anti-TNF agents (Strategies 1 and 2, respectively) on total population health and societal cost, and (2) the actual incremental CE of Strategy 2 compared to Strategy 1. METHODS: Dynamic population modelling was used to capture total population health and cost, and the actual incremental CE. Distinguishing the prevalent AS population on January 1, 2014 and the incident AS cohorts in the subsequent 20 years, the model tracked individually an actual number of AS patients until death or end of the simulation time. During the simulation, data on patient characteristics, history of drug use, costs and health at discrete time points were generated. In Strategy 1, five nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were available but anti-TNF agents withdrawn. In Strategy 2, five NSAIDs and two anti-TNF agents continued to be available. RESULTS: The predicted size of the prevalent AS population in the Dutch society varied within the range of 67,145-69,957 with 44-46 % of the patients receiving anti-TNF agents over the period 2014-2034. The use of anti-TNF agents resulted in an increase in the annual drug costs (168.54-205.28 million Euros), but at the same time caused a decrease in the annual productivity costs (12.58-31.21 million Euros) and in annual costs of healthcare categories other than drugs (7.23-11.90 million Euros). Incremental cost (Euros) per QALY gained in Strategy 2 compared to Strategy 1 corresponding to decision time spans of 5, 10, 15 and 20 years improved slightly from 75,379 to 67,268, 63,938 and 61,129, respectively. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of 118,656, 112,067, 110,188 and 110,512 Euros, it was 99 % certain that Strategy 2 was cost-effective for decision time spans of 5, 10, 15 and 20, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using the dynamic population approach, the present model can project real-time data to inform a healthcare system decision that affects all actual number of AS patients eligible for anti-TNF agents within different decision time spans. The predicted total population costs of different categories in the present study can help plan the organization of the healthcare resources based on the national budget for the disease.",2015-01-21002,26451133,Int J Cardiol,An Tran-Duy,2015,13 /,18,No,26451133,"An Tran-Duy; Annelies Boonen; Mart A F J van de Laar; Johan L Severens; Impact on total population health and societal cost, and the implication on the actual cost-effectiveness of including tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonists in management of ankylosing spondylitis: a dynamic population modelling study, Int J Cardiol, 2015; 13():1874-1754; 18",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Strategy 1: tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists (anti-TNF agents) would no longer be available vs. Strategy 2: tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist (anti-TNF agents) continued to be available,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,4.00,1.50,61129,Euro,2013,90198.21
14925,Economic Evaluation of Immunisation Programme of 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine and the Inclusion of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in the List for Single-Dose Subsidy to the Elderly in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Currently in Japan, both 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) are available for the elderly for the prevention of S. pneumoniae-related diseases. PPSV-23 was approved in 1988, while the extended use of PCV-13 was approved for adults aged 65 and older in June 2014. Despite these two vaccines being available, the recently launched national immunisation programme for the elderly only subsidised PPSV-23. The framework of the current immunisation programme lasts for five years. The elderly population eligible for the subsidised PPSV-23 shot for the 1st year are those aged 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 and >/= 100. While from the 2nd year to the 5th year, those who will age 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 and 100 will receive the same subsidised shot. METHODS: We performed economic evaluations to (1) evaluate the efficiency of alternative strategies of PPSV-23 single-dose immunisation programme, and (2) investigate the efficiency of PCV-13 inclusion in the list for single-dose pneumococcal vaccine immunisation programme. Three alternative strategies were created in this study, namely: (1) current PPSV-23 strategy, (2) 65 to 80 (as ""65-80 PPSV-23 strategy""), and (3) 65 and older (as "">/= 65 PPSV-23 strategy""). We constructed a Markov model depicting the S. pneumoniae-related disease course pathways. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality adjusted life year (QALY) and disease treatment costs were either calculated or cited from literature. Cost of per shot of vaccine was yen 8,116 (US$74; US$1 = yen 110) for PPSV-23 and yen 10,776 (US$98) for PCV-13. The model runs for 15 years with one year cycle after immunisation. Discounting was at 3%. RESULTS: Compared to current PPSV-23 strategy, 65-80 PPSV-23 strategy cost less but gained less, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of >/= 65 PPSV-23 strategy was yen 5,025,000 (US$45,682) per QALY gained. PCV-13 inclusion into the list for single-dose subsidy has an ICER of yen 377,000 (US$3,427) per QALY gained regardless of the PCV-13 diffusion level. These ICERs were found to be cost-effective since they are lower than the suggested criterion by WHO of three times GDP ( yen 11,000,000 or US$113,636 per QALY gained), which is the benchmark used in judging the cost-effectiveness of an immunisation programmne. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that switching current PPSV-23 strategy to >/= 65 PPSV-23 strategy or including PCV-13 into the list for single-dose subsidy to the elderly in Japan has value for money.",2015-01-21014,26444287,PLoS One,Shu-Ling Hoshi,2015,10 / 10,e0139140,No,26444287,"Shu-Ling Hoshi; Masahide Kondo; Ichiro Okubo; Economic Evaluation of Immunisation Programme of 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine and the Inclusion of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in the List for Single-Dose Subsidy to the Elderly in Japan, PLoS One , 2015; 10(10):1932-6203; e0139140",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23 ) strategy for >65 population vs. 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23 ) strategy,Not Stated,Not Stated,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,5025000,Japan,2013,57292.85
14926,"Broad Hepatitis C Treatment Scenarios Return Substantial Health Gains, But Capacity Is A Concern","Treatment of hepatitis C virus, the most common chronic viral infection in the United States, has historically suffered from challenges including serious side effects, low efficacy, and ongoing transmission and reinfection. Recent innovations have produced breakthrough therapies that are effective in more than 90 percent of patients. These treatments could dramatically reduce the virus's prevalence but are costly. To quantify the benefit of these treatments to society, including the value of reduced transmission, we estimated the effects of several hepatitis C treatment strategies on cost and population health. Treating patients at all disease stages could generate $610-$1,221 billion in additional quality-adjusted life-years, plus an additional $139 billion in saved medical expenditures over fifty years, and minimize the disease burden, but up-front treatment costs would exceed $150 billion. An intermediate scenario--treating 5 percent of the infected population annually, regardless of patients' disease stages--would also return substantial benefits and would be much more affordable under current financing schemes.",2015-01-21028,26438742,Health Aff (Millwood),Karen Van Nuys,2015,34 / 10,1666-74,No,26438742,"Karen Van Nuys; Ronald Brookmeyer; Jacquelyn W Chou; David Dreyfus; Douglas Dieterich; Dana P Goldman; Broad Hepatitis C Treatment Scenarios Return Substantial Health Gains, But Capacity Is A Concern, Health Aff (Millwood), 2015 Oct; 34(10):0278-2715; 1666-74",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"""Treat advanced"" scenario: introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents: pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin & uses the most effective regimen available for their genotype. vs. Baseline scenario: introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents: pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,150000,United States,2014,163987.1
14927,Defining the risk threshold for risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for ovarian cancer prevention in low risk postmenopausal women,"OBJECTIVE: To define risk thresholds for cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) for ovarian cancer (OC) prevention in low/intermediate risk postmenopausal women. METHODS: A decision-analytic model compares lifetime costs-&-effects of offering 'RRSO' with 'no RRSO' to postmenopausal women >/=50years for different lifetime OC-risk thresholds: 2%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 8% and 10%. Well established data from the literature are used to estimate total costs, effects in terms of Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years(QALYs), cancer incidence, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) and impact. Costs are reported at 2012 prices; costs/outcomes discounted at 3.5%. Deterministic/probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: RRSO does not save QALYs and is not cost-effective at the 2% general population lifetime OC-risk. At 4% OC-risk RRSO saves QALYs but is not cost-effective. At risk thresholds >/=5%, RRSO saves more life-years and QALYs and is highly cost-effective. The ICERs for OC-risk levels 5%, 6%, 8% and 10% are pound15,247, pound9958, pound4584, and pound1864 respectively. The gain in life-years from RRSO equates to 29.2, 40.1, 62.1 and 80.3days at risk thresholds of 5%, 6%, 8% and 10% respectively. The results are not sensitive to treatment costs of RRSO/OC/cardiovascular events but are sensitive to utility-scores for RRSO. On PSA, 67%, 80%, 84%, 91% and 94% of simulations at risk thresholds of 4%, 5%, 6%, 8% and 10% respectively are cost-effective for RRSO. CONCLUSION: RRSO is highly cost-effective in postmenopausal women aged >50 with >/=5% lifetime OC-risk and increases life-expectancy by >/=29.2days.

14928,Impact of Type 2 diabetes prevention programmes based on risk identification and lifestyle intervention intensity strategies: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIM: To develop a cost-effectiveness model to compare Type 2 diabetes prevention programmes that target different at-risk population subgroups through lifestyle interventions of varying intensity. METHODS: An individual patient simulation model simulated the development of diabetes in a representative sample of adults without diabetes from the UK population. The model incorporates trajectories for HbA1c , 2-h glucose, fasting plasma glucose, BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. In the model, patients can be diagnosed with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, microvascular complications of diabetes, cancer, osteoarthritis and depression, or can die. The model collects costs and utilities over a lifetime horizon. The perspective is the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services. We used the model to evaluate the population-wide impact of targeting a lifestyle intervention of varying intensity to six population subgroups defined as at high risk for diabetes. RESULTS: The intervention produces 0.0020 to 0.0026 incremental quality-adjusted life-years and saves pound15 to pound23 per person in the general population, depending on the subgroup targeted. Cost-effectiveness increases with intervention intensity. The most cost-effective options were to target South-Asian people and those with HbA1c levels >42 mmol/mol (6%). CONCLUSION: The model indicates that diabetes prevention interventions are likely to be cost-saving. The criteria for selecting at-risk individuals differentially has an impact on diabetes and cardiovascular disease outcomes, and on the timing of costs and benefits. The model is not currently able to account for potential differential uptake or efficacy between subgroups. These findings have implications for deciding who should be targeted for diabetes prevention interventions. This article is protected by copyright.

14929,Economic and epidemiological impact of early antiretroviral therapy initiation in India,"INTRODUCTION: Recent WHO guidance advocates for early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation at higher CD4 counts to improve survival and reduce HIV transmission. We sought to quantify how the cost-effectiveness and epidemiological impact of early ART strategies in India are affected by attrition throughout the HIV care continuum. METHODS: We constructed a dynamic compartmental model replicating HIV transmission, disease progression and health system engagement among Indian adults. Our model of the Indian HIV epidemic compared implementation of early ART initiation (i.e. initiation above CD4 >/=350 cells/mm(3)) with delayed initiation at CD4 </=350 cells/mm(3); primary outcomes were incident cases, deaths, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) and costs over 20 years. We assessed how costs and effects of early ART initiation were impacted by suboptimal engagement at each stage in the HIV care continuum. RESULTS: Assuming ""idealistic"" engagement in HIV care, early ART initiation is highly cost-effective ($442/QALY-gained) compared to delayed initiation at CD4 </=350 cells/mm(3) and could reduce new HIV infections to <15,000 per year within 20 years. However, when accounting for realistic gaps in care, early ART initiation loses nearly half of potential epidemiological benefits and is less cost-effective ($530/QALY-gained). We project 1,285,000 new HIV infections and 973,000 AIDS-related deaths with deferred ART initiation with current levels of care-engagement in India. Early ART initiation in this continuum resulted in 1,050,000 new HIV infections and 883,000 AIDS-related deaths, or 18% and 9% reductions (respectively), compared to current guidelines. Strengthening HIV screening increases benefits of earlier treatment modestly (1,001,000 new infections; 22% reduction), while improving retention in care has a larger modulatory impact (676,000 new infections; 47% reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Early ART initiation is highly cost-effective in India but only has modest epidemiological benefits at current levels of care-engagement.

14935,De novo cost-utility analysis of oral paliperidone in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis is to compare costs and effectiveness of paliperidone ER vs. placebo in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder (SAD) in the Czech Republic based on pooled clinical trial data. METHODS: A de novo micro-simulation model was developed to assess the cost-utility analysis of paliperidone vs. placebo as there is lack of clinical data comparing paliperidone to other interventions. There are no studies primarily evaluating the efficacy of treatment of SAD with other antipsychotics. The model estimated effectiveness and costs of patients with SAD every week during 24-week time horizon. The effectiveness was defined as improvement of a patient's PANSS score where utilities were assigned to each modelled PANSS score. Based on the patient level data a linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate the regression equations of percentage decrease of PANSS score from the baseline. Utilities were computed using a regression function of patients' age, sex and PANSS score, which was adapted from a clinical study of patients with schizophrenia as there are no QoL data on SAD patients. Among relevant costs, reflecting the payer's perspective, costs of pharmacotherapy, concomitant medications and outpatient care were considered.

14936,"Cost-effectiveness of population-level expansion of highly active antiretroviral treatment for HIV in British Columbia, Canada: a modelling study","BACKGROUND: Widespread HIV screening and access to highly active antiretroviral treatment (ART) were cost effective in mathematical models, but population-level implementation has led to questions about cost, value, and feasibility. In 1996, British Columbia, Canada, introduced universal coverage of drug and other health-care costs for people with HIV/AIDS and and began extensive scale-up in access to ART. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ART scale-up in British Columbia compared with hypothetical scenarios of constrained treatment access. METHODS: Using comprehensive linked population-level data, we populated a dynamic, compartmental transmission model to simulate the HIV/AIDS epidemic in British Columbia from 1997 to 2010. We estimated HIV incidence, prevalence, mortality, costs (in 2010 CAN$), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the study period, which was 1997-2010. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from societal and third-party-payer perspectives to compare actual practice (true numbers of individuals accessing ART) to scenarios of constrained expansion (75% and 50% probability of accessing ART). We also investigated structural and parameter uncertainty. FINDINGS: Actual practice resulted in 263 averted incident cases compared with 75% of observed access and 676 averted cases compared with 50% of observed access to ART. From a third-party-payer perspective, actual practice resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $23 679 per QALY versus 75% access and $24 250 per QALY versus 50% access. From a societal perspective, actual practice was cost saving within the study period. When the model was extended to 2035, current observed access resulted in cumulative savings of $25.1 million compared with the 75% access scenario and $65.5 million compared with the 50% access scenario. INTERPRETATION: ART scale-up in British Columbia has decreased HIV-related morbidity, mortality, and transmission. Resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for actual practice, derived within a limited timeframe, were within established cost-effectiveness thresholds and were cost saving from a societal perspective.

METHODS: We constructed a state-transition microsimulation model to compare multiple approaches to the primary prevention of CHD in a simulated cohort of men aged 45-75 and women 55-75. Risk-stratification strategies included the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol, the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, and approaches based on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring and C-reactive protein (CRP). Additionally we assessed a treat-all strategy in which all individuals were prescribed either moderate-dose or high-dose statins and all males received low-dose aspirin. Outcome measures included CHD events, costs, medication-related side effects, radiation-attributable cancers, and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) over a 30-year timeframe. RESULTS: Treat-all with high-dose statins dominated all other strategies for both men and women, gaining 15.7 million QALYs, preventing 7.3 million myocardial infarctions, and saving over $238 billion, compared to the status quo, far outweighing its associated adverse events including bleeding, hepatitis, myopathy, and new-onset diabetes. ACC/AHA guidelines were more cost-effective than ATP III guidelines for both men and women despite placing 8.7 million more people on statins. For women at low CHD risk, treat-all with high-dose statins was more likely to cause a statin-related adverse event than to prevent a CHD event. CONCLUSIONS: Despite leading to a greater proportion of the population placed on statin therapy, the ACC/AHA guidelines are more cost-effective than ATP III. Even so, at generic prices, treating all men and women with statins and all men with low-dose aspirin appears to be more cost-effective than all risk-stratification approaches for the primary prevention of CHD.

METHODS: We constructed a state-transition microsimulation model to compare multiple approaches to the primary prevention of CHD in a simulated cohort of men aged 45-75 and women 55-75. Risk-stratification strategies included the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol, the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, and approaches based on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring and C-reactive protein (CRP). Additionally we assessed a treat-all strategy in which all individuals were prescribed either moderate-dose or high-dose statins and all males received low-dose aspirin. Outcome measures included CHD events, costs, medication-related side effects, radiation-attributable cancers, and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) over a 30-year timeframe. RESULTS: Treat-all with high-dose statins dominated all other strategies for both men and women, gaining 15.7 million QALYs, preventing 7.3 million myocardial infarctions, and saving over $238 billion, compared to the status quo, far outweighing its associated adverse events including bleeding, hepatitis, myopathy, and new-onset diabetes.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and health outcomes attributable to fall prevention following vitamin D supplementation. RESULTS: Our model shows that treating the UK population aged 60 years and above with 800 iu colecalciferol would, over a 5-year period: (1) prevent in excess of 430,000 minor falls; (2) avoid 190,000 major falls; (3) prevent 1579 acute deaths; (4) avoid 84,000 person-years of long-term care and (5) prevent 8300 deaths associated with increased mortality in long-term care.

14956,Genetic risk for atrial fibrillation could motivate patient adherence to warfarin therapy: a cost effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases risk of stroke, and although this stroke risk can be ameliorated by warfarin therapy, some patients decline to adhere to warfarin therapy. A prospective clinical study could be conducted to determine whether knowledge of genetic risk for AF could increase adherence to warfarin therapy for patients who initially declined therapy. As a prelude to a potential prospective clinical study, we investigated whether the use of genetic information to increase adherence could be cost effective. METHODS: Markov model assessed costs and utilities of two care strategies for AF patients who declined warfarin therapy. In the usual care strategy patients received aspirin. In the test strategy genetic risk for AF was assessed (genotype of the 4q25 locus) and some patients with a positive genetic test (>/=1 risk allele) were assumed to adhere to warfarin therapy. The remaining patients received aspirin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was the ratio of the costs differential and the quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) differential for the two strategies. RESULTS: We found that the 4q25 genetic testing strategy, compared with the usual care strategy (aspirin therapy), would be cost-effective (ICER $ 47,148) if 2.1 % or more of the test positive patients were to adhere to warfarin therapy. The test strategy would become a cost saving strategy if 5.3 % or more of the test positive patients were to adhere to warfarin therapy. If 20 % of test positive patients were to adhere to warfarin therapy in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients, 7 stroke events would be prevented and 3 extra-cranial major bleeding events would be caused over 5 years, resulting in a cost savings of ~ $250,000 and a net gain of 9 QALYs. DISCUSSION: A clinical study to assess the impact of patient knowledge of genetic risk of AF on adherence to warfarin therapy would be merited because even a modest increase in patient adherence would make a genetic testing strategy cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Providing patients who declined warfarin therapy with information about their genetic risk of AF would be cost effective if this genetic risk information resulted in modest increases in adherence.",2015-01-21078,26419225,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,Dov Shiffman,2015,15 /,104,No,26419225,"Dov Shiffman; Marco V Perez; Lance A Bare; Judy Z Louie; Andre R Arellano; James J Devlin; Genetic risk for atrial fibrillation could motivate patient adherence to warfarin therapy: a cost effectiveness analysis, BMC Cardiovasc Disord, 2015; 15():1471-2261; 104",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"4q25 Allele testing to motivate patients perscirbed Warfin to adhere to therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Asprin therapy, no genetic test",Patients perscribed Warfarin to prevent future ischemic stroke events but declined to adhere to warfarin therapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,47148,United States,2013,52380.57
14957,Cost-effectiveness of RAS screening before monoclonal antibodies therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer based on FIRE3 Study,"The surprising results published by FIRE-3 revealed that the overall survival (OS) of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with Cetuximab(Cmab) and FOLFIRI combination was prolonged to 33.1 months. The substantial increase in testing and treatment costs, however, impose a considerable health burden on patients and society. Hence the study was aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of RAS screening before monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) therapy based on FIRE-3 study. Four groups were analyzed: group 1, patients with KRAS testing treated with Cmab and FOLFIRI; group 2, patients with RAS testing treated with Cmab and FOLFIRI; group 3, patients with KRAS testing treated with bevacizumab(Bmab) and FOLFIRI; group 4, patients with RAS testing treated with Bmab and FOLFIRI. A Markov model comprising 3 health states (progression-free survival, progressive disease and death) was built. The costs were calculated from a Chinese payer perspective, and survival was reported in quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs). Average total lifetime costs ranged from $104,682.44 (RAS-Bmab) to $136,867.44 (RAS-Cmab), while the survival gained varied from 16.88 QALMs in RAS-Bmab to 21.85 QALMs in RAS-Cmab. The cost per QALM was $6,263.86 for RAS-Cmab, $6,145.84 for KRAS-Bmab, $6,201.57 for RAS-Bmab and $6,960.70 for KRAS-Cmab respectively. The KRAS-Cmab strategy was dominated by the other 3 groups.

The cost and health implications of nonadherence in the screening process compared with recommended guidelines are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of current cervical cancer screening practice and assess the value of screening improvements. DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: New Mexico HPV Pap Registry; medical literature. TARGET POPULATION: Cohort of women eligible for routine screening. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Current cervical cancer screening practice; improved adherence to guidelines-based screening interval, triage testing, diagnostic referrals, and precancer treatment referrals. OUTCOME MEASURES: Reductions in lifetime cervical cancer risk, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Current screening practice was associated with lower health benefit and was not cost-effective relative to guidelines-based strategies. Improvements in the screening process were associated with higher QALYs and small changes in costs.

14967,Cost-effectiveness of first-line induction and maintenance treatment sequences in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the U.S,"OBJECTIVES: Due to the lack of direct head-to-head trials, there are limited data regarding the comparative effectiveness of induction-maintenance sequences. The objective of this study was to develop a cost-effectiveness model to compare induction-maintenance sequences in the US for the treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision analytic modelling was used to synthesize the treatment effect and baseline risk estimates for nine induction and maintenance treatment sequences, reflecting treatments used in the US. The model was structured using an area-under-the-curve approach and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Model validation was conducted by an independent third party. RESULTS: All active maintenance therapy-containing regimens, with the exception of gemcitabine+cisplatin (first-line)-->erlotinib (maintenance), were more costly than induction-only regimens. Concerning treatments that may be cost effective, the incremental costs per life-year gained were $121,425, $148,994, and $191,270 for gemcitabine+cisplatin-->erlotinib versus gemcitabine+cisplatin-->best supportive care (BSC), pemetrexed+cisplatin-->BSC versus gemcitabine+cisplatin-->erlotinib, and for pemetrexed+cisplatin-->pemetrexed versus pemetrexed+cisplatin-->BSC, respectively. All other regimens were found to be dominated (carboplatin+paclitaxel-->BSC; carboplatin+paclitaxel-->erlotinib; carboplatin+paclitaxel-->pemetrexed; bevacizumab+carboplatin+paclitaxel-->bevacizumab) or extendedly dominated (cisplatin+gemcitabine-->pemetrexed). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated stability.

14975,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Universal Vaccination of Adults Aged 60 Years with 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine versus Current Practice in Brazil,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing universal vaccination of adults aged 60 years with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) into the National Immunization Program (NIP) in Brazil. METHODS: Economic evaluation using a Markov model to compare two strategies: (1) universal vaccination of adults aged 60 years with one dose of PPV23 and 2) current practice (vaccination of institutionalized elderly and elderly with underlying diseases). The perspective was from the health system and society. Temporal horizon was 10 years. Discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. Clinical syndromes of interest were invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) including meningitis, sepsis and others and pneumonia. Vaccine efficacy against IPD was obtained from a meta-analysis of randomized control trials and randomized studies, whereas vaccine effectiveness against pneumonia was obtained from cohort studies. Resource utilization and costs were obtained from the Brazilian Health Information Systems. The primary outcome was cost per life year saved (LYS). Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: The universal vaccination strategy avoided 7,810 hospitalizations and 514 deaths, saving 3,787 years of life and costing a total of USD$31,507,012 and USD$44,548,180, respectively, from the health system and societal perspective. The universal immunization would result in ICERs of USD$1,297 per LYS, from the perspective of the health system, and USD$904 per LYS, from the societal perspective.

14976,"Cost-effectiveness of stereotactic radiation, sublobar resection, and lobectomy for early non-small cell lung cancers in older adults","OBJECTIVES: Stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) is a promising alternative to lobectomy or sublobar resection for early lung cancer, but the value of SABR in comparison to surgical therapy remains debated. We examined the cost-effectiveness of SABR relative to surgery using SEER-Medicare data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients age >/=66 years with localized (<5 cm) non-small cell lung cancers diagnosed from 2003-2009 were selected. Propensity score matching generated cohorts comparing SABR with either sublobar resection or lobectomy. Costs were determined via claims. Median survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were constructed from joint distribution of incremental costs and effects estimated by non-parametric bootstrap. RESULTS: In comparing SABR to sublobar resection, 5-year total costs were $55,120 with SABR vs. $77,964 with sublobar resection (P<0.001) and median survival was 3.6 years with SABR vs. 4.1 years with sublobar resection (P=0.95). The ICER for sublobar resection compared to SABR was $45,683/life-year gained, yielding a 46% probability that sublobar resection is cost-effective.

14978,Scaling Up Family Planning to Reduce Maternal and Child Mortality: The Potential Costs and Benefits of Modern Contraceptive Use in South Africa,"INTRODUCTION: Family planning contributes significantly to the prevention of maternal and child mortality. However, many women still do not use modern contraception and the numbers of unintended pregnancies, abortions and subsequent deaths are high. In this paper, we estimate the service delivery costs of scaling up modern contraception, and the potential impact on maternal, newborn and child survival in South Africa. METHODS: The Family Planning model in Spectrum was used to project the impact of modern contraception on pregnancies, abortions and births in South Africa (2015-2030). The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) was increased annually by 0.68 percentage points. The Lives Saved Tool was used to estimate maternal and child deaths, with coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions increasing by 5% annually. A scenario analysis was done to test impacts when: the change in CPR was 0.1% annually; and intervention coverage increased linearly to 99% in 2030. RESULTS: If CPR increased by 0.68% annually, the number of pregnancies would reduce from 1.3 million in 2014 to one million in 2030. Unintended pregnancies, abortions and births decrease by approximately 20%. Family planning can avert approximately 7,000 newborn and child and 600 maternal deaths. The total annual costs of providing modern contraception in 2030 are estimated to be US$33 million and the cost per user of modern contraception is US$7 per year. The incremental cost per life year gained is US$40 for children and US$1,000 for mothers. CONCLUSION: Maternal and child mortality remain high in South Africa, and scaling up family planning together with optimal maternal, newborn and child care is crucial.

14983,"Effectiveness, toxicity, and economic evaluation of vinflunine for the treatment of patients with transitional cell carcinoma in the Spanish outpatient setting","The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity profile of the vinflunine chemotherapy regimen and to examine the cost-effectiveness relation in a real-world sample of patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective cohort study. To assess the effectiveness and safety of vinflunine treatment, progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events were registered. An economic evaluation was performed and cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. A total of 37 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 67 (SD=9) years. The median progression-free survival was 2.61 months (95% confidence interval 1.79-4.23) and the median overall survival was 5.72 months (95% confidence interval 3.34-10.35). An objective response was achieved in eight (22%) patients. Statistically significant differences were found between patients treated with vinflunine as a second-line therapy and those treated with vinflunine as a third-line therapy (P=0.036). The most commonly reported analytical adverse event was anemia (n=34; 92%), and the most severe was neutropenia (n=19; 51%), with nine patients developing grade 4 neutropenia (9/19; 47%).

METHODS: A total of 168 acromegaly cases were retrospectively investigated for a comparative evaluation of surgery and preoperative medical therapy. A Markov model was developed to simulate treatment cost-effectiveness and progression of acromegaly. RESULTS: Overall effectiveness of preoperative medical therapy was significantly higher than surgery in acromegalic patients with macroadenoma. In addition, life expectancy, and cost per life-year gained were slightly higher in the preoperative medical therapy group than in the initial surgery group when patients received surgery as a secondary treatment. Interestingly, preoperative medical therapy achieved a significant increase in life expectancy and reduced cost for patients who received long-term medical therapy as secondary treatment.

14988,Incremental cost-effectiveness of dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients at intermediate risk for coronary artery disease,"AIMS: The effectiveness of stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as a gatekeeper for coronary angiography (CA) has been established. Level five HTA studies according to the hierarchical model of diagnostic test evaluation are not available. METHODS: This cohort study included 1,158 consecutive patients (mean age 63 +/- 11 years, 42 % women) presenting at our institution between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2004 with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) for an elective CA. The patients were assessed for eligibility and propensity score matching was applied to address selection bias regarding the patients' allocation to CMR or direct CA. Median patient follow-up was 7.9 years (95 % CI 7.8-8.0 years). The primary effect was calculated as relative survival difference. The cost unit calculation (per patient) at our institute was the source of costs. RESULTS: Survival was similar in CMR and CA (p = 0.139). Catheterizations ruling out CAD were significantly reduced by the CMR gate-keeper strategy. Patients with prior CMR had significantly lower costs at the initial hospital stay and at follow-up (CMR vs. CA, initial: 2,904<euro> vs. 3,421<euro>, p = 0.018; follow-up: 2,045<euro> vs. 3,318<euro>, p = 0.037). CMR was cost-effective in terms of a contribution of 12,466<euro> per life year to cover a part of the CMR costs.

14989,Helicobacter pylori test-and-treat program can be cost-effective to prevent gastric cancer in Taiwanese adults: referred to the nationwide reimbursement database,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of gastric cancer. The study aimed to compare cost-effectiveness ratios of H. pylori test-and-treat programs to prevent gastric cancer in Taiwan, referring to the nationwide reimbursement database and expected years of life lost. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 1998-2009, there were 12,857 females and 24,945 males with gastric adenocarcinoma in Taiwan National Cancer Registry. They were followed up to 2010 and linked to the reimbursement database of National Health Insurance and the national mortality registry to determine lifetime health expenditures and expected years of life lost. Cost-effectiveness ratios of H. pylori test-and-treat programs for prevention of gastric adenocarcinoma were compared between screenings with (13) C-urea breath test and with anti-H. pylori IgG. RESULTS: The test-and-treat program with anti-H. pylori IgG to prevent gastric adenocarcinoma had lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than that with (13) C-urea breath test in both sexes (females: 244 vs 1071 US dollars/life-year; males: 312 vs 1431 US dollars/life-year).

14990,Helicobacter pylori test-and-treat program can be cost-effective to prevent gastric cancer in Taiwanese adults: referred to the nationwide reimbursement database,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of gastric cancer. The study aimed to compare cost-effectiveness ratios of H. pylori test-and-treat programs to prevent gastric cancer in Taiwan, referring to the nationwide reimbursement database and expected years of life lost. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 1998-2009, there were 12,857 females and 24,945 males with gastric adenocarcinoma in Taiwan National Cancer Registry. They were followed up to 2010 and linked to the reimbursement database of National Health Insurance and the national mortality registry to determine lifetime health expenditures and expected years of life lost. Cost-effectiveness ratios of H. pylori test-and-treat programs for prevention of gastric adenocarcinoma were compared between screenings with (13) C-urea breath test and with anti-H. pylori IgG. RESULTS: The test-and-treat program with anti-H. pylori IgG to prevent gastric adenocarcinoma had lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than that with (13) C-urea breath test in both sexes (females: 244 vs 1071 US dollars/life-year; males: 312 vs 1431 US dollars/life-year). Cost saving would be achieved in an endemic area where H. pylori prevalence was >73.5%, or by selecting subpopulations with high absolute risk reduction rates of cancer after eradication.

14991,Cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis determined with real-life data,"BACKGROUND: Previous cost-effectiveness studies using data from the literature showed that newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (NBSCF) is a good economic option with positive health effects and longer survival. METHODS: We used primary data to compare cost-effectiveness of four screening strategies for NBSCF, i.e. immunoreactive trypsinogen-testing followed by pancreatitis-associated protein-testing (IRT-PAP), IRT-DNA, IRT-DNA-sequencing, and IRT-PAP-DNA-sequencing, each compared to no-screening. A previously developed decision analysis model for NBSCF was fed with model parameters mainly based on a study evaluating two novel screening strategies among 145,499 newborns in The Netherlands. RESULTS: The four screening strategies had cost-effectiveness ratios varying from euro23,600 to euro29,200 per life-year gained. IRT-PAP had the most favourable cost-effectiveness ratio. Additional life-years can be gained by IRT-DNA but against higher costs. When treatment costs reduce with 5% due to early diagnosis, screening will lead to financial savings. CONCLUSION: NBSCF is as an economically justifiable public health initiative. Of the four strategies tested IRT-PAP is the most economic and this finding should be included in any decision making model, when considering implementation of newborn screening for CF.",2015-01-21336,25213034,J Cyst Fibros,C P B van der Ploeg,2015,14 / 2,194-202,No,25213034,"C P B van der Ploeg; M E Van den Akker-van Marle; A M M Vernooij-van Langen; L H Elvers; J J P Gille; P H Verkerk; J E Dankert-Roelse; CHOPIN study group; Cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis determined with real-life data, J Cyst Fibros, 2015 Mar; 14(2):1873-5010; 194-202",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening in 99.8% of all newborns with an immunoreactive trysinogen (IRT)-test followed by a DNA-test if results are above a cutoff. vs. Screening in 99.8% of all newborns with an immunoreactive trysinogen (IRT)-test followed by a pancreatis-associated protein (PAP)-test if positive results,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,2009,Not Stated

14993,A health-economic analysis of diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure in relation to cardiovascular disease. The Greek experience,"PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adult population and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both diagnosis, based on polysomnography, and treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), carry a potentially high cost. The present study aims to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CPAP treatment versus no treatment, in the long-term, as it examines the effect of this treatment on the incidence of CVD. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to observe the disease evolution in patients with OSAS based on published evidence. Data on treatment costs were collected from public hospitals in Greece. Within each cycle of the model, each patient may remain free of CVD, may develop CVD, may die due to a cause related to CVD, or may die from other causes. The model begins at the age of 55 years in a severe OSAS patient (apnea-hypopnea index >/=30/h) and lasts for 45 years. RESULTS: Within the limitation of the model, CPAP was found to be a cost-effective strategy versus no treatment, due to the reduction of the cost for the CVD treatment, when the analysis was restricted to the male population. Moreover, CPAP was found to be clinically more effective than no treatment, as it increases life expectancy in both males and females.

14995,Sevelamer is cost effective versus calcium carbonate for the first-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia in new patients to hemodialysis: a patient-level economic evaluation of the INDEPENDENT-HD study,"BACKGROUND: The recent multicenter, randomized, open-label INDEPENDENT study demonstrated that sevelamer improves survival in new to hemodialysis (HD) patients compared with calcium carbonate. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate for patients new to HD, using patient-level data from the INDEPENDENT study. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING AND POPULATION: Adult patients new to HD in Italy. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, TIMEFRAME: A patient-level cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, Italy's national health service. The analysis was conducted for a 3-year time horizon. The cost of dialysis was excluded from the base case analysis. INTERVENTION: Sevelamer was compared to calcium carbonate. OUTCOMES: Total life years (LYs), total costs, and the incremental cost per LY gained were calculated. Bootstrapping was used to estimate confidence intervals around LYs, costs, and cost-effectiveness and to calculate the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. RESULTS: Sevelamer was associated with a gain of 0.26 in LYs compared to calcium carbonate, over the 3-year time horizon. Total drug costs were euro3,282 higher for sevelamer versus calcium carbonate, while total hospitalization costs were euro2,020 lower for sevelamer versus calcium carbonate. The total incremental cost of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate was euro1,262, resulting in a cost per LY gained of euro4,897. The bootstrap analysis demonstrated that sevelamer was cost effective compared with calcium carbonate in 99.4 % of 10,000 bootstrap replicates, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000 per LY gained. LIMITATIONS: Data on hospitalizations was taken from a post hoc retrospective chart review of the patients included in the INDEPENDENT study. Patient quality of life or health utility was not included in the analysis.

14996,Cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography-CT in the evaluation of cancer of unknown primary of the head and neck,"BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT is a useful diagnostic adjunct for cancer unknown primary (CUP) of the head and neck; however, the increased cost has not been justified with an economic evaluation in this patient population. METHODS: A decision tree analysis was performed from the perspective of the third party payer. Primary outcome was cost per life year gained ($/LYG). The 2 comparative groups were: (1) PET-CT followed by panendoscopy versus (2) panendoscopy alone. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for N1, N2, and N3 CUP were $369.83/LYG, $329.43/LYG, and $4900.28/LYG, respectively. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated a 96.8%, 97.1%, and 60.1% certainty that PET-CT is cost-effective for CUP with N1, N2, and N3 disease, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of PET-CT in patients with N1 and N2 CUP is the cost-effective choice.
