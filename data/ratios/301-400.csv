301,An economic analysis of alternatives for childhood immunisation against Haemophilus influenzae type b disease,"Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses of immunisation strategies against invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in Australia were based on a hypothetical birth cohort of 250,000 non-Aboriginal Australian children. The model predicted that, without immunisation, 625 cases of invasive Hib disease would occur in under-five-year-olds, with direct costs of $10.2 million. Universal public sector vaccination beginning before six months of age (6MVAC) prevented 80 per cent of cases; vaccination at 12 months (12MVAC) 62 per cent and at 18 months (18MVAC) 46 per cent. At a vaccine cost of $15 per dose, 18MVAC gave the lowest cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over a wide range of model assumptions, with 6MVAC the 'best' alternative. The best estimate ($ per QALY) for 6MVAC was $6930 (three doses), for 12MVAC $9136 (two doses) and for 18MVAC $1231 (one dose). The cost per QALY of single dose catch-up immunisation of older children was estimated at $8630 at two years, $27,000 at three years and $117,000 at four years if done at a scheduled visit; these values were increased if an additional medical visit was included. The threshold cost per vaccine dose at which an immunisation program became cost-saving was estimated for 6MVAC, 12MVAC and 18MVAC as $11, $10 and $14. Even under a worst-case scenario, an immunisation program at 6, 12 or 18 months became cost-saving if indirect costs of death were included.

303,A method for estimating the cost-effectiveness of incorporating patient preferences into practice guidelines,"Many clinical practice guidelines fail to account for the preferences of the individual patient. Approaches that seek to include the preferences of the individual patient in the decision-making process (e.g., interactive videodisks for patient education), however, may incur substantial incremental costs. Developers of clinical practice guidelines must therefore determine whether it is appropriate to make their guidelines flexible with regard to patient preferences. The authors present a formal method for determining the cost-effectiveness of incorporating the preferences of individual patients into clinical practice guidelines. Based on utilities assessed from 37 patients, they apply the method in the setting of mild hypertension. In this example, they estimate that the cost-effectiveness ratio for individualized utility assessment is $48,565 per quality-adjusted year of life, a ratio that compares favorably with other health interventions that are promoted actively. This approach, which can be applied to any clinical domain, offers a formal method for determining whether the incorporation of individual patient preferences is important clinically and is justified economically.",1994-01-01814,7808213,Med Decis Making,R F Nease,1994,14 / 4,382-92,No,7808213,"R F Nease; D K Owens; A method for estimating the cost-effectiveness of incorporating patient preferences into practice guidelines, Med Decis Making, 1994 Oct-Dec; 14(4):0272-989X; 382-92",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,individual utility assessment of trial of drug therapy vs. no individualized utility assessment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,48565,United States,1991,92284.55
304,Cost-effectiveness of ticlopidine in preventing stroke in high-risk patients,"BACKGROUND: Ticlopidine, an antiplatelet agent, when compared with aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of stroke in high-risk patients, ie, those with recent transient ischemic attack, reversible ischemic neurological deficit, amaurosis fugax, or minor stroke. Its cost-effectiveness in such use, however, is unknown. METHODS: We developed a model of primary stroke prevention in which a hypothetical cohort of 100 high-risk men and women 65 years of age was assumed to receive either ticlopidine (500 mg daily) or aspirin (1300 mg daily). Using published data, we estimated lifetime incidence of stroke, life expectancy (unadjusted and adjusted for changes in quality of life), and lifetime medical care costs associated with each therapy. RESULTS: Patients who receive ticlopidine would experience two fewer initial strokes per hundred than those treated with aspirin. Life expectancy would be extended by approximately one-half month, and lifetime medical care costs (discounted at 5%) would increase by about $2300. The cost-effectiveness of ticlopidine, compared with aspirin, is estimated to range from $31,200 to $55,500 per quality-adjusted life-year gained as the utility of life after nonfatal stroke is assumed to vary from 0.75 to 0.95.

305,A guide for surveillance of patients with Barrett's esophagus,"OBJECTIVE: Barrett's esophagus (columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux) affects nearly 700,000 people in the United States, and carries a risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma that is 30-125 times that of an age-matched population. Patients who develop high grade dysplasia are at greatest risk. Current recommendations are for endoscopic surveillance to detect dysplasia and to diagnose carcinoma while it is in an early and possibly treatable stage. In addition, some authorities recommend esophagectomy for high grade dysplasia, whereas others reserve esophagectomy only for those with cancer. There are no controlled trials demonstrating that surveillance increases life expectancy in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Furthermore, endoscopic surveillance of this large group with Barrett's esophagus may be costly, and associated with considerable morbidity. Therefore, our objective was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance in patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Design--Decision analysis using a computer cohort simulation (Markov). We examined 12 strategies: (A) no endoscopic surveillance. Esophagectomy is performed only if cancer is detected by biopsy. (B) no surveillance. Esophagectomy is performed if high grade dysplasia is detected by biopsy: (C1-C5) surveillance at intervals from 1 to 5 yr, with esophagectomy if cancer is diagnosed, and (D1-D5) surveillance at intervals from 1 to 5 yr with esophagectomy if high grade dysplasia is diagnosed. We measured life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each strategy. Data Sources--Medline Search and bibliographies of retrieved articles; expert opinion when published data were not available. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Annual surveillance with esophagectomy for high grade dysplasia prevents cancer and is the preferred strategy, if only length of life (life expectancy) is considered. For those who consider both length and quality of life, endoscopy every 2-3 yr will provide the greatest quality-adjusted life expectancy. When costs are considered, endoscopy every 5 yr also increases life expectancy and has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio similar to common medical practices.

309,Pulmonary artery catheterization in exacerbations of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"The cost-effectiveness of pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) has been questioned in many clinical situations. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of PAC in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring mechanical ventilation. METHODS: We constructed a decision analysis model and calculated the incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved for hypothetical patients, comparing a PAC strategy to one of no PAC. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the stability of conclusions over wide ranges of values. RESULTS: The incremental cost/QALY saved in the cost-effectiveness analysis using baseline data is $77,407 when catheterization-driven therapeutic changes result in a 5% improvement in survival. Cost-effectiveness is sensitive to variations in post-hospital life expectancy, quality of life, and the probability of favorable therapeutic changes resulting from the use of catheterization data. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery catheterization in COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation is expensive compared to accepted medical interventions for other conditions, unless changes in therapy prompted by catheterization increase hospital survival to a level 8.7% above baseline. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to investigate the economic impact of PAC and its effect on morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients.",1994-01-01817,10146114,Respir Care,K J Smith,1994,39 / 10,961-7,No,10146114,"K J Smith; R R Pesce; Pulmonary artery catheterization in exacerbations of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Respir Care, 1994-Oct; 39(10):0020-1324; 961-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pulmonary artery catheterization vs. No pulmonary artery catheterization,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,77521,United States,1992,143002.76
310,Quality adjusted life years added by treatment of obstructive sleep apnea,"We assessed the impact of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) on the quality of life of 19 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We measured the utility for the patients' health states before and with treatment using the standard gamble approach. The study group had an average age of 57 years and had been on treatment for a mean of 9.5 months. For all the patients, the polysomnographic indicators of OSA disease severity improved markedly with treatment. For nine of the 12 symptoms most commonly associated with OSA, the patients reported improvement during treatment. The mean utility and the standard deviation obtained with the standard gamble method were 0.87 +/- 0.17 on treatment and 0.63 +/- 0.29 pretreatment. The difference in utility between treatment and pretreatment health states was combined with the life expectancy of each patient to generate the number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) considered equivalent to the impact of treatment. This resulted in an average gain of 5.4 QALYs. When we related this impact to the cost of treatment, we obtained a cost-utility ratio between Can $3,397 and Can $9,792 per QALY added. These costs are relatively small when compared to the cost per QALY for many other clinical interventions.

311,Pharmacoeconomic analysis of ondansetron versus metoclopramide for cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting,"A pharmacoeconomic analysis of ondansetron versus metoclopramide use in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin therapy is reported. A meta-analysis of the literature was performed to synthesize the results of clinical trials of ondansetron and metoclopramide for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin therapy. A cost-benefit analysis was performed by constructing a decision tree of the possible outcomes of treatment with ondansetron or metoclopramide. Clinical outcomes were measured by counting the emesis episodes occurring within 24 hours after the antiemetic was given and the extrapyramidal reactions occurring after metoclopramide was given. The improvement in quality of life was transformed to an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in order to conduct a cost-utility analysis.

313,A cost utility analysis of treatment options for gallstone disease: methodological issues and results,"The techniques of cost utility analysis (CUA) were used to evaluate the treatment of gallstone disease by open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy and by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). The application of the techniques in this context raised three methodological questions which are not satisfactorily resolved in the literature. The first is whether an ex ante or ex post perspective is best adopted for the measurement of quality of life (QoL). The second is the method for converting a short term deterioration in QoL followed by full health into QALYs and the reliability of the methods available.

316,"Comparison of ""accelerated"" tissue plasminogen activator with streptokinase for treatment of suspected myocardial infarction","PURPOSE. A computerized decision analysis, based on the results of published clinical trials, assessed the risks, benefits, and costs of different thrombolytic regimens for suspected myocardial infarction (MI) throughout the likely range of clinical circumstances. DATA SOURCE. Medline search and articles' bibliographies. STUDY SELECTION. All studies reporting efficacy and side effects of thrombolysis. DATA ANALYSIS. Life-expectancy outcomes of thrombolytic therapies for possible MI modeled by decision analysis. RESULTS. The analysis allows a clinician to estimate the benefits, risks, and relative costs of thrombolytic therapies throughout the likely range of individual clinical circumstances. When applied, for example, to the average patient in ISIS-2, estimated gains are 150 quality-adjusted days of life (QALDs) from treatment with streptokinase (SK) and 255 QALDs with ""accelerated"" tPA (tPA). tPA costs $1,686 more than SK, taking into account the cost of lifelong care of the extra strokes incurred. Nevertheless, the chances of stroke above which thrombolysis is not preferred are 5.0% for SK and 8.0% for tPA, with tPA remaining the preferred treatment for six hours after symptom onset; thereafter, SK is marginally preferred, but at much lower cost. Both regimens are beneficial in older patients provided the chances of MI and death are ""average"" or greater. CONCLUSION. When the chances of MI and death are known, decision analysis can be a useful bedside tool to guide thrombolytic therapy and subsequently, if needed, to review and defend the treatment decisions made.",1995-01-01821,8544674,Med Decis Making,J Kellett,1995,15 / 4,297-310,No,8544674,"J Kellett; J Clarke; Comparison of ""accelerated"" tissue plasminogen activator with streptokinase for treatment of suspected myocardial infarction, Med Decis Making, 1995 Oct-Dec; 15(4):0272-989X; 297-310",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thrombolytic therapy with tPA regimen and aspirin vs. Thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase and aspirin,Not Stated,80 Years,80 Years,Male,Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,49804,United States,1994,86975.86
317,Screening blood donors for hereditary hemochromatosis: decision analysis model based on a 30-year database,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The high prevalence, morbidity, premature death, and benefit of early diagnosis and treatment make hemochromatosis a prime target for screening in the white population. Decision analysis techniques were used to compare the outcome, utility, and incremental cost savings of a plan to screen voluntary blood donors for hemochromatosis. METHODS: The screening strategy includes sequential testing of serum unsaturated iron-binding capacity, serum transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and either hepatic iron index or venesections to measure exchangeable body iron. Estimates of prevalence, asymptomatic intervals, probabilities of life-threatening clinical complications, symptom-specific life expectancy, and sensitivity and specificity of screening tests are based on our database of 170 hemochromatosis homozygotes and the published literature. RESULTS: The screening strategy led to an incremental increase in utility of 0.84 quality-adjusted life days with an incremental cost savings of $3.19 per blood donor screened. When the potential of identifying asymptomatic homozygous siblings was included, these values increased to 1.18 quality-adjusted life days and $12.57 per person screened. Screening remained a dominant strategy given a prevalence of hemochromatosis of > 0.0026 or an initial screening test cost of < $8.

319,Screening for hemochromatosis in children of homozygotes: prevalence and cost-effectiveness,"Although hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease, most homozygotes are concerned with the genetic implications for their children. The optimal age for testing children and the cost implications of screening their children have not been clearly established. A clinical database consisting of 255 children from families with at least one homozygote is used to assess the prevalence of homozygotes among children of homozygous parents and to review the biochemical abnormalities and life-threatening symptoms in these young adults. Decision analysis is used to estimate the cost and utility of screening children of a homozygous parent. Eleven homozygotes were discovered among children of homozygotes. Only one male had a life-threatening event, cirrhosis. Decision analysis estimated cost saving of $12 per child screened ($ net present value) and a saving of 10 quality-adjusted days per child screened at age 10 years compared with not screening. If screening began at age 20 years, there is a cost saving of $65 per child screened. Sensitivity analysis showed that the major factors influencing cost savings were the cost of venesections, sensitivity and specificity of the screening tests, and prevalence of disease. Because the prevalence of hemochromatosis is higher in children of homozygotes than in the general population, screening with transferrin saturation and ferritin as early as age 10 years is recommended. Savings are augmented if the cost per venesection is eliminated by allowing hemochromatosis patients to become voluntary blood donors.",1995-01-01823,7489980,Hepatology,P C Adams,1995,22 / 6,1720-7,No,7489980,"P C Adams; A E Kertesz; L S Valberg; Screening for hemochromatosis in children of homozygotes: prevalence and cost-effectiveness, Hepatology, 1995-Dec; 22(6):0270-9139; 1720-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening strategy for hemochromatosis vs. No screening,Not Stated,10 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,3.00,3.00,-437.96,Canada,1994,-559.87

We used a model-based study using optimistic and pessimistic assumptions, concerning improvement of prognosis due to screen-detection and duration of the period of mammographic detectability, resulting in upper and lower limits for favourable and unfavourable effects. Under pessimistic assumptions, the balance between positive and negative effects of screening remains favourable up to an age of around 80 years. Under optimistic assumptions, this balance never becomes clearly negative with increase of the upper age limit of a screening programme. When including the costs in the analysis, the balance between effects and costs of increasing the upper age limit from 69 to 75 years is likely to be at least as favourable as intensifying a screening programme within the age group 50-69 years.

322,Declining value of alanine aminotransferase in screening of blood donors to prevent posttransfusion hepatitis B and C virus infection. The Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study,"BACKGROUND: Since the mid-1980s, blood banks in the United States have screened donors for elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in an effort to prevent posttransfusion hepatitis. The present study was designed to quantitate the residual value of ALT screening following the implementation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) assays. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two approaches were used. First, a database of 2.3 million donations made by 586,507 volunteer blood donors between 1991 and 1993 was used to compare the incidence of seroconversion to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV marker positivity in donors with elevated ALT values and with normal ALT values. Second, the duration of ALT elevation prior to HBV and HCV seroconversion was determined from 34 well-documented cases of posttransfusion HBV and HCV; elevated-ALT window periods were multiplied by rates of HBV and HCV incidence in donors to project the yield of ALT screening. Predictive value and cost-effectiveness analyses were also performed to compare the value of ALT screening before and after HCV screening was implemented. RESULTS: Both approaches indicate that ALT testing does not detect HBV in the window phase but does currently identify approximately 3 HCV window-phase donations per 1 million donations; this contrasts with ALT detection of approximately 1800 HCV-infectious units per 1 million donations prior to anti-HCV screening. Currently, only 8 in 10,000 donated units with elevated ALT (negative anti-HCV) are infected with HCV. The cost of continued ALT screening was estimated at $7,931,000 per quality-adjusted year of life saved.

326,Cost-effectiveness of head CT in patients with lung cancer without clinical evidence of metastases,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of CT for detecting brain lesions in patients with lung cancer without clinical evidence of metastases. DESIGN: Decision analysis model comparing two different strategies for detecting brain metastases: brain CT routinely (CT-first) or brain CT only when patients develop neurologic signs and/or symptoms (CT-deferred). PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohort of patients with lung cancer with an unremarkable screening clinical evaluation for metastases. MEASUREMENTS: Net costs are calculated as the difference in costs between the two limbs of the decision tree. Net benefits are expressed as the difference in calculated years of life expectancy between the two strategies. Net costs are divided by net benefits, yielding the marginal cost per quality adjusted year of added life expectancy (C/QALY) for the CT-first strategy. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, the C/QALY for the CT-first strategy is about $70,000. Improving the clinical evaluation as a screen for detecting brain metastases markedly increases the C/QALY. Increasing the cost of brain CT magnifies this effect. More effective treatment for asymptomatic brain metastases and better accuracy of CT for identifying resectable and unresectable brain metastases lower C/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although a threshold cost-effectiveness has not been defined for identifying ""cost-effective"" diagnostic procedures, the marginal C/QALY of the CT-first strategy is substantially higher than many accepted medical interventions.

327,Treatment of chronic type B and C hepatitis with interferon alfa: an economic appraisal,"The aim of this study is to assess the long-term economic impact of treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C with interferon alfa. Estimates were made of the progression of the disease over a 30-year period using a transitional probability model. Cohorts of 1,000 hypothetical patients with either chronic hepatitis B or C treated with interferon alfa were compared with an untreated cohort. The costs were estimated for therapy, monitoring, and treatment of the disease, including transplantation. The cost-effectiveness of therapy was expressed in terms of cost per life saved, cost per year of life saved, and cost per quality-adjusted year of life saved. The analysis was extended to include the indirect costs to patients. The analysis included two rates of progression, two mortality rates, and discounted and undiscounted costs. Mortality in the treated group was lower, saving 18 to 31 lives in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) cohort and 13 to 22 lives in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) cohort. Fewer patients progressed to cirrhosis or decompensated cirrhosis. Discounted costs per year of life saved ranged from 2,142 pounds to 17,128 pounds.

335,Foot infections in diabetic patients. Decision and cost-effectiveness analyses,"OBJECTIVE--To examine the cost-effectiveness of approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) who have foot infections and suspected osteomyelitis. DESIGN--Decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using a Markov model. We examined the prevalence of osteomyelitis, the major complications and efficacies of long-term antibiotic therapy and surgery, and the performance characteristics of four diagnostic tests (roentgenography, technetium Tc 99m bone scanning, indium in 111-labeled white blood cell scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging). Data were drawn from the English-language literature using MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles. SETTING--Primary care. PATIENTS--Patients with NIDDM who had foot infections and suspected osteomyelitis but no signs of systemic toxicity. INTERVENTIONS--Following hospitalization for surgical débridement and intravenous antibiotic therapy: (1) treatment for presumed soft-tissue infection, (2) culture-guided empiric treatment for presumed osteomyelitis, (3) 71 combinations of diagnostic tests preceding antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis, (4) 71 combinations of tests preceding amputation, and (5) immediate amputation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Quality-adjusted life expectancy, average costs. RESULTS--Culture-guided empiric treatment for osteomyelitis with 10 weeks of oral antibiotic therapy has similar effectiveness to testing followed by a long course of antibiotic therapy if any test result is positive. However, empiric treatment is the least expensive strategy. CONCLUSIONS--Noninvasive testing adds significant expense to the treatment of patients with NIDDM in whom pedal osteomyelitis is suspected, and such testing may result in little improvement in health outcomes. In patients without systemic toxicity, a 10-week course of culture-guided oral antibiotic therapy following surgical débridement may be as effective as and less costly than other approaches.",1995-01-01828,7853629,JAMA,M H Eckman,1995,273 / 9,712-20,No,7853629,"M H Eckman; S Greenfield; W C Mackey; J B Wong; S Kaplan; L Sullivan; K Dukes; S G Pauker; Foot infections in diabetic patients.

336,The cost effectiveness of preoperative autologous blood donations,"BACKGROUND. Since the recognition that human immunodeficiency virus is transmissible by blood transfusion there has been increasing public and professional support for autologous blood donations before elective surgery. Autologous blood donation is, however, a more expensive process than the donation of allogeneic blood by community volunteers. Furthermore, there have been recent improvements in the safety of the volunteer blood supply. METHODS. We used a decision-analysis model to assess the cost effectiveness of donating autologous blood for four surgical procedures. Cost data were collected from the observation of transfusion practice at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1992. Estimates of the risks of transfusion-associated diseases and the costs of treating them came from the medical literature. Cost effectiveness was expressed in dollars per quality-adjusted year of life saved. We performed sensitivity analyses of the variables in our model and examined the effect of strategies suggested to reduce costs. RESULTS. Substituting autologous for allogeneic blood resulted in little expected health benefit (0.0002 to 0.00044 quality-adjusted year of life saved) at considerable additional cost ($68 to $4,783 per unit of blood). The additional cost of autologous blood was primarily a function of the discarding of units that were donated but not transfused and of a more labor-intensive donation process. The cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $235,000 to over $23 million per quality-adjusted year of life saved. CONCLUSIONS. Given the improved safety of allogeneic transfusions today, the increased protection afforded by donating autologous blood is limited and may not justify the increased cost.",1995-01-01829,7854380,N Engl J Med,J Etchason,1995,332 / 11,719-24,No,7854380,"J Etchason; L Petz; E Keeler; L Calhoun; S Kleinman; C Snider; A Fink; R Brook; The cost effectiveness of preoperative autologous blood donations, N Engl J Med, 1995-Mar-16; 332(11):1533-4406; 719-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous blood donation vs. Allogeneic blood donation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,235000,United States,1992,433503.81

340,Cost-effectiveness of warfarin and aspirin for prophylaxis of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVE--To examine the cost-effectiveness of prescribing warfarin sodium in patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with or without additional stroke risk factors (a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease). DESIGN--Decision and cost-effectiveness analyses. The probabilities for stroke, hemorrhage, and death were obtained from published randomized controlled trials. The quality-of-life estimates were obtained by interviewing 74 patients with atrial fibrillation. Costs were estimated from literature review, phone survey, and Medicare reimbursement. PATIENTS--In the base case, the patients were 65 years of age and good candidates for warfarin therapy. INTERVENTIONS--Treatment with warfarin, aspirin, or no therapy in the decision analytic model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Quality-adjusted survival and marginal cost-effectiveness of warfarin as compared with aspirin or no therapy. RESULTS--For patients with NVAF and additional risk factors for stroke, warfarin therapy led to a greater quality-adjusted survival and to cost savings. For patients with NVAF and one additional risk factor, warfarin therapy cost $8000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. For 65-year-old patients with NVAF alone, warfarin cost about $370,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved, as compared with aspirin therapy. However, for 75-year-old patients with NVAF alone, prescribing warfarin cost $110,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. For patients who were not prescribed warfarin, aspirin was preferred to no therapy on the basis of both quality-adjusted survival and cost in all patients, regardless of the number of risk factors present. CONCLUSIONS--Treatment with warfarin is cost-effective in patients with NVAF and one or more additional risk factors for stroke. In 65-year-old patients with NVAF but no other risk factors for stroke, prescribing warfarin instead of aspirin would affect quality-adjusted survival minimally but increase costs significantly.",1995-01-01830,7500532,JAMA,B F Gage,1995,274 / 23,1839-45,No,7500532,"B F Gage; A B Cardinalli; G W Albers; D K Owens; Cost-effectiveness of warfarin and aspirin for prophylaxis of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, JAMA, 1995-Dec-20; 274(23):1538-3598; 1839-45",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,warfarin vs. ASA,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,1994,Not Stated

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Quality-adjusted survival and marginal cost-effectiveness of warfarin as compared with aspirin or no therapy. RESULTS--For patients with NVAF and additional risk factors for stroke, warfarin therapy led to a greater quality-adjusted survival and to cost savings. For patients with NVAF and one additional risk factor, warfarin therapy cost $8000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. For 65-year-old patients with NVAF alone, warfarin cost about $370,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved, as compared with aspirin therapy. However, for 75-year-old patients with NVAF alone, prescribing warfarin cost $110,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. For patients who were not prescribed warfarin, aspirin was preferred to no therapy on the basis of both quality-adjusted survival and cost in all patients, regardless of the number of risk factors present. CONCLUSIONS--Treatment with warfarin is cost-effective in patients with NVAF and one or more additional risk factors for stroke.

The extent of such improvements is unclear despite the extensive use of this treatment modality, and there are no studies concerning the economic cost of any gain achieved in the quantity and quality of life by chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1991 and May 1992, 61 patients with inoperable cancer (18 gastric, 22 pancreatic or biliary, and 21 colorectal) were randomized to either primary chemotherapy in addition to best supportive care or to best supportive care. Chemotherapy was allowed in the latter group if the supportive measures did not achieve palliation. All economic costs for medical care were prospectively recorded, and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses were performed. RESULTS: More patients in the primary chemotherapy group (19/33, 58%) had improved/prolonged high quality of life (QoL-patient, minimum duration 4 months) than in the best supportive care group (8/28, 29%, p < 0.05). Overall survival and quality-adjusted survival were significantly longer in the primary chemotherapy group (median 9 vs. 4 months, p < 0.05), and median 7 vs. 2 months, p < 0.05, respectively). When analysed by cancer site, survival was significantly prolonged in gastric cancer patients (median 10 vs. 4 months, p < 0.02), but not in colorectal (median 12 vs. 6 months, p = 0.1) and pancreatic-biliary cancer patients (median 8 vs. 5 months, p = 0.8). The average cost for all medical care was approximately 50% higher in the primary chemotherapy group, but the average cost per day was the same in the two groups. Hospitalization accounted for most of the costs in both groups. The incremental costs per gained year of life was SEK 166,400 ($21,300), per gained quality-adjusted year of life SEK 157,200 ($20,200), and per QoL-patient SEK 160,300 ($20,600). These costs were lower for gastric and colorectal cancer patients, and much higher for pancreatic-biliary cancer patients.

350,Management of childhood lead poisoning: clinical impact and cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVES. No consensus exists regarding the preferred treatment of childhood lead poisoning. The authors used decision analysis to compare the clinical impacts and cost-effectiveness of four management strategies for childhood lead poisoning, and to investigate how effective chelation therapy must be in reducing neuropsychologic sequelae to warrant its use. METHODS. The model was based on a 2-year-old child with moderate lead poisoning [blood lead level 1.21 to 1.88 mumol/L (25 to 39 micrograms/dL)]. The following strategies were compared: 1) no treatment; 2) EDTA provocation testing, followed by chelation if testing is positive (PROV); 3) penicillamine chelation with crossover to EDTA provocation testing if toxicity occurs (PCA); 4) EDTA provocation testing with crossover to penicillamine chelation if testing is negative (EDTA). RESULTS. The EDTA and PCA strategies prevented 22.5% of the cases of reading disability and resulted in an increase of 1.02 quality-adjusted life years compared with no treatment. When the costs of outpatient EDTA testing and chelation are considered, the EDTA strategy is more cost-effective than the PCA strategy; when inpatient costs are considered, the PCA strategy becomes more cost-effective. When costs of remedial education are considered, all strategies are cost-saving compared with no treatment if chelation reduces the risk of lead-induced reading disability by more than 20%. CONCLUSIONS. Treatment strategies for childhood lead poisoning vary in clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness. Chelation of the 1.4% of United States preschoolers whose blood lead levels are 2.21 mumol/L (25 micrograms/dL) or higher could prevent more than 45,000 cases of reading disability, and save more than $900 million per year in overall costs when the costs of remedial education are considered.",1995-01-01832,7898292,Med Decis Making,D E Glotzer,1995,15 / 1,13-24,No,7898292,"D E Glotzer; K A Freedberg; H Bauchner; Management of childhood lead poisoning: clinical impact and cost-effectiveness, Med Decis Making, 1995 Jan-Mar; 15(1):0272-989X; 13-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"EDTA provocation testing, with EDTA chelation if positive vs. No treatment",Not Stated,2 Years,2 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,804,United States,1990,1592.07

When costs of remedial education are considered, all strategies are cost-saving compared with no treatment if chelation reduces the risk of lead-induced reading disability by more than 20%. CONCLUSIONS. Treatment strategies for childhood lead poisoning vary in clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness. Chelation of the 1.4% of United States preschoolers whose blood lead levels are 2.21 mumol/L (25 micrograms/dL) or higher could prevent more than 45,000 cases of reading disability, and save more than $900 million per year in overall costs when the costs of remedial education are considered.",1995-01-01832,7898292,Med Decis Making,D E Glotzer,1995,15 / 1,13-24,No,7898292,"D E Glotzer; K A Freedberg; H Bauchner; Management of childhood lead poisoning: clinical impact and cost-effectiveness, Med Decis Making, 1995 Jan-Mar; 15(1):0272-989X; 13-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"PCA chelation with crossover to EDTA provocation testing if necessary vs. EDTA provocation testing, with chelation (EDTA if pos., PCA if neg.)",Not Stated,2 Years,2 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,1990,Not Stated
353,The community psychiatric nurse in primary care: an economic analysis,"Community psychiatric nurses (CPNs) in the United Kingdom are increasingly working in primary health care settings with less serious mental health problems. This paper describes an economic evaluation of their work using a randomized controlled trial in which 231 patients were assigned to continuing general practitioner care or one of two conditions of CPN intervention. This is only the third systematic economic analysis of community mental health nursing in the UK and the first carried out by mental health nurses. Various costs to patients, their families and the health care system were determined. Results showed that patients receiving CPN intervention experienced less absence from work and that this resulted in a net benefit. However, the cost per quality adjusted life year for intervening with this group of patients was probably several times more than for intervening with the seriously mentally ill. Therefore, if one considers both the clinical and economic results of the study, taken together with the recent results of the review of mental health nursing, there seems little justification for CPNs continuing to work in this area.",1995-01-01833,8708198,J Adv Nurs,K Gournay,1995,22 / 4,769-78,No,8708198,"K Gournay; J Brooking; The community psychiatric nurse in primary care: an economic analysis, J Adv Nurs, 1995-Oct; 22(4):0309-2402; 769-78",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuing care from a community psychiatric nurse vs. Continuing psychiatric are from a general practitioner,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,28000,United Kingdom,1988,109117.14

A decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the relative benefits and cost-effectiveness of revascularization for femoropopliteal disease using percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or bypass surgery. DESIGN--Decision analysis using a multistate transition simulation model (Markov process) and cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the health care system. SETTING--Based on mortality, morbidity, patency, and cost data from a literature review. PATIENTS--Hypothetical cohort of patients with chronic femoropopliteal disease who desire revascularization. Subgroup analysis for patients defined by age, sex, indication, lesion type, and graft type. INTERVENTIONS--Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, bypass surgery, and a strategies combining the two treatments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Five-year patency results, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS--For 65-year-old men with disabling claudication and a femoropopliteal stenosis or occlusion and for 65-year-old men with chronic critical ischemia and a femoropopliteal stenosis, initial angioplasty increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 2 to 13 months and resulted in decreased lifetime expenditures compared with bypass surgery. For patients with chronic critical ischemia and a femoropopliteal occlusion, initial bypass surgery increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1 to 4 months and resulted in decreased lifetime expenditures compared with angioplasty. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that angioplasty would always be the preferred initial treatment if the angioplasty 5-year patency rate exceeds 30%.

367,A cost-effectiveness model of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the short- and long-term costs and clinical and quality of life outcomes with the use of streptokinase (SK) vs tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: A decision analysis model. PATIENTS: Patients with acute MI who were candidates for thrombolytic therapy and who presented within six hours of symptom onset. MEASUREMENTS: 30-day and one-year mortality, impacts of disabling and nondisabling stroke, reinfarction, hemorrhage, hypotension, anaphylaxis, and long-term medical costs. RESULTS: Using 30-day mortality data from the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trial, the baseline analysis yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness for tPA of $30,300 per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, compared with SK. Using one-year mortality data from the GUSTO trial, the analysis yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness for tPA of $27,400 per additional QALY, compared with SK. The incremental cost-effectiveness of tPA over SK was sensitive to the difference in mortality seen with the two agents, exceeding $100,000 per QALY, for a relative survival advantage of approximately one-third that seen in the GUSTO trial. The incremental cost per QALY of tPA remained under $60,000 if the survival benefit was half that seen in the GUSTO trial. The cost-effectiveness of tPA declined with a shorter projected life expectancy following MI and for inferior (vs anterior) wall infarction. The analysis was modestly sensitive to the costs of the thrombolytic agents.

368,Cost utility analysis of maintenance treatment for recurrent depression,"This paper presents a cost-utility analysis of three maintenance treatments for recurrent depression: interpersonal therapy (IPT-M), imipramine drug therapy (Drug), and a combination of the two. We base our analysis on the results of the University of Pittsburgh's Controlled Clinical Trial of Maintenance Therapies for Recurrent Depression. We construct a Markovian state-transition model to incorporate clinical effectiveness into cost and quality-of-life impacts; we assign empirical values to the parameters of this model; and we then use Monte Carlo analysis to compare the relative cost effectiveness of the different maintenance treatments. For the patients who met the eligibility standards for the study, Drug maintenance treatment is cost-effective in the strongest sense of the term compared to either a placebo group or IPT-M: it both improves expected lifetime health (measured in quality-adjusted life years, or QALYs) and reduces direct medical costs. This is true even when relatively severe side effects of the drug are considered. Compared to the placebo group, IPT-M and the combination of IPT-M and Drug each improve expected lifetime health, although in neither case are expected direct medical costs reduced. Still, the cost of the resulting health improvements, under $5000/QALY, are very reasonable. A similar conclusion holds comparing Drug and IPT-M to IPT-M alone.

372,Perioperative imaging strategies for carotid endarterectomy. An analysis of morbidity and cost-effectiveness in symptomatic patients,"OBJECTIVE--To assess the cost-effectiveness of four diagnostic strategies for the preoperative evaluation of symptomatic patients who are potential candidates for carotid endarterectomy (ie, 70% to 99% stenosis): (1) duplex sonography (DS), (2) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), (3) contrast angiography (CA), and (4) the combination of DS and MRA supplemented by CA for disparate results. METHODS--Cost-effectiveness analysis based largely on published clinical trial data. Sensitivities and specificities of noninvasive tests were estimated from 81 patients undergoing prospective evaluation with DS, MRA, and CA. OUTCOME MEASURE--Incremental cost per quality-adjusted year of life gained. RESULTS--For a hypothetical cohort of symptomatic patients undergoing evaluation for carotid endarterectomy, the combination of tests resulted in the greatest quality-adjusted life expectancy of the four options considered. After incorporating the costs of testing, surgery, and stroke, we found that neither the MRA nor the CA strategy was cost-effective. The combination of tests was more effective but more costly than DS, resulting in an additional cost of $22,400 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. For centers that do not have adequate MRA, CA resulted in an additional cost of $99,200 per quality-adjusted year of life saved compared with DS. CONCLUSIONS--Our results suggest that for the preoperative detection of a 70% to 99% carotid stenosis, the combination of DS and MRA, supplemented by CA for disparate results, is associated with the lowest long-term morbidity and mortality and has a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.

383,Screening to prevent renal failure in insulin dependent diabetic patients: an economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the conditions necessary to make screening for microalbuminuria in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus cost effective. DESIGN: This economic evaluation compared two strategies designed to prevent the development of end stage renal disease in patients with insulin dependent diabetes with disease for five years. Strategy A, screening for microalbuminuria as currently recommended, was compared with strategy B, a protocol in which patients were screened for hypertension and macroproteinuria. INTERVENTION: Patients identified in both strategies were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. SETTING: Computer simulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Strategy costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The model predicted that strategy A would produce an additional 0.00967 QALYs at a present value cost of $261.53 (1990 US$) per patient (or an incremental cost/QALY of $27,041.69) over strategy B. The incremental cost/QALY for strategy A over B was sensitive to several variables. If the positive predictive value of screening for microalbuminuria (impact of false label and unnecessary treatment) is < 0.72, the effect of treatment to delay progression from microalbuminuria to macroproteinuria is < 1.6 years, the cumulative incidence of diabetic nephropathy falls to < 20%, or > 64% of patients demonstrate hypertension at the onset of microalbuminuria, then the incremental costs/QALY will exceed $75,000. CONCLUSION: Whether microalbuminuria surveillance in this population is cost effective requires more information. Being aware of the costs, recommendation pitfalls, and gaps in our knowledge should help focus our efforts to provide cost effective care to this population.",1995-01-01841,8555801,BMJ,B A Kiberd,1995,311 / 7020,1595-9,No,8555801,"B A Kiberd; K K Jindal; Screening to prevent renal failure in insulin dependent diabetic patients: an economic evaluation, BMJ, 1995-Dec-16; 311(7020):0959-8138; 1595-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Screening for microalbuminuria, & treatment with an ACE inhibitor if pos. vs. Treating patients with hypertension or macroproteinuria (no screening)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,27041.69,United States,1990,53547.72

A three-state Markov model was used to simulate the progression from PRF to end-stage renal disease and death. In our baseline analysis, assuming a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.8 of MRA for RAS, we obtained an incremental cost-effectiveness of MRA screening compared with no screening of $2,214 per quality-adjusted life year saved, which is less than many commonly performed procedures. Under our baseline assumptions, if the receiver-operating characteristic curve of MRA for RAS is better than the chance curve, then MRA screening would be cost-effective. The analysis was most sensitive to assumptions about renal function after correction of RAS and prevalence of RAS, although the results show that MRA remains cost-effective for reasonable ranges of these assumptions.

395,Hepatitis B vaccination: the cost effectiveness of alternative strategies in England and Wales,"OBJECTIVE--To assess the cost effectiveness of adding universal hepatitis B vaccination in infancy or pre-adolescence to a policy of selective vaccination of at risk groups. DESIGN--Costs of a selective policy and additional costs of universal vaccination policies were estimated from costs of vaccine delivery and published data on target populations. Additional years of life gained were calculated for each policy by applying life tables to estimates of mortality attributable to hepatitis B. SETTING--England and Wales. RESULTS--Compared with no vaccination, vaccination in infancy was the most cost effective followed by vaccination in preadolescence. Selective vaccination was the least effective (cost per year of life gained 2568 pounds, 2824 pounds, and 8564 pounds respectively). Adding vaccination in infancy or at pre-adolescence to a selective policy cost 1537 pounds or 1658 pounds per year of life gained. Discounting years gained in the future at 6% per annum, however, made pre-adolescent vaccination more cost effective than infant or selective vaccination (51,817 pounds, 94,821 pounds, and 124,779 pounds per discounted year of life gained). Adding pre-adolescent vaccination to a selective policy cost 32,125 pounds per discounted year of life gained and infant vaccination, 77,085 pounds. CONCLUSIONS--Universal vaccination against hepatitis B was more cost effective than selective vaccination in a low prevalence country.

398,"Comparison of cost-effectiveness and utility of exercise ECG, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and coronary angiography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease","BACKGROUND: To compare cost-effectiveness and utility of four clinical algorithms to diagnose obstructive coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD), we compared exercise ECG (ExECG), stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and coronary angiography. METHODS AND RESULTS: Published data and a straightforward mathematical model based on Bayes' theorem were used to compare strategies. Effectiveness was defined as the number of patients with diagnosed CAD, and utility was defined as the clinical outcome, ie, the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) extended by therapy after the diagnosis of CAD. Our model used published values for costs, accuracy, and complication rates of tests. Analysis of the model indicates the following results. (1) The direct cost (fee) for each test differs considerably from total cost per delta QALY. (2) As pretest likelihood of CAD (pCAD) in the population increases, there is a linear increase in cost per patient tested but a hyperbolic decrease in cost per effect and cost per utility unit, ie, increased cost-effectiveness and decreased cost per utility unit. (3) At pCAD < 0.70, analysis of the model indicates that stress PET is the most cost-effective test, with the lowest cost per utility, followed by SPECT, ExECG, and angiography, in that order. (4) Above a threshold value of pCAD of 0.70 (for example, middle-aged men with typical angina), proceeding directly to angiography as the first test showed the lowest cost per effect or utility. This quantitative model has the advantage of estimating a threshold value of pCAD (0.70) at which the rank order of cost-effectiveness and cost per utility unit change. The model also allows substitution of different values for any variable as a way to account for the uncertainties of clinical data, ie, changing costs, test accuracy and risk, etc. This procedure, called sensitivity analysis, showed that the rank order of cost-effectiveness did not change despite changes in several variables. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Estimation of total costs of diagnostic tests for CAD requires consideration not only of the direct cost of the test per se (eg, test fees) but also of the indirect and induced costs of management algorithms based on the test (eg, cost/delta QALY). (2) It is essential to consider the clinical history (pCAD) when selecting the clinical algorithm to make a diagnosis with the lowest cost per effect or cost per utility unit. (3) Stress PET shows the lowest cost per effect or cost per utility unit in patients with pCAD < 0.70. (4) Angiography shows the lowest cost per effect or cost per utility unit in patients with pCAD > 0.70.",1995-01-01847,7805219,Circulation,R E Patterson,1995,91 / 1,54-65,No,7805219,"R E Patterson; R L Eisner; S F Horowitz; Comparison of cost-effectiveness and utility of exercise ECG, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and coronary angiography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease, Circulation, 1995-Jan-01; 91(1):0009-7322; 54-65",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clinical diagnostic testing algorithms for CAD vs. No diagnostic testing for CAD,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,1993,Not Stated
