10801,Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy and alternative strategies,"OBJECTIVES: Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and sigmoidoscopy are proven to decrease colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality. Sigmoidoscopy''s benefit is limited to the distal colon. Observational data are conflicting regarding the degree to which colonoscopy affords protection against proximal CRC. Our aim was to explore the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy and alternative CRC screening strategies in light of the latest published data. METHODS: We performed a contemporary cost-utility analysis using a Markov model validated against data from randomized controlled trials of FOBT and sigmoidoscopy. Persons at average CRC risk within the general US population were modeled. Screening strategies included those recommended by the United States (US) Preventive Services Task Force, including colonoscopy every 10 years (COLO), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years (FS), annual fecal occult blood testing, annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), and the combination FS/FIT. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. RESULTS: In the base case, FIT dominated other strategies. The advantage of FIT over FS and COLO was contingent on rates of uptake and adherence that are well above current US rates. Compared with FIT, FS and COLO both cost <$50,000/QALY gained when FIT per-cycle adherence was <50%. COLO cost $56,800/QALY gained vs. FS in the base case. COLO cost <$100,000/QALY gained vs. FS when COLO yielded a relative risk of proximal CRC of <0.5 vs. no screening. In probabilistic analyses, COLO was cost-effective vs. FS at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained in 84% of iterations. CONCLUSIONS: Screening colonoscopy may be cost-effective compared with FIT and sigmoidoscopy, depending on the relative rates of screening uptake and adherence and the protective benefit of colonoscopy in the proximal colon.

10809,Cost-utility analysis of nt-probnp-guided multidisciplinary care in chronic heart failure,"OBJECTIVES: A recent randomized, controlled trial in chronic heart failure patients showed that NT-proBNP-guided, intensive patient management (BMC) on top of multidisciplinary care reduced all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations compared with multidisciplinary care (MC) or usual care (UC). We now performed a cost-utility analysis of these interventions from a payer''s perspective. METHODS: Costs related to hospitalizations, ambulatory physician and nurse visits, and NT-proBNP testing for the three management strategies were acquired for both Austria (euro) and Canada ($) and combined with the survival and quality of life data from the clinical trial for cost-effectiveness analysis. Data on long-term survival, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were extrapolated for a 20-year time horizon using a Markov model, which simulated the progression of disease through beta-blocker use, hospitalizations, and mortality. RESULTS: BMC was the most cost-effective strategy as it was dominant (cost-saving with improved health outcome) over both MC and UC based on both Austrian and Canadian costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for MC relative to UC were euro3,746 and $5,554 per QALY gained for Austrian and Canadian costs, respectively. The probabilities for BMC being the most cost-effective strategy were 92 percent at a threshold value of Austrian euro40,000 and 93 percent at a threshold value of Canadian $50,000.

There are very few data on the cost-effectiveness of antidepressants for depression in dementia and their effects on carer outcomes. AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sertraline and mirtazapine compared with placebo for depression in dementia. METHOD: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis (trial registration: ISRCTN88882979 and EudraCT 2006-000105-38). The primary cost-effectiveness analysis compared differences in treatment costs for patients receiving sertraline, mirtazapine or placebo with differences in effectiveness measured by the primary outcome, total Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) score, over two time periods: 0-13 weeks and 0-39 weeks. The secondary evaluation was a cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) computed from the Euro-Qual (EQ-5D) and societal weights over those same periods. RESULTS: There were 339 participants randomised and 326 with costs data (111 placebo, 107 sertraline, 108 mirtazapine). For the primary outcome, decrease in depression, mirtazapine and sertraline were not cost-effective compared with placebo. However, examining secondary outcomes, the time spent by unpaid carers caring for participants in the mirtazapine group was almost half that for patients receiving placebo (6.74 v. 12.27 hours per week) or sertraline (6.74 v. 12.32 hours per week). Informal care costs over 39 weeks were pound1510 and pound1522 less for the mirtazapine group compared with placebo and sertraline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of reducing depression, mirtazapine and sertraline were not cost-effective for treating depression in dementia. However, mirtazapine does appear likely to have been cost-effective if costing includes the impact on unpaid carers and with quality of life included in the outcome.

We assessed the potential cost-effectiveness of UGT1A1 testing to inform the choice of an initial protease-inhibitor-containing regimen in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications computer simulation model to project quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs (2009 USD) for atazanavir-based ART with or without UGT1A1 testing, using darunavir rather than atazanavir when indicated. We assumed the UGT1A1-associated atazanavir discontinuation rate reported in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (a *28/*28 frequency of 14.9%), equal efficacy and cost of atazanavir and darunavir and a genetic assay cost of $107. These parameters, as well as the effect of hyperbilirubinaemia on quality of life and loss to follow up, were varied in sensitivity analyses. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: Initiating atazanavir-based ART at CD4(+) T-cell counts <500 cells/mul without UGT1A1 testing had an average discounted life expectancy of 16.02 QALYs and $475,800 discounted lifetime cost. Testing for UGT1A1 increased QALYs by 0.49 per 10,000 patients tested and was not cost-effective (>$100,000/QALY). Testing for UGT1A1 was cost-effective (<$100,000/QALY) if assay cost decreased to $10, or if avoiding hyperbilirubinaemia by UGT1A1 testing reduced loss to follow-up by 5%. If atazanavir and darunavir differed in cost or efficacy, testing for UGT1A1 was not cost-effective under any scenario.

10822,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stents versus bypass surgery for patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease: results from the FREEDOM trial,"BACKGROUND: Studies from the balloon angioplasty and bare metal stent eras have demonstrated that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is cost-effective compared with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients undergoing multivessel coronary revascularization-particularly among patients with complex coronary artery disease or diabetes mellitus. Whether these results apply in the drug-eluting stent (DES) era is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2010, 1900 patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease were randomized to PCI with DES (DES-PCI; n=953) or CABG (n=947). Costs were assessed from the perspective of the U.S. health care system. Health state utilities were assessed using the EuroQOL 5 dimension 3 level questionnaire. A patient-level microsimulation model based on U.S. life-tables and in-trial results was used to estimate lifetime cost-effectiveness. Although initial procedural costs were lower for CABG, total costs for the index hospitalization were $8622 higher per patient. Over the next 5 years, follow-up costs were higher with PCI, owing to more frequent repeat revascularization and higher outpatient medication costs. Nonetheless, cumulative 5-year costs remained $3641 higher per patient with CABG. Although there were only modest gains in survival with CABG during the trial period, when the in-trial results were extended to a lifetime horizon, CABG was projected to be economically attractive relative to DES-PCI, with substantial gains in both life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios <$10 000 per life-year or quality-adjusted life-year gained across a broad range of assumptions regarding the effect of CABG on post-trial survival and costs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher initial costs, CABG is a highly cost-effective revascularization strategy compared with DES-PCI for patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease.

10823,Cost-effectiveness of two endovascular treatment strategies vs intravenous thrombolysis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of endovascular treatment against intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) when varying assumptions concerning its effectiveness. METHODS: We developed a health economic model including a hypothetical population consisting of patients with ischemic stroke, admitted within 4.5 h from onset, without contraindications for IVT or intra-arterial treatment (IAT).

10826,Cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of wrist and hand disability due to upper-limb post-stroke spasticity in Scotland,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating upper-limb post-stroke spasticity (ULPSS) with usual care (UC) plus onabotulinumtoxinA versus UC alone in Scotland. METHODS: We developed a model to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from treating ULPSS. Efficacy data and health utilities were taken from clinical trials. Unit costs were taken from published Scottish sources. We compared UC plus onabotulinumtoxinA and UC alone in three scenarios: (i) a scenario from the National Health Service perspective, which included differences in onabotulinumtoxinA use, specialist visits and day-hospital visits; (ii) a scenario that only included differences in onabotulinumtoxinA use and specialist visits; and (iii) a scenario from a societal perspective that included differences in onabotulinumtoxinA use, specialist visits and caregiver burden. RESULTS: In the first scenario, the model predicted that UC plus onabotulinumtoxinA produced 0.107 QALYs at an additional cost of pound1099 compared with UC alone over 5 years, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound10,271/QALY. In the second scenario, the ICER increased to pound27,134/QALY. In the third scenario (societal perspective), UC plus onabotulinumtoxinA produced lower total cost and higher QALYs, and therefore was superior to UC alone. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a model, UC plus onabotulinumtoxinA improved disability, which translated into greater QALYs but also increased direct medical costs compared with UC alone; however, the resulting ICER can be considered cost-effective. Moreover, UC plus onabotulinumtoxinA can be cost-saving if reduction in caregiver burden was included.

10827,Primary treatments for clinically localised prostate cancer: a comprehensive lifetime cost-utility analysis,"WHAT''S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Multiple treatment alternatives exist for localised prostate cancer, with few high-quality studies directly comparing their comparative effectiveness and costs. The present study is the most comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis to date for localised prostate cancer, conducted with a lifetime horizon and accounting for survival, health-related quality-of-life, and cost impact of secondary treatments and other downstream events, as well as primary treatment choices. The analysis found minor differences, generally slightly favouring surgical methods, in quality-adjusted life years across treatment options. However, radiation therapy (RT) was consistently more expensive than surgery, and some alternatives, e.g. intensity-modulated RT for low-risk disease, were dominated - that is, both more expensive and less effective than competing alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the costs and outcomes associated with radical prostatectomy (open, laparoscopic, or robot-assisted) and radiation therapy (RT: dose-escalated three-dimensional conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT, brachytherapy, or combination), using a comprehensive, lifetime decision analytical model. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to follow hypothetical men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer over their lifetimes after primary treatment; probabilities of outcomes were based on an exhaustive literature search yielding 232 unique publications. In each Markov cycle, patients could have remission, recurrence, salvage treatment, metastasis, death from prostate cancer, and death from other causes. Utilities for each health state were determined, and disutilities were applied for complications and toxicities of treatment. Costs were determined from the USA payer perspective, with incorporation of patient costs in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Differences across treatments in quality-adjusted life years across methods were modest, ranging from 10.3 to 11.3 for low-risk patients, 9.6-10.5 for intermediate-risk patients and 7.8-9.3 for high-risk patients. There were no statistically significant differences among surgical methods, which tended to be more effective than RT methods, with the exception of combined external beam + brachytherapy for high-risk disease. RT methods were consistently more expensive than surgical methods; costs ranged from $19 901 (robot-assisted prostatectomy for low-risk disease) to $50 276 (combined RT for high-risk disease).

10834,Assessing the cost utility of response-guided therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 in the UK using the MONARCH model,"BACKGROUND: European guidelines advocate the measurement of on-treatment hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in order to determine optimal therapy duration (response-guided therapy [RGT]) in patients with rapid virological response (RVR) or delayed virological response (DVR). Treatment response is highly dependent upon the extent of liver fibrosis yet there is little evidence quantifying the cost effectiveness of RGT particularly conditional upon fibrosis stage. OBJECTIVE: This study describes an economic model designed to assess the costs and benefits of RGT compared with standard duration of therapy (SDT) in hepatitis C virus genotype 1 patients. METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation model with lifetime perspective was developed to undertake a cost utility analysis of RGT in the UK. Patients entered the model at Metavir disease stages F0-F4, and progressed through these stages via age and duration of HCV infection-dependent transition probabilities. Treated patients were partitioned according to virological response and shortened or extended duration of therapy was applied following European guidelines. RESULTS: For all patients, SDT and RGT was associated with an increase of 2.14 and 2.20 QALYs and pound2,374 and pound2,270 costs, respectively, compared with no treatment. Overall, RGT was a dominant scenario being associated with a lower risk of complications, increased QALYs (0.08) and cost saving ( pound101). RGT across fibrosis stages was either highly cost effective or dominant; in all cases RGT was associated with an increase in QALYs, driven by a reduction in complications in DVR subjects and reduced exposure to treatment disutility in RVR subjects; costs were lower in F1 and F2 fibrosis stages. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY, overall RGT across fibrosis stages F2-F4 were associated with the highest probability of being cost effective. At this threshold, the probability of reduced/extended therapy in RVR/DVR patients being cost effective is 0.35 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that the treatment of HCV genotype 1 patients in fibrosis stage F2 has the greatest potential for maximizing health benefit and cost saving within an RGT protocol.

10840,Is liver transplantation using organs donated after cardiac death cost-effective or does it decrease waitlist death by increasing recipient death?,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness in liver transplantation (LT) of utilizing organs donated after cardiac death (DCD) compared with organs donated after brain death (DBD). METHODS: A Markov-based decision analytic model was created to compare two LT waitlist strategies distinguished by organ type: (i) DBD organs only, and (ii) DBD and DCD organs. The model simulated outcomes for patients over 10 years with annual cycles through one of four health states: survival; ischaemic cholangiopathy; retransplantation, and death. Baseline values and ranges were determined from an extensive literature review. Sensitivity analyses tested model strength and parameter variability. RESULTS: Overall survival is decreased, and biliary complications and retransplantation are increased in recipients of DCD livers. Recipients of DBD livers gained 5.6 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of US$69 000/QALY, whereas recipients on the DBD + DCD LT waitlist gained 6.0 QALYs at a cost of US$61 000/QALY. The DBD + DCD organ strategy was superior to the DBD organ-only strategy.

10841,A pharmaco-economic evaluation of deferasirox for treating patients with iron overload caused by transfusion-dependent thalassemia in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The newly available iron chelator deferasirox (Exjade, Novartis) is expected to provide better long-term clinical outcomes and improved quality of life for patients with thalassemia than its predecessor, deferoxamine (Desferal, Novartis), because of its oral tablet form. METHODS: We used the Markov model to estimate total additional lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with deferasirox versus deferoxamine in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Patients were assumed to be 2 years of age at initiation of chelation therapy. Clinical outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality from associated complications and life expectancy for the study population were estimated using the databases of the Bureau of National Health Insurance and the Health and Vital Statistics of Taiwan. Treatment costs were based on analyses of health insurance claims for patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Utilities in terms of quality of life were also included in the model. The incremental cost-utility ratio of deferasirox versus deferoxamine was defined by the ratio of the difference in expected lifetime costs to the difference in QALYs. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results to key assumptions. RESULTS: Patients treated with deferasirox are expected to experience a lower incidence of associated complications and obtain 2.3 QALYs (discounted) at an additional lifetime cost of US$36,291 per patient (US$15,596 per QALY). Sensitivity analyses showed that the unit drug cost of deferasirox had the greatest impact on the incremental cost-utility ratio. In addition, the incremental cost-utility ratio will increase by delaying the starting age (2 years of age in our study) of chelation therapy. CONCLUSION: Compared with infusional deferoxamine, oral deferasirox improved clinical outcomes and quality of life in terms of iron chelation in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia at a reasonable cost from a healthcare perspective.",2013-01-10414,23537869,J Formos Med Assoc,Wan-Ling Ho,2013,112 / 4,221-9,No,23537869,"Wan-Ling Ho; Kuo-Piao Chung; Szu-Sheng Yang; Meng-Yao Lu; Shiann-Tarng Jou; Hsiu-Hao Chang; Yung-Li Yang; Dong-Tsamn Lin; Kai-Hsin Lin; A pharmaco-economic evaluation of deferasirox for treating patients with iron overload caused by transfusion-dependent thalassemia in Taiwan, J Formos Med Assoc, ; 112(4):0929-6646; 221-9",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral deferasirox therapy vs. Infusional deferoxamine therapy,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15596,United States,2011,17944.49

Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is a promising treatment but no previous study has assessed the cost-effectiveness or long-term outcome of ICBT for severe health anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness and 1-year treatment effects of ICBT for severe health anxiety. METHOD: Cost-effectiveness and 1-year follow-up data were obtained from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing ICBT (n = 40) to an attention control condition (CC, n = 41). The primary outcome measure was the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). A societal perspective was taken and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using bootstrap sampling. RESULTS: The main ICER was - pound1244, indicating the societal economic gain for each additional case of remission when administering ICBT.

10843,Is the US AIDS drug assistance program cost-effective?,"Each year, the US AIDS drug assistance program (ADAP) provides access to prescription drugs-including antiretrovirals-to more than 110,000 persons living with HIV (PLWH) who lack adequate medical insurance. PLWH on effective antiretroviral therapy live longer lives, with enhanced quality of life, and are less likely to transmit HIV to others. There are thus significant benefits associated with the ADAP program. But there also are substantial costs. A mathematical model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the US ADAP program. Findings indicate that by providing antiretrovirals to underinsured persons, the ADAP program prevented 3,191 secondary infections and saved 24,922 quality-adjusted life years in 2008.

10844,Prophylactic salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy as an alternative for BRCA mutation carriers,"OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is advised for women with BRCA mutations, but there are adverse consequences of premature menopause. The majority of BRCA-associated ovarian cancers appear to arise in the fallopian tube; therefore, salpingectomy may be an alternative to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. We compared the costs and benefits of salpingectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy among BRCA mutation carriers. METHODS: We developed a Markov Monte Carlo simulation model to compare three strategies for risk reduction in women with BRCA mutations: 1) bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; 2) bilateral salpingectomy; and 3) bilateral salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy. Net health benefits were measured in years-of-life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-year expectancy, and the primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The model estimated the number of future breast and ovarian cancers and cardiovascular deaths attributed to premature menopause with each strategy. RESULTS: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was associated with the lowest cost and highest life expectancy compared with the other two strategies. When quality-of-life measures were included, salpingectomy followed by delayed oophorectomy yielded the highest quality-adjusted life expectancy with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $37,805 and $89,680 per quality-adjusted life-year for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively, relative to salpingectomy alone. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy yielded the lowest number of future breast and ovarian cancers compared with the other two strategies. CONCLUSION: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy offers the greatest risk reduction for breast and ovarian cancer among BRCA mutation carriers.

10846,Prophylactic salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy as an alternative for BRCA mutation carriers,"OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is advised for women with BRCA mutations, but there are adverse consequences of premature menopause. The majority of BRCA-associated ovarian cancers appear to arise in the fallopian tube; therefore, salpingectomy may be an alternative to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. We compared the costs and benefits of salpingectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy among BRCA mutation carriers. METHODS: We developed a Markov Monte Carlo simulation model to compare three strategies for risk reduction in women with BRCA mutations: 1) bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; 2) bilateral salpingectomy; and 3) bilateral salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy. Net health benefits were measured in years-of-life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-year expectancy, and the primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The model estimated the number of future breast and ovarian cancers and cardiovascular deaths attributed to premature menopause with each strategy. RESULTS: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was associated with the lowest cost and highest life expectancy compared with the other two strategies. When quality-of-life measures were included, salpingectomy followed by delayed oophorectomy yielded the highest quality-adjusted life expectancy with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $37,805 and $89,680 per quality-adjusted life-year for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively, relative to salpingectomy alone.

10848,A decision-analytic Markov model to compare the cost-utility of anterior repair augmented with synthetic mesh compared with non-mesh repair in women with surgically treated prolapse,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a mesh-augmented anterior vaginal wall repair compared with a non-mesh fascial plication repair. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. SETTING: Data for outcomes of different surgical techniques were derived from systematic reviews and recent publications. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model, developed in TreeAge Pro 2007((R)) , was used to compare the cost-utility of mesh and non-mesh anterior vaginal wall repairs. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of different scenarios and assumptions on results from the model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Under base case assumptions at 5 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for mesh-augmented anterior repairs was pound15 million per QALY. Sensitivity analysis found no plausible model inputs that could make a mesh repair cost-effective by conventional criteria. This was mostly because of the extra costs associated with the price of the mesh, treating mesh erosion and difficulty finding data that support a lower reoperation rate for mesh anterior wall repairs.

10849,Cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to heroin users for lay overdose reversal,"BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose is a leading cause of accidental death in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone, an opioid antagonist, to heroin users for use at witnessed overdoses. DESIGN: Integrated Markov and decision analytic model using deterministic and probabilistic analyses and incorporating recurrent overdoses and a secondary analysis assuming heroin users are a net cost to society. DATA SOURCES: Published literature calibrated to epidemiologic data. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical 21-year-old novice U.S. heroin user and more experienced users with scenario analyses. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Naloxone distribution for lay administration. OUTCOME MEASURES: Overdose deaths prevented and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In the probabilistic analysis, 6% of overdose deaths were prevented with naloxone distribution; 1 death was prevented for every 227 naloxone kits distributed (95% CI, 71 to 716). Naloxone distribution increased costs by $53 (CI, $3 to $156) and quality-adjusted life-years by 0.119 (CI, 0.017 to 0.378) for an ICER of $438 (CI, $48 to $1706). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Naloxone distribution was cost-effective in all deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses, and it was cost-saving if it resulted in fewer overdoses or emergency medical service activations. In a ""worst-case scenario"" where overdose was rarely witnessed and naloxone was rarely used, minimally effective, and expensive, the ICER was $14 000. If national drug-related expenditures were applied to heroin users, the ICER was $2429. LIMITATION: Limited sources of controlled data resulted in wide CIs. CONCLUSION: Naloxone distribution to heroin users is likely to reduce overdose deaths and is cost-effective, even under markedly conservative assumptions.

10853,Economic evaluation of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) for the treatment of mild to moderate depression,"BACKGROUND: The burden of rising health care expenditures has created a demand for information regarding the clinical and economic outcomes associated with Complementary and Alternative Medicines. Clinical controlled trials have found St. John''s wort to be as effective as antidepressants in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. The objective of this study was to develop a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of St. John''s wort based on this evidence. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate health and economic impacts of St. John''s wort versus antidepressants. Outcomes were treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and Net Monetary Benefits (NMB). Probabilistic analyses were conducted on key model parameters. RESULTS: The average NMB across 5000 simulations identified St. John''s wort as the strategy with the highest net benefit. The total cost savings for SJW were $359.66 and $202.56 per individual for venlafaxine and sertraline respectively, with a gain of 0.08 to 0.12 QALYs over the 72 weeks of the model.

10855,Cost-effectiveness of trial of labor after previous cesarean in a minimally biased cohort,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a trial of labor after one previous cesarean delivery (TOLAC). STUDY DESIGN: A model comparing TOLAC with elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) was developed for a hypothetical cohort with no contraindication to a TOLAC. Probabilistic estimates were obtained from women matched on their baseline characteristics using propensity scores. Cost data, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and data on cerebral palsy were incorporated from the literature. RESULTS: The TOLAC strategy dominated the ERCD strategy at baseline, with $138.6 million saved and 1703 QALYs gained per 100,000 women. The model was sensitive to five variables: the probability of uterine rupture, the probability of successful TOLAC, the QALY of failed TOLAC, the cost of ERCD, and the cost of successful TOLAC without complications. When the probability of TOLAC success was at the base value, 68.5%, TOLAC was preferred if the probability of uterine rupture was 4.2% or less. When the probability of uterine rupture was at the base value, 0.8%, the TOLAC strategy was preferred as long as the probability of success was 42.6% or more.

10856,Cost-effectiveness of new adult pneumococcal vaccination strategies in Italy,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) are very relevant pathologies among elderly people (>/= 65 y old), with a consequent high disease burden. Immunization with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has been differently implemented in the Italian regions in the past years, reaching overall low coverage rates even in those with medical indications. In 2010, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) became available and recommended in the universal Italian infant immunization program. Since October 2012, indications for use of PCV13 were extended to subjects >/= 50 y to prevent invasive pneumococcal diseases. The Italian decision makers should now revise regional indications for the prevention of pneumococcal diseases in the elderly. Pharmaco-economic analyses represent a useful tool to value the feasibility of new immunization programs and their sustainability. Therefore, an ad hoc population model was developed in order to value the clinical and economic impact of an adult pneumococcal vaccination program in Italy. Particularly, different immunization scenarios were modeled: vaccination of 65 y-olds (1 cohort strategy), simultaneous vaccination of people aged 65 and 70 y (double cohort strategy) and, lastly, immunization of people aged 65, 70 and 75 y (triple cohort strategy), thus leading to the vaccination of 5, 10 and 15 cohorts during the 5 y of the program. In addition, the administration of a PPV23 dose one year after PCV13 was evaluated, in order to verify the economic impact of the supplemental serotype coverage in elderly people. The mathematical model valued the clinical impact of PCV13 vaccination on the number of bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia (BPP) and pneumococcal meningitis (PM) cases, and related hospitalizations and deaths. Although PCV13 is not yet formally indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal CAP by the European Medicine Agency (differently from FDA, whose indications include all pneumococcal diseases in subjects >/= 50 y), the model calculated also the possible impact of vaccination on CAP cases (non-bacteraemic), considering the rate of this disease due to S. pneumoniae. The results of the analysis show that, in Italy, an age-based PCV13 vaccination program in elderly people is cost-effective from the payer perspective, with costs per QALY ranging from 17,000 to 22,000 Euro, according to the adopted vaccination strategy. The subsequent PPV23 offer results in an increment of costs per QALY (from 21,000 to 28,000 Euro, according to the vaccination strategy adopted).

We estimate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral-based HIV prevention strategies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed and analysed a mathematical model of a hyperendemic setting with relatively low levels of condom use. We estimated the prevention impact and cost of various PrEP interventions, assuming a fixed amount of spending on PrEP; investigated the optimal role of PrEP and earlier ART in terms of epidemiological impact and cost; and systematically explored the impact of earlier ART and PrEP, in combination with medical male circumcision services; on HIV transmission. RESULTS: A PrEP intervention is unlikely to generate a large reduction in HIV incidence, unless the cost is substantially reduced. In terms of infections averted and quality adjusted life years gained, at a population-level maximal cost-effectiveness is achieved by providing ART to more infected individuals earlier rather than providing PrEP to uninfected individuals. However, early ART alone cannot reduce HIV incidence to very low levels and PrEP can be used cost-effectively in addition to earlier ART to reduce incidence further. If implemented in combination and at ambitious coverage levels, medical male circumcision, earlier ART and PrEP could produce dramatic declines in HIV incidence, but not stop transmission completely.

10874,Should chronic hepatitis B be treated as early as possible?,"OBJECTIVES: We studied the cost-effectiveness of tenofovir and entecavir in e antigen positive (CHBe+) and negative (CHBe-) chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: Using a multicenter survey including 544 patients we measured patient quality of life and attributable costs by clinical disease stage. Natural disease progression was studied in 278 patients in a single center. A Markov model was constructed to follow hypothetical cohorts of treated and untreated 40-year-old CHBe+ and CHBe- patients and 50-year-old patients with compensated cirrhosis. RESULTS: We did not find an improvement in quality of life when viral load was reduced under treatment. Transition rates to liver cirrhosis were found to be age-dependent. Assuming equal effectiveness, tenofovir dominates the entecavir strategy because of its lower price in Belgium. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of tenofovir after 20 years is more favorable for treating Caucasian cirrhotic patients (mean ICER euro29,000/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) compared with treating non-cirrhotic patients (mean ICER euro110,000 and 131,000/QALY for CHB e+ and e-, respectively). Within the non-cirrhotic patients the ICER decreases with increasing cohort starting age from 30 to 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: Results of long-term models for tenofovir or entecavir treatment of CHB need to be interpreted with caution as long-term trials with hard end points are lacking.

10882,Cost-effectiveness of sorafenib treatment in field practice for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,"The purpose was to assess the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients incorporating current prices and the results of the recent published field practice SOraFenib Italian Assessment (SOFIA) study. We created a Markov Decision Model to evaluate, in a hypothetical cohort of Caucasian male patients, aged 67 years with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) C HCC, or BCLC B HCC who were unfit or failed to respond to locoregional therapies, well compensated cirrhosis, and with performance status 0-1 according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), the cost-effectiveness of the following strategies: (1) full or dose-adjusted sorafenib for BCLC B and C patients together; (2) full or dose-adjusted sorafenib for BCLC B patients; (3) full or dose-adjusted sorafenib for BCLC C patients. Outcomes include quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In the base-case analysis dose-adjusted sorafenib was the most effective of the evaluated strategies. For dose-adjusted sorafenib, QALY was 0.44 for BCLC B and C patients together, 0.44 for BCLC C patients, and 0.38 for BCLC B patients. The ICER of dose-adjusted sorafenib compared with BSC was euro34,534 per QALY gained for BCLC B and C patients together, euro27,916 per QALY gained for BCLC C patients, and euro54,881 per QALY gained for BCLC B patients.

10883,Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and anticoagulation therapy is indicated to reduce risk. Dabigatran is a new oral anticoagulant that does not require INR monitoring. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in Switzerland. METHODS: A Markov model simulating the course of treatment and occurrence of clinical events in two treatment arms over the lifetime of patients was adapted to the Swiss context. The adaptation included the cost of anticoagulation therapy and clinical events in Switzerland. The cost of inpatient care was estimated on data of all inpatient hospital stays in 2008. The calculation of outpatient care costs was based on peer reviewed studies, expert interviews and local tariffs. RESULTS: Patients treated with dabigatran had a higher life expectancy and experienced more quality adjusted life years (QALY) while incurring higher costs than patients treated with vitamin K antagonists. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was CHF 25,108. per QALY with 110 mg and CHF 9,702 per QALY with 150 mg of dabigatran. A sequential dosage scheme, in which 150 mg are administered up to the age of 80 years and 110 mg thereafter, resulted in an ICER of CHF 10,215 per QALY. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that these results are robust. CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran can be considered cost-effective in comparison with vitamin K antagonists in the Swiss context.

10886,The cost-effectiveness of a new percutaneous ventricular assist device for high-risk PCI patients: mid-stage evaluation from the European perspective,"OBJECTIVE: A new and smaller percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD, Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, MA) has been developed to provide circulatory support in hemodynamically unstable patients and to prevent hemodynamic collapse during high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The objective of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this specific device compared to the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) from the European perspective. Additional analysis on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was conducted for observational purposes only, given its use in some European countries. METHODS: A combination of a decision tree and Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the small, pVAD. The short-term (30-day) effectiveness and safety (early survival, risk of bleeding, and stroke) were modeled, as well as long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure). The short-term effectiveness and safety data for the device were obtained from two registries (the Europella and USpella), both of which are large multi-center studies in high-risk patient groups. Probabilities of long-term major adverse cardiovascular events were obtained from various published clinical studies. The economic analysis was conducted from a German statutory health insurance perspective and only direct medical costs were included. Cost-effectiveness was estimated over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Compared with IABP, the pVAD generated an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.22 (with Euro-registry data) and 0.27 (with US-registry data). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the device varied between euro38,069 (with Euro-registry data) and euro31,727 (with US-registry data) per QALY compared with IABP. KEY LIMITATIONS: Unadjusted, indirect comparisons of short-term effectiveness and safety between the interventions were used in the model. Cost and utility data were retrieved from various sources. Therefore, differences in patient populations may bias the estimated cost-effectiveness.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Results were incorporated into a probabilistic Markov model to compare lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane and Cinahl databases from 2002 to 18 April 2011 to identify studies comparing hydrophilic, gel reservoir, and non-coated intermittent catheters. Earlier guidelines were used to identify papers published before 2002. To capture studies comparing clean and sterile non-coated intermittent self catheterisation, each database was searched from its date of inception to 18 April 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteraemia, mortality, patient preference or comfort, and number of catheters used. The economic model included downstream complications of UTI and cost effectiveness was calculated as incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the systematic review. Most were conducted in patients with spinal cord injuries, and most of the included patients were men. People using gel reservoir and hydrophilic catheters were significantly less likely to report one or more UTIs compared with sterile non-coated catheters (absolute effect for gel reservoir = 149 fewer per 1000 (95% confidence interval -7 to 198), P=0.04; absolute effect for hydrophilic = 153 fewer per 1000 (-8 to 268), P=0.04). However, there was no difference between hydrophilic and sterile non-coated catheters when outcomes were measured as mean monthly UTIs (mean difference = 0.01 (-0.11 to 0.09), P=0.84) or total UTIs at 1 year (mean difference = 0.18 (-0.50 to 0.86), P=0.60). There was little difference in the incidence of one or more UTIs for people using clean versus sterile non-coated catheters (absolute effect = 12 fewer per 1000 (-134 to 146), P=0.86).

10893,"Intermittent self catheterisation with hydrophilic, gel reservoir, and non-coated catheters: a systematic review and cost effectiveness analysis","OBJECTIVE: To determine the most effective and cost effective type of catheter for patients performing intermittent self catheterisation in the community. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Results were incorporated into a probabilistic Markov model to compare lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane and Cinahl databases from 2002 to 18 April 2011 to identify studies comparing hydrophilic, gel reservoir, and non-coated intermittent catheters. Earlier guidelines were used to identify papers published before 2002. To capture studies comparing clean and sterile non-coated intermittent self catheterisation, each database was searched from its date of inception to 18 April 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteraemia, mortality, patient preference or comfort, and number of catheters used. The economic model included downstream complications of UTI and cost effectiveness was calculated as incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the systematic review. Most were conducted in patients with spinal cord injuries, and most of the included patients were men. People using gel reservoir and hydrophilic catheters were significantly less likely to report one or more UTIs compared with sterile non-coated catheters (absolute effect for gel reservoir = 149 fewer per 1000 (95% confidence interval -7 to 198), P=0.04; absolute effect for hydrophilic = 153 fewer per 1000 (-8 to 268), P=0.04). However, there was no difference between hydrophilic and sterile non-coated catheters when outcomes were measured as mean monthly UTIs (mean difference = 0.01 (-0.11 to 0.09), P=0.84) or total UTIs at 1 year (mean difference = 0.18 (-0.50 to 0.86), P=0.60). There was little difference in the incidence of one or more UTIs for people using clean versus sterile non-coated catheters (absolute effect = 12 fewer per 1000 (-134 to 146), P=0.86). Although the most effective, gel reservoir catheters cost > pound54,350 per QALY gained and are therefore not cost effective compared with clean non-coated self catheterisation. CONCLUSION: The type of catheter used for intermittent self catheterisation seems to make little difference to the risk of symptomatic UTI. Given large differences in resource use, clean non-coated catheters are most cost effective.

10894,Cost-effectiveness of vaccination of the elderly against herpes zoster in The Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Each year a substantial number of Dutch elderly suffers from herpes zoster (HZ), caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV). A potential complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) which results in a prolonged loss of quality of life. A large randomized clinical trial, labelled the Shingles Prevention study (SPS), demonstrated that a live attenuated VZV vaccine can reduce the incidence of HZ and PHN. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccination of the elderly against HZ versus no such vaccination in The Netherlands. METHODS: A cohort model was developed to compare the costs and effects in a vaccinated and a non-vaccinated age- and gender-stratified cohort of immune-competent elderly. Vaccination age was varied from 60 to 75 years. Data from published literature such as the SPS were used for transition probabilities. The study was performed from the societal as well as the health care payer''s perspective and results were expressed in euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the base case, we estimated that vaccination of a cohort of 100,000 60-year-olds would prevent 4136 cases of HZ, 305 cases of PHN resulting in a QALY-gain of 209. From the societal perspective, a total of euro1.9 million was saved and the ICER was euro35,555 per QALY gained when a vaccine price of euro87 was used. Vaccination of women resulted in a lower ICER than vaccination of men (euro33,258 vs. euro40,984 per QALY gained). The vaccination age with the most favourable ICER was 70 years (euro29,664 per QALY gained). Parameters with a major impact on the ICER were the vaccine price and HZ incidence rates. In addition, the model was sensitive to utility of mild pain, vaccine efficacy at the moment of uptake and the duration of protection induced by the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Vaccination against HZ might be cost-effective for ages ranging from 60 to 75 when a threshold of euro50,000 per QALY gained would be used, at euro20,000 per QALY this might not be the case.

10898,Predicting the cost-effectiveness of total hip and knee replacement: a health economic analysis,"The aim of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis of total hip (THR) and knee replacement (TKR). Arthritis is a disabling condition that leads to long-term deterioration in quality of life. Total joint replacement, despite being one of the greatest advances in medicine of the modern era, has recently come under scrutiny. The National Health Service (NHS) has competing demands, and resource allocation is challenging in times of economic restraint. Patients who underwent THR (n = 348) or TKR (n = 323) between January and July 2010 in one Scottish region were entered into a prospective arthroplasty database. A health-utility score was derived from the EuroQol (EQ-5D) score pre-operatively and at one year, and was combined with individual life expectancy to derive the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare QALYs gained between procedures, while controlling for baseline differences. The number of QALYs gained was higher after THR than after TKR (6.5 vs 4.0 years, p < 0.001). The cost per QALY for THR was pound1372 compared with pound2101 for TKR. The predictors of an increase in QALYs gained were poorer health before surgery (p < 0.001) and younger age (p < 0.001). General health (EQ-5D VAS) showed greater improvement after THR than after TKR (p < 0.001). This study provides up-to-date cost-effectiveness data for total joint replacement.

10900,Cost-effectiveness of an improving access to psychological therapies service,"BACKGROUND: Effective psychological therapies have been recommended for common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, but provision has been poor. Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) may provide a cost-effective solution to this problem. AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of IAPT at the Doncaster demonstration site (2007-2009). METHOD: An economic evaluation comparing costs and health outcomes for patients at the IAPT demonstration site with those for comparator sites, including a separate assessment of lost productivity. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: The IAPT site had higher service costs and was associated with small additional gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with its comparator sites, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of pound29 500 using the Short Form (SF-6D). Sensitivity analysis using predicted EQ-5D scores lowered this to pound16 857. Costs per reliable and clinically significant (RCS) improvement were pound9440 per participant. CONCLUSIONS: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies provided a service that was probably cost-effective within the usual National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) threshold range of pound20 000-30 000, but there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the costs and outcome differences.",2013-01-10739,23307921,Br J Psychiatry,Clara Mukuria,2013,202 / 3,220-7,No,23307921,"Clara Mukuria; John Brazier; Michael Barkham; Janice Connell; Gillian Hardy; Rebecca Hutten; Dave Saxon; Kim Dent-Brown; Glenys Parry; Cost-effectiveness of an improving access to psychological therapies service, Br J Psychiatry, ; 202(3):0007-1250; 220-7",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) sites vs. Non-IAPT sites,Age- 16-64 years,64 Years,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,8 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,29500,United Kingdom,2008,65762.28
