8601,Cost-effectiveness of adding rh-endostatin to first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in China,"Adding rh-endostatin to standard platinum-based chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free and overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the cost-effectiveness of this practice is unclear.The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to estimate the effects of adding rh-endostatin to standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC on health and economic outcomes in China.A semi-Markov model was constructed to track 3-week patient transitions between 3 health states: progression-free survival, progressed survival, and death. Probabilities were derived mainly from the results of a pivotal Phase III trial assessing the addition of rh-endostatin to standard first-line chemotherapy with vinorelbine-cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health care system, and the analysis was run over a 10-year time horizon. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding rh-endostatin at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 3 ? the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.According to the model, treatment with rh-endostatin plus standard chemotherapy would increase overall survival by 0.63 years and 0.35 QALYs per patient compared with standard chemotherapy, at an additional cost of $8402.60. The ICER for adding rh-endostatin to chemotherapy was $24,454.25/QALY gained (at a 3% discounted rate). On 1-way sensitivity analysis, the utility value of progression-free survival was the most influential factor on the results, followed by the cost of rh-endostatin. On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probabilities of cost-effectiveness varied by region due to discrepant per-capita GDPs in China. Modeling to extrapolate clinical survival beyond trial completion was the main limitation.The findings from the present analysis suggest that the addition of rh-endostatin to standard first-line chemotherapy is unlikely to be cost-effective. However, at a high WTP, rh-endostatin might be a cost-effective treatment option.",2011-01-08172,21992806,Clin Ther,Bin Wu,2011,33 /,1446-55,Yes,21992806,"Bin Wu; Huafeng Chen; Jinfang Shen; Ming Ye; Cost-effectiveness of adding rh-endostatin to first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in China, Clin Ther, ; 33 ():1879-114X; 1446-55",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) + cisplatin (30 mg/m2) along with rh-endostatin (7.5 mg/m2) for 4 cycles (endostatin strategy) vs. Vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) + cisplatin (30 mg/m2) for 4 cycles (NP strategy),Not Stated,76 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,24454,United States,2010,29024.49
8602,The cost and cost-effectiveness of expedited partner therapy compared with standard partner referral for the treatment of chlamydia or gonorrhea,"Partner treatment is an important component of sexually transmitted disease control. Several randomized controlled trials have compared expedited partner treatment (EPT) to unassisted standard partner referral (SR). All of these trials found that EPT significantly increased partner treatment over SR, whereas some found that EPT significantly lowered reinfection rates in index patients.We collected cost data to assess the payer-specific, health care system, and societal-level cost of EPT and SR. We used data on partner treatment and index patient reinfection rates from 2 randomized controlled trials examining EPT and SR for patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea. Additional elements were estimated or drawn from the literature. We used a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the impact on cost and effectiveness of varying several variables simultaneously, and calculated threshold values for selected variables at which EPT and SR costs per patient were equal.From a health care system or societal perspective, EPT was less costly and it treated more partners than SR. From the perspective of an individual payer, EPT was less costly than SR if =32% to 37% of male index patients' female partners or =29% of female index patients' male partners received care from the same payer.EPT has a lower cost from a societal or health care system perspective than SR and treats more partners.

8617,Are stroke units cost effective? Evidence from a New Zealand stroke incidence and population-based study,"Background and aim Acute stroke units in hospitals are known to be more costly than standard care, but proponents claim that the health gains will justify the expense. Yet, despite widespread adoption of stroke units, the evidence on the cost effectiveness of stroke units has been mixed, due in part to differences in the pathway of care across hospitals. The purpose of this study is to compare costs and outcomes for patients admitted to a stroke unit with those admitted to a general ward. Methods Data on 530 stroke sufferers from a large incidence study of stroke (the Auckland Regional Community Stroke Outcome Study) were used. Cost of health services, places of discharge were identified at one-, six- and 12 months poststroke and were linked with long-term cost and survival five-years poststroke. A decision analytical model was developed, including the relationship between waiting time for discharge and probability of admission to stroke unit. Cost effectiveness was determined using a willingness to pay threshold of NZ$20 000 (US$15 234). Results Regression analysis suggested that there were no significant differences between patients admitted to a stroke unit and a general ward. The incremental cost-utility ratio for the first-year was NZ$42 813/quality-adjusted life year (US$32 610/quality-adjusted life year), but fell substantially to NZ$6747/quality-adjusted life year (US$5139/quality-adjusted life year) when lifetime costs and outcomes were considered. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analysis suggests that the results are robust to areas of uncertainty or delays in the pathway of care.

8618,Economic evaluation of the impact of memantine on time to nursing home admission in the treatment of Alzheimer disease,"An observational study showed that combining memantine with a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment significantly delayed admission to nursing homes in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Our study aimed to evaluate the economic impact of the concomitant use of memantine and a ChEI, compared with a ChEI alone, in a Canadian population of patients with AD.A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model during a 7-year time horizon was performed according to a societal and Canadian health care system perspective. The Markov model includes the following states: noninstitutionalized, institutionalized, and deceased. The model includes transition probabilities for institutionalization and death, adjusted with mortality rates specific to AD. Utilities associated with institutionalization and noninstitutionalization were included. For the health care system perspective, costs of medication as well as costs of care provided in the community and in nursing homes were considered. For the societal perspective, costs of direct care and supervision provided by caregivers were added.From both perspectives, the concomitant use of a ChEI and memantine is a dominant strategy, compared with the use of a ChEI alone. On a per patient basis, there was a gain of 0.26 quality-adjusted life years with the treatment including memantine and cost decreases of Can$21 391 and Can$30 512, respectively, for the societal and health care system perspective.This economic evaluation indicates that institutionalization is the largest cost component in AD management and that the use of memantine, combined with a ChEI, to treat AD is a cost-effective alternative, compared with the use of a ChEI alone.",2011-01-08199,22014692,Can J Psychiatry,Jean Lachaine,2011,56 /,596-604,No,22014692,"Jean Lachaine; Catherine Beauchemin; Mark Legault; S?bastien Bineau; Economic evaluation of the impact of memantine on time to nursing home admission in the treatment of Alzheimer disease, Can J Psychiatry, ; 56 ():0706-7437; 596-604",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Concomitant use of memantine and cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment vs. Cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,7 Years,5.00,5.00,-82273.08,Canada,2010,-94857.08

Recently, clinical trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (liraglutide and exenatide) have shown a multifactorial clinical profile with the potential to address many of the clinical needs of patients and reduce the burden of disease.The goal of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-daily liraglutide versus exenatide BID in patients with type 2 diabetes who failed to improve with metformin and/or sulfonylurea, based on the results of a previous clinical trial in 6 European countries (Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, and Austria).A validated computer simulation model of diabetes was used to predict life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incidence of diabetes-related complications in patients receiving liraglutide (1.8 mg once daily) or exenatide (10 ?g BID). Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were derived from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 trial. Country-specific complication costs were taken from published sources. Simulations were run over 40 years from third-party payer perspectives. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at country-specific discount rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed.Liraglutide was associated with improvements of 0.12 to 0.17 QALY and a reduced incidence of most diabetes-related complications versus exenatide in all settings.

We evaluated the outcomes, costs and cost-effectiveness of HIV screening when offered by either a member of the ED staff or by an HIV counselor.We employed a mathematical model to extend data obtained from a randomized clinical trial of provider- vs. counselor-based HIV screening in the ED. We compared the downstream survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness of three HIV screening modalities: 1) no screening program; 2) an ED provider-based program; and 3) an HIV counselor-based program. Trial arm-specific data were used for test offer and acceptance rates (provider offer 36%, acceptance 75%; counselor offer 80%, acceptance 71%). Undiagnosed HIV prevalence (0.4%) and linkage to care rates (80%) were assumed to be equal between the screening modalities. Personnel costs were derived from trial-based resource utilization data. We examined the generalizability of results by conducting sensitivity analyses on offer and acceptance rates, undetected HIV prevalence, and costs.Estimated HIV screening costs in the provider and counselor arms averaged $8.10 and $31.00 per result received. The Provider strategy (compared to no screening) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $58,700/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and the Counselor strategy (compared to the Provider strategy) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $64,500/QALY. Results were sensitive to the relative offer and acceptance rates by strategy and the capacity of providers to target-screen, but were robust to changes in undiagnosed HIV prevalence and programmatic costs.The cost-effectiveness of provider-based HIV screening in an emergency department setting compares favorably to other US screening programs.

8638,Pharmacoeconomic assessment of implementing a universal PCV-13 vaccination programme in the Valencian public health system (Spain),"Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) was licensed to provide immunity against pneumococcal disease caused by seven serotypes of S. pneumoniae. Thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) includes 6 additional serotypes for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease.The objective of this study was to estimate the potential health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with PCV-13 in the Community of Valencia and to generate valuable information for policy makers at regional and country levels.A decision tree was designed to determine the health and economic outcomes in hypothetical cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated children followed over their lifetime. Information about disease incidence and serotype distribution were gathered from local databases and from published and unpublished local records. PCV-13 effectiveness was extrapolated from PCV-7 efficacy data. A 5% of herd effect and a serotype replacement of 25% were considered for the base case scenario.

8643,Economic analysis of the implementation of guidelines for type 2 diabetes control developed by Diabetes Poland: what increase in costs is justified by clinical results?,"Diabetes Poland has recently published guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Treatment according to these guidelines is more expensive and requires more involvement of the patient than is the case in current clinical practice.The aim of the study was to assess to what extent the cost of type 2 diabetes treatment according to the Diabetes Poland guidelines may be increased when compared with the cost of the current treatment, so that the introduction of the guidelines remains cost-effective in the Polish setting.Two hypothetical patients were defined, John and Peter, representing the population of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. The disease progression was simulated assuming that John is treated according to the current practice and Peter is treated to achieve and maintain the goals defined by Diabetes Poland. The simulation was performed using the CORE model, which has been constructed based on the published scientific evidence and includes more than a dozen of diabetes complications. The model has been widely validated by numerous studies and is broadly used; it enables a reliable estimation of costs and clinical effects associated with diabetes. The parameters of the model were adapted to the Polish conditions. The analysis was conducted in a life-long perspective, discounting of costs/effects was included, and the acceptability threshold was set at 25,511 EUR per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).The quality-adjusted life expectancy of John will be 0.3 QALY lower than the life expectancy of Peter. The treatment of diabetic complications will be 400 EUR more expensive in the case of John compared with that of Peter. Assuming the willingness to pay at the level of 7500 EUR/QALY, the cost of diabetes treatment of Peter may be 250 EUR higher than that of John's treatment. For the threshold level of 15,000 EUR/QALY, the difference in cost may be 450 EUR, and for the threshold level of 25,000 EUR/QALY - 725 EUR per year.Treatment according to the guidelines of Diabetes Poland may be cost-effective provided that the additional costs associated with intensification of therapy will not exceed 725 EUR per year.",2011-01-08232,22045095,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Daria Szmurlo,2011,121 /,345-50,No,22045095,"Daria Szmurlo; Agata Schubert; Kaja Kostrzewska; Przemyslaw Rys; Iwona Skrzekowska-Baran; Economic analysis of the implementation of guidelines for type 2 diabetes control developed by Diabetes Poland: what increase in costs is justified by clinical results?, Pol Arch Med Wewn , ; 121 ():1897-9483; 345-50",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensified treatment provided through guidelines developed by Diabetes Poland vs. Usual care,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,3.50,Not Stated,Euro,2010,Not Stated
8644,A cost-effectiveness analysis of a preventive exercise program for patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with concomitant chemo-radiotherapy,"Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) has become an indispensable organ, but not always function preserving treatment modality for advanced head and neck cancer. To prevent/limit the functional side effects of CCRT, special exercise programs are increasingly explored. This study presents cost-effectiveness analyses of a preventive (swallowing) exercise program (PREP) compared to usual care (UC) from a health care perspective.A Markov decision model of PREP versus UC was developed for CCRT in advanced head and neck cancer. Main outcome variables were tube dependency at one-year and number of post-CCRT hospital admission days. Primary outcome was costs per quality adjusted life years (cost/QALY), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as outcome parameter. The Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) was calculated to obtain the value of further research.PREP resulted in less tube dependency (3% and 25%, respectively), and in fewer hospital admission days than UC (3.2 and 4.5 days respectively). Total costs for UC amounted to ?41,986 and for PREP to ?42,271. Quality adjusted life years for UC amounted to 0.68 and for PREP to 0.77. Based on costs per QALY, PREP has a higher probability of being cost-effective as long as the willingness to pay threshold for 1 additional QALY is at least ?3,200/QALY. At the prevailing threshold of ?20,000/QALY the probability for PREP being cost-effective compared to UC was 83%. The EVPI demonstrated potential value in undertaking additional research to reduce the existing decision uncertainty.Based on current evidence, PREP for CCRT in advanced head and neck cancer has the higher probability of being cost-effective when compared to UC. Moreover, the majority of sensitivity analyses produced ICERs that are well below the prevailing willingness to pay threshold for an additional QALY (range from dominance till ?45,906/QALY).",2011-01-08242,22051143,BMC Cancer,Valesca P Ret?l,2011,11 /,475,No,22051143,"Valesca P Ret?l; Lisette van der Molen; Frans J M Hilgers; Coen R N Rasch; Annemiek A A M H J L'Ortye; Lotte M G Steuten; Wim H van Harten; A cost-effectiveness analysis of a preventive exercise program for patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with concomitant chemo-radiotherapy, BMC Cancer, ; 11 ():1471-2407; 475",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Preventative swallowing exercise program (PREP) in addition to usual care vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,4.00,1.50,3197,Euro,2008,5659.11

8648,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of electric stimulation therapy in non-healing venous leg ulcers,"To estimate the cost-effectiveness of using electric stimulation (ES) therapy (Accel-Heal) plus dressings and compression bandaging compared with dressings and compression bandaging alone in treating chronic, non-healing venous leg ulcers (VLUs) of >6 months' duration from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.A 5-month Markov model was constructed, depicting the management of a chronic, non-healing VLU of >6 months' duration. The model considers the decision by a clinician to continue with a patient's previous care plan (comprising dressings and compression bandaging) or treating with ES therapy plus dressings and compression bandaging. The model was used to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of ES therapy at 2008-2009 prices.According to the model, 38% of VLUs are expected to heal within 5 months after starting ES therapy, with a further 57% expected to improve. This improvement in clinical outcome is expected to lead to a 6% health gain of 0.017 QALYs (from 0.299 to 0.316 QALYs) over 5 months. The model also showed that using ES therapy instead of continuing with a patient's previous care plan is expected to reduce the NHS cost of managing them by 15%, from ?880 to ?749, due in part to a 27% reduction in the requirement for nurse visits (from mean 49.0 to 35.9 visits per patient) over the first 5 months after the start of treatment. Hence, use of ES therapy was found to be a dominant treatment (improved outcome for less cost).Within the model's limitations, use of ES therapy potentially affords the NHS a cost-effective treatment, compared with patients remaining on their previous care plan in managing chronic, non-healing VLUs of >6 months' duration. However, this is dependant on the number of ES therapy units per treatment, the unit cost of the device, and the number of nurse visits required to manage patients in clinical practice.This study was sponsored by Synapse Microcurrent Ltd., manufacturers of Accel-Heal.

8649,Treating mild gestational diabetes mellitus: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of treating mild gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).A decision analytic model was built to compare treating vs not treating mild GDM. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). All probabilities, costs, and benefits were derived from the literature. Base case, sensitivity analyses, and a Monte Carlo simulation were performed.Treating mild GDM was more expensive, more effective, and cost-effective at $20,412 per QALY. Treatment remained cost-effective when the incremental cost to treat GDM was less than $3555 or if treatment met at least 49% of its reported efficacy at the baseline cost to treat of $1786.Treating mild GDM is cost-effective in terms of improving maternal and neonatal outcomes including decreased rates of preeclampsia, cesarean sections, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, permanent and transient brachial plexus injury, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.",2011-01-08270,22071065,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Mika S Ohno,2011,205 /,282.e1-7,No,22071065,"Mika S Ohno; Teresa N Sparks; Yvonne W Cheng; Aaron B Caughey; Treating mild gestational diabetes mellitus: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Am J Obstet Gynecol, ; 205 ():0002-9378; 282.e1-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Dietary advice, glucose monitoring and insulin if necessary vs. Usual prenatal care",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.00,20412,United States,2009,24624.42
8650,The economic impact and cost-effectiveness of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin after cardiac surgery,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common after cardiac surgery, and expeditious recognition with specific biomarkers may help improve outcome.Because the economic impact of a biomarker-based diagnostic strategy is unknown, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of using urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for the diagnosis of AKI after cardiac surgery compared with current diagnostic methods.A decision analysis model was developed using the societal perspective to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NGAL. Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was determined for NGAL and standard strategies. The base case was a 67-year-old male patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the United Kingdom. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how cost-effectiveness would vary with changes in the underlying clinical and economic variables.The base case yielded expected costs of ?4244 and 11.86 QALYs for the NGAL strategy compared with ?4672 and 11.79 QALYs for the standard therapy. The cost-effectiveness ratio for the NGAL strategy was ?358/QALY compared with ?396/QALY for the standard regimen. Cost-effectiveness increased as the treatment effect-defined as the ability to prevent progression of established AKI (kidney injury or failure)-for the therapy triggered by an elevated NGAL level rose. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most responsive to the probability of developing AKI and least sensitive to the test cost for NGAL. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis supported the NGAL strategy as the most cost-effective option. Because this study was a decision analysis model incorporating a nonspecific treatment for AKI (as opposed to an observational study or controlled trial), model structural assumptions may therefore have underestimated mortality and the likelihood of developing AKI, although these were tested in multiple sensitivity analyses. Indirect costs were also not explicitly factored.The use of urinary NGAL after cardiac surgery appears to be cost-effective in the early diagnosis of AKI.",2011-01-08271,22071237,Clin Ther,Andrew D Shaw,2011,33 /,1713-25,Yes,22071237,"Andrew D Shaw; Donald B Chalfin; Joris Kleintjens; The economic impact and cost-effectiveness of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin after cardiac surgery, Clin Ther, ; 33 ():1879-114X; 1713-25",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for acute kidney infection (AKI) diagnosis vs. Current standard including creatine and urinary monitoring,Not Stated,67 Years,67 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-6114.29,United Kingdom,2008,-13630.15
8651,Cost-effectiveness analysis of prophylactic lamivudine use in preventing vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus infection,"As neonates born to mothers with positive hepatitis B e antigen may not be completely protected by hepatitis B vaccination, prophylactic lamivudine use in mothers with high viraemia has been proposed. However, the overall effectiveness and the balance between cost and benefit for such a prophylactic strategy have rarely been addressed.Using a review of recent literature, we aimed to assess the cost effectiveness, from the Taiwanese societal perspective, of administering prophylactic lamivudine to mothers to reduce vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus and its long-term sequelae in neonates.A meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of lamivudine versus placebo. A Markov decision model was constructed in which in both treatment arms infants received active and passive immunoprophylaxis. An economic evaluation was performed to calculate costs, acute infections averted, and QALYs gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve drawn. All these analyses were from the societal perspective. Costs ($US) were valued in year 2008 prices.Supplemental lamivudine use gained an additional 0.0024 QALYs and averted 0.23 acute infections per birth compared with the routine active-passive immunization without lamivudine. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the use of additional prophylactic lamivudine dominated the routine strategy. The acceptability curve suggested that the probability of being cost effective under the willingness-to-pay threshold of $US20,000 was 94%.This analysis suggests that supplemental use of lamivudine in mothers with high hepatitis B viraemia is effective in reducing vertical transmission and may be cost effective, from a Taiwanese societal perspective, compared with the routine active-passive immunization without lamivudine.",2011-01-08285,22077578,Pharmacoeconomics,Hui-Fang Hung,2011,29 /,1063-73,Yes,22077578,"Hui-Fang Hung; Hsiu-Hsi Chen; Cost-effectiveness analysis of prophylactic lamivudine use in preventing vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus infection, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 29 ():1179-2027; 1063-73",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Lamivudine (100mg/day) prescribed in last month until delivery and all neonates received HBV vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months after birth; neonates born to mothers with positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen received HBIG (200 IU) vs. All neonates receive HBV vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months after birth; neonates born to mothers with positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen received HBIG (200 IU)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,Not Stated,-15416.67,United States,2008,-18532.04

However, to our knowledge, no published studies have yet evaluated the cost effectiveness of any treatments for CHB in a Canadian setting, where relative prices and management of CHB differ from those in Europe.Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of tenofovir DF compared with other nucleos(t)ide therapies licensed for CHB in Canada from the perspective of publicly funded healthcare payers.A Markov model was used to calculate the costs and benefits of nucleos(t)ide therapy in three groups of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative CHB: nucleos(t)ide-naive patients without cirrhosis; nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with compensated cirrhosis; and lamivudine-resistant patients. Disease progression was modelled as annual transitions between 18 disease states. Transition probabilities, quality of life and costs were based on published studies. Health benefits were measured in QALYs. The reference year for costs was 2007 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum.First-line tenofovir DF was the most effective nucleos(t)ide strategy for managing CHB, generating 6.85-9.39 QALYs per patient. First-line tenofovir DF was also the most cost-effective strategy in all patient subgroups investigated, costing between $Can43,758 and $Can48,015 per QALY gained compared with lamivudine then tenofovir.

8674,Should TIA patients be hospitalized or referred to a same-day clinic?: a decision analysis,"For patients presenting with TIA, a previous study concluded that hospitalization is cost-effective compared to discharge without treatment from the emergency department. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of hospitalization vs urgent clinic evaluation following TIA.Among a cohort of TIA patients, we created a decision tree model to compare the decision to hospitalize or refer to urgent-access specialty clinic. We estimated probabilities, utilities, and direct costs from the available literature and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We assumed equal access to standard medical treatments between the 2 approaches; however, we estimated higher tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) utilization among hospitalized patients. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess all assumptions in our model.In patients with TIA aged 65-74 years, hospitalization yielded additional 0.00026 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 1 year, but at an additional cost of $5,573 per patient compared to urgent clinic evaluation (ICER = $21,434,615/QALY). Over 30 years, the ICER was $3,473,125/QALY. These results were not sensitive to varying 48-hour stroke risk, length of stay, tPA utilization rate, QALYs saved per tPA treatment, and hospitalization and clinic costs, and cost saved per tPA treatment.Despite increased access to tPA in the hospital, we found that hospitalization is not cost-effective compared to same-day clinic evaluation following TIA. A very small fraction of patients benefits from hospitalization if urgent-access TIA clinics are available.

8675,Reconstruction versus conservative treatment after rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament: cost effectiveness analysis,"The decision whether to treat conservatively or reconstruct surgically a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an ongoing subject of debate. The high prevalence and associated public health burden of torn ACL has led to continuous efforts to determine the best therapeutic approach. A critical evaluation of benefits and expenditures of both treatment options as in a cost effectiveness analysis seems well-suited to provide valuable information for treating physicians and healthcare policymakers.A literature review identified four of 7410 searched articles providing sufficient outcome probabilities for the two treatment options for modeling. A transformation key based on the expert opinions of 25 orthopedic surgeons was used to derive utilities from available evidence. The cost data for both treatment strategies were based on average figures compiled by Orthopaedic University Hospital Balgrist and reinforced by Swiss national statistics. A decision tree was constructed to derive the cost-effectiveness of each strategy, which was then tested for robustness using Monte Carlo simulation.Decision tree analysis revealed a cost effectiveness of 16,038 USD/0.78 QALY for ACL reconstruction and 15,466 USD/0.66 QALY for conservative treatment, implying an incremental cost effectiveness of 4,890 USD/QALY for ACL reconstruction. Sensitivity analysis of utilities did not change the trend.ACL reconstruction for reestablishment of knee stability seems cost effective in the Swiss setting based on currently available evidence.

8676,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle intervention programmes to prevent diabetes based on an example from Germany: Markov modelling,"ABSTRACT:Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) poses a large worldwide burden for health care systems. One possible tool to decrease this burden is primary prevention. As it is unethical to wait until perfect data are available to conclude whether T2D primary prevention intervention programmes are cost-effective, we need a model that simulates the effect of prevention initiatives. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of lifestyle intervention programmes for the prevention of T2D using a Markov model. As decision makers often face difficulties in applying health economic results, we visualise our results with health economic tools.We use four-state Markov modelling with a probabilistic cohort analysis to calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A one-year cycle length and a lifetime time horizon are applied. Best available evidence supplies the model with data on transition probabilities between glycaemic states, mortality risks, utility weights, and disease costs. The costs are calculated from a societal perspective. A 3% discount rate is used for costs and QALYs. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are presented to assist decision makers.The model indicates that diabetes prevention interventions have the potential to be cost-effective, but the outcome reveals a high level of uncertainty. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were negative for the intervention, ie, the intervention leads to a cost reduction for men and women aged 30 or 50 years at initiation of the intervention. For men and women aged 70 at initiation of the intervention, the ICER was EUR27,546/QALY gained and EUR19,433/QALY gained, respectively. In all cases, the QALYs gained were low. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that the higher the willingness-to-pay threshold value, the higher the probability that the intervention is cost-effective. Nonetheless, all curves are flat. The threshold value of EUR50,000/QALY gained has a 30-55% probability that the intervention is cost-effective.Lifestyle interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes are cost-saving for men and women aged 30 or 50 years at the start of the intervention, and cost-effective for men and women aged 70 years.

8687,Cost-effectiveness of the implantable HeartMate II left ventricular assist device for patients awaiting heart transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are being proposed as a life-saving therapeutic alternative to conventional medical management for people with end-stage heart failure awaiting transplantation. However, cost-effectiveness assessments of first-generation LVADs have not been encouraging. The cost-effectiveness of the enhanced second-generation LVAD HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) is estimated here. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was developed to extrapolate survival, utility, and resource use over the total lifetime of a hypothetic cohort of patients with end-stage heart failure under the 2 competing therapeutic strategies, using the most robust and recently published evidence about their performance. Cost data are based on UK activity to consider reimbursement in the UK National Health Service setting. RESULTS: HeartMate II had a mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of ?258,922 ($414,275). The sensitivity analysis showed that 2 factors mainly explain why HeartMate II is not a cost-effectiveness strategy as a bridge-to-transplant: (1) the survival of heart transplant candidates treated conventionally while on the waiting list has significantly improved in recent years, and (2) the high acquisition cost of the device, ?94,200 ($150,720). CONCLUSIONS: Although HeartMate II LVAD implantation significantly increases survival compared with conventional medical management, it does not provide good value for the money spent according to established thresholds of cost-effectiveness in the UK. HeartMate II is unlikely to become cost-effective unless the additional survival gained by its use raises and/or the device is given free of charge. Therefore, its implantation to transplant candidates lacks justification in terms of cost-effectiveness.",2011-01-08342,22115674,J Heart Lung Transplant,Santiago G Moreno,2011,/,,No,22115674,"Santiago G Moreno; Nicola Novielli; Nicola J Cooper; Cost-effectiveness of the implantable HeartMate II left ventricular assist device for patients awaiting heart transplantation, J Heart Lung Transplant, ; ():1053-2498",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Second-generation left ventricular assist device (LVAD) HeartMate II vs. Conventional therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,258922,United Kingdom,2011,477939.64
8688,An economic analysis of outcomes and complications of treating distal radius fractures in the elderly,"There is a lack of scientific data regarding which treatment provides the best outcome for distal radius fractures (DRFs) in the elderly. Currently, casting is used to treat the majority of these fractures, although open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) has been used increasingly in recent years. Given the recent emphasis on the wise use of medical resources, we conducted a cost-utility analysis to assess which of 4 common DRF treatments (casting, wire fixation, external fixation, or ORIF) optimizes the cost-to-patient preference ratio.We created a decision tree to model the process of choosing a DRF treatment and experiencing a final outcome. Fifty adults aged 65 and older were surveyed in a time trade-off, one-on-one interview to obtain utilities for DRF treatments and possible complications. We gathered Medicare reimbursement rates and calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio for each treatment.Participants rated DRF treatment relatively high, assigning utility values close to perfect health to all treatments. The ORIF was the most preferred treatment (utility, 0.96), followed by casting (utility, 0.94), wire fixation (utility, 0.94), and external fixation (utility, 0.93). The ORIF was the most expensive treatment (reimbursement, $3,516), whereas casting was the least expensive (reimbursement, $564). The incremental cost-utility ratio for ORIF, when compared to casting, was $15,330 per quality-adjusted life years, which is less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year, thereby indicating that, from the societal perspective, ORIF is considered a worthwhile alternative to casting.There is a slight preference for the faster return to minimally restricted activity provided by ORIF. Overall, patients show little preference for one DRF treatment over another.

8691,Does Age or Bilateral Disease Influence the Value of Hip Arthroplasty?,"BACKGROUND: Measuring value in medicine is an increasingly important issue as healthcare spending continues to rise and cost containment becomes even more important. However, value assessments can be affected by patient factors and comorbidities. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore quantified the approximate value of total hip arthroplasty and determined if patient age and Charnley classification affected the EuroQol5D (EQ5D) after hip arthroplasty. METHODS: Using charge data and an institutional joint registry, we evaluated 1442 patients after hip arthroplasty. Using the Charnley case-mix index to define bilateral disease and age of 65?years to distinguish between elderly and young patients, statistical comparisons were made among all groups. We obtained subspecialty physician charges and hospital charges. RESULTS: Patients with both unilateral and bilateral disease in both age groups had improved EQ5D scores after total hip arthroplasty, and the average change in scores was 0.27. There was no difference in the change in utility scores when patients older than 65?years of age were compared with patients younger than 65?years or when patients with unilateral disease were compared with those with bilateral disease. The average cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was $9773/QALY.

However, value assessments can be affected by patient factors and comorbidities. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore quantified the approximate value of total hip arthroplasty and determined if patient age and Charnley classification affected the EuroQol5D (EQ5D) after hip arthroplasty. METHODS: Using charge data and an institutional joint registry, we evaluated 1442 patients after hip arthroplasty. Using the Charnley case-mix index to define bilateral disease and age of 65?years to distinguish between elderly and young patients, statistical comparisons were made among all groups. We obtained subspecialty physician charges and hospital charges. RESULTS: Patients with both unilateral and bilateral disease in both age groups had improved EQ5D scores after total hip arthroplasty, and the average change in scores was 0.27. There was no difference in the change in utility scores when patients older than 65?years of age were compared with patients younger than 65?years or when patients with unilateral disease were compared with those with bilateral disease.

8698,Economic model of a birth cohort screening program for hepatitis C virus,"Recent research has identified high hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence among older US residents who contracted HCV decades ago and may no longer be recognized as high-risk. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening 100% of US residents born 1946-1970 over 5 years (birth-cohort screening) compared with current risk-based screening, by projecting costs and outcomes of screening over the remaining lifetime of this birth cohort. A Markov model of the natural history of HCV was developed using data synthesized from surveillance data, published literature, expert opinion, and other secondary sources. We assumed eligible patients were treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, with genotype 1 patients receiving a direct-acting antiviral in combination. The target population is US residents born 1946-1970 with no prior HCV diagnosis. Among the estimated 102 million (1.6 million chronically HCV-infected) eligible for screening, birth-cohort screening leads to 84,000 fewer cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 46,000 fewer cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 10,000 fewer liver transplants and 78,000 fewer HCV-related deaths. Birth-cohort screening led to higher overall costs than risk-based screening ($80.4 billion vs. $53.7 billion), but yielded lower costs related to advanced liver disease ($31.2 billion vs. $39.8 billion); birth-cohort screening produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $37,700 per quality-adjusted life-year gained versus risk-based screening. Sensitivity analyses showed that reducing the time horizon during which health and economic consequences are evaluated increases the ICER, whereas decreasing the treatment rates and efficacy increases the ICER. Model results were relatively insensitive to other inputs. CONCLUSION: Birth-cohort screening for HCV is likely to provide important health benefits by reducing lifetime cases of advanced liver disease and HCV-related deaths, and is cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds.

8699,Dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation: a NICE single technology appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of dronedarone (Multaq?, Sanofi-Aventis Limited, UK) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter, as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics, both at the University of York, were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions regarding the use of dronedarone within the UK NHS. The ERG review comprised a critique of the submitted evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of dronedarone. The ERG examined the search strategy used to obtain relevant evidence, the selection of studies included in the assessment, outcome measures chosen and statistical methods employed. The ERG also validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model and used it to explore the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results to key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness evidence supporting the use of dronedarone as a treatment for AF came from four randomized controlled trials. These trials were compared with a broader set of trials examining the effectiveness of other AADs for AF: amiodarone, sotalol and class 1c agents (flecainide and propafenone). The evidence suggested that all AADs decreased the recurrence of AF but dronedarone had the smallest effect. A mixed treatment comparison analysis of the trials showed that dronedarone was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality than other AADs, but this was highly uncertain. There was limited evidence to assess the effect of dronedarone on stroke, and no statistically significant differences between dronedarone and other AADs were found for treatment discontinuation. From the evidence presented by the manufacturer, dronedarone appeared highly cost effective in each of the population groups examined compared with using standard baseline therapy alone as first-line treatment, or compared with sotalol or amiodarone as first-line AAD, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) well below ?20,000 per QALY gained. The ICER for dronedarone relative to class 1c agents was around ?19,000 per QALY. Although the evidence presented by the manufacturer indicated that dronedarone was cost effective, the estimates of treatment effect relative to other AADs and safety in the longer term were highly uncertain. The NICE Appraisal Committee in its preliminary guidance did not recommend the use of dronedarone for AF. However, following the response from a large number of consultees and commentators, NICE revised its preliminary guidance to allow the use of the drug in a specific subgroup of AF patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors.",2011-01-08368,22136303,Pharmacoeconomics,Claire McKenna,2011,30 /,35-46,Yes,22136303,"Claire McKenna; Emma Maund; Muhammad Sarowar; David Fox; Matt Stevenson; Chris Pepper; Nerys Woolacott; Stephen Palmer; Dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation: a NICE single technology appraisal, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 30 ():1179-2027; 35-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dronedarone + standard baseline first-line therapy of beta-blockers and anticoagulation vs. Standard baseline first-line therapy of beta-blockers and anticoagulation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,3620,United Kingdom,2008,8069.81
