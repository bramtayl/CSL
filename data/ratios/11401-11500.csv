11401,Cost-effectiveness of universal and platelet reactivity assay-driven antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome,"Assays monitoring P2Y12 platelet reactivity can accurately predict which patients will have a poor response to clopidogrel. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of using platelet reactivity assays (PRAs) to select a dual-antiplatelet regimen for patients with acute coronary syndrome. A hybrid decision tree Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of universal clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel (given to all patients) or PRA-driven ticagrelor or prasugrel (given to patients with high platelet reactivity, defined as >230 on the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay; the others received generic clopidogrel). We assumed a cohort of 65-year-old patients with acute coronary syndrome and an incidence of high platelet reactivity of 32% and 13% at ~24 to 48 hours after revascularization and 1 month, respectively. The 5-year costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for PRA-driven ticagrelor and prasugrel compared with universal clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel. PRA-driven ticagrelor and prasugrel were cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $40,100 and $49,143/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively); however, universal ticagrelor and prasugrel were not (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $61,651 and $96,261/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively). Monte Carlo simulation suggested PRA-driven ticagrelor, PRA-driven prasugrel, universal ticagrelor, and universal prasugrel would have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year in 52%, 40%, 23%, and 2% of the iterations compared with universal clopidogrel, respectively. Universal ticagrelor and prasugrel were not cost-effective compared with their respective PRA-driven regimens (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $68,182; $116,875/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively). Monte Carlo simulation suggested universal ticagrelor and prasugrel would have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year in 26% and 4% of iterations compared with their respective PRA-driven regimens. The results were most sensitive to differences in agent costs and drug-specific relative risks of death. In conclusion, even with generic clopidogrel, PRA-driven selection of antiplatelet therapy appeared to be a cost-effective strategy with the potential to decrease the overall acute coronary syndrome-associated healthcare costs.",2013-01-11292,23631863,Am J Cardiol,Craig I Coleman,2013,112 / 3,355-62,No,23631863,"Craig I Coleman; Brendan L Limone; Cost-effectiveness of universal and platelet reactivity assay-driven antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome, Am J Cardiol, ; 112(3):0002-9149; 355-62",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal ticagrelor vs. Platelet Reactivity Assay (PRA)-driven ticagrelor,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,68182,United States,2011,78449.05

11403,Cost-effectiveness of a coronary heart disease secondary prevention program in patients with myocardial infarction: results from a randomised controlled trial (ProActive Heart),"BACKGROUND: Participation in coronary heart disease (CHD) secondary prevention programs is low. Telephone-delivered CHD secondary prevention programs may overcome the treatment gap. The telephone-based health coaching ProActive Heart trial intervention has previously been shown to be effective for improving health-related quality of life, physical activity, body mass index, diet, alcohol intake and anxiety. As a secondary aim, the current study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the ProActive Heart intervention compared to usual care. METHODS: 430 adult myocardial infarction patients were randomised to a six-month CHD secondary prevention ''health coaching'' intervention or ''usual care'' control group. Primary outcome variables were health-related quality of life (SF-36) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey). Data were collected at baseline, six-months (post-intervention) and 12 months (six-months post-intervention completion) for longer term effects. Cost-effectiveness data [health utility (SF-6D) and health care utilisation] were collected using self-reported (general practitioner, specialist, other health professionals, health services, and medication) and claims data (hospitalisation rates). Intervention effects are presented as mean differences (95% CI), p-value. RESULTS: Improvements in health status (SF-6D) were observed in both groups, with no significant difference between the groups at six [0.012 (-0.016, 0.041), p = 0.372] or 12 months [0.011 (-0.028, 0.051) p = 0.738]. Patients in the health coaching group were significantly more likely to be admitted to hospital due to causes unrelated to cardiovascular disease (p = 0.042). The overall cost for the health coaching group was higher ($10,574 vs. $8,534, p = 0.021), mainly due to higher hospitalisation (both CHD and non-CHD) costs ($6,841 vs. $4,984, p = 0.036). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $85,423 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention effect measured using the SF-36/SF-6D and ProActive Heart resulted in significantly increased costs. The cost per QALY gained from ProActive Heart was high and above acceptable limits compared to usual care.",2013-01-11298,23634982,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,Erika Turkstra,2013,13 /,33,No,23634982,"Erika Turkstra; Anna L Hawkes; Brian Oldenburg; Paul A Scuffham; Cost-effectiveness of a coronary heart disease secondary prevention program in patients with myocardial infarction: results from a randomised controlled trial (ProActive Heart), BMC Cardiovasc Disord, ; 13():1471-2261; 33",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Health coaching (HC) intervention: telephone-based health coaching to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,170000,Australia,2008,174456.3
11404,Bariatric surgery for the treatment of severely obese patients in South Korea--is it cost effective?,"BACKGROUND: In South Korea, the number of severely obese patients has increased. An economic study comparing bariatric surgery with nonsurgical interventions has not been published for Asia. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate the cost effectiveness of bariatric surgery as compared to nonsurgical interventions for severe obese Korean people. METHODS: We used the Markov model to compare the lifetime expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between bariatric surgery and nonsurgical interventions from Korean Healthcare system perspectives. Our target cohort consisted of severe obese people defined as having a body mass index of 30-<40 kg/m(2) in South Korea. The starting age of the cohort was 30 years old, and the cycle length was 1 year. Nonsurgical interventions included a physician visit, exercise, diet, and pharmacotherapy. A discount of 5 % was applied in cost and QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of bariatric surgery compared to nonsurgery interventions was calculated. RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis study indicated that bariatric surgery had US$1,522 incremental costs and 0.86 incremental QALYs as compared to nonsurgical interventions. Through the base case analysis, ICER was US$1,771/QALY. The sensitivity analyses were performed using a variety of assumptions, and the robustness of the study results was also demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that bariatric surgery was a cost-effective alternative to nonsurgical interventions over a lifetime, providing substantial lifetime benefits for severely obese Korean people.",2013-01-11304,23636995,Obes Surg,Hyun Jin Song,2013,23 / 12,,No,23636995,"Hyun Jin Song; Jin Won Kwon; Yong Jin Kim; Sung-Hee Oh; Yoonseok Heo; Sang-Moon Han; Bariatric surgery for the treatment of severely obese patients in South Korea--is it cost effective?, Obes Surg, 2013 Dec; 23(12):0960-8923",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bariatric surgery vs. Nonsurgical intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,30 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,1771,United States,2011,2037.68
11405,Cost-effectiveness of various interventions for newly diagnosed diabetic macular edema,"OBJECTIVE: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies have revolutionized the treatment of clinically significant diabetic macular edema (CSDME); yet these agents are expensive, and whether they are cost-effective is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the most cost-effective treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed CSDME: focal laser photocoagulation alone (L), focal laser plus intravitreal ranibizumab (L+R), focal laser plus intravitreal bevacizumab (L+B), or focal laser plus intravitreal triamcinolone (L+T) injections. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of 57-year-old patients with newly diagnosed CSDME. METHODS: By using a Markov model with a 25-year time horizon, we compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of treating patients with newly diagnosed CSDME using L, L+R, L+B, or L+T. Data came from the DRCRnet randomized controlled trial, the Medicare fee schedule, and the medical literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental costs per QALY gained. RESULTS: Compared with L, the incremental cost-effectiveness of L+R and L+B was $89903/QALY and $11138/QALY, respectively. L+T was dominated by L. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that, at a willingness to pay (WTP) of $50000/QALY, L was approximately 70% likely to be the preferred therapy over L+R and L+T. However, at a WTP of $100000/QALY, more than 90% of the time, L+R therapy was the preferred therapy compared with L and L+T. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, L+B was found to be the preferred therapy over L and L+T for any WTP value >$10000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the annual risk of cerebrovascular accident would have to be at least 1.5% higher with L+B than with L+R for L+R to be the preferred treatment. In another sensitivity analysis, if patients require <8 injections per year over the remainder of the 25-year time horizon, L+B would cost <$100000/QALY, whereas L+R would be cost-effective at a WTP of $100000/QALY if patients require fewer than 0.45 injections per year after year 2. CONCLUSIONS: With bevacizumab and ranibizumab assumed to have equivalent effectiveness and similar safety profiles when used in the management of CSDME, bevacizumab therapy confers the greatest value among the different treatment options for CSDME.

11410,The cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylaxis of headache in adults with chronic migraine in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Although chronic migraine is associated with substantial disability and costs, few treatments have been shown to be effective. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA) is the first treatment to be licensed in the UK for the prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA in this indication in the UK. METHODS: A state-transition (Markov) model was developed comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to placebo. Efficacy data and utility values were taken from the pooled Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) clinical trials program (n = 1384). Estimates of resource utilisation were taken from the International Burden of Migraine Study (IBMS), and stopping rules were informed by published medical guidelines and clinical data. This study estimated 2-year discounted costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the UK National Health Service perspective. RESULTS: At 2 years, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA was associated with an increase in costs of pound1367 and an increase in QALYs of 0.1 compared to placebo, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound15,028. Treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA reduced headache days by an estimated 38 days per year at a cost of pound18 per headache day avoided. Sensitivity analysis showed that utility values had the greatest influence on model results. The ICER remained cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of pound20,000- pound30,000/QALY in the majority of scenario analyses as well as in probabilistic sensitivity analysis, where onabotulinumtoxinA was cost-effective on 96% of occasions at a threshold of pound20,000/QALY and 98% of occasions at pound30,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: OnabotulinumtoxinA has been shown to reduce the frequency of headaches in patients with chronic migraine and can be considered a cost-effective use of resources in the UK National Health Service.

11411,Modelling the benefits of early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer using a biomarker signature,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival of 3-4%. This is mainly due to late diagnosis because of diffuse symptoms, where 80-85% of the patients are inoperable. Consequently, early diagnosis would be of significant benefit, resulting in a potential 5-year survival of 30-40%. However, new technologies must be carefully evaluated concerning effectiveness and healthcare costs. We have developed a framework for modelling cost and health effects from early detection of PC, which for the first time allowed us to analyse its cost-effectiveness. A probabilistic cohort model for estimating costs and quality adjusted life-years (QALY) arising from screening for PC, compared to a ""wait-and-see""-approach, was designed. The test accuracy, Swedish survival and costs by tumour stage, expected life gain from early detection and pretest probabilities in risk groups, were retrieved from previous investigations. In a cohort of newly diagnosed diabetic patient (incidence 0.71%) the incremental cost per QALY gained (ICER) was euro13,500, which is considered cost-effective in Europe. Results were mainly sensitive to the incidence with the ICER ranging from euro315 to euro204,000 (familial PC 35% and general population 0.046%, respectively). This is the first study focusing on clinical implementation of advanced testing and what is required for novel technologies in cancer care to be cost-effective. The model clearly demonstrated the potential of multiplexed proteomic-testing of PC and also identified the requirements for test accuracy. Consequently, it can serve as a model for assessing the possibilities to introduce advanced test platforms also for other cancer indications.",2013-01-11325,23649606,Int J Cancer,Ola Ghatnekar,2013,133 / 10,,No,23649606,"Ola Ghatnekar; Roland Andersson; Marianne Svensson; Ulf Persson; Ulrika Ringdahl; Paula Zeilon; Carl A K Borrebaeck; Modelling the benefits of early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer using a biomarker signature, Int J Cancer, 2013 Nov 15; 133(10):0020-7136",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for pancreatic cancer vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,13466,Euro,2011,21560.76
11412,Primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease with penicillin in South African children with pharyngitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Acute rheumatic fever and subsequent rheumatic heart disease remain significant in developing countries. We describe a cost-effective analysis of 7 strategies for the primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in children presenting with pharyngitis in urban primary care clinics in South Africa. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment with intramuscular penicillin using each of the following strategies: (1) empirical (treat all); (2) positive throat culture (culture all); (3) clinical decision rule (CDR) score >/=2 (CDR 2+); (4) CDR score >/=3 (CDR 3+); (5) treating those with a CDR score >/=2 plus those with CDR score <2 and positive cultures (CDR 2+, culture CDR negatives); (6) treating those with a CDR score >/=3 plus those with CDR score <3 and positive cultures (CDR 3+, culture CDR negatives); and (7) treat none. The strategies ranked in order from lowest cost were treat all ($11.19 per child), CDR 2+ ($11.20); the CDR 3+ ($13.00); CDR 2+, culture CDR negatives ($16.42); CDR 3+, culture CDR negatives ($23.89); and culture all ($27.21). The CDR 2+ is the preferred strategy at less than $150/quality-adjusted life year compared with the treat all strategy. A strategy of culturing all children compared with the CDR 2+ strategy costs more than $125 000/quality-adjusted life year gained.

The objective of this study was to examine the real-world cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines (FL) versus FL-only as adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life-years from a hospital perspective. The effectiveness of the oxaliplatin arm was modelled by combining published efficacy data from the pivotal clinical registration trial (MOSAIC trial) with real-world (RW) data from a Dutch population-based observational study. RW patients were categorised into ""eligible"" or ""ineligible"", depending on whether the patients fulfilled the MOSAIC trial eligibility criteria. Ineligible RW patients (18 %) had a poorer prognosis than eligible RW patients (82 %) and MOSAIC trial patients. The effectiveness of the comparator was modelled using MOSAIC trial results. All cost inputs were based on RW patients and reported in Euro 2012. Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed for four different scenarios: (1) cost-effectiveness analyses based on MOSAIC trial patients; (2) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and eligible RW patients; (3) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and both eligible and ineligible RW patients, assuming oxaliplatin had an equal effect in ineligible and eligible patients; (4) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and both eligible and ineligible RW patients, assuming oxaliplatin had no effect amongst ineligibles. For each scenario, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: MOSAIC trial patients and eligible RW patients treated with oxaliplatin had comparable 2-year disease-free survivals (79.5 vs. 78.4 %). Oxaliplatin showed an incremental QALY gain of 1.02, 1.13, 1.17 and 0.93 and incremental cost of <euro>9,961, <euro>11,055, <euro>9,814 and <euro>11,854 in scenarios 1-4, respectively.

Ineligible RW patients (18 %) had a poorer prognosis than eligible RW patients (82 %) and MOSAIC trial patients. The effectiveness of the comparator was modelled using MOSAIC trial results. All cost inputs were based on RW patients and reported in Euro 2012. Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed for four different scenarios: (1) cost-effectiveness analyses based on MOSAIC trial patients; (2) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and eligible RW patients; (3) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and both eligible and ineligible RW patients, assuming oxaliplatin had an equal effect in ineligible and eligible patients; (4) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and both eligible and ineligible RW patients, assuming oxaliplatin had no effect amongst ineligibles. For each scenario, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: MOSAIC trial patients and eligible RW patients treated with oxaliplatin had comparable 2-year disease-free survivals (79.5 vs. 78.4 %). Oxaliplatin showed an incremental QALY gain of 1.02, 1.13, 1.17 and 0.93 and incremental cost of <euro>9,961, <euro>11,055, <euro>9,814 and <euro>11,854 in scenarios 1-4, respectively. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were <euro>9,766, <euro>9,783, <euro>8,388 and <euro>12,746 in scenarios 1-4, respectively. In all scenarios, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICERs are acceptable and robust under a wide range of model assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: The ICERs of the different scenarios that resulted from combining MOSAIC trial data with data from Dutch daily practice all suggest that FL + oxaliplatin is cost-effective versus FL alone in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer.

11422,The cost-effectiveness of exenatide once weekly compared with exenatide twice daily and insulin glargine for the treatment of patients with type two diabetes and body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2) in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of exenatide once weekly (EQW) for the treatment of type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Spain. EQW was compared against exenatide twice daily (EBID) and insulin glargine (IG). METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes for patients with T2DM treated with EQW, EBID, and IG. Treatment effects and patient baseline characteristics were taken from the DURATION 3 and pooled DURATION 1 and 5 studies, in the comparison against IG and EBID, respectively. Unit costs and health state utility values were derived from published sources. To reflect diabetes progression, patients started on EQW or EBID, switching to insulin glargine after 3 years. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service over a time horizon of 35 years with costs and outcomes discounted at 3%. The base case included patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m(2), which is in line with current prescription restrictions in Spain. Uncertainty was addressed through extensive one-way sensitivity analyses around key model parameters and a comprehensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: When compared with EBID, EQW was the dominant strategy, i.e., less costly and more effective. When compared to IG, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at euro12,084 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the model projections were robust to the various scenarios tested. LIMITATIONS: Primary limitations of the analysis are common to other T2DM analyses and include the extrapolation of short-term clinical data to the 35 year time horizon and uncertainty around optimum treatment durations. CONCLUSION: The analyses indicate that EQW is a cost-effective option for the treatment of T2DM patients in Spain for patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m(2) considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000 per QALY gained.",2013-01-11335,23659201,J Med Econ,Tiago Fonseca,2013,16 / 7,926-38,Yes,23659201,"Tiago Fonseca; John Clegg; Giuseppe Caputo; Kirsi Norrbacka; Tatiana Dilla; Maria Alvarez; The cost-effectiveness of exenatide once weekly compared with exenatide twice daily and insulin glargine for the treatment of patients with type two diabetes and body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2) in Spain, J Med Econ, ; 16(7):1369-6998; 926-38",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exenatide once weekly vs. Insulin glargine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,12084,Euro,2012,17515.86

11424,Cost effectiveness of the NHS breast screening programme: life table model,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the overall cost effectiveness of the NHS breast screening programme, based on findings of the Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening and taking into account the uncertainty of associated estimates of benefits, harms, and costs. DESIGN: A life table model comparing data from two cohorts. SETTING: United Kingdom''s health service. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: 364,500 women aged 50 years-the population of 50 year old women in England and Wales who would be eligible for screening-were followed up for 35 years without screening, compared with a similar cohort who had regular mammographic screening between ages 50 and 70 years and were then followed for another 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Between the cohorts, we compared the number of breast cancer diagnoses, number of deaths from breast cancer, number of deaths from other causes, person years of survival adjusted for health quality, and person years of survival with breast cancer. We also calculated the costs of treating primary and end stage breast cancer, and the costs of screening. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis explored the effect of uncertainty in key input parameters on the model outputs. RESULTS: Under the base case scenario (using input parameters derived from the Independent Panel Review), there were 1521 fewer deaths from breast cancer and 2722 overdiagnosed breast cancers. Discounting future costs and benefits at a rate of 3.5% resulted in an additional 6907 person years of survival in the screened cohort, at a cost of 40,946 additional years of survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Screening was associated with 2040 additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at an additional cost of pound42.5m (euro49.8m; $64.7m) in total or pound20,800 per QALY gained. The gain in person time survival over 35 years was 9.2 days per person and 2.7 quality adjusted days per person screened. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that this incremental cost effectiveness ratio varied widely across a range of plausible scenarios. Screening was cost effective at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained in 2260 (45%) scenarios, but in 588 (12%) scenarios, screening was associated with a reduction in QALYs. CONCLUSION: The NHS breast screening programme is only moderately likely to be cost effective at a standard threshold. However, there is substantial uncertainty in the model parameter estimates, and further primary research will be needed for cost effectiveness studies to provide definitive data to inform policy.",2013-01-11338,23661112,BMJ,Paul D P Pharoah,2013,346 /,f2618,No,23661112,"Paul D P Pharoah; Bernadette Sewell; Deborah Fitzsimmons; Hayley S Bennett; Nora Pashayan; Cost effectiveness of the NHS breast screening programme: life table model, BMJ, ; 346():0959-8138; f2618",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Breast screening mammography vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,Female,Full,35 Years,3.50,3.50,20800,United Kingdom,2011,38394.36

To conduct an economic evaluation comparing agomelatine with other commonly used alternatives for treating patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in Greece. METHODS: An existing international Markov model designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of agomelatine was adapted to the Greek setting. It reflects six different health states, in which patients may move on a monthly basis. The analysis was undertaken from a societal perspective. Transition probabilities, utilities and costs assigned to each health state were extracted from the published literature, government sources and expert opinion. Data reflects the year 2012 and was discounted using a rate of 3.5%. Probabilistic analysis was undertaken to deal with uncertainty. RESULTS: Base case analyses revealed that agomelatine is a dominant therapy for MDD relative to escitalopram, fluoxetine and sertraline, and it appeared to be cost-effective compared to venlafaxine (ICER: euro547/QALY).

Agomelatine remained a dominant treatment against generic sertraline and fluoxetine, and it appeared to be a cost-effective alternative compared to generic venlafaxine and escitalopram (ICER: euro1,446/QALY and euro3,303/QALY, respectively). Excluding the indirect cost from the analysis, agomelatine remained a cost-effective alternative over all comparators. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis agomelatine was dominant in 44.5%, 89.6%, 70.6% and 84.6% of simulated samples against branded venlafaxine, escitalopram, fluoxetine and sertraline, respectively.

11433,Clinical and cost-effectiveness of absorbent dressings in the treatment of highly exuding VLUs,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of using a sodium carboxymethylcellulose dressing (CMC [Aquacel]) and four super absorbent dressings (DryMax Extra[DM], Flivasorb [F], Kerramax [K] and sachet S [S]) in the treatment of highly exuding chronic venous leg ulcers (VLUs) in the UK, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). METHOD: A decision model was constructed depicting the patient pathways and associated management of a cohort of 439 patients with highly exuding chronic VLUs of;;: 3 months of age. The model was based on the case records of a cohort of matched patients from The Health Improvement Network (THIN)database (a nationally representative database of patients registered with general practitioners (GPs) in the UK) who were treated with one of the five dressings. The model estimated the costs and outcomes of patient management over 6 months and the relative cost-effectiveness of using each dressing. RESULTS: Patients'' mean age was 73.1 years, and 46% were female. Between 39% and 56% ofVLUs healed by 6 months. CMC-treated wounds that remained unhealed increased in size by 43% over the study period, whereas unhealed wounds treated with the other dressings decreased in size by a mean 34%. Consequently, CMC was excluded from the cost-effectiveness analysis.

11436,Cost-utility analysis of radical nephrectomy versus partial nephrectomy in the management of small renal masses: Adjusting for the burden of ensuing chronic kidney disease,"OBJECTIVES: We compare the cost-utility of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN), laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) and open partial nephrectomy (OPN) in the management of small renal masses (SRMs) when the impact of ensuing chronic kidney disease (CKD) disease is considered. METHODS: We designed a Markov decision analysis model with a 10-year time horizon. Estimates of costs, utilities, complication rates and probabilities of developing CKD were derived from the literature. The base case patient was assumed to be a 65-year-old patient with a <4-cm unilateral renal mass, a normal contralateral kidney and a normal preoperative serum creatinine. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to address the uncertainty associated with the study parameters. RESULTS: OPN was the least costly strategy at $25 941 USD and generated 7.161 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 10 years. LPN yielded 0.098 additional QALYs at an additional cost of $888 for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $9057 per QALY, well below a commonly cited willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY. LRN was more costly and yielded fewer QALYs than OPN and LPN. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated our model to be robust to changes to key parameters. Age had no effect on preferred strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Partial nephrectomy (PN) is the preferred treatment strategy for SRMs. In centres where LPN is not available, OPN remains considerably more cost-effective than LRN.

11438,Placing a price on medical device innovation: the example of total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is common, effective, and cost-effective. Innovative implants promising reduced long-term failure at increased cost are under continual development. We sought to define the implant cost and performance thresholds under which innovative TKA implants are cost-effective. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a validated, published computer simulation model of knee osteoarthritis. Model inputs were derived using published literature, Medicare claims, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We compared projected TKA implant survival, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), lifetime costs, and cost-effectiveness (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios or ICERs) of standard versus innovative TKA implants. We assumed innovative implants offered 5-70% decreased long-term TKA failure rates at costs 20-400% increased above standard implants. We examined the impact of patient age, comorbidity, and potential increases in short-term failure on innovative implant cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Implants offering >/=50% decrease in long-term TKA failure at </=50% increased cost offered ICERs <$100,000 regardless of age or baseline comorbidity. An implant offering a 20% decrease in long-term failure at 50% increased cost provided ICERs <$150,000 per QALY gained only among healthy 50-59-year-olds. Increasing short-term failure, consistent with recent device failures, reduced cost-effectiveness across all groups. Increasing the baseline likelihood of long-term TKA failure among younger, healthier and more active individuals further enhanced innovative implant cost-effectiveness among younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative implants must decrease actual TKA failure, not just radiographic wear, by 50-55% or more over standard implants to be broadly cost-effective. Comorbidity and remaining life span significantly affect innovative implant cost-effectiveness and should be considered in the development, approval and implementation of novel technologies, particularly in orthopedics.

11441,The role of noninvasive prenatal testing as a diagnostic versus a screening tool--a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: As the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) that uses cell-free fetal DNA in maternal serum to identify Down syndrome (DS) in utero improves, NIPT could be considered a diagnostic test, thus avoiding the complications of chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of NIPT as a diagnostic versus a screening tool. METHOD: A decision-analytic model compared NIPT as a diagnostic tool (NIPT Dx) that did not require a confirmatory amniocentesis versus NIPT used for screening (NIPT Scr) that allowed a confirmatory amniocentesis for screen positive results. Baseline case, univariate, and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For a high-risk population, NIPT Dx would result in three more DS babies born and 2432 more elective terminations compared with NIPT Scr. Furthermore, there would be many more terminations of fetuses without DS with NIPT Dx (2424) than procedure-related losses associated with NIPT Scr (29). NIPT Scr is more expensive but cost-effective at $7687 per quality-associated life year (QALY), less than the standard cost-effectiveness limit of $100 000/QALY.

11442,Effect of including cancer mortality on the cost-effectiveness of aspirin for primary prevention in men,"BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that aspirin may be effective for reducing cancer mortality. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether including a cancer mortality-reducing effect influences which men would benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. DESIGN: We modified our existing Markov model that examines the effects of aspirin among middle-aged men with no previous history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. For our base case scenario of 45-year-old men, we examined costs and life-years for men taking aspirin for 10 years compared with men who were not taking aspirin over those 10 years; after 10 years, we equalized treatment and followed the cohort until death. We compared our results depending on whether or not we included a 22 % relative reduction in cancer mortality, based on a recent meta-analysis. We discounted costs and benefits at 3 % and employed a third party payer perspective. MAIN MEASURE: Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. KEY RESULTS: When no effect on cancer mortality was included, aspirin had a cost per QALY gained of $22,492 at 5 % 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk; at 2.5 % risk or below, no treatment was favored. When we included a reduction in cancer mortality, aspirin became cost-effective for men at 2.5 % risk as well (cost per QALY, $43,342). Results were somewhat sensitive to utility of taking aspirin daily; risk of death after myocardial infarction; and effects of aspirin on stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. However, aspirin remained cost-saving or cost-effective (< $50,000 per QALY) in probabilistic analyses (59 % with no cancer effect included; 96 % with cancer effect) for men at 5 % risk. CONCLUSIONS: Including an effect of aspirin on cancer mortality influences the threshold for prescribing aspirin for primary prevention in men.

11443,"A decision impact, decision conflict and economic assessment of routine Oncotype DX testing of 146 women with node-negative or pNImi, ER-positive breast cancer in the U.K","BACKGROUND: Tumour gene expression analysis is useful in predicting adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in early breast cancer patients. This study aims to examine the implications of routine Oncotype DX testing in the U.K. METHODS: Women with oestrogen receptor positive (ER+), pNO or pN1mi breast cancer were assessed for adjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently offered Oncotype DX testing, with changes in chemotherapy decisions recorded. A subset of patients completed questionnaires about their uncertainties regarding chemotherapy decisions pre- and post-testing. All patients were asked to complete a diary of medical interactions over the next 6 months, from which economic data were extracted to model the cost-effectiveness of testing. RESULTS: Oncotype DX testing resulted in changes in chemotherapy decisions in 38 of 142 (26.8%) women, with 26 of 57 (45.6%) spared chemotherapy and 12 of 85 (14.1%) requiring chemotherapy when not initially recommended (9.9% reduction overall). Decision conflict analysis showed that Oncotype DX testing increased patients'' confidence in treatment decision making. Economic analysis showed that routine Oncotype DX testing costs pound6232 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

11444,A pragmatic parallel arm multi-centre randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a group-based fatigue management programme (FACETS) for people with multiple sclerosis,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and troubling symptom for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a six-session group-based programme for managing MS-fatigue (Fatigue: Applying Cognitive behavioural and Energy effectiveness Techniques to lifeStyle (FACETS)). METHODS: Three-centre parallel arm randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation. Patients with MS and significant fatigue were randomised to FACETS plus current local practice (FACETS) or current local practice alone (CLP), using concealed computer-generated randomisation. Participant blinding was not possible. Primary outcomes were fatigue severity (Fatigue Assessment Instrument), self-efficacy (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy) and disease-specific quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29)) at 1 and 4 months postintervention (follow-up 1 and 2). Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated (EuroQoL 5-Dimensions questionnaire and the Short-form 6-Dimensions questionnaire). RESULTS: Between May 2008 and November 2009, 164 patients were randomised; primary outcome data were available for 146 (89%). Statistically significant differences favour the intervention group on fatigue self-efficacy at follow-up 1 (mean difference (MD) 9, 95% CI (4 to 14), standardised effect size (SES) 0.54, p=0.001) and follow-up 2 (MD 6, 95% CI (0 to 12), SES 0.36, p=0.05) and fatigue severity at follow-up 2 (MD -0.36, 95% CI (-0.63 to -0.08), SES -0.35, p=0.01) but no differences for MSIS-29 or QALYs. No adverse events reported. Estimated cost per person for FACETS is pound453; findings suggest an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound2157 per additional person with a clinically significant improvement in fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: FACETS is effective in reducing fatigue severity and increasing fatigue self-efficacy. However, it is difficult to assess the additional cost in terms of cost-effectiveness (ie, cost per QALY) as improvements in fatigue are not reflected in the QALY outcomes, with no significant differences between FACETS and CLP. The strengths of this trial are its pragmatic nature and high external validity.

11445,The cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at high operative risk,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in a high-risk aortic stenosis (AS) population. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis employing the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) reference case design for technology appraisals. SETTING: The perspective of the UK National Health Service. PATIENTS: Utility data from a UK high-risk AS population. TAVI and SAVR effectiveness was taken from the PARTNER A randomised controlled trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs modelled over a 10 year horizon using a Markov model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were calculated with reference to the NICE willingness to pay per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gain threshold. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses performed. RESULTS: Despite greater procedural costs ( pound16 500 vs pound9,256), TAVI was cost-effective compared with SAVR over the 10 year model horizon (costs pound52 593 vs pound53 943 and QALYs 2.81 vs 2.75), indicating that TAVI dominated SAVR. This appeared to be due to greater postsurgical costs, related to the length and cost of hospital stay. The results appeared robust to a number of deterministic sensitivity and probabilistic analyses. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that at the NICE pound20 000 willingness to pay threshold per QALY gained, TAVI had a 64.6% likelihood of being cost-effective, compared with 35.4% for SAVR. CONCLUSIONS: TAVI is likely to be a cost-effective treatment for high-risk patients with AS compared with the reference standard of SAVR. However, uncertainty surrounding the long-term outcomes for TAVI patients remains; this could have a substantive impact on estimates of cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-11386,23696198,Heart,Timothy A Fairbairn,2013,99 / 13,914-20,No,23696198,"Timothy A Fairbairn; David M Meads; Claire Hulme; Adam N Mather; Sven Plein; Daniel J Blackman; John P Greenwood; The cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at high operative risk, Heart, ; 99(13):1468-201X; 914-20",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation vs. surgical aortic valve replacement,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-22500,United Kingdom,2011,-41532.36

Cost utility analysis studies of epidural injections for managing chronic low back pain demonstrated highly variable results including a lack of cost utility in randomized trials and contrasting results in observational studies. There has not been any cost utility analysis studies of epidural injections in large randomized trials performed in interventional pain management settings. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost utility of caudal epidural injections in managing chronic low back pain secondary to lumbar disc herniation, axial or discogenic low back pain, lumbar central spinal stenosis, and lumbar post surgery syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: This analysis is based on 4 previously published randomized trials. SETTING: A private, specialty referral interventional pain management center in the United States. METHODS: Four randomized trials were conducted assessing the clinical effectiveness of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids for lumbar disc herniation, lumbar discogenic or axial low back pain, lumbar central spinal stenosis, and post surgery syndrome. A cost utility analysis was performed with direct payment data for a total of 480 patients over a period of 2 years from these 4 trials. Outcome included various measures with significant improvement defined as at least a 50% improvement in pain reduction and disability status. RESULTS: The results of 4 randomized controlled trials of low back pain with 480 patients with a 2 year follow-up with the actual reimbursement data showed cost utility for one year of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of $2,206 for disc herniation, $2,136 for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, $2,155 for central spinal stenosis, and $2,191 for post surgery syndrome. All patients showed significant improvement clinically and showed positive results in the cost utility analysis with an average cost per one year QALY of $2,172.50 for all patients and $1,966.03 for patients judged to be successful.

11454,Is fidaxomicin worth the cost? An economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration approved fidaxomicin for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has been found to be noninferior to vancomycin; however, its cost-effectiveness for the treatment of CDI remains undetermined. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic simulation model to determine the economic value of fidaxomicin for CDI treatment from the third-party payer perspective. We looked at CDI treatment in these 3 cases: (1) no fidaxomicin, (2) only fidaxomicin, and (3) fidaxomicin based on strain typing results. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for fidaxomicin based on screening given current conditions was >$43.7 million per quality-adjusted life-year and using only fidaxomicin was dominated (ie, more costly and less effective) by the other 2 treatment strategies explored. The fidaxomicin strategy tended to remain dominated, even at lower costs. With approximately 50% of CDI due to the NAP1/BI/027 strain, a course of fidaxomicin would need to cost </=$150 to be cost-effective in the treatment of all CDI cases and between $160 and $400 to be cost-effective for those with a non-NAP1/BI/027 strain (ie, treatment based on strain typing).

11455,Is fidaxomicin worth the cost? An economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration approved fidaxomicin for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has been found to be noninferior to vancomycin; however, its cost-effectiveness for the treatment of CDI remains undetermined. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic simulation model to determine the economic value of fidaxomicin for CDI treatment from the third-party payer perspective. We looked at CDI treatment in these 3 cases: (1) no fidaxomicin, (2) only fidaxomicin, and (3) fidaxomicin based on strain typing results. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for fidaxomicin based on screening given current conditions was >$43.7 million per quality-adjusted life-year and using only fidaxomicin was dominated (ie, more costly and less effective) by the other 2 treatment strategies explored. The fidaxomicin strategy tended to remain dominated, even at lower costs. With approximately 50% of CDI due to the NAP1/BI/027 strain, a course of fidaxomicin would need to cost </=$150 to be cost-effective in the treatment of all CDI cases and between $160 and $400 to be cost-effective for those with a non-NAP1/BI/027 strain (ie, treatment based on strain typing).

11457,Cost-effectiveness of adherence therapy versus health education for people with schizophrenia: randomised controlled trial in four European countries,"BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to anti-psychotics is common, expensive and affects recovery. We therefore examine the cost-effectiveness of adherence therapy for people with schizophrenia by multi-centre randomised trial in Amsterdam, London, Leipzig and Verona. METHODS: Participants received 8 sessions of adherence therapy or health education. We measured lost productivity and use of health/social care, criminal justice system and informal care at baseline and one year to estimate and compare mean total costs from health/social care and societal perspectives. Outcomes were the Short Form 36 (SF-36) mental component score (MCS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained (SF-36 and EuroQoL 5 dimension (EQ5D)). Cost-effectiveness was examined for all cost and outcome combinations using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). RESULTS: 409 participants were recruited. There were no cost or outcome differences between adherence therapy and health education. The probability of adherence therapy being cost-effective compared to health education was between 0.3 and 0.6 for the six cost-outcome combinations at the willingness to pay thresholds we examined. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence therapy appears equivalent to health education. It is unclear whether it would have performed differently against a treatment as usual control, whether such an intervention can impact on quality of life in the short-term, or whether it is likely to be cost-effective in some sites but not others.

11458,Cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immunization in Indonesia: taking breastfeeding patterns into account,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immunization in Indonesia, taking breastfeeding patterns explicitly into account. METHOD: An age-structured cohort model was developed for the 2011 Indonesia birth cohort. Next, we compared two strategies, the current situation without rotavirus immunization versus the alternative of a national immunization program. The model applies a 5 year time horizon, with 1 monthly analytical cycles for children less than 1 year of age and annually thereafter. Three scenarios were compared to the base case reflecting the actual distribution over the different breastfeeding modes as present in Indonesia; i.e., the population under 2 years old with (i) 100% exclusive breastfeeding, (ii) 100% partial breastfeeding and (iii) 100% no breastfeeding. Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the economic acceptability and affordability of the rotavirus vaccination. RESULTS: Rotavirus immunization would effectively reduce severe cases of rotavirus during the first 5 years of life of a child. Under the market vaccine price the total yearly vaccine cost would amount to US$ 65 million. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) in the base case was US$ 174 from the societal perspective. Obviously, it was much lower than the 2011 Indonesian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$ 3495. Affordability results showed that at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI)-subsidized vaccine price, rotavirus vaccination could be affordable for the Indonesian health system. Increased uptake of breastfeeding might slightly reduce cost-effectiveness results. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus immunization in Indonesia would be a highly cost-effective health intervention even under the market vaccine price. The results illustrate that rotavirus immunization would greatly reduce the burden of disease due to rotavirus infection. Even within increased uptake of breastfeeding, cost-effectiveness remains favorable.",2013-01-11402,23707163,Vaccine,Auliya A Suwantika,2013,31 / 32,3300-7,Yes,23707163,"Auliya A Suwantika; Hong Anh T Tu; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immunization in Indonesia: taking breastfeeding patterns into account, Vaccine, ; 31(32):1873-2518; 3300-7",QALY,Indonesia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rotavirus immunization vs. Placebo,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,174,United States,2011,200.2
11459,Cost effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral therapy for treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in the veterans health administration,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest single provider of care for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States. We analyzed the cost effectiveness of treatment with the HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir in a defined managed care population of 102,851 patients with untreated chronic genotype 1 infection. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic Markov model to examine 4 strategies: standard dual-therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin (PR), the combination of boceprevir and PR triple therapy, the combination of telaprevir and PR, or no antiviral treatment. A sensitivity analysis was performed. Sources of data included published rates of disease progression, the census bureau, and VHA pharmacy and hospitalization cost databases. RESULTS: The estimated costs for treating each patient were $8000 for PR, $31,300 for boceprevir and PR, and $41,700 for telaprevir and PR. Assuming VHA treatment rates of 22% and optimal rates of sustained virologic response, PR, boceprevir and PR, and telaprevir and PR would reduce relative liver-related deaths by 5.2%, 10.9%, and 11.5%, respectively. Increasing treatment rates to 50% would reduce liver-related deaths by 12%, 24.7%, and 26.1%, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $29,184/quality-adjusted life-years for boceprevir and PR and $44,247/quality-adjusted life-years for telaprevir and PR vs only PR. With the current 22% treatment rate, total system-wide costs to adopt boceprevir and PR or telaprevir and PR would range from $708 to $943 million. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial up-front costs of treating HCV-infected patients in the VHA with PR, or telaprevir and PR, each regimen improves quality of life and extends life expectancy by reducing liver-related morbidity and mortality, and should be cost effective.

11466,Cost effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral therapy for treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in the veterans health administration,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest single provider of care for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States. We analyzed the cost effectiveness of treatment with the HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir in a defined managed care population of 102,851 patients with untreated chronic genotype 1 infection. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic Markov model to examine 4 strategies: standard dual-therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin (PR), the combination of boceprevir and PR triple therapy, the combination of telaprevir and PR, or no antiviral treatment. A sensitivity analysis was performed. Sources of data included published rates of disease progression, the census bureau, and VHA pharmacy and hospitalization cost databases. RESULTS: The estimated costs for treating each patient were $8000 for PR, $31,300 for boceprevir and PR, and $41,700 for telaprevir and PR. Assuming VHA treatment rates of 22% and optimal rates of sustained virologic response, PR, boceprevir and PR, and telaprevir and PR would reduce relative liver-related deaths by 5.2%, 10.9%, and 11.5%, respectively. Increasing treatment rates to 50% would reduce liver-related deaths by 12%, 24.7%, and 26.1%, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $29,184/quality-adjusted life-years for boceprevir and PR and $44,247/quality-adjusted life-years for telaprevir and PR vs only PR. With the current 22% treatment rate, total system-wide costs to adopt boceprevir and PR or telaprevir and PR would range from $708 to $943 million. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial up-front costs of treating HCV-infected patients in the VHA with PR, or telaprevir and PR, each regimen improves quality of life and extends life expectancy by reducing liver-related morbidity and mortality, and should be cost effective.

We assess the cost-effectiveness of TT compared to no therapy in the treatment of patients previously treated with G1 CHC. METHODS: The available published literature provided the data source. The target population was made up of previously treated Caucasian patients with G1 CHC and these were evaluated over a lifetime horizon by Markov model.

11483,Are supportive care-based treatment strategies preferable to standard chemotherapy in recurrent cervical cancer?,OBJECTIVE: Recurrent cervical cancer has a poor prognosis despite aggressive treatment. We evaluate the comparative-effectiveness of four management strategies in recurrent cervix cancer incorporating risk prognostication categories derived from pooled collaborative group trials: 1) standard doublet chemotherapy; 2) selective chemotherapy (home hospice with no chemotherapy for poorest prognosis patients with remainder receiving standard doublet chemotherapy); 3) single-agent chemotherapy with home hospice; and 4) home hospice. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness decision model was constructed. Survival reduction of 24% was assumed for single-agent chemotherapy and 40% for hospice only compared to standard doublet chemotherapy. Overall survival and strategy cost for each arm were modeled as follows: standard doublet chemotherapy 8.9 months ($33K); selective chemotherapy 8.7 months ($29K); single-agent chemotherapy with home hospice 6.7 months ($16K); and home hospice alone 5.3 months ($11K). Base case analysis assumed equal quality of life (QOL). Sensitivity analyses assessed model uncertainties. RESULTS: Standard doublet chemotherapy for all is not cost-effective compared to selective chemotherapy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $276K per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analysis predicted that a 90% improvement in survival is required before standard doublet chemotherapy is cost-effective in the poorest prognosis patients. Selective chemotherapy is the most cost-effective strategy compared to single-agent chemotherapy with home hospice with an ICER of $78K/QALY.

11486,Cost-utility analysis of the newly recommended adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer patients in the 2011 Chinese National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Gastric Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin was first recommended for resectable gastric cancer patients in the 2011 Chinese National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Gastric Cancer, but the economic influence of this therapy in China is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin after a gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymph-node dissection, compared with a D2 gastrectomy alone, for patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer. METHODS: On the basis of data from the CLASSIC trial, a Markov model was created to determine economic and clinical data for patients in the chemotherapy and surgery group (CSG) and the surgery-only group (SOG). The costs, presented in 2010 US dollars and estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health-care system, were obtained from the published literature and the local health system. The utilities were based on published literature. Costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated. A lifetime horizon and a 3 % annual discount rate were used. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For the base case, the CSG compared with SOG would increase LYs and QALYs in a 3-, 5-, 10- or 30-year time horizon (except the QALYs at 3 or 5 years). In the short run (such as in 3 or 5 years), the medical costs would increase owing to adjuvant chemotherapy of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after D2 gastrectomy, but in the long run the costs would decline. The ICERs suggested that the SOG was dominant at 3 or 5 years and the CSG was dominant at 10 or 30 years.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin after a gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymph-node dissection, compared with a D2 gastrectomy alone, for patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer. METHODS: On the basis of data from the CLASSIC trial, a Markov model was created to determine economic and clinical data for patients in the chemotherapy and surgery group (CSG) and the surgery-only group (SOG). The costs, presented in 2010 US dollars and estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health-care system, were obtained from the published literature and the local health system. The utilities were based on published literature. Costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated. A lifetime horizon and a 3 % annual discount rate were used. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For the base case, the CSG compared with SOG would increase LYs and QALYs in a 3-, 5-, 10- or 30-year time horizon (except the QALYs at 3 or 5 years). In the short run (such as in 3 or 5 years), the medical costs would increase owing to adjuvant chemotherapy of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after D2 gastrectomy, but in the long run the costs would decline.

Until recently, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended protecting young infants by ""cocooning"" or vaccination of postpartum mothers and other close contacts with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, adsorbed (Tdap) booster vaccine. ACIP recommends pregnancy vaccination as a preferred and safe alternative to postpartum vaccination. The ACIP cocooning recommendation has not changed. METHODS: We used a cohort model reflecting US 2009 births and the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis schedule to simulate a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy compared with postpartum vaccination with or without vaccination of other close contacts (ie, cocooning). We analyzed infant pertussis cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, as well as direct disease, indirect, and public health costs for infants in the first year of life. All costs were updated to 2011 US dollars. RESULTS: Pregnancy vaccination could reduce annual infant pertussis incidence by more than postpartum vaccination, reducing cases by 33% versus 20%, hospitalizations by 38% versus 19%, and deaths by 49% versus 16%. Additional cocooning doses in a father and 1 grandparent could avert an additional 16% of cases but at higher cost. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved for pregnancy vaccination was substantially less than postpartum vaccination ($414 523 vs $1 172 825).

11497,Therapeutic options in docetaxel-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is an established first-line therapy to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Recently, abiraterone and cabazitaxel were approved for use after docetaxel failure, with improved survival. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) preliminary recommendations were negative for both abiraterone (now positive in final recommendation) and cabazitaxel (negative in final recommendation). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone and prednisone for mCRPC treatment in US. METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed to compare the two mCRPC treatments versus two placebos over 18 months from a societal perspective. Chance nodes include baseline pain as a severity indicator, grade III/IV side-effects, and survival at 18 months. Probabilities, survival and health utilities were from published studies. Model cost inputs included drug treatment, side-effect management and prevention, radiation for pain, and death associated costs in 2010 US dollars. RESULTS: Abiraterone is a cost-effective choice at $94K/QALY (quality adjusted life years) compared to placebo in our base-case analysis. Cabazitaxel and abiraterone are the most effective, yet also most expensive agents. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) at base-case are $101K/QALY (extended dominated) for mitoxantrone vs. placebo, $91K/QALY for abiraterone vs. mitoxantrone, $956K/QALY for cabazitaxel vs. abiraterone. Abiraterone becomes less cost-effective as its AWP increases, or if the cost of mitoxantrone side-effect management decreases.

11498,Therapeutic options in docetaxel-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is an established first-line therapy to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Recently, abiraterone and cabazitaxel were approved for use after docetaxel failure, with improved survival. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) preliminary recommendations were negative for both abiraterone (now positive in final recommendation) and cabazitaxel (negative in final recommendation). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone and prednisone for mCRPC treatment in US. METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed to compare the two mCRPC treatments versus two placebos over 18 months from a societal perspective. Chance nodes include baseline pain as a severity indicator, grade III/IV side-effects, and survival at 18 months. Probabilities, survival and health utilities were from published studies. Model cost inputs included drug treatment, side-effect management and prevention, radiation for pain, and death associated costs in 2010 US dollars. RESULTS: Abiraterone is a cost-effective choice at $94K/QALY (quality adjusted life years) compared to placebo in our base-case analysis. Cabazitaxel and abiraterone are the most effective, yet also most expensive agents. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) at base-case are $101K/QALY (extended dominated) for mitoxantrone vs. placebo, $91K/QALY for abiraterone vs. mitoxantrone, $956K/QALY for cabazitaxel vs. abiraterone. Abiraterone becomes less cost-effective as its AWP increases, or if the cost of mitoxantrone side-effect management decreases.
