24001,Cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in France: a meta-analysis and an integrated economic model derived from randomized controlled trials,"AIMS: Cost-effectiveness data on the remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) compared to the current standard of care (SC) remains limited. This meta-analysis was performed to assess the economic burden, and to develop an integrated economic model evaluating the efficiency of the RM strategy vs. SC in the context of French healthcare. METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized controlled trials, comparing RM to SC in patients implanted with ICDs with or without resynchronization therapy (+/-CRT-D), were identified through a systematic search of scientific literature databases dating from 2005. Seventeen trials (10 229 patients) reporting data on clinical outcomes, quality of life, cost, and/or utility, either as primary or secondary endpoints were identified. Compared to SC, RM resulted in significant reductions in annual costs per patient for direct healthcare costs (seven studies, difference in means -276.1, 95% standard error [SE]: 66.0, I2 = 76.3%) and for labour costs (two studies, difference in means -11.3, 95% SE: 1.4, I2 = 96.3%). A three-state Markov Model showed that RM resulted in cost-savings of 4142 per patient over a 5-year time horizon, with a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.29. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -14 136 /QALY, in favour of RM. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed that the RM strategy was dominant over SC in 70% of cases. CONCLUSION: Our economic model demonstrates that once implemented, RM of ICD +/- CRT-D patients would result in increased effectiveness for lower costs over a 5-year period, compared to the current SC in France.

24002,Cost-effectiveness of the HepCATT intervention in specialist drug clinics to improve case-finding and engagement with HCV treatment for people who inject drugs in England,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, ~50% are undiagnosed in England and linkage-to-care is poor. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of an intervention (HepCATT) to improve case-finding and referral to HCV treatment compared with standard-of-care pathways in drug treatment centres in England. DESIGN: HCV transmission and disease progression model with cost-effectiveness analysis using a health-care perspective. Primary outcome and cost data from the HepCATT study parameterized the intervention, suggesting that HepCATT increased HCV testing in drug treatment centres 2.5-fold and engagement onto the HCV treatment pathway 10-fold. A model was used to estimate the decrease in HCV infections and HCV-related deaths from 2016, with costs and health benefits (quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs) tracked over 50 years. Univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were undertaken. SETTING: England-specific epidemic with 40% prevalence of chronic HCV among PWID. PARTICIPANTS: PWID attending drug treatment centres. INTERVENTION: Nurse facilitator in drug treatment centres to improve the HCV care pathway from HCV case-finding to referral and linkage to specialist care. Comparator was the standard-of-care HCV care pathway. MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per QALY gained through improved case-finding. FINDINGS: Over 50 years per 1000 PWID, the HepCATT intervention could prevent 75 (95% central interval 37-129) deaths and 1330 (827-2040) or 51% (30-67%) of all new infections. The mean ICER was 7986 per QALY gained, with all PSA simulations being cost-effective at a 20 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. Univariable sensitivity analyses suggest the intervention would become cost-saving if the cost of HCV treatment reduces to 3900. If scaled up to all PWID in England, the intervention would cost 8.8 million and decrease incidence by 56% (33-70%) by 2030. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing hepatitis C virus infection case-finding and treatment referral in drug treatment centres could be a highly cost-effective strategy for decreasing hepatitis C virus incidence among people who inject drugs.

24003,"Health Gain, Cost Impacts, and Cost-Effectiveness of a Mass Media Campaign to Promote Smartphone Apps for Physical Activity: Modeling Study","BACKGROUND: Physical activity smartphone apps are a promising strategy to increase population physical activity, but it is unclear whether government mass media campaigns to promote these apps would be a cost-effective use of public funds. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the health impacts, costs, and cost-effectiveness of a one-off national mass media campaign to promote the use of physical activity apps. METHODS: We used an established multistate life table model to estimate the lifetime health gains (in quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) that would accrue if New Zealand adults were exposed to a one-off national mass media campaign to promote physical activity app use, with a 1-year impact on physical activity, compared to business-as-usual. A health-system perspective was used to assess cost-effectiveness. and a 3% discount rate was applied to future health gains and health system costs. RESULTS: The modeled intervention resulted in 28 QALYs (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 8-72) gained at a cost of NZ $81,000/QALY (2018 US $59,500; 95% UI 17,000-345,000), over the remaining life course of the 2011 New Zealand population. The intervention had a low probability (20%) of being cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of NZ $45,000 (US $32,900) per QALY. The health impact and cost-effectiveness of the intervention were highly sensitive to assumptions around the maintenance of physical activity behaviors beyond the duration of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A mass media campaign to promote smartphone apps for physical activity is unlikely to generate much health gain or be cost-effective at the population level. Other investments to promote physical activity, particularly those that result in sustained behavior change, are likely to have greater health impacts.

24004,Cost-Utility Analysis of rhBMP-2 Use in Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery,"STUDY DESIGN: Economic modeling of data from a multicenter, prospective registry. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the cost utility of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP) in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ASD surgery is expensive and presents risk of major complications. BMP is frequently used off-label to reduce the risk of pseudarthrosis. METHODS: Of 522 ASD patients with fusion of five or more spinal levels, 367 (70%) had at least 2-year follow-up. Total direct cost was calculated by adding direct costs of the index surgery and any subsequent reoperations or readmissions. Cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were calculated from the change in preoperative to final follow-up SF-6D health utility score. A decision-analysis model comparing BMP versus no-BMP was developed with pseudarthrosis as the primary outcome. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using mixed first-order and second-order Monte Carlo simulations. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed by varying cost, probability, and QALY estimates (Alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: BMP was used in the index surgery for 267 patients (73%). The mean (+/-standard deviation) direct cost of BMP for the index surgery was $14,000 +/- $6400. Forty patients (11%) underwent revision surgery for symptomatic pseudarthrosis (BMP group, 8.6%; no-BMP group, 17%; P = 0.022). The mean 2-year direct cost was significantly higher for patients with pseudarthrosis ($138,000 +/- $17,000) than for patients without pseudarthrosis ($61,000 +/- $25,000) (P < 0.001). Simulation analysis revealed that BMP was associated with positive incremental utility in 67% of patients and considered favorable at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY in >52% of patients. CONCLUSION: BMP use was associated with reduction in revisions for symptomatic pseudarthrosis in ASD surgery. Cost-utility analysis suggests that BMP use may be favored in ASD surgery; however, this determination requires further research.

24005,Bayesian Regression Model for a Cost-Utility and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Comparing Punch Grafting Versus Usual Care for the Treatment of Chronic Wounds,"Punch grafting is a traditional technique used to promote epithelialization of hard-to-heal wounds. The main purpose of this observational study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis (CUA) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) comparing punch grafting (n = 46) with usual care (n = 34) for the treatment of chronic wounds in an outpatient specialized wound clinic from a public healthcare system perspective (Spanish National Health system) with a three-month time horizon. CUA outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated from EuroQoL-5D, whereas CEA outcome was wound-free period. One-way sensitivity analyses, extreme scenario analysis, and re-analysis by subgroups were conducted to fight against uncertainty. Bayesian regression models were built to explore whether differences between groups in costs, wound-free period, and QALYs could be explained by other variables different to treatment. As main results, punch grafting was associated with a reduction of 37% in costs compared to usual care, whereas mean incremental utility (0.02 +/- 0.03 QALYs) and mean incremental effectiveness (7.18 +/- 5.30 days free of wound) were favorable to punch grafting. All sensitivity analyses proved the robustness of our models. To conclude, punch grafting is the dominant alternative over usual care because it is cheaper and its utility and effectiveness are greater.",2020-01-33653,0,Int. J. Environ. Res.

24006,Changes in Cost-Effectiveness for Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Pharmacotherapy: The Case for Continuous Cost-Effectiveness Analyses,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness evaluations for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments have been published frequently, but new products with significant cost and effectiveness differences make these analyses obsolete. How valuable are economic models for a fixed time period in a dynamic market? OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the best available HCV treatment at different points in time, using the same comparator to demonstrate how rapid innovation in a disease area influences economic outcomes. METHODS: A Markov model was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of treatment in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 compared with a standard comparator (no treatment) from the payer perspective. Expected drug costs and treatment effectiveness estimates for sustained virologic response (SVR) were calculated using recommended regimens for each of the 6 HCV genotypes at each time point and distribution of genotypes in the United States. Patients entered the model with different stages of fibrosis. Utility estimates for each health state were used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) earned at each cycle. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were reported for each year to compare the ""treatment versus no treatment"" decision at that time. RESULTS: No HCV treatment resulted in a gain of 11.54 QALYs over a 20-year time horizon at a cost of $42,938. Costs for treated groups were $69,075, $123,267, $125,431, $86,782, and $56,470 for the 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 scenarios, respectively. QALYs gained for treated groups were 12.90, 12.97, 13.34, 13.39, and 13.46 for the 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 scenarios, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in each year compared with no treatment were $19,218 per QALY, $56,104 per QALY, $45,829 per QALY, $23,699 per QALY, and $7,048 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment effectiveness for HCV has increased steadily, while treatment costs increased substantially from 2010-2014 before decreasing to its lowest point in 2018. Thus, the dynamic nature of innovation creates the need for iterative cost-effectiveness analyses. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

24011,Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for elderly in Sweden,"INTRODUCTION: The aim was to assess cost-effectiveness of including pneumococcal vaccination for elderly in a national vaccination programme in Sweden, comparing health-effects and costs of pneumococcal related diseases with a vaccination programme versus no vaccination. METHOD: We used a single-cohort deterministic decision-tree model to simulate the current burden of pneumococcal disease in Sweden. The model accounted for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumonia caused by pneumococci. Costs included in the analysis were those incurred when treating pneumococcal disease, and acquisition and administration of the vaccine. Health effects were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The time-horizon was set to five years, both effects and costs were discounted by 3% annually. Health-effects and costs were accumulated over the time-horizon and used to create an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was used in the base-case analysis. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13 was included in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: A vaccination programme using PPV23 would reduce the burden of pneumococcal related disease significantly, both when vaccinating a 65-year-old cohort and a 75-year-old cohort. IPD would decrease by 30% in the 65-year-old cohort, and by 29% in the 75-year-old cohort. The corresponding figures for CAP (communicable acquired pneumonia) are 19% and 15%. The cost per gained QALY was estimated to EUR 94,000 for vaccinating 65-year-olds and EUR 29,500 for 75-year-olds. With one dose PCV13 given instead of PPV23, the cost per gained QALY would increase by around 400% for both cohorts. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Introducing a vaccination programme against pneumococcal disease for 65-year-olds in Sweden is unlikely to be cost-effective, whereas it for 75 year-olds and using PPV23 can be considered good value for money. Our model indicates that vaccine price needs to be reduced by 55% for vaccination of 65-year-olds to be cost-effective, given a threshold of EUR 50,000. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

24013,Using Simulation Modeling to Guide the Design of the Girl Scouts Fierce & Fit Program,"OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to help the Girl Scouts of Central Maryland evaluate, quantify, and potentially modify the Girl Scouts Fierce & Fit program. METHODS: From 2018 to 2019, our Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research team developed a computational simulation model representing the 250 adolescent girls participating in the Fierce & Fit program and how their diets and physical activity affected their BMI and subsequent outcomes, including costs. RESULTS: Changing the Fierce & Fit program from a 6-week program meeting twice a week, with 5 minutes of physical activity each session, to a 12-week program meeting twice a week with 30 minutes of physical activity saved an additional $84,828 ($80,130-$89,526) in lifetime direct medical costs, $81,365 ($76,528-$86,184) in lifetime productivity losses, and 7.85 (7.38-8.31) quality-adjusted life-years. The cost-benefit of implementing this program was $95,943. Based on these results, the Girl Scouts of Central Maryland then implemented these changes in the program. CONCLUSIONS: This is an example of using computational modeling to help evaluate and revise the design of a program aimed at increasing physical activity among girls.

24031,"Cost-utility analysis of antibiotic treatment in patients with chronic low back pain and Modic changes: results from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial in Norway (the AIM study)","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of 100 days of antibiotics in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) and type I or II Modic changes included in the Antibiotic treatment In patients with chronic low back pain and Modic changes (AIM) study. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis from a societal and healthcare perspective alongside a double-blinded, parallel group, placebo, multicentre trial. SETTING: Hospital outpatient clinics at six hospitals in Norway. The main results from the AIM study showed a small effect in back-related disability in favour of the antibiotics group, and slightly larger in those with type I Modic changes, but this effect was below the pre-defined threshold for clinically relevant effect. PARTICIPANTS: 180 patients with chronic LBP, previous disc herniation and Modic changes type I (n=118) or type II (n=62) were randomised to antibiotic treatment (n=89) or placebo-control (n=91). INTERVENTIONS: Oral treatment with either 750 mg amoxicillin or placebo three times daily for 100 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by EuroQoL-5D over 12 months and costs for healthcare and productivity loss measured in Euro (1=NOK 10), in the intention-to-treat population. Cost-utility was expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Mean (SD) total cost was 21 046 (20 105) in the amoxicillin group and 19 076 (19 356) in the placebo group, mean difference 1970 (95% CI; -3835 to 7774). Cost per QALY gained was 24 625. In those with type I Modic changes, the amoxicillin group had higher healthcare consumption than the placebo group, resulting in 39 425 per QALY gained. Given these ICERs and a willingness-to-pay threshold of 27 500 (NOK 275 000), the probability of amoxicillin being cost-effective was 51%. Even when the willingness-to-pay threshold increased to 55 000, the probability of amoxicillin being cost-effective was never higher than 53%. CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin treatment showed no evidence of being cost-effective for people with chronic LBP and Modic changes during 1-year follow-up.

24032,Cost-effectiveness analysis of an outreach model of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) assessment to facilitate HCV treatment in primary care,"The effects of hepatitis C virus (HCV), such as morbidity and mortality associated with cirrhosis and liver cancer, is a major public health issue in Australia. Highly effective treatment has recently been made available to all Australians living with HCV. A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the hepatology partnership, compared to usual care. A Markov model was chosen, as it is state-based and able to include recursive events, which accurately reflects the natural history of the chronic and repetitive nature of HCV. Cost-effectiveness of the new model of care is indicated by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), where the mean change to costs associated with the new model of care is divided by the mean change in quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). Ten thousand iterations of the model were run, with the majority (73%) of ICERs representing cost-savings. In comparison to usual care, the intervention improves health outcomes (22.38 QALYs gained) and reduces costs by $42,122 per patient. When compared to usual care, a partnership approach to management of HCV is cost-effective and good value for money, even when key model parameters are changed in scenario analyses. Reduction in costs is driven by improved efficiency of the new model of care, where more patients are treated in a timely manner, away from the expensive tertiary setting. From an economic perspective, a reduction in hospital-based care is a positive outcome and represents a good investment for decision-makers who wish to maximise health gain per dollar spent.",2020-01-33674,0,PLoS One,D Brain,2020,15 / 5,e0234577,No,Not Stated,"D Brain; J Mitchell; J O'Beirne; Cost-effectiveness analysis of an outreach model of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) assessment to facilitate HCV treatment in primary care, PLoS One , 2020; 15(5):1932-6203; e0234577",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",hepatology care partnership (care connection and education) vs. Standard/Usual Care- care through referrals,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"1 Year, 10 years",Not Stated,Not Stated,-1882146.34,Australia,2018,-1450002.47
24033,Cost-effectiveness of 12 weeks of supervised treatment compared to written advice in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a secondary analysis of the 2-year outcome from a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the 24-month cost-effectiveness of supervised treatment compared to written advice in knee osteoarthritis (OA). DESIGN: 100 adults with moderate-severe OA not eligible for total knee replacement (TKR) randomized to a 12-week individualized, supervised treatment (exercise, education, diet, insoles and pain medication) or written advice. Effectiveness was measured as change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from baseline to 24 months, including data from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, while healthcare costs and transfer payments were derived from national registries after final follow-up. Incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. A sensitivity analysis resampling existing data was conducted and the probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated using a 22,665 Euros/QALY threshold. In a sensitivity analysis, cost-effectiveness was calculated for different costs of the supervised treatment (actual cost in study; cost in private practice; and in-between cost). RESULTS: Average costs were similar between groups (6,758 Euros vs 6,880 Euros), while the supervised treatment were close to being more effective (incremental effect (95% CI) of 0.075 (-0.005 to 0.156). In the primary analysis excluding deaths, this led the supervised treatment to be cost-effective, compared to written advice. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results were sensitive to changes in the cost of treatment, but in all scenarios the supervised treatment was cost-effective (ICERs of 6,229 to 20,688 Euros/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: From a 24-month perspective, a 12-week individualized, supervised treatment program is cost-effective compared to written advice in patients with moderate-severe knee OA not eligible for TKR.

24034,Cost-effectiveness of Endoscopic Polypectomy in Clinic compared to Endoscopic Sinus Surgery: A modelling study,"OBJECTIVE: To compare costs and quality-adjusted life years of patients receiving endoscopic polypectomy in the clinic those receiving endoscopic sinus surgery from the perspective of Canada''s health system. METHOD: We developed a Markov model to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years among a cohort of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps who received endoscopic polypectomy in clinic or endoscopic sinus surgery, over a patient''s lifetime. Our study focused on patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps who have the predominant symptom of bilateral nasal obstruction. Cost data were obtained from Canadian sources. Health utility values were derived from Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores reported in the published literature. A cycle length of six months was used. Both costs and quality-adjusted life years were discounted using an annual rate of 1.5%. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the study findings. RESULTS: Endoscopic polypectomy in clinic was a cost-saving option as it had a lower cost (C$736 vs. C$6,728) and produced more quality-adjusted life years (13.85 vs 13.06) compared to endoscopic sinus surgery. Our findings were, however, highly sensitive to health utility values. Results from probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that endoscopic polypectomy in clinic had a lower cost and was more effective compared to endoscopic sinus surgery in 99.86% of iterations. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the publicly funded healthcare system, endoscopic polypectomy in clinic was economically attractive compared to endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps patients who have a primary symptom of bilateral nasal obstruction. The cost-effectiveness results are, however, highly dependent on the relative impact of endoscopic polypectomy in the clinic and endoscopic sinus surgery on post-surgery health utility values.

24035,Indwelling Pleural Catheter Drainage Strategy for Malignant Effusion: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Rationale: The likelihood of achieving pleurodesis after indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) placement for malignant pleural effusion varies with the specific drainage strategy used: symptom-guided drainage, daily drainage, or talc instillation through the IPC (IPC + talc). The relative cost-effectiveness of one strategy over the other is unknown. Objectives: We performed a decision tree model-based analysis to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of each IPC drainage strategy from a healthcare system perspective. Methods: We developed a decision tree model using theoretical event probability data derived from three randomized clinical trials and used 2019 Medicare reimbursement data for cost estimation. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over an analytical horizon of 6 months with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to measure the uncertainty surrounding base case estimates. Results: IPC + talc was a cost-effective alternative to symptom-guided drainage, with an ICER of $59,729/QALY. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that this strategy was favored in 54% of simulations. However, symptom-guided drainage was cost effective for pleurodesis rates >20% and for life expectancy <4 months. Daily drainage was not cost effective in any scenario, including for patients with nonexpandable lung, in whom it had an ICER of $2,474,612/QALY over symptom-guided drainage. Conclusions: For patients with malignant pleural effusion and an expandable lung, IPC + talc may be cost effective relative to symptom-guided drainage, although considerable uncertainty exists around this estimation.

24037,Health and Economic Impacts of the National Menu Calorie Labeling Law in the United States: A Microsimulation Study,"BACKGROUND: Excess caloric intake is linked to weight gain, obesity, and related diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obesity incidence is rising, with nearly 3 in 4 US adults being overweight or obese. In 2018, the US federal government finalized the implementation of mandatory labeling of calorie content on all menu items across major chain restaurants nationally as a strategy to support informed consumer choice, reduce caloric intake, and potentially encourage restaurant reformulations. Yet, the potential health and economic impacts of this policy remain unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a validated microsimulation model (CVD-PREDICT) to estimate reductions in CVD events, diabetes mellitus cases, gains in quality-adjusted life years, costs, and cost-effectiveness of the menu calorie labeling intervention, based on consumer responses alone, and further accounting for potential industry reformulation. The model incorporated nationally representative demographic and dietary data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2009 to 2016; policy effects on consumer diets and body mass index-disease effects from published meta-analyses; and policy effects on industry reformulation, policy costs (policy administration, industry compliance, and reformulation), and health-related costs (formal and informal healthcare costs, productivity costs) from established sources or reasonable assumptions. We modeled change in calories to change in weight using an established dynamic weight-change model, assuming 50% of expected calorie reductions would translate to long-term reductions. Findings were evaluated over 5 years and a lifetime from healthcare and societal perspectives, with uncertainty incorporated in both 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Between 2018 and 2023, implementation of the restaurant menu calorie labeling law was estimated, based on consumer response alone, to prevent 14 698 new CVD cases (including 1575 CVD deaths) and 21 522 new type 2 diabetes mellitus cases, gaining 8749 quality-adjusted life years. Over a lifetime, corresponding values were 135 781 new CVD cases (including 27 646 CVD deaths), 99 736 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases, and 367 450 quality-adjusted life years. Assuming modest restaurant item reformulation, both health and economic benefits were estimated to be about 2-fold larger than based on consumer response alone. The consumer response alone was estimated to be cost-saving by 2023, with net lifetime savings of $10.42B from a healthcare perspective and $12.71B from a societal perspective.

24041,Permanent inferior vena cava filters offer greater expected patient utility at lower predicted cost,"OBJECTIVE: Retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters were first approved for use in the United States in 2003 to address the long-term complications of migration, thrombosis, fracture, and perforation observed with permanent IVC filter implantation. Although Food and Drug Administration approval of retrievable IVC filters includes permanent implantation, the incidence of complications from long-term implantation appears to be greater than that reported with existing permanent IVC filters. Also, only a small fraction of such retrievable IVC filters are ever retrieved. The purpose of the present study was to determine the threshold retrieval rate at which the use of retrievable IVC filters could be justified. METHODS: A Markov decision tree was constructed comparing retrievable and permanent IVC filters regarding their effectiveness and cost. A review of the reported data provided outcome probabilities, and the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry was the source of the utility values for the various potential outcomes. Medicare reimbursement rates served as a proxy for costs. A sensitivity analysis was performed for various parameters, primarily to determine the retrieval rate threshold at which the use of retrievable IVC filters would outperform the use of permanent IVC filters. RESULTS: Base case analysis demonstrated a greater predicted effectiveness for permanent compared with retrievable IVC filter implantation (5.41 quality-adjusted life-years [QALY] vs 5.33 QALY) at a lower cost ($2070 vs $4650). Monte Carlo simulation at 10,000 iterations confirmed the expected utility (5.4 +/- 3.0 QALY vs 5.3 +/- 3.0 QALY; P = .0002) and cost ($1900 +/- $7400 vs $4800 +/- 9900; P < .0001) to be statistically superior for permanent IVC filters. A sensitivity analysis for the filter retrieval rate demonstrated that the strategy of using a retrievable IVC filter was never preferable for utility or cost. The superiority of permanent IVC filter placement for effectiveness and cost persisted, regardless of anticipated patient-predicted annual mortality. A two-way sensitivity analysis for both IVC filter removal rate and annual patient mortality confirmed the superiority of permanent IVC filter placement at all levels. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted effectiveness of permanent IVC filters was greater and the predicted cost lower than those for retrievable IVC filters, regardless of the IVC filter retrieval rate. This interpretation of existing reported data using Markov decision analysis modeling supports the argument that unless the long-term complication rate of retrievable IVC filters can be significantly improved, their use should be abandoned in favor of currently available permanent IVC filters.

24042,Bariatric Surgery Prior to Total Hip Arthroplasty Is Cost-Effective in Morbidly Obese Patients,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery to achieve weight loss prior to total hip arthroplasty (THA), and decrease the complications and costs associated with THA in the morbidly obese, is unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery prior to THA for morbidly obese patients with end-stage hip osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-utility of 2 treatment protocols for patients with morbid obesity and end-stage hip OA: (1) immediate THA and (2) bariatric surgery 2 years prior to THA (combined protocol). The analysis was performed from both a payer and a societal perspective using direct and indirect costs over a 40-year time horizon. Utilities, associated costs, and probabilities for health state transitions were derived from the literature. One-way, 2-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the base case results, using the standard willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life years. RESULTS: From the societal perspective, the combined protocol was more effective (13.16 vs 12.26) with less cost ($91,717 vs $92,684) and thus was the dominant strategy over immediate THA. These results were stable across broad ranges for independent model variables. Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 samples demonstrated that bariatric surgery prior to THA was the preferred cost-effective strategy over 95% of the time from both a societal and payer perspective. CONCLUSION: In the morbidly obese patient with end-stage hip OA, bariatric surgery prior to THA is a cost-effective strategy for improving quality of life and decreasing societal and payer costs.

METHODS: A decision tree Markov model was constructed for a cohort of infants born to HBV surface antigen-positive mothers in China, 2016. The expected cost and effectiveness were compared between the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis strategy and the tenofovir prophylaxis strategy, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. One-way and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For 100,000 babies born to mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, tenofovir prophylaxis strategy will prevent 2213 perinatal HBV infections and will gain 931 quality-adjusted life years when compared with the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 59,973 ($9087) per quality-adjusted life years gained. This result was robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high viral loads in late pregnancy was found to be more cost-effective than the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis alone. Embedding tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high virus loads into the present hepatitis B prevention strategies should be considered to further prevent mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission in China.

24044,Internal fixation versus hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: There is little information on the cost and outcome of different treatments for femoral neck fractures. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of internal fixation compared with hemiarthroplasty (HA) for elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 121 patients >= 65 years old were divided into internal fixation (n = 58) or HA group (n = 63). Clinical outcome was evaluated by the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) score at 3, 12, and 24 months. The total costs including medical and non-medical expense were collected through hospitalisation information, cost diaries, and telephone interviews. A cost-utility analysis of the total costs in combination with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated by EQ-5D and survival time was conducted. Results were expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D index score in the HA group were higher at the early follow-up (p<0.05). At 24 months there were no differences in EQ-5D between the 2 treatment groups (p>0.05). Over the 2-year period, patients treated with HA gained 0.09-0.10 more QALYs than those treated with internal fixation, while the mean total costs for internal fixation (CNY 55,676) were significantly lower than for HA (CNY 80,297) (P<0.001). ICER indicated that internal fixation may be more cost-effective than HA. CONCLUSION: HA is associated with better outcome than internal fixation in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. However, internal fixation may be more cost-effective because of less total cost. Copyright © 2020.

24045,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Guided Brachytherapy Versus Two-Dimensional and Computed Tomography (CT) Guided Brachytherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer,"PURPOSE: The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer is external beam radiation therapy and concurrent cisplatin followed by brachytherapy. Traditionally, 2-dimensional brachytherapy (2DBT) or computed tomography guided brachytherapy (CTgBT) has been used, but magnetic resonance guided brachytherapy (MRgBT) improves clinical outcomes and has become the new standard of care. This cost-utility analysis was undertaken to compare MRgBT to CTgBT and 2DBT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-utility from the perspective of the public health care payer in Ontario. Treatment effectiveness, expressed as quality-adjusted life years, and costs, expressed in 2016 Canadian dollars, were evaluated for MRgBT, CTgBT, and 2DBT. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for all patients and separately for low and high-risk subgroups. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: MRgBT improved tumor control, reduced side effects, and was less costly compared with either CTgBT or 2DBT for all patients and in low- and high-risk prognostic subgroups separately. Sensitivity analysis supported the robustness of the findings and identified the cost of treating cancer recurrence to be the single most influential model parameter. CONCLUSIONS: MRgBT is more effective and less costly than CTgBT or 2DBT by avoiding downstream costs of treating cancer recurrence and managing side effects. These findings will assist health care providers and policymakers with future infrastructure and human resource planning to ensure optimal care of women with this disease.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-utility from the perspective of the public health care payer in Ontario. Treatment effectiveness, expressed as quality-adjusted life years, and costs, expressed in 2016 Canadian dollars, were evaluated for MRgBT, CTgBT, and 2DBT. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for all patients and separately for low and high-risk subgroups. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: MRgBT improved tumor control, reduced side effects, and was less costly compared with either CTgBT or 2DBT for all patients and in low- and high-risk prognostic subgroups separately. Sensitivity analysis supported the robustness of the findings and identified the cost of treating cancer recurrence to be the single most influential model parameter. CONCLUSIONS: MRgBT is more effective and less costly than CTgBT or 2DBT by avoiding downstream costs of treating cancer recurrence and managing side effects. These findings will assist health care providers and policymakers with future infrastructure and human resource planning to ensure optimal care of women with this disease.

24051,Safer and Cheaper: An Enhanced Milestone-Based Return to Play Program After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Young Athletes Is Cost-Effective Compared With Standard Time-Based Return to Play Criteria,"BACKGROUND: Safe return to play (RTP) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is critical to patient satisfaction. Enhanced rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction with appropriate objective criteria for RTP may reduce the risk of subsequent injury. The cost-effectiveness of an enhanced RTP (eRTP) strategy relative to standard post-ACL reconstruction rehabilitation has not been investigated. PURPOSE: To determine if an eRTP strategy after ACL reconstruction is cost-effective compared with standard rehabilitation. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was utilized to compare standard rehabilitation with an eRTP strategy, which includes additional neuromuscular retraining, advanced testing, and follow-up physician visits. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a payer perspective. Costs of surgical procedures and rehabilitation protocols, risks of graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury, risk reductions as a result of the eRTP strategy, and relevant health utilities were derived from the literature. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year was used to determine cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed on pertinent model parameters to assess their effect on base case conclusions. In the base case analysis, the eRTP strategy cost was conservatively estimated to be $969 more than the standard rehabilitation protocol. Completion of the eRTP strategy was considered to confer a 25% risk reduction for graft rupture in comparison with standard rehabilitation. RESULTS: The eRTP strategy was more cost-effective than standard rehabilitation alone. Based on 1-way threshold analyses, the eRTP strategy was cost-effective as long as its additional cost over standard rehabilitation was <$2092 or the eRTP strategy decreased the incidence of contralateral ACL rupture by >13.8%. CONCLUSION: The eRTP strategy in this study adds additional neuromuscular retraining and additional physician follow-up-as well as advanced testing goals upon which RTP is contingent-to traditional physical therapy. Our data suggest that these additions are cost-effective, even assuming only modest associated decreases in ACL graft failure. This study also determined that the only variable that had the potential to change the cost-effectiveness conclusion based on predetermined ranges was the additional cost of rehabilitation based on 1-way sensitivity analysis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides evidence of cost-effectiveness for payers, supporting the use of enhanced RTP programs. The sensitivity analyses herein may be used to determine if any given RTP program going forward is cost-effective, regardless of the exact components of the program.",2020-01-33708,0,Am J Sports Med,CJ DeFrancesco,2020,48 /,1100-1107,No,Not Stated,"CJ DeFrancesco; DG Lebrun; JT Molony; MR Heath; PD Fabricant; Safer and Cheaper: An Enhanced Milestone-Based Return to Play Program After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Young Athletes Is Cost-Effective Compared With Standard Time-Based Return to Play Criteria, Am J Sports Med, 2020; 48():1726-6890; 1100-1107",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Diagnostic, Health Education or Behavior",enhanced return to play strategy vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard postoperative rehabilitation,"participated in, and desire to return to, cutting and pivoting sports; appropriate candidates for postoperative rehabilitiation",22 Years,14 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,-37375,United States,2018,-38521.67
24052,"Cost-effectiveness Comparison of Ceftazidime/Avibactam Versus Meropenem in the Empirical Treatment of Hospital-acquired Pneumonia, Including Ventilator-associated Pneumonia, in Italy","PURPOSE: Ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a fixed-dose combination antibiotic approved in Europe and the United States for patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). The economic benefits of a new drug such as CAZ-AVI are required to be assessed against those of available comparators, from the perspective of health care providers and payers, through cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. The objective of this analysis was to compare the cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI versus meropenem in the empirical treatment of appropriate hospitalized patients with HAP/VAP caused by gram-negative pathogens, from the perspective of publicly funded health care in Italy (third-party perspective, based on the data from the REPROVE (Ceftazidime-Avibactam Versus Meropenem In Nosocomial Pneumonia, Including Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) clinical study; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01808092). METHODS: A patient-level, sequential simulation model of the HAP/VAP clinical course was developed using spreadsheet software. The analysis focused on direct medical costs. The time horizon of the model selected was 5 years, with an annual discount rate of 3% on costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Clinical inputs for treatment comparisons were mainly obtained from the REPROVE clinical study data. In addition to clinical outcomes observed in the trial, the model incorporated impact of resistance pathogens, based on data from published studies and expert opinion. Certain assumptions were made for some model parameters due to a lack of data. FINDINGS: The analysis demonstrated that the intervention sequence (CAZ-AVI followed by colistin + high-dose meropenem) versus the comparator sequence (meropenem followed by colistin + high-dose meropenem) provided a better clinical cure rate (+13.52%), which led to a shorter hospital stay (-0.40 days per patient), and gains in the number of life-years (+0.195) and QALYs (+0.350) per patient. The intervention sequence had an estimated net incremental total cost of 1254 ($1401) per patient, and the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 3581 ($4000) per QALY gained, well below the willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 ($33,507) per QALY in Italy. IMPLICATIONS: The model results showed that CAZ-AVI is expected to provide clinical benefits in hospitalized patients with HAP/VAP in Italy at an acceptable cost compared to meropenem.

24053,The Cost-effectiveness of Eltrombopag for the Treatment of Immune Thrombocytopenia in the United States,"PURPOSE: Eltrombopag was evaluated as a second-line treatment for adult chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the 2006 Phase III RAISE (Eltrombopag for Management of Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia) randomized, placebo-controlled trial. More than 80% of patients reached satisfactory platelet counts within 2 weeks. However, the economic value of eltrombopag as a second-line treatment for ITP remains to be formally assessed. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating ITP with a comparable thrombopoietin receptor agonist (eltrombopag vs romiplostim). METHODS: A Markov model was implemented over a lifetime time horizon to estimate the benefits and costs of each treatment. The model featured 3 health states based on current guidelines: (1) on treatment; (2) treatment failure/discontinuation; and (3) mortality. In line with therapeutic goals in ITP, model patients could experience 3 events: no bleeding, mild/moderate bleeding, or severe bleeding. Data on eltrombopag use were obtained from an open-label extension of previous Phase II/III trials, including RAISE. Romiplostim data were obtained from Phase III trials and an extension study. Lifetime overall survival was extrapolated by using treatment-specific mortality rates derived from severe bleeding and natural mortality rates. The costs of drugs, routine care, bleeding episodes, adverse events, and mortality were represented in the model. FINDINGS: Eltrombopag-treated patients gained 17.58 life years and 14.68 quality-adjusted life years, whereas romiplostim-treated patients gained 17.52 life years and 14.67 quality-adjusted life years. The total lifetime cost of eltrombopag treatment was estimated at $1.58 million versus $2.13 million for romiplostim. Sensitivity analyses supported base case findings. Deterministic sensitivity analysis predicted the greatest sensitivity to the rates of severe bleeding, discontinuation, and natural mortality. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that eltrombopag would be an efficient use of resources at a $50,000 threshold in 52.8% of cases. In all probabilistic iterations, the total cost of eltrombopag treatment was lower than with romiplostim, primarily because of lower drug costs. IMPLICATIONS: Clinical data were applied in an economic analysis, and eltrombopag exhibited economic dominance compared with romiplostim, driven largely by the reduced costs of primary therapy. This model was limited by a lack of specific patient-level data and robust data on the duration of secondary therapy, as well as by the fact that utilization values are likely conservative estimates for routine care use.

24054,Cost effectiveness and impact on quality of life of abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of children with lower limb spasticity in Canada,"Background: Injectable botulinum neurotoxins are a mainstay of treatment for pediatric spasticity. AbobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA are both injectable toxin therapies used to treat pediatric lower limb (PLL) spasticity in Canada. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of abobotulinumtoxinA vs. onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of PLL spasticity in Canada. Methods: A probabilistic Markov cohort model with a 2-year time horizon was developed, with health states defined by response to therapy, as characterized by the goal attainment scale (GAS). Based on randomized controlled trial evidence, response to therapy was similar or higher for abobotulinumtoxinA relative to onabotulinumtoxinA; uncertainty was incorporated into model parameters, however, as the two therapies have not been compared head-to-head. Canadian resource use and cost data were incorporated. Results: In the base case, abobotulinumtoxinA generated 1.48 quality-adjusted life years over the model time horizon, compared to 1.47 for onabotulinumtoxinA. AbobotulinumtoxinA was associated with cost savings of $123 CAD, reflecting lower costs in both medication acquisition and health services. The estimated improvement to quality of life and reduced costs result in an estimate of economic dominance for abobotulinumtoxinA over onabotulinumtoxinA. This dominant result persisted across probabilistic and scenario analyses.Key points for decision makersBased on a review of available clinical evidence, abobotulinumtoxinA was found to have significant and/or numerical efficacy benefits to onabotulinumtoxinA on functional outcomes (Goal Attainment Scale) and tone (Modified Ashworth Scale) and in the treatment of pediatric lower limb spasticityIn this cost-effectiveness analysis, abobotulinumtoxinA was found to be associated with greater quality-adjusted life years and lower costs than onabotulinumtoxinA (economically dominant)A limitation of this analysis was the uncertainty around key parameters. Specifically, the lack of head-to-head comparison data for the two therapies, and variable data regarding likely onabotulinumtoxinA dosing in PLL in clinical practice. However, across a range of plausible scenarios, the economic dominant result remained.",2020-01-33718,0,J Med Econ,K Johnston,2020,23 / 7,631-640,Yes,Not Stated,"K Johnston; N Danchenko; R Hansen; J Dinet; A Liovas; A Armstrong; S Bains; SD Sullivan; Cost effectiveness and impact on quality of life of abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of children with lower limb spasticity in Canada, J Med Econ, 2020; 23(7):1369-6998; 631-640",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,abobotulinumtoxina vs. onabotulinumtoxina,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,1.50,1.50,-12300,Canada,2017,-10002.52
24055,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a gender-neutral human papillomavirus vaccination program in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Vaccinating girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a highly effective and cost-effective intervention to provide protection against HPV-induced cancers. Since vaccination coverage rates among girls is modest in the Netherlands, additional strategies should be implemented to improve the protection against HPV-related cancer. Here we assessed the benefits and cost-effectiveness of gender-neutral vaccination. METHODS: We designed a static Markov model with a lifelong time horizon to simulate a cohort of 100,000 12-year-old Dutch boys. The model compares health and economic effects of HPV vaccination taking the current female vaccination coverage into consideration. HPV prevalence in boys was corrected for the predicted herd effects of the female programme in 2017. We extracted transition probabilities from peer-reviewed literature and previously constructed models. The robustness of the model was tested with multiple sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Vaccinating 30% of 100,000 12-year-old boys prevents 18, 13 and 25 cases of anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers in men, respectively. A total of 205 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are saved by preventing cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Assuming a vaccine price of 50 per dose, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is 17,907 per QALY. In addition, due to vaccine-induced herd effects, we estimated that 110 cases of cancer in females would be additionally prevented and 246 QALYs would be gained in the female cohort, bringing the total to 166 cancers prevented and 451 QALYs gained. Taking these additional benefits of boys'' vaccination into account, the overall ICER was estimated at 7310 per QALY gained. The model outcomes are most sensitive to variation in vaccine price, herd immunity from females and vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of boys, additional to girls, will prevent a relevant number of cancers in both boys and girls. Based on the current Dutch situation vaccination of HPV in boys is likely cost-effective. GSK Study identifier: HO-18-19169. Copyright © 2020 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A.

24056,Evaluation of the Cost-effectiveness of Services for Schizophrenia in the UK Across the Entire Care Pathway in a Single Whole-Disease Model,"Importance: The existing economic models for schizophrenia often have 3 limitations; namely, they do not cover nonpharmacologic interventions, they report inconsistent conclusions for antipsychotics, and they have poor methodologic quality. Objectives: To develop a whole-disease model for schizophrenia and use it to inform resource allocation decisions across the entire care pathway for schizophrenia in the UK. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model used a whole-disease model to simulate the entire disease and treatment pathway among a simulated cohort of 200000 individuals at clinical high risk of psychoses or with a diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia being treated in primary, secondary, and tertiary care in the UK. Data were collected March 2016 to December 2018 and analyzed December 2018 to April 2019. Exposures: The whole-disease model used discrete event simulation; its structure and input data were informed by published literature and expert opinion. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. Key interventions assessed included cognitive behavioral therapy, antipsychotic medication, family intervention, inpatient care, and crisis resolution and home treatment team. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life-time costs and quality-adjusted life-years. Results: In the simulated cohort of 200000 individuals (mean [SD] age, 23.5 [5.1] years; 120800 [60.4%] men), 66400 (33.2%) were not at risk of psychosis, 69800 (34.9%) were at clinical high risk of psychosis, and 63800 (31.9%) had psychosis. The results of the whole-disease model suggest the following interventions are likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20000 ($25552) per quality-adjusted life-year: practice as usual plus cognitive behavioral therapy for individuals at clinical high risk of psychosis (probability vs practice as usual alone, 0.96); a mix of hospital admission and crisis resolution and home treatment team for individuals with acute psychosis (probability vs hospital admission alone, 0.99); amisulpride (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.39), risperidone (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.30), or olanzapine (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.17) combined with family intervention for individuals with first-episode psychosis (probability vs family intervention or medication alone, 0.58); and clozapine for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (probability vs other medications, 0.81). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that the current schizophrenia service configuration is not optimal. Cost savings and/or additional quality-adjusted life-years may be gained by replacing current interventions with more cost-effective interventions.",2020-01-33734,0,Oncol.

The results of the whole-disease model suggest the following interventions are likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20000 ($25552) per quality-adjusted life-year: practice as usual plus cognitive behavioral therapy for individuals at clinical high risk of psychosis (probability vs practice as usual alone, 0.96); a mix of hospital admission and crisis resolution and home treatment team for individuals with acute psychosis (probability vs hospital admission alone, 0.99); amisulpride (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.39), risperidone (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.30), or olanzapine (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.17) combined with family intervention for individuals with first-episode psychosis (probability vs family intervention or medication alone, 0.58); and clozapine for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (probability vs other medications, 0.81).

24060,Health economic evaluation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous disease in which an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) effectively prevents sudden cardiac death in at-risk individuals. Nevertheless, the cost-effectiveness of ICDs in this specific patient group has not been evaluated. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was constructed to simulate the course of identified adult persons with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with and without an ICD over the course of 12 years based on Swedish disease-specific unit costs. The age distribution was based on empirical data from the nationwide cohort of HCM patients with ICDs (mean age at the time of implant was 51.8 years). The outcomes were costs per saved life and cost per gained quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Of 1000 simulated patients, 402 lives were saved after 12 years with an ICD at a cost of 646,000 Swedish krona (SEK), which corresponds to 57,118 Euro per saved life from the health care sector viewpoint. The cost per gained QALY (the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER)) was 171,000 SEK (15,119 Euro). From a societal viewpoint, including effects on productivity losses, the use of an ICD was absolutely dominant (both cheaper and better, and thus an ICER is of no interest). Both the one-way sensitivity analyses and the probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported the findings in the base option. CONCLUSION: For identified patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy deemed at high risk of sudden cardiac death, the use of an ICD is extremely cost effective, both in terms of the cost for saved lives and gained QALY.

24062,Measles vaccination of young infants in China: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Although global progress in measles control has been realized, achieving elimination has proven difficult in many regions of the world. China has adopted a goal of measles elimination but recent outbreaks predominantly affecting children <8 months who are ineligible for vaccination and incompletely protected by maternal antibodies has impeded progress. We assess the cost-effectiveness of adding an initial measles vaccine dose in China to earlier than the currently recommended 8 months of age. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing the costs and health benefits associated with adding a measles vaccine dose to the routine schedule at 4, 5, 6 or 7 months compared to the current recommendation for the first dose at age 8 months. A decision analytic model was developed in Microsoft Excel, including five non-severe and two fatal health outcomes associated with measles infection. Model parameters were informed by the literature and surveillance data. Future costs and health benefits were discounted at 3%. Primary outcomes included costs, Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a lifetime time horizon. RESULTS: Lowering the recommended age for initiating the measles vaccination series to address susceptibility in children <8 months provided incremental health gains compared to minimal costs at the individual-level. The ICER was most favorable ($232.70 per QALY gain) for administering an initial dose at 4 months of age due to fewer incremental program costs when shifting measles administration to an immunization visit already established under the Chinese vaccination program. CONCLUSION: We found potential beneficial health gains at a minimum cost associated with adding an earlier measles dose <8 months of age in China. Further investigation about disease transmission dynamics is required to more fully assess the tradeoffs of administering measles at a younger age to infants in China. Copyright © 2020.

24066,Detection of fetal cardiac anomalies: cost-effectiveness of increased number of cardiac views,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the recommended three-view fetal heart screening method to detect major congenital heart disease (CHD) with more elaborate screening strategies to determine the cost-effective strategy in unselected (low-risk) pregnancies. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was designed to compare four screening strategies to identify fetuses with major CHD in a theoretical cohort of 4 000 000 births in the USA. The four strategies were: (1) three views: four-chamber view (4CV) and views of the left (LVOT) and right (RVOT) ventricular outflow tracts; (2) five views: 4CV, LVOT, RVOT and longitudinal views of the ductal arch and aortic arch; (3) five axial views: 4CV, LVOT, RVOT, three-vessel (3V) view and three-vessels-and-trachea view; and (4) six views: 4CV, LVOT, RVOT and 3V views and longitudinal views of the ductal arch and aortic arch. Outcomes related to neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental disability were evaluated. The analysis was performed from a healthcare-system perspective, with a cost-effectiveness willingness-to-pay threshold set at $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Baseline analysis, one-way sensitivity analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation were performed. RESULTS: In our baseline model, screening with five axial views was the optimal strategy, detecting 3520 more CHDs, and resulting in 259 fewer children with neurodevelopmental disability, 40 fewer neonatal deaths and only slightly higher costs, compared with screening with the currently recommended three views. Screening with six views was more effective, but also cost considerably more, compared with screening with five axial views, and had an incremental cost of $490 023/QALY, which was over the willingness-to-pay threshold. The five-view strategy was dominated by the other three strategies, i.e. it was more costly and less effective in comparison. The data were robust when tested with Monte-Carlo and one-way sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Although current guidelines recommend a minimum of three views for detecting CHD during the mid-trimester anatomy scan, screening with five axial views is a cost-effective strategy that may lead to improved outcome compared with three-view screening.

CONCLUSION: Although current guidelines recommend a minimum of three views for detecting CHD during the mid-trimester anatomy scan, screening with five axial views is a cost-effective strategy that may lead to improved outcome compared with three-view screening.

24069,Cost-effectiveness analysis of nivolumab in the second-line treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Background: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab versus chemotherapy in the second-line treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Materials & methods: A Markov model reflecting the patients in the ATTRACTION-3 trial was established. Weibull survival model was employed to fit the Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival and overall survival probabilities of the nivolumab and chemotherapy strategy, respectively. Meanwhile, one-way and PSA were performed to test the uncertainty in the model. Results: Overall, the incremental effectiveness and cost of nivolumab versus chemotherapy were 0.107 quality-adjusted life-years and $14,627.90, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $136,709.35/quality-adjusted life-year.

24070,Cost-Effectiveness of Rifaximin Treatment in Patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of cirrhosis of the liver causing neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Clinical manifestations of overt HE result in increased health care resource utilization and effects on patient quality of life. While lactulose has historically been the mainstay of treatment for acute HE and maintenance of remission, there is an unmet need for additional therapeutic options with a favorable adverse event profile. Compared with lactulose alone, rifaximin has demonstrated proven efficacy in complete reversal of HE and reduction in the incidence of HE recurrence, mortality, and hospitalizations. Evidence suggests the benefit of long-term prophylactic therapy with rifaximin; however, there is a need to assess the economic impact of rifaximin treatment in patients with HE. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of rifaximin +/- lactulose versus lactulose monotherapy in patients with overt HE. METHODS: A Markov model was developed in Excel with 4 health states (remission, overt HE, liver transplantation, and death) to predict costs and outcomes of patients with HE after initiation of maintenance therapy with rifaximin +/- lactulose to avoid recurrent HE episodes. Cost-effectiveness of rifaximin was evaluated through estimation of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) or life-year (LY) gained. Analyses were conducted over a lifetime horizon. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty in results. RESULTS: The rifaximin +/- lactulose regimen provided added health benefits despite an additional cost versus lactulose monotherapy. Model results showed an incremental benefit of $29,161 per QALY gained and $27,762 per LY gained with rifaximin +/- lactulose versus lactulose monotherapy. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the rifaximin +/- lactulose regimen was cost-effective ~99% of the time at a threshold of $50,000 per QALY/LY gained, which falls within the commonly accepted threshold for incremental cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit of rifaximin, combined with an acceptable economic profile, demonstrates the advantages of rifaximin maintenance therapy as an important option to consider for patients at risk of recurrent HE.

24071,Fixation Method for Hip Arthroplasty Stem Following Hip Fracture: A Population-Level Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroplasty is increasing in Australia. The number of procedures for fractured neck of femur was 7500 in 2017. Best practices for fixation method and procedure type require scrutiny. This paper is about the costs and health outcomes of cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty at a national level. METHODS: We created a Markov model for patients <75, aged 75-85, and over 85. Expected costs and health outcomes over 5 years from a decision to change from existing practice to a best practice policy in which all patients with fractured neck of femur received the same fixation method based on age and type of arthroplasty are estimated. The model was populated using prevalence and incidence data from the Australian Orthopedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry, costs from Metro North Hospital and Health Service in Queensland, and probabilities and utilities from the literature. We simulated the uncertainties in outcomes with probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found that uncemented stem procedures were more costly and provided worse health outcomes compared to cemented stem fixation for hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty for all age groups. Moving from existing practice to cemented stem arthroplasty could save the Australian health system $2.0 million over 5 years with a gain of 203 quality-adjusted life years. CONCLUSION: We suggest that consideration be given to cemented fixation of the femoral stem for patients receiving both hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty for fractured neck of femur. Best practice guidelines focused on cost-effectiveness should recommend cemented stem fixation to both save costs and improve patient quality of life. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

24082,Fixation Method for Hip Arthroplasty Stem Following Hip Fracture: A Population-Level Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroplasty is increasing in Australia. The number of procedures for fractured neck of femur was 7500 in 2017. Best practices for fixation method and procedure type require scrutiny. This paper is about the costs and health outcomes of cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty at a national level. METHODS: We created a Markov model for patients <75, aged 75-85, and over 85. Expected costs and health outcomes over 5 years from a decision to change from existing practice to a best practice policy in which all patients with fractured neck of femur received the same fixation method based on age and type of arthroplasty are estimated. The model was populated using prevalence and incidence data from the Australian Orthopedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry, costs from Metro North Hospital and Health Service in Queensland, and probabilities and utilities from the literature. We simulated the uncertainties in outcomes with probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found that uncemented stem procedures were more costly and provided worse health outcomes compared to cemented stem fixation for hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty for all age groups. Moving from existing practice to cemented stem arthroplasty could save the Australian health system $2.0 million over 5 years with a gain of 203 quality-adjusted life years. CONCLUSION: We suggest that consideration be given to cemented fixation of the femoral stem for patients receiving both hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty for fractured neck of femur. Best practice guidelines focused on cost-effectiveness should recommend cemented stem fixation to both save costs and improve patient quality of life. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

24083,The Cost-Effectiveness of Lifestyle Interventions for Preventing Diabetes in a Health Resource-Limited Setting,"Aims: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a health challenge in China, and the economic outcomes of lifestyle intervention are critically important for policymakers. This study estimates the lifetime economic outcomes of lifestyle intervention among the prediabetic population in the Chinese context. Methods: We developed a mathematical model to compare the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle intervention and no prevention in the prediabetic population. Efficacy and safety, medical expenditure, and utility data were derived from the literature, which was assigned to model variables for estimating the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The analysis was conducted from the perspective of Chinese healthcare service providers. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Compared with no prevention, lifestyle intervention averted 9.53% of T2DM, which translated into an additional 0.52 QALYs at a saved cost of $700 by substantially reducing the probabilities of macro- and microvascular diseases. This finding indicated that lifestyle intervention was a dominant strategy. The sensitivity analyses showed the model outputs were robust. Conclusions: Lifestyle intervention is a very cost-effective alternative for prediabetic subjects and worth implementing in the Chinese healthcare system to reduce the disease burden related to T2DM.

Methods: A Markov model, which was developed with 2-week cycles and 1-year time horizon from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Administration perspective, consisted of three health states: ""mild,"" ""moderate,"" and ""severe"" pain. Average daily pain score (ADPS) was assessed at the end of each cycle. Patients either remained in, or transitioned from, their assigned health state to a different state according to their pain score changes. All patients entered the model in ""moderate"" (4 <= ADPS <7) or ""severe"" (7 <= ADPS <= 10) pain health states. Efficacy data was informed by the pivotal Phase III trial, or by a network meta-analysis (NMA). Utility values were obtained from published literature and cost data from Taiwanese clinical experts and the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration, using 2018 New Taiwan dollar (NT$). Probabilistic analysis was conducted to test the robustness of base case results. Results: Head-to-head analysis showed mirogabalin 30 mg to be cost-effective versus placebo in PHN.

24088,Daily almond consumption in cardiovascular disease prevention via LDL-C change in the U.S. population: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the health claim that 1.5 oz (42.5 g) of nut intake may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have focused on the cost-effectiveness of other foods or dietary factors on primary cardiovascular disease prevention, yet not in almond consumption. This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of almond consumption in cardiovascular disease primary prevention. PERSPECTIVE & SETTING: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of consuming 42.5 g of almond from the U.S. healthcare sector perspective. METHODS: A decision model was developed for 42.5 g of almond per day versus no almond consumption and cardiovascular disease in the U.S. POPULATION: Parameters in the model were derived from the literature, which included the probabilities of increasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, developing acute myocardial infarction and stroke, treating acute myocardial infarction, dying from the disease and surgery, as well as the costs of the disease and procedures in the U.S. population, and the quality-adjusted life years. The cost of almonds was based on the current price in the U.S. market. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for different levels of willingness-to-pay, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ten-year risk prevention, different costs of procedures and almond prices, and patients with or without cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: The almond strategy had $363 lower cost and 0.02 higher quality-adjusted life years gain compared to the non-almond strategy in the base-case model. The annual net monetary benefit of almond consumption was $1421 higher per person than no almond consumption, when the willingness to pay threshold was set at $50,000 for annual health care expenditure. Almond was more cost-effective than non-almond in cardiovascular disease prevention in all the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Consuming 42.5 g of almonds per day is a cost-effective approach to prevent cardiovascular disease in the short term and potentially in the long term.",2020-01-33808,0,BMC Public Health,J Wang,2020,20 /,558,No,Not Stated,"J Wang; Bravatti Lee; EJ Johnson; G Raman; Daily almond consumption in cardiovascular disease prevention via LDL-C change in the U.S. population: a cost-effectiveness analysis, BMC Public Health, 2020; 20():1471-2458; 558",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,almond consumption vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"1 Year, 10 years",Not Stated,Not Stated,-18150,United States,2012,-20459.68
24089,Cost-effectiveness microsimulation of catheter-directed thrombolysis in submassive pulmonary embolism using a right ventricular function model,"Approximately 30-50% of hemodynamically stable patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. These patients are classified as submassive PE and the role of reperfusion therapy remains unclear. We sought to identify the circumstances under which catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) would represent high-value care for submassive PE. We used a computer-based, individual-level, state-transition model with one million simulated patients to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the treatment of submassive PE with CDT followed by anticoagulation to treatment with anticoagulation alone. Because RV function impacts prognosis and is commonly used in PE outcomes research, our model used RV dysfunction to differentiate health states. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to quantify model uncertainty. Our base case analysis generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $119,326 per quality adjusted life year. Sensitivity analyses resulted in ICERs consistent with high-value care when CDT conferred a reduction in the absolute probability of RV dysfunction of 3.5% or more. CDT yielded low-value ICERs if the absolute reduction was less than 1.56%. Our model suggests that catheter-directed thrombolytics represents high-value care compared to anticoagulation alone when CDT offers an absolute improvement in RV dysfunction of 3.5% or more, but there is substantial uncertainly around these results. We estimated the monetary value of clarifying the costs and consequences surrounding RV dysfunction after submassive PE to be approximately $268 million annually, suggesting further research in this area could be highly valuable.",2020-01-33818,0,J Thromb Thrombolysis,SE Mason,2020,49 /,673-680,No,Not Stated,"SE Mason; J Zhu; FN Rahaghi; GR Washko; A Pandya; Cost-effectiveness microsimulation of catheter-directed thrombolysis in submassive pulmonary embolism using a right ventricular function model, J Thromb Thrombolysis, 2020; 49():1573-742X; 673-680",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,catheter directed thrombolysis + anticoagulation treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- anticoagulation,submassive pulmonary embolism,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,119326,United States,2017,125990.87
24090,Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing to Model Cost Utility of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Pathways in Microvascular Breast Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs are being used increasingly in microvascular breast reconstruction. However, it is unclear as to what extent the benefits outweigh the costs. We hypothesized that an ERAS pathway for microvascular breast reconstruction would be cost-effective relative to the standard of care. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was made incorporating clinically relevant health states after microvascular breast reconstruction with ERAS vs standard of care. Probabilities and utility scores were abstracted from published sources, and a third-party payer perspective was adopted. Time-driven activity-based costing was used to map and estimate costs attributed to ERAS. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The results of 5 studies, totaling 986 patients, were pooled to generate health state probabilities. ERAS was found to be dominant, being both less expensive and more effective than standard of care. On sensitivity analysis, ERAS becomes cost-ineffective (incremental cost-utility ratio > $50,000/quality-adjusted life year) at an amount > $19,336.75. Length of stay would have to be reduced from 5.96 days to 3.36 days for standard of care to become cost-effective. Monte-Carlo analysis demonstrated ERAS to be the more cost-effective option across a range of willingness-to-pay values. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased medication and personnel costs attributed to ERAS, it is less costly overall and associated with superior outcomes compared with standard of care. These findings lend additional support to the value of ERAS implementation in microvascular breast reconstruction. Time-driven activity-based costing provides granular estimates and are useful in quality-improvement initiatives. Copyright © 2020 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

24091,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Feeding Guidelines for Infants Following Intestinal Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of postoperative feeding guidelines to reduce complications in infants with intestinal surgery compared to standard feeding practices. METHODS: Using outcomes from a cohort study, Markov models from health care and societal perspectives simulated costs per hospitalization among infants fed via guidelines versus standard practice. Short-term outcomes included intestinal failure-associated liver disease, necrotizing enterocolitis after feeding, sepsis, and mortality. Effectiveness was measured as length of stay. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) compared cost over length of stay. Univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses with 10,000 Monte Carlo Simulations were performed. A second decision tree model captured the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using utilities associated with long-term outcomes (liver cirrhosis and transplantation). RESULTS: In the hospital perspective, standard feeding had a cost of $31,258,902 and 8296 hospital days, and the feeding guidelines had a cost of $29,295,553 and 8096 hospital days. The ICER was $-9832 per hospital stay with guideline use. More than 90% of the ICERs were in the dominant quadrant. Results were similar for the societal perspective. Long-term costs and utilities in the guideline group were $2830 and 0.91, respectively, versus $4030 and 0.90, resulting in an ICER of $-91,756/QALY. CONCLUSION: In our models, feeding guideline use resulted in cost savings and reduction in hospital stay in the short-term and cost savings and an increase in QALYs in the long-term.

24092,Comparative cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib as second-line therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in Germany and the United States,"BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the Federal Drug Administration as an option for sorafenib-resistant advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, increasing overall survival and progression-free survival compared with placebo. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib in the second-line setting for patients with an advanced hepatocellular carcinoma from the German statutory health insurance perspective compared with an US scenario using US prices. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of cabozantinib with best supportive care in the second-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma over a lifetime horizon. Health outcomes were measured in discounted life years and discounted quality-adjusted life years. Survival probabilities were estimated using parametric survival distributions based on CELESTIAL trial data. Utilities were derived from the literature. Costs contained drugs, monitoring and adverse events measured in US Dollars. Model robustness was addressed in univariable, scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cabozantinib generated a gain of 0.18 life years (0.15 quality-adjusted life years) compared with best supportive care. The total mean cost per patient was $56,621 for cabozantinib and $2064 for best supportive care in the German model resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for cabozantinib of $306,778/life year and $375,470/quality-adjusted life year.

24094,Favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for lung cancer screening in Italy,"OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer detection by low-dose computed tomographic screening reduces mortality. However, it is essential to assess cost-effectiveness. We present a cost-effectiveness analysis of screening in Italians at high risk of lung cancer, from the point of view of the Italian tax-payer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a decision model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of annual screening for 5 years in smokers (>=30 pack-years) of 55-79 years. Patients diagnosed in the COSMOS study were the screening arm; patients diagnosed and treated for lung cancer in the Lombardy Region, Italy, constituted the usual care arm. Treatment costs were extracted from our hospital database. Lung cancer survival in screened patients was adjusted for 2-year lead-time bias. Life-years and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated by stage at diagnosis, from which incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gained were estimated. RESULTS: Base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 3297 and 2944 euro per quality-adjusted life-year and life-year gained, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that these values were particularly sensitive to lung cancer prevalence, screening sensitivity and specificity, screening cost, and treatment costs for stage I and IV disease. From the probabilistic sensitivity analysis incremental cost-effectiveness ratios had a 98 % probability of being <25,000 euro (widely-accepted threshold) and a 55 % probability of being <5000 euro. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose computed tomographic screening is associated with an incremental cost of 2944 euro per life-year gained in high risk population, implying that screening can be introduced in Italy at contained cost, saving the lives of many lung cancer patients.

24095,Cost-Effectiveness of Tafamidis Therapy for Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy,"BACKGROUND: In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, tafamidis reduces all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations and slows decline in quality of life compared with placebo. In May 2019, tafamidis received expedited approval from the US Food and Drug Administration as a breakthrough drug for a rare disease. However, at $225 000 per year, it is the most expensive cardiovascular drug ever launched in the United States, and its long-term cost-effectiveness and budget impact are uncertain. We therefore aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tafamidis and its potential effect on US health care spending. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of patients with wild-type or variant transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy and heart failure (mean age, 74.5 years) using inputs from the ATTR-ACT trial (Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial), published literature, US Food and Drug Administration review documents, healthcare claims, and national survey data. We compared no disease-specific treatment (""usual care"") with tafamidis therapy. The model reproduced 30-month survival, quality of life, and cardiovascular hospitalization rates observed in ATTR-ACT; future projections used a parametric survival model in the control arm, with constant hazards reduction in the tafamidis arm. We discounted future costs and quality-adjusted life-years by 3% annually and examined key parameter uncertainty using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The main outcomes were lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and annual budget impact, assessed from the US healthcare sector perspective. This study was independent of the ATTR-ACT trial sponsor. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, tafamidis was projected to add 1.29 (95% uncertainty interval, 0.47-1.75) quality-adjusted life-years at an incremental cost of $1 135 000 (872 000-1 377 000), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $880 000 (697 000-1 564 000) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Assuming a threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained and current drug price, tafamidis was cost-effective in 0% of 10 000 probabilistic simulations. A 92.6% price reduction from $225 000 to $16 563 would be necessary to make tafamidis cost-effective at $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year. Results were sensitive to assumptions related to long-term effectiveness of tafamidis. Treating all eligible patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in the United States with tafamidis (n=120 000) was estimated to increase annual healthcare spending by $32.3 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tafamidis is projected to produce substantial clinical benefit but would greatly exceed conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds at the current US list price. On the basis of recent US experience with high-cost cardiovascular medications, access to and uptake of this effective therapy may be limited unless there is a large reduction in drug costs.",2020-01-33835,0,Circulation,DS Kazi,2020,141 /,1214-1224,No,Not Stated,"DS Kazi; BK Bellows; SJ Baron; C Shen; DJ Cohen; JA Spertus; RW Yeh; SV Arnold; BW Sperry; MS Maurer; SJ Shah; Cost-Effectiveness of Tafamidis Therapy for Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy, Circulation, 2020; 141():0009-7322; 1214-1224",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,tafamidis vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,Not Stated,90 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 30 months",3.00,3.00,880000,United States,2019,890856.42
24096,"Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis is common in older people, but the effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy in this group is unclear. We tested whether oral sodium bicarbonate provides net health benefit for older people with advanced chronic kidney disease and serum bicarbonate concentrations < 22 mmol/L. METHODS: Pragmatic multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. We recruited adults aged >= 60 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, not receiving dialysis, with serum bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/L, from 27 nephrology and geriatric medicine departments in the UK. Participants received oral sodium bicarbonate (up to 3 g/day) or matching placebo given for up to 2 years, randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was between-group difference in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at 12 months, adjusted for baseline values, analysed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes included generic and disease-specific quality of life (EQ-5D and KDQoL tools), anthropometry, renal function, walk distance, blood pressure, bone and vascular health markers, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. RESULTS: We randomised 300 participants between May 2013 and February 2017, mean age 74 years, 86 (29%) female. At 12 months, 116/152 (76%) participants allocated to bicarbonate and 104/148 (70%) allocated to placebo were assessed; primary outcome data were available for 187 participants. We found no significant treatment effect for the SPPB: bicarbonate arm 8.3 (SD 2.5) points, placebo arm 8.8 (SD 2.2) and adjusted treatment effect - 0.4 (95% CI - 0.9 to 0.1, p = 0.15). We found no significant treatment effect for glomerular filtration rate (0.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI - 0.8 to 2.0, p = 0.39). The bicarbonate arm showed higher costs and lower quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D-3L tool over 1 year (564 [95% CI 88 to 1154]); placebo dominated bicarbonate under all sensitivity analyses. Adverse events were more frequent in those randomised to bicarbonate (457 versus 400). CONCLUSIONS: Oral sodium bicarbonate did not improve physical function or renal function, increased adverse events and is unlikely to be cost-effective for use by the UK NHS for this patient group.

24097,Volar Plate Fixation in Adults with a Displaced Extra-Articular Distal Radial Fracture Is Cost-Effective,"BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, a health economic evaluation of volar plate fixation compared with plaster immobilization in patients with a displaced extra-articular distal radial fracture has not been previously conducted. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to volar plate fixation or plaster immobilization. The use of resources per patient was documented prospectively for up to 12 months after randomization and included direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect non-medical costs due to the distal radial fracture and the received treatment. RESULTS: The mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 12 months were higher in patients treated with volar plate fixation (mean QALY difference, 0.16 [bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.07 to 0.27]). (The 95% CIs throughout are bias-corrected and accelerated.) In addition, the mean total costs per patient were lower in patients treated with volar plate fixation (mean difference, -$299 [95% CI, -$1,880 to $1,024]). The difference in costs per QALY was -$1,838 (95% CI, -$12,604 to $9,787), in favor of volar plate fixation. In a subgroup analysis of patients who had paid employment, the difference in costs per QALY favored volar plate fixation by -$7,459 (95% CI, -$23,919 to $3,233). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with a displaced extra-articular distal radial fracture, volar plate fixation is a cost-effective intervention, especially in patients who had paid employment. Besides its better functional results, volar plate fixation is less expensive and provides a better quality of life than plaster immobilization. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic Level I.

24098,Estimating the price at which hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antivirals would be cost-saving in Japan,"In Japan, 1.5-2 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. New direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) offer an unprecedented opportunity to cure HCV. While the price of HCV treatment decreased recently in most countries, it remains one of the highest in Japan. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment in patients of different age groups and to estimate the price at which DAAs become cost-saving in Japan. A previously developed microsimulation model was adapted to the Japanese population and updated with Japan-specific health utilities and costs. Our model showed that compared with no treatment, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DAAs at a price USD 41,046 per treatment was USD 9,080 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 60-year-old patients. HCV treatment became cost-effective after 9 years of starting treatment. However, if the price of DAAs is reduced by 55-85% (USD 6,730 to 17,720), HCV treatment would be cost-saving within a 5 to 20-year time horizon, which should serve to increase the uptake of DAA-based HCV treatment.
