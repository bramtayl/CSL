14501,A cost-utility analysis of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in men with localized prostate cancer in Thailand,"OBJECTIVE: Robotic machines are being used with increasing frequency in the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer in Thailand. While robotics may offer some advantages, it remains unclear whether potential benefits offset higher costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare cost utility between standard and robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy from a health system perspective. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors created a care pathway and a model to facilitate a comprehensive cost utility analysis. All variables used in our model were derived from our review of the literature, exceptfor cost, utility for erectile dysfunction, and utility for urinary incontinence, which were derived from Chulalongkorn Hospital patient records. All costs described in this report are denominated in Thai baht, with a 2012 currency value. A positive margin was used to simulate the model. Sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the robustness of the outcome. RESULTS: Thailand utility values for erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence were 0.86 and 0.81, respectively. The cost of robotic laparoscopy was, on average, 120,359 baht (95% CI, 89,368-151,350 baht) higher than standard laparoscopy and was more effective with a mean gain of 0.05 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (95% CI, 0.03-0.08) for the 100 procedures performed each year. The incremental cost effectiveness (ICER) ratio was 2,407,180 baht per QALYs, with a very low probability that robotic prostatectomy would be cost effective at the Thai-willingness-to pay (WTP) threshold of 160,000 baht/ QALY. CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is not more cost effective than standard laparoscopic prostatectomy for the 100 cases performed each year. An increase in the number of cases may result in better economies of scale and a lower ICER, an outcome that may increase the overall value and cost effectiveness of an investment in this technology.",2015-01-18541,25764608,J Med Assoc Thai,Supoj Ratchanon,2015,98 Suppl 1 /,S14-20,No,25764608,"Supoj Ratchanon; Polporn Apiwattanasawee; Kriangsak Prasopsanti; A cost-utility analysis of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in men with localized prostate cancer in Thailand, J Med Assoc Thai, 2015 Jan; 98 Suppl 1():0125-2208; S14-20",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy vs. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,2407180,Thailand,2012,87394.15
14502,Saving lives and saving money: hospital-based violence intervention is cost-effective,"BACKGROUND: Victims of violence are at significant risk for injury recidivism, including fatality. We previously demonstrated that our hospital-based violence intervention program (VIP) resulted in a fourfold reduction in injury recidivism, avoiding trauma care costs of $41,000 per injury. Given limited trauma center resources, assessing cost-effectiveness of interventions is fundamental to inform use of these programs in other institutions. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of hospital-based VIP. METHODS: We used a decision tree and Markov disease state modeling to analyze cost utility for a hypothetical cohort of violently injured subjects, comparing VIP versus no VIP at a trauma center. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using differences in mortality and published health state utilities. Costs of trauma care and VIP were obtained from institutional data, and risk of recidivism with and without VIP were obtained from our trial. Outcomes were QALYs gained and net costs over a 5-year horizon. Sensitivity analyses examined the impact of uncertainty in input values on results. RESULTS: VIP results in an estimated 25.58 QALYs and net costs (program plus trauma care) of $5,892 per patient. Without VIP, these values are 25.34 and $5,923, respectively, suggesting that VIP yields substantial health benefits (24 QALYs) and savings ($4,100) if implemented for 100 individuals. In the sensitivity analysis, net QALYs gained with VIP nearly triple when the injury recidivism rate without VIP is highest. Cost-effectiveness remained robust over a range of values; $6,000 net cost savings occur when 5-year recidivism rate without VIP is at 7%. CONCLUSION: VIP costs less than having no VIP with significant gains in QALYs especially at anticipated program scale. Across a range of plausible values at which VIP would be less cost-effective (lower injury recidivism, cost of injury, and program effectiveness), VIP still results in acceptable cost per health outcome gained. VIP is effective and cost-effective and should be considered in any trauma center that takes care of violently injured patients. Our analyses can be used to estimate VIP costs and results in different settings.

14503,Individualized positron emission tomography-based isotoxic accelerated radiation therapy is cost-effective compared with conventional radiation therapy: a model-based evaluation,"PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term health effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET)-based isotoxic accelerated radiation therapy treatment (PET-ART) compared with conventional fixed-dose CT-based radiation therapy treatment (CRT) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our analysis uses a validated decision model, based on data of 200 NSCLC patients with inoperable stage I-IIIB. Clinical outcomes, resource use, costs, and utilities were obtained from the Maastro Clinic and the literature. Primary model outcomes were the difference in life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost/utility ratio (ICER and ICUR) of PET-ART versus CRT. Model outcomes were obtained from averaging the predictions for 50,000 simulated patients. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses were carried out. RESULTS: The average incremental costs per patient of PET-ART were euro569 (95% confidence interval [CI] euro-5327-euro6936) for 0.42 incremental LYs (95% CI 0.19-0.61) and 0.33 QALYs gained (95% CI 0.13-0.49). The base-case scenario resulted in an ICER of euro1360 per LY gained and an ICUR of euro1744 per QALY gained. The probabilistic analysis gave a 36% probability that PET-ART improves health outcomes at reduced costs and a 64% probability that PET-ART is more effective at slightly higher costs. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the available data, individualized PET-ART for NSCLC seems to be cost-effective compared with CRT.",2015-01-18561,25752401,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,Mathilda L Bongers,2015,91 / 4,857-65,No,25752401,"Mathilda L Bongers; Veerle M H Coupe; Dirk De Ruysscher; Cary Oberije; Philippe Lambin; Carin A Uyl-de Groot; Individualized positron emission tomography-based isotoxic accelerated radiation therapy is cost-effective compared with conventional radiation therapy: a model-based evaluation, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2015 Mar 15; 91(4):0360-3016; 857-65",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Positron emission tomography-based isotoxic accelerated radiation therapy treatment vs. Conventional fixed-dose CT-based radiation therapy treatment,With inoperable stage I-IIIB,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,1744,Euro,2012,2527.94
14504,An economic analysis of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in the treatment of new onset type 1 diabetes,"AIMS: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an emerging treatment option in new onset type 1 diabetes (T1DM), leading to a remission of the T1DM for a longer time period in up to 50 % of patients. The aim of the study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of this treatment option compared with standard insulin therapy. METHODS: The medical records of patients who had undergone immunoablation with AHSCT for new onset T1DM were analyzed for the cost-effectiveness of the treatment using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. RESULTS: The expected survival of patients with T1DM treated solely with insulin (without transplantation) was estimated to be 34.4 years, and their quality-adjusted survival was 13.8 QALY, whereas the expected survival of the patients treated with AHSCT was 34.9 years when the HbA1c benefit over standard treated patients lasted for 2, 35.4 years with 8-year benefit and even up to 40.3 years with the lifelong benefit scenario. Values under the threshold of ICER were reached after 8 years of sustained benefit in terms of HbA1c concentration. If discounting was not applied, the threshold values were reached after 3 years of HbA1c benefit over the standard group, independent of insulin use after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could be cost-effective in treating new onset T1DM, providing that the benefits of the transplantation lasted over 3-8 years, depending on application of discounting.",2015-01-18575,25744552,Acta Diabetol,Emilian Snarski,2015,52 / 5,881-8,No,25744552,"Emilian Snarski; Daria Szmurlo; Kazimierz Halaburda; Malgorzata Krol; Elzbieta Urbanowska; Alicja Milczarczyk; Edward Franek; Wieslaw Wiktor-Jedrzejczak; An economic analysis of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in the treatment of new onset type 1 diabetes, Acta Diabetol, 2015 Oct; 52(5):1432-5233; 881-8",QALY,Poland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard insulin therapy (daily dose of 0.69IU/kg),Not Stated,33 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 2 years",5.00,3.50,41915,Euro,2013,61847.21
14505,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Incretin Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes in Spain: 1.8 mg Liraglutide Versus Sitagliptin,"OBJECTIVES: Metformin is the first-line therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes, but the majority require treatment intensification at some stage due to the progressive nature of the disease. The 1860-LIRA-DPP-4 trial showed that liraglutide exhibited greater improvements compared with sitagliptin in glycated hemoglobin and body mass index in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. As a follow-up to a previously published cost-effectiveness analysis of 1.2 mg liraglutide versus sitagliptin in Spain, the aim of this analysis was to compare long-term projections of the clinical and cost implications associated with 1.8 mg liraglutide and sitagliptin. METHODS: For the modeling analysis, 52-week treatment effect data (as opposed to 26-week data in the previous analysis) were taken from the 1860-LIRA-DPP-4 trial, for adults with type 2 diabetes receiving 1.8 mg liraglutide or 100 mg sitagliptin daily in addition to metformin. Long-term (patient lifetime) projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2012 EUR) were made using a published and validated model of type 2 diabetes, with modeling assumptions as per the 1.2 mg liraglutide analysis. RESULTS: Liraglutide was associated with increased life expectancy (14.24 versus 13.87 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy [9.24 versus 8.84 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] over sitagliptin. Improved clinical outcomes were attributable to the improvement in glycemic control, leading to a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications, including renal disease, cardiovascular disease, ophthalmic and diabetic foot complications. Liraglutide was associated with increased direct costs (EUR 56,628 versus EUR 52,450), driven by increased pharmacy costs. Based on these estimates, liraglutide was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 10,436 per QALY gained versus sitagliptin. CONCLUSIONS: A previous analysis has suggested that 1.2 mg liraglutide is cost-effective from a healthcare payer perspective in Spain, and the present analysis suggests that the 1.8 mg dose is also likely to be cost-effective.",2015-01-18576,25742705,Diabetes Ther,Antonio Perez,2015,6 / 1,61-74,No,25742705,"Antonio Perez; Pedro Mezquita Raya; Antonio Ramirez de Arellano; Teresa Briones; Barnaby Hunt; William J Valentine; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Incretin Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes in Spain: 1.8 mg Liraglutide Versus Sitagliptin, Diabetes Ther, 2015 Mar; 6(1):1869-6953; 61-74",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,1.8 mg Liraglutide + metformin vs. 100 mg sitagliptin + metformin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5, 10, 20, 30 years",3.00,3.00,10436,Euro,2012,15127.07
14506,"Comparative Cost-effectiveness of the Baerveldt Implant, Trabeculectomy With Mitomycin, and Medical Treatment","IMPORTANCE: The Tube vs Trabeculectomy Trial (TVT) found that the 350-mm2 Baerveldt implant (tube) and trabeculectomy with mitomycin may be similarly effective in lowering intraocular pressure in primary open-angle glaucoma. However, to date, there are no published long-term clinical data on the cost-effectiveness of trabeculectomy with mitomycin vs tube insertion. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of these procedures compared with maximal medical treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the Markov cohort model with a 5-year time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients who required glaucoma surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, costs from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of medical treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion. Costs were identified from Medicare Current Procedural Terminology and Ambulatory Payment Classification reimbursement codes and Red Book medication costs. The QALYs were based on visual field and visual acuity outcomes. The hypothetical societal limit to resources was included using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY. Costs and utilities were discounted at 3% per year. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The mean costs for medical treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion were $6172, $7872 and $10 075, respectively; these amounts resulted in a cost difference of $1700 (95% CI, $1644-$1770) for medical treatment vs trabeculectomy, $3904 (95% CI, $3858-$3953) for medical treatment vs tube insertion, and $2203 (95% CI, $2121-$2261) for trabeculectomy vs tube insertion. The mean 5-year probability of blindness was 4% for both surgical procedures and 15% for medical treatment. The utility gained after medical treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion was 3.10, 3.30, and 3.38 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $8289 per QALY for trabeculectomy vs medical treatment, $13 896 per QALY for tube insertion vs medical treatment, and $29 055 per QALY for tube insertion vs trabeculectomy. The cost-effectiveness of each surgical procedure was most sensitive to early and late surgical failure rates and was minimally affected by adverse events, rates of visual field progression, or medication costs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assuming a willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, trabeculectomy and tube insertion are cost-effective compared with medical treatment alone.

Standard AD treatment provides marginal improvements in this domain. Recent reports, however, suggested that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may result in improved memory. Given significant equipment costs and health expenses required for DBS surgery, we determine clinical and economic thresholds required for it to be as effective as standard AD treatment. Literature review yielded annual AD progression probabilities, health-related quality of life (QoL), and costs by AD stage. Our 5-year decision analysis model compared cumulative QoL in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of standard therapy to theoretical DBS treatment of various success rates, using known complication rates and QoL data.

DBS success was defined as regression to and maintenance of minimal stage AD, which was defined as midway between mild and no dementia, for the first year, and continuation of the natural course of AD for the remaining 4 years. Compared to standard treatment alone, DBS for mild-stage AD requires a success rate of 3% to overcome effects of possible surgical complications on QoL. If DBS can be delivered with success rates above 20% ($200 K/QALY) or 74% ($50 K/QALY) for mild AD, it can be considered cost-effective.

14511,Cost-effectiveness of the 21-gene breast cancer assay in Mexico,"INTRODUCTION: The 21-gene breast cancer assay (Oncotype DX((R)); Genomic Health, Inc.) is a validated diagnostic test that predicts the likelihood of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit and 10-year risk of distant recurrence in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative, early-stage breast cancer. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the assay to inform adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in Mexico. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to make long-term projections of distant recurrence, survival, and direct costs in scenarios using conventional diagnostic procedures or the 21-gene assay to inform adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations. Transition probabilities and risk adjustment were taken from published landmark trials. Costs [2011 Mexican Pesos (MXN)] were estimated from an Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social perspective. Costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 5% annually. RESULTS: Following assay testing, approximately 66% of patients previously receiving chemotherapy were recommended to receive hormone therapy only after consideration of assay results. Furthermore, approximately 10% of those previously allocated hormone therapy alone had their recommendation changed to add chemotherapy. This optimized therapy allocation led to improved mean life expectancy by 0.068 years per patient and increased direct costs by MXN 1707 [2011 United States Dollars (USD) 129] per patient versus usual care. This is equated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MXN 25,244 (USD 1914) per life-year gained. CONCLUSION: In early-stage breast cancer patients in Mexico, guiding decision making on adjuvant therapy using the 21-gene assay was projected to improve life expectancy in comparison with the current standard of care, with an ICER of MXN 25,244 (USD 1914) per life-year gained, which is within the range generally considered cost-effective.",2015-01-18587,25740550,Adv Ther,Juan Enrique Bargallo-Rocha,2015,32 / 3,239-53,No,25740550,"Juan Enrique Bargallo-Rocha; Fernando Lara-Medina; Victor Perez-Sanchez; Rafael Vazquez-Romo; Cynthia Villarreal-Garza; Hector Martinez-Said; Robin J Shaw-Dulin; Alejandro Mohar-Betancourt; Barnaby Hunt; Juliette Plun-Favreau; William J Valentine; Cost-effectiveness of the 21-gene breast cancer assay in Mexico, Adv Ther, 2015 Mar; 32(3):0741-238X; 239-53",QALY,Mexico,Not Stated,Not Stated,21-gene assay to inform adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conventional diagnostic procedures,"Hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative",Not Stated,55 Years,Female,Full,40 Years,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,Mexico,2011,Not Stated

The purpose of our study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with that of total knee arthroplasty across the age spectrum of patients undergoing knee replacement. METHODS: Using a Markov decision analytic model, we compared unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with total knee arthroplasty with regard to lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from a societal perspective for patients undergoing surgery at forty-five, fifty-five, sixty-five, seventy-five, or eighty-five years of age. Transition probabilities were estimated from the literature; survival, from the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register; and costs, from the literature and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) database. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.0% annually. We conducted sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of model estimates and threshold analyses. RESULTS: For patients sixty-five years of age and older, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty dominated total knee arthroplasty, with lower lifetime costs and higher QALYs.

14519,Cost-effectiveness of Out-of-Hospital Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Acute Respiratory Failure,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the cost-effectiveness of out-of-hospital continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with standard care for adults presenting to emergency medical services with acute respiratory failure. METHODS: We developed an economic model using a United Kingdom health care system perspective to compare the costs and health outcomes of out-of-hospital CPAP to standard care (inhospital noninvasive ventilation) when applied to a hypothetical cohort of patients with acute respiratory failure. The model assigned each patient a probability of intubation or death, depending on the patient's characteristics and whether he or she had out-of-hospital CPAP or standard care. The patients who survived accrued lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health care costs according to their age and sex. Costs were accrued through intervention and hospital treatment costs, which depended on patient outcomes. All results were converted into US dollars, using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development purchasing power parities rates. RESULTS: Out-of-hospital CPAP was more effective than standard care but was also more expensive, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound20,514 per QALY ($29,720/QALY) and a 49.5% probability of being cost-effective at the pound20,000 per QALY ($29,000/QALY) threshold. The probability of out-of-hospital CPAP's being cost-effective at the pound20,000 per QALY ($29,000/QALY) threshold depended on the incidence of eligible patients and varied from 35.4% when a low estimate of incidence was used to 93.8% with a high estimate. Variation in the incidence of eligible patients also had a marked influence on the expected value of sample information for a future randomized trial. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of out-of-hospital CPAP is uncertain. The incidence of patients eligible for out-of-hospital CPAP appears to be the key determinant of cost-effectiveness.",2015-01-18600,25737210,Ann Emerg Med,Praveen Thokala,2015,65 / 5,556-563.e6,No,25737210,"Praveen Thokala; Steve Goodacre; Matt Ward; Jerry Penn-Ashman; Gavin D Perkins; Cost-effectiveness of Out-of-Hospital Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Acute Respiratory Failure, Ann Emerg Med, 2015 May; 65(5):0196-0644; 556-563.e6",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Out-of-hospital continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) vs. Standard/Usual Care- In hosptial noninvasive ventilation,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,20514,United Kingdom,2013,35648.47

The aim of the present study was to assess the cost- effectiveness of treatment with HAART in a large clinical cohort of naive adults to determine the potential role of single-tablet regimens in the management of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis was performed, including a quality-adjusted life year approach. RESULTS: In total, 741 patients (females comprising 25.5%) were retrospectively included. The mean age was 39 years, the mean CD4 cell count was 266 cells/muL, and the mean viral load was 192,821 copies/mL. The most commonly used backbone was tenofovir + emtricitabine (77.6%); zidovudine + lamivudine was used in 10%, lamivudine + abacavir in 3%, and other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) or NRTI-free regimens in 9.4% of patients. NNRTIs were used in 52.8% of cases, boosted protease inhibitors in 44.1%, and unboosted protease inhibitors and integrase inhibitors in 0.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Starting therapy at CD4 >500 cells/muL and CD4 351-500 cells/muL rather than at <201 cells/muL was the more cost-effective approach. The same consideration was not true comparing current indications with the possibility to start HAART at any CD4 value (eg, >500 cells per muL); in this case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio value was euro199,130 per quality-adjusted life year gained, a higher value than the one suggested in guidelines. The single-tablet regimen (STR) invariably dominated any other therapeutic approach. Sensitivity analysis was performed, and starting right away with an STR was cost-effective even when compared with therapeutic strategies contemplating STR as simplification. CONCLUSION: By integrating clinical data with economic variables, our study offers an estimate of the cost-effectiveness of the various first-line treatment strategies for patients infected with HIV and provides significant evidence to be used in future prospective pharmacoeconomic evaluations.",2015-01-18605,25733942,Patient Relat Outcome Meas,Franco Maggiolo,2015,6 /,53-60,No,25733942,"Franco Maggiolo; Giorgio L Colombo; Sergio Di Matteo; Giacomo M Bruno; Noemi Astuti; Elisa Di Filippo; Giulia Masini; Claudia Bernardini; Cost-effectiveness analysis of antiretroviral therapy in a cohort of HIV-infected patients starting first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy during 6 years of observation, Patient Relat Outcome Meas, 2015; 6():1179-271X; 53-60",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at CD4 count 201-350 vs. Standard/Usual Care,Treatment naïve,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-34243.64,Euro,2013,-50527.81

14527,Depression and pain: an appraisal of cost effectiveness and cost utility of antidepressants,"BACKGROUND: Although depression and chronic pain frequently co-occur, there is a lack of clarity in the literature regarding the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of antidepressants in the presence of these two conditions. From the perspective of healthcare provider, the current study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of antidepressants in a national cohort of depressed patients with and without comorbid pain conditions. METHODS: Adult patients prescribed with antidepressants for depression were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan (n=96,501). By using remission as effectiveness measure and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as utility measure, the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility were compared across selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), as well as by the presence of comorbid painful physical symptoms (PPS). RESULTS: SSRIs dominated SNRIs in both the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility regardless of comorbid PPS. In comparison with TCAs, SSRIs were likely to be the cost-effective option for patients without PPS. In patients with PPS, the cost-utility advantage for SSRIs over TCAs varied with threshold willingness-to-pay levels. Comorbid PPS may be considered an effect modifier of the cost-utility comparisons between SSRIs and TCAs. CONCLUSIONS: For depressed patients without PPS, SSRIs are likely to be cost-effective in improving remission rates and QALYs compared to TCAs and SNRIs.

RESULTS: SSRIs dominated SNRIs in both the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility regardless of comorbid PPS. In comparison with TCAs, SSRIs were likely to be the cost-effective option for patients without PPS. In patients with PPS, the cost-utility advantage for SSRIs over TCAs varied with threshold willingness-to-pay levels. Comorbid PPS may be considered an effect modifier of the cost-utility comparisons between SSRIs and TCAs. CONCLUSIONS: For depressed patients without PPS, SSRIs are likely to be cost-effective in improving remission rates and QALYs compared to TCAs and SNRIs. However, to improve cost-utility in those with comorbid PPS, people need to choose between SSRIs and TCAs according to threshold willingness-to-pay levels.

14533,Health economic evaluation of paricalcitol((R)) versus cinacalcet + calcitriol (oral) in Italy. [corrected],"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly morbid disorder. The most severe form of CKD is end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in which the patient requires some form of renal replacement therapy to survive. The increasing incidence, prevalence, and costs of ESRD are major national healthcare concerns. The objective of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness of two innovative therapies, paricalcitol versus cinacalcet + calcitriol (oral) in patients with CKD stage 5 (CKD 5) in the healthcare setting in Italy in 2013. METHODS: A Markov process model was developed employing data sources from the published literature, paricalcitol clinical trials, official Italian price/tariff lists, and national population statistics. The analysis is based on a comparison of treatment with paricalcitol versus cinacalcet + calcitriol (oral) in CKD 5. The perspective of the study was that of the payer [Italian National Health Service (INHS)]. The primary efficacy outcomes in the paricalcitol and cinacalcet + calcitriol (oral) clinical trials (reduction of secondary hyperparathyroidism, complications, and mortality) were extrapolated to effectiveness outcomes: number of life-years gained (LYG) and number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 3 %. RESULTS: The base-case analysis is based on a 5-year time horizon. From the INHS perspective, the use of paricalcitol leads to a cost saving of euro1,853 and an increase in LYG (0.136) and a gain in QALYs (0.089). Consequently, the use of paricalcitol is dominant over the use of combination cinacalcet + calcitriol (oral paricalcitol leads to cost savings and a higher effectiveness). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the favorable clinical benefit of paricalcitol results in positive health economic benefits. This study suggests that the use of paricalcitol in patients with ESRD may be cost effective from the perspective of the INHS.",2015-01-18622,25724153,Clin Drug Investig,Mark Nuijten,2015,35 / 4,229-38,Yes,25724153,"Mark Nuijten; Daniela P Roggeri; Alessandro Roggeri; Paolo Novelli; Thomas S Marshall; Health economic evaluation of paricalcitol((R)) versus cinacalcet + calcitriol (oral) in Italy.

14534,"Cost-effectiveness of routine varicella vaccination using the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine in France: an economic analysis based on a dynamic transmission model for varicella and herpes zoster","PURPOSE: Each year in France, varicella and zoster affect large numbers of children and adults, resulting in medical visits, hospitalizations for varicella- and zoster-related complications, and societal costs. Disease prevention by varicella vaccination is feasible, wherein a plausible option involves replacing the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine with the combined MMR and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. This study aimed to: (1) assess the cost-effectiveness of adding routine varicella vaccination through MMRV, using different vaccination strategies in France; and (2) address key uncertainties, such as the economic consequences of breakthrough varicella cases, the waning of vaccine-conferred protection, vaccination coverage, and indirect costs. METHODS: Based on the outputs of a dynamic transmission model that used data on epidemiology and costs from France, a cost-effectiveness model was built. A conservative approach was taken regarding the impact of varicella vaccination on zoster incidence by assuming the validity of the hypothesis of an age-specific boosting of immunity against varicella. FINDINGS: The model determined that routine MMRV vaccination is expected to be a cost-effective option, considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of euro20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved; routine vaccination was cost-saving from the societal perspective. Results were driven by a large decrease in varicella incidence despite a temporary initial increase in the number of zoster cases due to the assumption of exogenous boosting. In the scenario analyses, despite moderate changes in assumptions about incidence and costs, varicella vaccination remained a cost-effective option for France. IMPLICATIONS: Routine vaccination with MMRV was associated with high gains in quality-adjusted life-years, substantial reduction in the occurrences of varicella- and zoster-related complications, and few deaths due to varicella.

14536,Probabilistic Markov Model Estimating Cost Effectiveness of Methylphenidate Osmotic-Release Oral System Versus Immediate-Release Methylphenidate in Children and Adolescents: Which Information is Needed?,"BACKGROUND: Incidence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents has been increasing. The disorder results in high societal costs. Policymakers increasingly use health economic evaluations to inform decisions on competing treatments of ADHD. Yet, health economic evaluations of first-choice medication of ADHD in children and adolescents are scarce and generally do not include broader societal effects. OBJECTIVES: This study presents a probabilistic model and analysis of methylphenidate osmotic-release oral system (OROS) versus methylphenidate immediate-release (IR). We investigate and include relevant societal aspects in the analysis so as to provide cost-effectiveness estimates based on a broad societal perspective. METHODS: We enhanced an existing Markov model and determined the cost effectiveness of OROS versus IR for children and adolescents responding suboptimally to treatment with IR. Enhancements included screening of a broad literature base, updated utility values, inclusion of costs and effects on caregivers and a change of the model type from deterministic to probabilistic. RESULTS: The base case scenario resulted in lower incremental costs (euro-5815) of OROS compared with IR and higher incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains (0.22). Scenario analyses were performed to determine sensitivity to changes in transition rates, utility of caregivers, medical costs of caregivers and daily medication dose. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that, for children responding suboptimally to treatment with IR, the beneficial effect of OROS on compliance may be worth the additional costs of medication. The presented model adds to the health economic information available for policymakers and to considerations on a broader perspective in cost-effectiveness analyses.",2015-01-18641,25715975,Pharmacoeconomics,Saskia Schawo,2015,33 / 5,489-509,Yes,25715975,"Saskia Schawo; Annemarie van der Kolk; Clazien Bouwmans; Lieven Annemans; Maarten Postma; Jan Buitelaar; Michel van Agthoven; Leona Hakkaart-van Roijen; Probabilistic Markov Model Estimating Cost Effectiveness of Methylphenidate Osmotic-Release Oral System Versus Immediate-Release Methylphenidate in Children and Adolescents: Which Information is Needed?, Pharmacoeconomics, 2015 May; 33(5):1179-2027; 489-509",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Osmotic-release oral system (OROS) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Methylphenidate immediate-release (IR),Suboptimal response to immediate release methylphenidate,6 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Years,4.00,1.50,-26431.82,Euro,2014,-38422.85
14537,A pilot cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments in newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas: the example of 5-aminolevulinic Acid compared with white-light surgery,"BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas are aggressive, incurable tumors characterized by extensive diffuse invasion of the normal brain parenchyma. Novel therapies at best prolong survival; their costs are formidable and benefit is marginal. Economic restrictions thus require knowledge of the cost-effectiveness of treatments. Here, we show the cost-effectiveness of enhanced resections in malignant glioma surgery using a well-characterized tool for intraoperative tumor visualization, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 5-ALA fluorescence-guided neurosurgery compared with white-light surgery in adult patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma, adopting the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service. METHODS: We used a Markov model (cohort simulation). Transition probabilities were estimated with the use of data from 1 randomized clinical trial and 1 noninterventional prospective study. Utility values and resource use were obtained from published literature and expert opinion. Unit costs were taken from official Portuguese reimbursement lists (2012 values). The health outcomes considered were quality-adjusted life-years, life-years, and progression-free life-years. Extensive 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are below &OV0556;10 000 in all evaluated outcomes, being around &OV0556;9100 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, &OV0556;6700 per life-year gained, and &OV0556;8800 per progression-free life-year gained. The probability of 5-ALA fluorescence-guided surgery cost-effectiveness at a threshold of &OV0556;20000 is 96.0% for quality-adjusted life-year, 99.6% for life-year, and 98.8% for progression-free life-year.

14538,Cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in Hong Kong - A decision analysis,"Trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) selects one of the 2 co-circulating influenza B lineages whereas quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) includes both lineages. We examined potential cost-effectiveness of QIV versus TIV from perspectives of healthcare provider and society of Hong Kong. A decision tree was designed to simulate the outcomes of QIV vs. TIV in 6 age groups: 0-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15-64 years, 65-79 y and >/=80 years. Direct cost alone, direct and indirect costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss due to TIV-unmatched influenza B infection were simulated for each study arm. Outcome measure was incremental cost per QALY (ICER). In base-case analysis, QIV was more effective than TIV in all-age population with additional direct cost per QALY (ICER-direct cost) and additional total cost per QALY (ICER-total cost) of USD 22,603 and USD 12,558, respectively. Age-stratified analysis showed that QIV was cost-effective in age groups 6 months to 9 y and >/=80 years from provider's perspective, and it was cost-effective in all age group except 15-64 y from societal perspective. Percentage of TIV-unmatched influenza B in circulation and additional vaccine cost of QIV were key influential factors. From perspectives of healthcare provider and society, QIV was the preferred option in 52.77% and 66.94% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. QIV appears to be cost-effective in Hong Kong population, except for age group 15-64 years, from societal perspective.

14539,Utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy for solitary dermal melanomas,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Solitary dermal melanoma (SDM) is melanoma confined to subcutaneous and/or dermal layers in the absence of a known primary cutaneous lesion. We hypothesized that sentinel node biopsy is an effective staging strategy for this rare disease. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed to represent two management strategies for SDM: wide local excision followed by observation, and wide local excision followed by sentinel node biopsy. Utilities, likelihood of positive sentinel node biopsy, and cancer progression rates during a five year time horizon were assigned based on institutional data and a review of existing literature. Estimated costs were derived using Medicare reimbursements. RESULTS: Excision followed by sentinel node biopsy provides greater utility, yielding 3.85 discounted quality-adjusted life years (dQALY) compared to 3.66 for excision alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for sentinel node biopsy is $19,102 per dQALY. Sensitivity analyzes demonstrated that observation is more cost-effective if greater than 23% of sentinel node biopsies are positive (16% reported), or if 5-year survival for observed patients is greater than 76% (69% reported).

METHODS: A Markov model represented the possible health state transitions of Spanish postmenopausal women from initiation of fracture prevention treatment until age 100 years or death. The perspective was that of the Spanish National Health System. Fracture efficacy data for denosumab were taken from a randomized controlled trial. Fracture efficacy data for alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and strontium ranelate were taken from an independent meta-analysis. Data on the incidence of fractures in Spain were either taken from the published literature or derived from Swedish data after applying a correction factor based on the reported incidence from each country.

14544,Cost-utility of denosumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Spain,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of denosumab for fracture prevention compared with no treatment, generic bisphosphonates, and strontium ranelate in a cohort of osteoporotic postmenopausal women in Spain. METHODS: A Markov model represented the possible health state transitions of Spanish postmenopausal women from initiation of fracture prevention treatment until age 100 years or death. The perspective was that of the Spanish National Health System. Fracture efficacy data for denosumab were taken from a randomized controlled trial. Fracture efficacy data for alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and strontium ranelate were taken from an independent meta-analysis. Data on the incidence of fractures in Spain were either taken from the published literature or derived from Swedish data after applying a correction factor based on the reported incidence from each country. Resource use in each health state was obtained from the literature, or where no data had been published, conservative assumptions were made. Utility values for the various fracture health states were taken from published sources. The primary endpoints of the model were life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for denosumab against the comparators. RESULTS: Denosumab reduced the risk of fractures compared with either no treatment or the other active interventions, and produced the greatest gains in life-years and QALYs. With an annual acquisition cost of euro417.34 for denosumab, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for denosumab versus no treatment, alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate were estimated at euro6,823, euro16,294, euro4,895, and euro2,205 per QALY gained, respectively.

14545,Medicare's intensive behavioral therapy for obesity: an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Medicare coverage recently was expanded to include intensive behavioral therapy for obese individuals in primary care settings. PURPOSE: To examine the potential cost effectiveness of Medicare's intensive behavioral therapy for obesity, accounting for uncertainty in effectiveness and utilization. METHODS: A Markov simulation model of type 2 diabetes was used to estimate long-term health benefits and healthcare system costs of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity in the Medicare population without diabetes relative to an alternative of usual care. Cohort statistics were based on the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Model parameters were derived from the literature. Analyses were conducted in 2014 and reported in 2012 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: Based on assumptions for the maximal intervention effectiveness, intensive behavioral therapy is likely to be cost saving if costs per session equal the current reimbursement rate ($25.19) and will provide a cost-effectiveness ratio of $20,912 per quality-adjusted life-year if costs equal the rate for routine office visits. The intervention is less cost effective if it is less effective in primary care settings or if fewer intervention sessions are supplied by providers or used by participants. CONCLUSIONS: If the effectiveness of the intervention is similar to lifestyle interventions tested in other settings and costs per session equal the current reimbursement rate, intensive behavioral therapy for obesity offers good value. However, intervention effectiveness and the pattern of implementation and utilization strongly influence cost effectiveness. Given uncertainty regarding these factors, additional data might be collected to validate the modeling results.",2015-01-18669,25703178,Am J Prev Med,Thomas J Hoerger,2015,48 / 4,419-25,No,25703178,"Thomas J Hoerger; Wesley L Crouse; Xiaohui Zhuo; Edward W Gregg; Ann L Albright; Ping Zhang; Medicare's intensive behavioral therapy for obesity: an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis, Am J Prev Med, 2015 Apr; 48(4):0749-3797; 419-25",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive behavioral therapy to prevent diabetes vs. Standard/Usual Care,Medicare beneficiaries without diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-545.02,United States,2012,-614.38
14546,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery for Middle-Aged Men with Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Intolerant of CPAP,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Conventional OSA therapy necessitates indefinite continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Although CPAP is an effective treatment modality, up to 50% of OSA patients are intolerant of CPAP. We explore whether surgical modalities developed for those intolerant of CPAP are cost-effective. METHODS: We construct a lifetime semi-Markov model of OSA that accounts for observed increased risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and motor vehicle collisions for a 50-year-old male with untreated severe OSA. Using this model, we compare the cost-effectiveness of (1) no treatment, (2) CPAP only, and (3) CPAP followed by surgery (either palatopharyngeal reconstructive surgery [PPRS] or multilevel surgery [MLS]) for those intolerant to CPAP. RESULTS: Compared with the CPAP only strategy, CPAP followed by PPRS (CPAP-PPRS) adds 0.265 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for an increase of $2,767 (discounted 2010 dollars) and is highly cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $10,421/QALY for a 50-year-old male with severe OSA. Compared to a CPAP-PPRS strategy, the CPAP-MLS strategy adds 0.07 QALYs at an increase of $6,213 for an ICER of $84,199/QALY. The CPAP-PPRS strategy appears cost-effective over a wide range of parameter estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Palatopharyngeal reconstructive surgery appears cost-effective in middle-aged men with severe OSA intolerant of CPAP.

14549,Is procalcitonin-guided antimicrobial use cost-effective in adult patients with suspected bacterial infection and sepsis?,"OBJECTIVE: Procalcitonin has emerged as a promising biomarker of bacterial infection. Published literature demonstrates that use of procalcitonin testing and an associated treatment pathway reduces duration of antibiotic therapy without impacting mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the financial impact of utilizing a procalcitonin-guided treatment algorithm in hospitalized patients with sepsis. DESIGN: Cost-minimization and cost-utility analysis. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohort of adult ICU patients with suspected bacterial infection and sepsis. METHODS: Utilizing published clinical and economic data, a decision analytic model was developed from the U.S. hospital perspective. Effectiveness and utility measures were defined using cost-per-clinical episode and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Upper and lower sensitivity ranges were determined for all inputs. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of our model and variables. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and compared to predetermined willingness-to-pay thresholds. RESULTS: Base-case results predicted the use of a procalcitonin-guided treatment algorithm dominated standard care with improved quality (0.0002 QALYs) and decreased overall treatment costs ($65). The model was sensitive to a number of key variables that had the potential to impact results, including algorithm adherence (<42.3%), number and cost of procalcitonin tests ordered (>/=9 and >$46), days of antimicrobial reduction (<1.6 d), incidence of nephrotoxicity and rate of nephrotoxicity reduction. CONCLUSION: The combination of procalcitonin testing with an evidence-based treatment algorithm may improve patients' quality of life while decreasing costs in ICU patients with suspected bacterial infection and sepsis; however, results were highly dependent on a number of variables and assumptions.",2015-01-18685,25695167,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Michelle Harrison,2015,36 / 3,265-72,No,25695167,"Michelle Harrison; Curtis D Collins; Is procalcitonin-guided antimicrobial use cost-effective in adult patients with suspected bacterial infection and sepsis?, Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol, 2015 Mar; 36(3):0899-823X; 265-72",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Procalitonin-guided treatment algorithm vs. Standard/Usual Care,Adult ICU patients with suspected bacterial infection and sepsis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-325000,United States,2014,-355305.38
14550,Revisiting the cost-effectiveness of universal HPV-vaccination in Denmark accounting for all potentially vaccine preventable HPV-related diseases in males and females,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the consequences of a national immunization program with HPV vaccine for both boys and girls in Denmark, including the prophylactic effects on all potentially vaccine preventable HPV-associated diseases in male and female. METHODS: The study focussed on the quadrivalent vaccine which protects against HPV type 6, 11, 16 and 18, and the vaccine's protection against genital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, anogenital cancer (anal, penile, vaginal and vulvar cancer) and head and neck cancer (oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer) were included in the analyses. In general, the analysis was performed in two phases. First, an agent-based transmission model that described the HPV transmission without and with HPV vaccination was applied. Second, an analysis of the incremental costs and effects was performed. The model did not include naturally-acquired immunity to HPV in the simulations. RESULTS: In the base case result (i.e. vaccination of girls only, 85% vaccination rate, private market price at euro 123 per dose ex.

Continuation of bevacizumab beyond progression is an accepted standard of care based on a 1.4-month increase in median overall survival observed in a randomized trial. No United States-based cost-effectiveness modeling analyses are currently available addressing the use of bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer. Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab in the first-line setting and when continued beyond progression from the perspective of US payers. METHODS: We developed two Markov models to compare the cost and effectiveness of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab in the first-line treatment and subsequent fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan with or without bevacizumab in the second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Model robustness was addressed by univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Using bevacizumab in first-line therapy provided an additional 0.10 QALYs (0.14 life-years) at a cost of $59,361. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $571,240 per QALY. Continuing bevacizumab beyond progression provided an additional 0.11 QALYs (0.16 life-years) at a cost of $39,209. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $364,083 per QALY. In univariable sensitivity analyses, the variables with the greatest influence on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were bevacizumab cost, overall survival, and utility.

14559,Cost-effectiveness analysis of single fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy compared with single fraction of external beam radiation therapy for palliation of vertebral bone metastases,"PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been proposed for the palliation of painful vertebral bone metastases because higher radiation doses may result in superior and more durable pain control. A phase III clinical trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0631) comparing single fraction SBRT with single fraction external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in palliative treatment of painful vertebral bone metastases is now ongoing. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare these strategies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model, using a 1-month cycle over a lifetime horizon, was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of SBRT (16 or 18 Gy in 1 fraction) with that of 8 Gy in 1 fraction of EBRT. Transition probabilities, quality of life utilities, and costs associated with SBRT and EBRT were captured in the model. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement in 2014. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). To account for uncertainty, 1-way, 2-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Strategies were evaluated with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. RESULTS: Base case pain relief after the treatment was assumed as 20% higher in SBRT. Base case treatment costs for SBRT and EBRT were $9000 and $1087, respectively. In the base case analysis, SBRT resulted in an ICER of $124,552 per QALY gained. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to variation of the utility of unrelieved pain; the utility of relieved pain after initial treatment and median survival were also sensitive to variation. If median survival is >/=11 months, SBRT cost <$100,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: SBRT for palliation of vertebral bone metastases is not cost-effective compared with EBRT at a $100,000 per QALY gained WTP threshold. However, if median survival is >/=11 months, SBRT costs </=$100,000 per QALY gained, suggesting that selective SBRT use in patients with longer expected survival may be the most cost-effective approach.",2015-01-18718,25680599,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,Hayeon Kim,2015,91 / 3,556-63,No,25680599,"Hayeon Kim; Malolan S Rajagopalan; Sushil Beriwal; M Saiful Huq; Kenneth J Smith; Cost-effectiveness analysis of single fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy compared with single fraction of external beam radiation therapy for palliation of vertebral bone metastases, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2015 Mar 1; 91(3):0360-3016; 556-63",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stereotactic body radiation therapy vs. External beam radiation therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,124552,United States,2014,136166.14
14560,Cost utility of the treatment of stress urinary incontinence,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the cost utility of nonsurgical versus surgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). METHODS: A decision analysis model was created to compare nonsurgical and surgical treatment options for women with SUI. Decision paths included conservative management, pelvic floor physical therapy (pelvic floor muscle training [PFMT]), PFMT with electrical stimulation, incontinence pessary, and surgical treatment. A Markov model cohort analysis was performed with a cycle length of 1 year starting at age 45 years with a lifetime horizon. Probabilities, success rates, and utilities were obtained from the literature when available or by expert opinion. Cost-utility analysis was performed using US recommendations from a societal perspective. Cost data were obtained from Medicare reimbursement in 2012 US dollars. RESULTS: Incontinence pessary was the most cost-effective treatment option with a cost of $11,411 for 18.9 quality-adjusted life years. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000, incontinence pessary remained the most cost-effective treatment option. At a WTP threshold of $60,000, surgery became the most cost-effective treatment option. The PFMT and PFMT with electrical stimulation were dominated at any WTP threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical correction is likely the most cost-effective treatment option for young healthy women with SUI. Results are driven by the high success rate of minimally invasive slings. More studies are needed to define utility values for heath states experienced by women with SUI. This will enhance our ability to develop more accurate cost-utility models and offer the best treatment for women affected by incontinence.",2015-01-18719,25679355,Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg,Emily Von Bargen,2015,21 / 3,150-3,No,25679355,"Emily Von Bargen; Danielle Patterson; Cost utility of the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg, 2015 May-Jun; 21(3):2151-8378; 150-3",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Incontinence pessary vs. Midurethral slings,Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-159200,United States,2012,-179459.01

14566,Cost-effectiveness analysis of antiviral therapies for hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B patients in China,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several antiviral therapies are now available for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but the most cost-effective strategy for Chinese patients is unclear. The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term cost effectiveness of the antiviral treatments (lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine and entecavir) for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients in China. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the life-time (41-year time span) costs and effectiveness associated with antiviral treatments from the perspective of Chinese healthcare. Relative model parameters were derived from Chinese population studies. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at 5 %. The highest retail prices for generic and branded drug prices were also considered. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analysis were used to explore model uncertainties. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the least quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained with adefovir as the reference strategy. Lamivudine generated the highest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with an additional US$35,000 needed to gain one additional QALY for generic drugs and US$36,000 for branded drugs.

The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term cost effectiveness of the antiviral treatments (lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine and entecavir) for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients in China. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the life-time (41-year time span) costs and effectiveness associated with antiviral treatments from the perspective of Chinese healthcare. Relative model parameters were derived from Chinese population studies. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at 5 %. The highest retail prices for generic and branded drug prices were also considered. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analysis were used to explore model uncertainties. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the least quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained with adefovir as the reference strategy.

14569,Cost-effectiveness estimate of prehospital thrombolysis: results of the PHANTOM-S study,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of shorter delays to treatment and increased thrombolysis rate as shown in the PHANTOM-S (Prehospital Acute Neurological Treatment and Optimization of Medical Care in Stroke) Study. METHODS: In addition to intermediate outcomes (time to thrombolysis) and treatment rates, we registered all resource consequences of the intervention. The analyzed treatment effects of the intervention were restricted to distribution of IV thrombolysis (IVT) administrations according to time intervals. Intermediate outcomes were extrapolated to final outcomes according to numbers needed to treat derived from pooled IVT trials and translated to gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The net annual cost of the Stroke Emergency Mobile (STEMO) prehospital stroke concept was euro963,954. The higher frequency of IVT administrations per year (310 vs 225) and higher proportions of patients treated in the early time interval (within 90 minutes: 48.1% vs 37.4%; 91-180 minutes: 37.4% vs 50%; 181-270 minutes: 14.5% vs 12.8%) resulted in an annual expected health gain of avoidance of 18 cases of disability equaling 29.7 QALYs. This produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro32,456 per QALY.

14582,Economic analysis of ticagrelor therapy from a U.S. perspective: results from the PLATO study,"BACKGROUND: Based on results of the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial comparing ticagrelor with clopidogrel therapy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved ticagrelor in 2011 for reducing thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with the proviso that it be taken with low-dose aspirin. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the cost and cost effectiveness of ticagrelor therapy relative to clopidogrel in treating ACS patients from the perspective of the U.S. health care system. METHODS: We estimated within-trial resource use and costs using U.S. low-dose aspirin patients in PLATO (n = 547). Quality-adjusted life expectancy was estimated using the total PLATO population (n = 18,624), combined with baseline risk and long-term survival data from an external ACS patient cohort. Study drugs were valued at current costs. Cost effectiveness was assessed, as was the sensitivity of results to sampling and methodological uncertainties. RESULTS: One year of ticagrelor therapy, relative to that of generic clopidogrel, cost $29,665/quality-adjusted life-year gained, with 99% of bootstrap estimates falling under a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Results were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses, including variations in clopidogrel cost, exclusion of costs in extended years of life, and a recalibrated estimate of survival reflecting a lower underlying mortality risk in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: For PLATO-eligible ACS patients, a U.S. perspective comparison of the current standard of dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin with clopidogrel versus aspirin plus ticagrelor showed that the ticagrelor regimen increased life expectancy at an incremental cost well within accepted benchmarks of good value for money.

14589,"Economic analysis of thrombo inCode, a clinical-genetic function for assessing the risk of venous thromboembolism","BACKGROUND: Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) commonly have an underlying genetic predisposition. However, genetic tests nowadays in use have very low sensitivity for identifying subjects at risk of VTE. Thrombo inCode((R)) is a new genetic tool that has demonstrated very good sensitivity, thanks to very good coverage of the genetic variants that modify the function of the coagulation pathway. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic analysis of risk assessment of VTE from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System with Thrombo inCode((R)) (a clinical-genetic function for assessing the risk of VTE) versus the conventional/standard method used to date (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A). METHODS: An economic model was created from the National Health System perspective, using a decision tree in patients aged 45 years with a life expectancy of 81 years. The predictive capacity of VTE, based on identification of thrombophilia using Thrombo inCode((R)) and using the standard method, was obtained from two case-control studies conducted in two different populations (S. PAU and MARTHA; 1,451 patients in all). Although this is not always the case, patients who were identified as suffering from thrombophilia were subject to preventive treatment of VTE with warfarin, leading to a reduction in the number of VTE events and an increased risk of severe bleeding. The health state utilities (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and costs (in 2013 EUR values) were obtained from the literature and Spanish sources. RESULTS: On the basis of a price of EUR 180 for Thrombo inCode((R)), this would be the dominant option (more effective and with lower costs than the standard method) in both populations. The Monte Carlo probabilistic analyses indicate that the dominance would occur in 100 % of the simulations in both populations. The threshold price of Thrombo inCode((R)) needed to reach the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) generally accepted in Spain (EUR 30,000 per QALY gained) would be between EUR 3,950 (in the MARTHA population) and EUR 11,993 (in the S. PAU population). CONCLUSION: According to the economic model, Thrombo inCode((R)) is the dominant option in assessing the risk of VTE, compared with the standard method currently used.",2015-01-18775,25652150,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,C Rubio-Terres,2015,13 / 2,233-42,Yes,25652150,"C Rubio-Terres; J M Soria; P E Morange; J C Souto; P Suchon; J Mateo; N Saut; D Rubio-Rodriguez; J Sala; A Gracia; S Pich; E Salas; Economic analysis of thrombo inCode, a clinical-genetic function for assessing the risk of venous thromboembolism, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2015 Apr; 13(2):1179-1896; 233-42",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thrombo inCode: a clinical genetic function for assessing the risk of venous thromboembolism vs. Standard/Usual Care- Factor V Leiden (FVL),Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-5970.29,Euro,2013,-8809.39

Thrombo inCode((R)) is a new genetic tool that has demonstrated very good sensitivity, thanks to very good coverage of the genetic variants that modify the function of the coagulation pathway. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic analysis of risk assessment of VTE from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System with Thrombo inCode((R)) (a clinical-genetic function for assessing the risk of VTE) versus the conventional/standard method used to date (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A). METHODS: An economic model was created from the National Health System perspective, using a decision tree in patients aged 45 years with a life expectancy of 81 years. The predictive capacity of VTE, based on identification of thrombophilia using Thrombo inCode((R)) and using the standard method, was obtained from two case-control studies conducted in two different populations (S. PAU and MARTHA; 1,451 patients in all). Although this is not always the case, patients who were identified as suffering from thrombophilia were subject to preventive treatment of VTE with warfarin, leading to a reduction in the number of VTE events and an increased risk of severe bleeding. The health state utilities (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and costs (in 2013 EUR values) were obtained from the literature and Spanish sources. RESULTS: On the basis of a price of EUR 180 for Thrombo inCode((R)), this would be the dominant option (more effective and with lower costs than the standard method) in both populations. The Monte Carlo probabilistic analyses indicate that the dominance would occur in 100 % of the simulations in both populations. The threshold price of Thrombo inCode((R)) needed to reach the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) generally accepted in Spain (EUR 30,000 per QALY gained) would be between EUR 3,950 (in the MARTHA population) and EUR 11,993 (in the S. PAU population). CONCLUSION: According to the economic model, Thrombo inCode((R)) is the dominant option in assessing the risk of VTE, compared with the standard method currently used.",2015-01-18775,25652150,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,C Rubio-Terres,2015,13 / 2,233-42,Yes,25652150,"C Rubio-Terres; J M Soria; P E Morange; J C Souto; P Suchon; J Mateo; N Saut; D Rubio-Rodriguez; J Sala; A Gracia; S Pich; E Salas; Economic analysis of thrombo inCode, a clinical-genetic function for assessing the risk of venous thromboembolism, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2015 Apr; 13(2):1179-1896; 233-42",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thrombo inCode: a clinical genetic function for assessing the risk of venous thromboembolism vs. Standard/Usual Care- Factor V Leiden (FVL),Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-4764.67,Euro,2013,-7030.46
14591,A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Ferric Carboxymaltose in Patients With Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure in Spain,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment with ferric carboxymaltose improves symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ferric carboxymaltose treatment vs no treatment in these patients. METHODS: We used an economic model based on the Spanish National Health System, with a time horizon of 24 weeks. Patient characteristics and ferric carboxymaltose effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years) were taken from the Ferinject(R) Assessment in patients with IRon deficiency and chronic Heart Failure trial. Health care resource use and unit costs were taken either from Spanish sources, or from the above mentioned trial. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, patients treated with and without ferric carboxymaltose treatment acquired 0.335 and 0.298 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, representing a gain of 0.037 quality-adjusted life years for each treated patient. The cost per patient was euro824.17 and euro597.59, respectively, resulting in an additional cost of euro226.58 for each treated patient. The cost of gaining 1 quality adjusted life year with ferric carboxymaltose was euro6123.78. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. The probability of ferric carboxymaltose being cost-effective (< euro30 000 per quality-adjusted life year) and dominant (more effective and lower cost than no treatment) was 93.0% and 6.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ferric carboxymaltose in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency, with or without anemia, is cost-effective in Spain.",2015-01-18782,25649970,Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed),Josep Comin-Colet,2015,68 / 10,846-851,No,25649970,"Josep Comin-Colet; Dario Rubio-Rodriguez; Carlos Rubio-Terres; Cristina Enjuanes-Grau; Florian S Gutzwiller; Stefan D Anker; Piotr Ponikowski; A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Ferric Carboxymaltose in Patients With Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure in Spain, Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed), 2015 Oct; 68(10):1885-5857; 846-851",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) treatment vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,6123.78,Euro,2013,9035.87
14592,Robot-assisted surgery for kidney cancer increased access to a procedure that can reduce mortality and renal failure,"Surgeons increasingly use robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery for a variety of medical conditions. For hospitals, the acquisition and maintenance of a robot requires a significant investment, but financial returns are not linked to any improvement in long-term patient outcomes in the current reimbursement environment. Kidney cancer provides a useful case study for evaluating the long-term value that this innovation can provide. Kidney cancer is generally treated through partial or radical nephrectomy, with evidence favoring the former procedure for appropriate patients. We found that robot-assisted surgery increased access to partial nephrectomy and that partial nephrectomy reduced mortality and renal failure. The value of the benefits of robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery to patients, in terms of quality-adjusted life-years gained, outweighed the health care and surgical costs to patients and payers by a ratio of five to one. In addition, we found no evidence that the availability of robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery increased the likelihood that inappropriate patients received partial nephrectomy.",2015-01-18790,25646101,Health Aff (Millwood),Amitabh Chandra,2015,34 / 2,220-8,No,25646101,"Amitabh Chandra; Julia Thornton Snider; Yanyu Wu; Anupam Jena; Dana P Goldman; Robot-assisted surgery for kidney cancer increased access to a procedure that can reduce mortality and renal failure, Health Aff (Millwood), 2015 Feb; 34(2):0278-2715; 220-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Partial nephrectomy vs. Radical nephrectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated
14593,Economic analysis of the treatment of end-stage renal disease treatment: living-donor kidney transplantation versus hemodialysis,"INTRODUCTION: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major public health problem in the Spanish health system. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice, offering better survival and cost-effectiveness than other alternatives. This study aimed to compare the cost of living-donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) during the first year after transplantation with that of hemodialysis (HD). METHOD: A prospective, descriptive study of cost and efficacy was performed in the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona from January to December 2011. We included 106 patients (57 undergoing HD and 49 receiving a LDKT). The costs of LDKT (donor and recipient) and HD were calculated based on our economic database program. RESULTS: The mean age of recipients and donors was 46 +/- 15 and 52 +/- 10 years, respectively, and 67% of the recipients were men. In HD patients, the mean age was 67 +/- 11 years and 62% were men. The total cost of LDKT was euro29,897.91 (euro8,128.44 for donors and euro21,769.47 for recipients). The total cost of HD was euro43,000.88 (euro37,917 for HD and related procedures plus euro5,082 for transport). LDKT represented a savings of euro13,102.97 per patient/year and the payback period was less than 1 year. Quality-adjusted life years were higher in LDKT than in HD patients. CONCLUSION: LDKT is cost effective during the first year after transplantation and is associated with enhanced quality of life. From both the medical and economic points of view, pre-emptive LDKD should be encouraged in Spain to reduce the health budget for ESRD.",2015-01-18791,25645763,Transplant Proc,A Sanchez-Escuredo,2015,47 / 1,30-3,No,25645763,"A Sanchez-Escuredo; A Alsina; F Diekmann; I Revuelta; N Esforzado; M J Ricart; F Cofan; J V Torregrosa; J M Campistol; F Oppenheimer; E Fernandez; Economic analysis of the treatment of end-stage renal disease treatment: living-donor kidney transplantation versus hemodialysis, Transplant Proc, 2015 Jan-Feb; 47(1):0041-1345; 30-3",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Living-donor kidney transplantation vs. Hemodialysis,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-56969.43,Euro,2013,-84060.61
14594,Cost-utility comparison of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus primary debulking surgery for treatment of advanced-stage ovarian cancer in patients 65 years old or older,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment for advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) includes primary debulking surgery (PDS) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). A randomized controlled trial comparing these treatments resulted in comparable overall survival (OS). Studies report more complications and lower chemotherapy completion rates in patients 65 years old or older receiving PDS. We sought to evaluate the cost implications of NACT relative to PDS in AEOC patients 65 years old or older. STUDY DESIGN: A 5 year Markov model was created. Arm 1 modeled PDS followed by 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel (CT). Arm 2 modeled 3 cycles of CT, followed by interval debulking surgery and then 3 additional cycles of CT. Parameters included OS, surgical complications, probability of treatment initiation, treatment cost, and quality of life (QOL). OS was assumed to be equal based on the findings of the international randomized control trial. Differences in surgical complexity were accounted for in base surgical cost plus add-on procedure costs weighted by occurrence rates. Hospital cost was a weighted average of diagnosis-related group costs weighted by composite estimates of complication rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Assuming equal survival, NACT produces a cost savings of $5616. If PDS improved median OS by 1.5 months or longer, PDS would be cost effective (CE) at a $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold. If PDS improved OS by 3.2 months or longer, it would be CE at a $50,000 threshold. The model was robust to variation in costs and complication rates. Moderate decreases in the QOL with NACT would result in PDS being CE. CONCLUSION: A model based on the RCT comparing NACT and PDS showed NACT is a cost-saving treatment compared with PDS for AEOC in patients 65 years old or older. Small increases in OS with PDS or moderate declines in QOL with NACT would result in PDS being CE at the $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold. Our results support further evaluation of the effects of PDS on OS, QOL and complications in AEOC patients 65 years old or older.",2015-01-18797,25644442,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Michelle R Rowland,2015,212 / 6,763.e1-8,No,25644442,"Michelle R Rowland; Jamie L Lesnock; Coreen Farris; Joseph L Kelley; Thomas C Krivak; Cost-utility comparison of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus primary debulking surgery for treatment of advanced-stage ovarian cancer in patients 65 years old or older, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 2015 Jun; 212(6):0002-9378; 763.e1-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs. Primary debulking surgery,Advanced-stage,Not Stated,65 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated
14595,Bariatric Surgery can Lead to Net Cost Savings to Health Care Systems: Results from a Comprehensive European Decision Analytic Model,"BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the cost-utility of bariatric surgery in a lifetime horizon from a Swedish health care payer perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model using the Markov process was developed covering cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and surgical complications. Clinical effectiveness and safety were based on the literature and data from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. Gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding were included in the analysis. Cost data were obtained from Swedish sources. RESULTS: Bariatric surgery was cost saving in comparison with conservative management. It also led to a substantial reduction in lifetime risk of events: from a 16 % reduction in the risk of transient ischaemic attacks to a 62 % reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of <euro>8408 and generated an additional 0.8 years of life and 4.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, which translates into gains of 32,390 quality-adjusted person-years and savings of <euro>66 million for the cohort, operated in 2012. Analysis of the consequences of a 3-year delay in surgery provision showed that the overall lifetime cost of treatment may be increased in patients with diabetes or a body mass index >40 kg/m(2). Delays in surgery may also lead to a loss of clinical benefits: up to 0.6 life years and 1.2 QALYs per patient over a lifetime.

14596,Economic implications of intra-aortic balloon support for myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock: an analysis from the IABP-SHOCK II-trial,"BACKGROUND: The Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II (IABP-SHOCK II) trial has demonstrated the safety of intra-aortic balloon (IABP) support in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock, but no beneficial effect on mortality. Currently, intra-aortic balloon pumping is still the most widely used support device. However, little is known about the economic implications associated with this device. METHODS: Data of 600 patients included in the IABP-SHOCK II trial (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00491036) with follow-up at 30 days, 6 and 12 months were subjected to an economic analysis. Patients with cardiogenic shock complicating AMI were randomly assigned to IABP additionally to optimal medical therapy (OMT; n = 301) or OMT alone (n = 299) before early revascularization. Costs were calculated from the perspective of a German healthcare payer. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and reduction in New York Heart Association (NYHA) and Canadian Cardiac Society (CCS) class as effectiveness measures. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in overall costs between the IABP (33,155 +/- 14,593 <euro>) and the control group (32,538 +/- 14,031 <euro>, p < 0.00001). This was predominantly attributed to the IABP costs in the IABP (760 +/- 174 <euro>) versus control group (64 +/- 218 <euro>, p < 0.0001) whilst the intensive care unit costs did not differ between the groups (29,177 +/- 12,013 <euro> and 29,401 +/- 12,063 <euro>, p = 0.82). There was no significant difference in QALY or NYHA and CCS reduction, respectively (p = n.s.). CONCLUSION: IABP support is associated with higher healthcare costs as compared to conservative treatment regimens. Clinically, IABP support cannot generally be recommended in AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock in the absence of a mortality benefit. However, economically considering the relatively little contribution to overall costs generated by IABP therapy it may still be considered if clinical scenarios with an IABP-induced benefit may be identified in the future.",2015-01-18814,25637294,Clin Res Cardiol,Andreas Schuster,2015,104 / 7,566-73,No,25637294,"Andreas Schuster; Maggie Faulkner; Uwe Zeymer; Taoufik Ouarrak; Ingo Eitel; Steffen Desch; Gerd Hasenfuss; Holger Thiele; Economic implications of intra-aortic balloon support for myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock: an analysis from the IABP-SHOCK II-trial, Clin Res Cardiol, 2015 Jul; 104(7):1861-0684; 566-73",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II (IABP-SHOCK II) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Optimal medical therapy,With cardiogenic shock,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,61700,Euro,2014,89690.76
14597,Cost-utility analysis of botulinum toxin type A products for the treatment of cervical dystonia,"PURPOSE: A cost-utility analysis of botulinum toxin type A products for the treatment of cervical dystonia (CD) was conducted. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of botulinum toxin type A products was conducted from the U.S. government perspective using a decision-analysis model with a one-year time horizon. Probabilities of the model were taken from several studies using the three botulinum type A products approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CD: onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport), and incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin). The main outcome measurement was successful treatment response with botulinum toxin type A, measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Response was defined as a patient who experienced improvement of CD symptoms without a severe adverse event. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to test robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS: All three botulinum toxin type A agents were cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Xeomin was the most cost-effective with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,548 per QALY. Xeomin was dominant over the alternative agents with equivalent efficacy outcomes and lower costs. Dysport had the second lowest cost-effectiveness ratio ($36,678), followed by Botox ($49,337). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis supported the results of the base-case analysis. Dysport was associated with the lowest wastage (2.2%), followed by Xeomin (10%) and Botox (22.9%).

14599,Cost-effectiveness of hypertension therapy according to 2014 guidelines,"BACKGROUND: On the basis of the 2014 guidelines for hypertension therapy in the United States, many eligible adults remain untreated. We projected the cost-effectiveness of treating hypertension in U.S. adults according to the 2014 guidelines. METHODS: We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to simulate drug-treatment and monitoring costs, costs averted for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by treating previously untreated adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years from 2014 through 2024. We assessed cost-effectiveness according to age, hypertension level, and the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease or diabetes. RESULTS: The full implementation of the new hypertension guidelines would result in approximately 56,000 fewer cardiovascular events and 13,000 fewer deaths from cardiovascular causes annually, which would result in overall cost savings. The projections showed that the treatment of patients with existing cardiovascular disease or stage 2 hypertension would save lives and costs for men between the ages of 35 and 74 years and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years. The treatment of men or women with existing cardiovascular disease or men with stage 2 hypertension but without cardiovascular disease would remain cost-saving even if strategies to increase medication adherence doubled treatment costs. The treatment of stage 1 hypertension was cost-effective (defined as <$50,000 per QALY) for all men and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years, whereas treating women between the ages of 35 and 44 years with stage 1 hypertension but without cardiovascular disease had intermediate or low cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the 2014 hypertension guidelines for U.S. adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years could potentially prevent about 56,000 cardiovascular events and 13,000 deaths annually, while saving costs.
