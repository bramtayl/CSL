18801,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Bariatric Surgery for Morbid Obesity,"BACKGROUND: In the USA, three types of bariatric surgeries are widely performed, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). However, few economic evaluations of bariatric surgery are published. There is also scarcity of studies focusing on the LSG alone. Therefore, this study is evaluating the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery using LRYGB, LAGB, and LSG as treatment for morbid obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed over a lifetime horizon to simulate weight change, health consequences, and costs of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. US health care prospective was used. A model was propagated based on a report from the first report of the American College of Surgeons. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used in the model. Model parameters were estimated from publicly available databases and published literature. RESULTS: LRYGB was cost-effective with higher QALYs (17.07) and cost ($138,632) than LSG (16.56 QALYs; $138,925), LAGB (16.10 QALYs; $135,923), and no surgery (15.17 QALYs; $128,284). Sensitivity analysis showed initial cost of surgery and weight regain assumption were very sensitive to the variation in overall model parameters. Across patient groups, LRYGB remained the optimal bariatric technique, except that with morbid obesity 1 (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m(2)) patients, LSG was the optimal choice. CONCLUSION: LRYGB is the optimal bariatric technique, being the most cost-effective compared to LSG, LAGB, and no surgery options for most subgroups. However, LSG was the most cost-effective choice when initial BMI ranged between 35 and 39.9 kg/m(2).",2018-01-25656,29335933,Obes Surg,Adnan Alsumali,2018,/,,No,29335933,"Adnan Alsumali; Tewodros Eguale; Sigrid Bairdain; Mihail Samnaliev; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Bariatric Surgery for Morbid Obesity, Obes Surg, 2018 Jan 15; ():0960-8923",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Surgical,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding,Super obesity (BMI = 50 kg/m2),74 Years,18 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3,3,118,United States,2016,127.25

18813,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Bariatric Surgery for Morbid Obesity,"BACKGROUND: In the USA, three types of bariatric surgeries are widely performed, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). However, few economic evaluations of bariatric surgery are published. There is also scarcity of studies focusing on the LSG alone. Therefore, this study is evaluating the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery using LRYGB, LAGB, and LSG as treatment for morbid obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed over a lifetime horizon to simulate weight change, health consequences, and costs of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. US health care prospective was used. A model was propagated based on a report from the first report of the American College of Surgeons. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used in the model. Model parameters were estimated from publicly available databases and published literature. RESULTS: LRYGB was cost-effective with higher QALYs (17.07) and cost ($138,632) than LSG (16.56 QALYs; $138,925), LAGB (16.10 QALYs; $135,923), and no surgery (15.17 QALYs; $128,284).

18825,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Bariatric Surgery for Morbid Obesity,"BACKGROUND: In the USA, three types of bariatric surgeries are widely performed, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). However, few economic evaluations of bariatric surgery are published. There is also scarcity of studies focusing on the LSG alone. Therefore, this study is evaluating the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery using LRYGB, LAGB, and LSG as treatment for morbid obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed over a lifetime horizon to simulate weight change, health consequences, and costs of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. US health care prospective was used. A model was propagated based on a report from the first report of the American College of Surgeons. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used in the model. Model parameters were estimated from publicly available databases and published literature. RESULTS: LRYGB was cost-effective with higher QALYs (17.07) and cost ($138,632) than LSG (16.56 QALYs; $138,925), LAGB (16.10 QALYs; $135,923), and no surgery (15.17 QALYs; $128,284).

18837,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Bariatric Surgery for Morbid Obesity,"BACKGROUND: In the USA, three types of bariatric surgeries are widely performed, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). However, few economic evaluations of bariatric surgery are published. There is also scarcity of studies focusing on the LSG alone. Therefore, this study is evaluating the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery using LRYGB, LAGB, and LSG as treatment for morbid obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed over a lifetime horizon to simulate weight change, health consequences, and costs of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. US health care prospective was used. A model was propagated based on a report from the first report of the American College of Surgeons. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used in the model. Model parameters were estimated from publicly available databases and published literature. RESULTS: LRYGB was cost-effective with higher QALYs (17.07) and cost ($138,632) than LSG (16.56 QALYs; $138,925), LAGB (16.10 QALYs; $135,923), and no surgery (15.17 QALYs; $128,284).

18848,Adapting cervical cancer screening for women vaccinated against human papillomavirus infections: The value of stratifying guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Several countries have implemented vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) for adolescent girls and must decide whether and how to adapt cervical cancer (CC) screening for these low-risk women. We aimed to identify the optimal screening strategies for women vaccinated against HPV infections and quantify the amount that could be spent to identify vaccination status among women and stratify CC screening guidelines accordingly. METHODS: We used a mathematical model reflecting HPV-induced CC in Norway to project the long-term health benefits, resources and costs associated with 74 candidate-screening strategies that varied by screening test, start age and frequency. Strategies were considered separately for women vaccinated with the bivalent/quadrivalent (2/4vHPV) and nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccines. We used a cost-effectiveness framework (i.e. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefit) and a commonly-cited Norwegian willingness-to-pay threshold of euro75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: The most cost-effective screening strategy for 9vHPV- and 2/4vHPV-vaccinated women involved HPV testing once and twice per lifetime, respectively. The value of stratifying guidelines by vaccination status was euro599 (2/4vHPV) and euro725 (9vHPV) per vaccinated woman.

We aimed to identify the optimal screening strategies for women vaccinated against HPV infections and quantify the amount that could be spent to identify vaccination status among women and stratify CC screening guidelines accordingly. METHODS: We used a mathematical model reflecting HPV-induced CC in Norway to project the long-term health benefits, resources and costs associated with 74 candidate-screening strategies that varied by screening test, start age and frequency. Strategies were considered separately for women vaccinated with the bivalent/quadrivalent (2/4vHPV) and nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccines. We used a cost-effectiveness framework (i.e. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefit) and a commonly-cited Norwegian willingness-to-pay threshold of euro75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: The most cost-effective screening strategy for 9vHPV- and 2/4vHPV-vaccinated women involved HPV testing once and twice per lifetime, respectively.

We aimed to identify the optimal screening strategies for women vaccinated against HPV infections and quantify the amount that could be spent to identify vaccination status among women and stratify CC screening guidelines accordingly. METHODS: We used a mathematical model reflecting HPV-induced CC in Norway to project the long-term health benefits, resources and costs associated with 74 candidate-screening strategies that varied by screening test, start age and frequency. Strategies were considered separately for women vaccinated with the bivalent/quadrivalent (2/4vHPV) and nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccines. We used a cost-effectiveness framework (i.e. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefit) and a commonly-cited Norwegian willingness-to-pay threshold of euro75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: The most cost-effective screening strategy for 9vHPV- and 2/4vHPV-vaccinated women involved HPV testing once and twice per lifetime, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for enrolling PWID in PrEP. DESIGN: Dynamic network model that captures HIV transmission and progression among PWID in a representative US urban center.

18873,Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for provision of HIV preexposure prophylaxis for people who inject drugs,"BACKGROUND: Oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been recommended as a means of HIV prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID) but, at current prices, is unlikely to be cost-effective for all PWID. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for enrolling PWID in PrEP. DESIGN: Dynamic network model that captures HIV transmission and progression among PWID in a representative US urban center. OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV infections averted, discounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). INTERVENTION: We assume 25% PrEP coverage and investigate four strategies: 1) random PWID are enrolled (Unselected Enrollment); 2) individuals are randomly selected and enrolled together with their partners (Enroll Partners); 3) individuals with the highest number of sexual and needle-sharing partnerships are enrolled (Most Partners); 4) individuals with the greatest number of infected partners are enrolled (Most Positive Partners). RESULTS: PrEP can achieve significant health benefits: compared to the status quo of no PrEP, the strategies gain 1114 QALYs (Unselected Enrollment), 2194 QALYs (Enroll Partners), 2481 QALYs (Most Partners), and 3046 QALYs (Most Positive Partners) over 20 years in a population of approximately 8500 people. The ICER of each strategy compared to the status quo (cost per QALY gained) is $272,000 (Unselected Enrollment), $158,000 (Enroll Partners), $124,000 (Most Partners), and $101,000 (Most Positive Partners).

18889,Potential therapeutic and economic value of risk-stratified treatment as initial treatment of multiple myeloma in Europe,"Biomarkers associated with prognosis in multiple myeloma (MM) can be used to stratify patients into risk categories. An attractive alternative to uniform treatment (UT), risk-stratified treatment (RST) is proposed where high-risk patients receive bortezomib-based regimens while standard-risk patients receive alternative less costly regimens. An early Markov-type decision analytic model evaluated the potential therapeutic and economic value of different RST strategies compared with UT in MM patients in key European countries.

METHODS: The Cost-effectiveness was evaluated as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using direct costs and indirect costs which included loss of wages during the patient''s lifetime due to early death caused by viral hepatitis infection. QOL scores were determined by EQ-5D-3L questionnaire survey on 200 HCV patients in Hiroshima. RESULTS: The QOL scores for chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma were estimated as 0.871, 0.774, and 0.780, respectively. The elapsed time that the ICER of scenario-1 becomes shortest less than 6 million JPY was 25 years after treatment in men and women who started treatment at the age of 20-60.

18892,Cost Effectiveness of Gene Expression Profile Testing in Community Practice,"Purpose Gene expression profile (GEP) testing can support chemotherapy decision making for patients with early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative breast cancers. This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of one GEP test, Onco type DX (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA), in community practice with test-eligible patients age 40 to 79 years. Methods A simulation model compared 25-year societal incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of community Onco type DX use from 2005 to 2012 versus usual care in the pretesting era (2000 to 2004). Inputs included Onco type DX and chemotherapy data from an integrated health care system and national and published data on Onco type DX accuracy, chemotherapy effectiveness, utilities, survival and recurrence, and Medicare and patient costs. Sensitivity analyses varied individual parameters; results were also estimated for ideal conditions (ie, 100% testing and adherence to test-suggested treatment, perfect test accuracy, considering test effects on reassurance or worry, and lowest costs). Results Twenty-four percent of test-eligible patients had Onco type DX testing. Testing was higher in younger patients and patients with stage I disease ( v stage IIA), and 75.3% and 10.2% of patients with high and low recurrence risk scores received chemotherapy, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratio for testing ( v usual care) was $188,125 per QALY. Considering test effects on worry versus reassurance decreased the cost-effectiveness ratio to $58,431 per QALY. With perfect test accuracy, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $28,947 per QALY, and under ideal conditions, it was $39,496 per QALY. Conclusion GEP testing is likely to have a high cost-effectiveness ratio on the basis of community practice patterns. However, realistic variations in assumptions about key variables could result in GEP testing having cost-effectiveness ratios in the range of other accepted interventions. The differences in cost-effectiveness ratios on the basis of community versus ideal conditions underscore the importance of considering real-world implementation when assessing the new technology.",2018-01-25684,29309250,J Clin Oncol,Young Chandler,2018,/,JCO2017745034,No,29309250,"Young Chandler; Clyde B Schechter; Jinani Jayasekera; Aimee Near; Suzanne C O'Neill; Claudine Isaacs; Charles E Phelps; G Thomas Ray; Tracy A Lieu; Scott Ramsey; Jeanne S Mandelblatt; Cost Effectiveness of Gene Expression Profile Testing in Community Practice, J Clin Oncol, 2018 Jan 8; ():0732-183X; JCO2017745034",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,Oncotype DX Gene Expression Profile Testing - community practice vs. Standard/Usual Care- Usual care without test,"Stage I or IIA, ER-positive, HER2-negative; diagnosed between 2000 and 2012",79 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,25 Years,3,3,188125,United States,2015,205423.32
18893,Incremental cost-effectiveness of screening and laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema in Malawi,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the economic impact of introducing targeted screening and laser photocoagulation treatment for sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy and macular edema in a setting with no previous screening or laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy in sub-Saharan Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort Markov model was built to compare combined targeted screening and laser treatment for patients with sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy and macular edema against no intervention. Primary outcomes were incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Primary data were collected on 357 participants from the Malawi Diabetic Retinopathy Study, a prospective, observational cohort study. Multiple scenarios were explored and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: In the base case (age: 50 years, service utilization rate: 80%), the cost of the intervention and the years of severe visual impairment averted per patient screened were $209 and 2.2 years respectively. Applying the World Health Organization threshold of cost-effectiveness for Malawi ($679), the base case was cost-effective when QALYs were used ($400 per QALY gained) but not when DALYs were used ($766 per DALY averted). The intervention was more cost-effective when it targeted younger patients (age: 30 years) and less cost-effective when the utilization rate was lowered to 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Annual photographic screening of diabetic patients attending medical diabetes clinics in Malawi, with the provision of laser treatment for those with sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy and macular edema, appears to be cost-effective in terms of QALYs gained, in our base case scenario.

A new adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine (HZ/su) has higher efficacy but might be more expensive. The choice of vaccines depends on their relative values. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of HZ/su. Design, Setting, and Participants: Markov decision model with transition probabilities based on the US medical literature. Participants were immunocompetent adults 60 years or older. Data were derived from participant groups ranging in number from less than 100 to more than 30000 depending on the variable assessed.

Conclusions and Relevance: Under conservative assumptions, at a price of $280 per series ($140 per dose), HZ/su would cost less than ZVL and has a high probability of offering good value.",2018-01-25699,29297049,JAMA Intern Med,Phuc Le,2018,178 / 2,248-258,No,29297049,"Phuc Le; Michael B Rothberg; Cost-effectiveness of the Adjuvanted Herpes Zoster Subunit Vaccine in Older Adults, JAMA Intern Med, 2018 Feb 1; 178(2):2168-6114; 248-258",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Immunization,Live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine vs. Adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3,3,-266667,United States,2016,-287559.75
