18501,Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention portfolios for people who inject drugs in the United States: A model-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: The risks of HIV transmission associated with the opioid epidemic make cost-effective programs for people who inject drugs (PWID) a public health priority. Some of these programs have benefits beyond prevention of HIV-a critical consideration given that injection drug use is increasing across most United States demographic groups. To identify high-value HIV prevention program portfolios for US PWID, we consider combinations of four interventions with demonstrated efficacy: opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe programs (NSPs), HIV testing and treatment (Test & Treat), and oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We adapted an empirically calibrated dynamic compartmental model and used it to assess the discounted costs (in 2015 US dollars), health outcomes (HIV infections averted, change in HIV prevalence, and discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the four prevention programs, considered singly and in combination over a 20-y time horizon. We obtained epidemiologic, economic, and health utility parameter estimates from the literature, previously published models, and expert opinion. We estimate that expansions of OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat implemented singly up to 50% coverage levels can be cost-effective relative to the next highest coverage level (low, medium, and high at 40%, 45%, and 50%, respectively) and that OAT, which we assume to have immediate and direct health benefits for the individual, has the potential to be the highest value investment, even under scenarios where it prevents fewer infections than other programs. Although a model-based analysis can provide only estimates of health outcomes, we project that, over 20 y, 50% coverage with OAT could avert up to 22,000 (95% CI: 5,200, 46,000) infections and cost US$18,000 (95% CI: US$14,000, US$24,000) per QALY gained, 50% NSP coverage could avert up to 35,000 (95% CI: 8,900, 43,000) infections and cost US$25,000 (95% CI: US$7,000, US$76,000) per QALY gained, 50% Test & Treat coverage could avert up to 6,700 (95% CI: 1,200, 16,000) infections and cost US$27,000 (95% CI: US$15,000, US$48,000) per QALY gained, and 50% PrEP coverage could avert up to 37,000 (22,000, 58,000) infections and cost US$300,000 (95% CI: US$162,000, US$667,000) per QALY gained. When coverage expansions are allowed to include combined investment with other programs and are compared to the next best intervention, the model projects that scaling OAT coverage up to 50%, then scaling NSP coverage to 50%, then scaling Test & Treat coverage to 50% can be cost-effective, with each coverage expansion having the potential to cost less than US$50,000 per QALY gained relative to the next best portfolio. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 59% of portfolios prioritized the addition of OAT and 41% prioritized the addition of NSPs, while PrEP was not likely to be a priority nor a cost-effective addition. Our findings are intended to be illustrative, as data on achievable coverage are limited and, in practice, the expansion scenarios considered may exceed feasible levels. We assumed independence of interventions and constant returns to scale. Extensive sensitivity analyses allowed us to assess parameter sensitivity, but the use of a dynamic compartmental model limited the exploration of structural sensitivities. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat, implemented singly or in combination, have the potential to effectively and cost-effectively prevent HIV in US PWID. PrEP is not likely to be cost-effective in this population, based on the scenarios we evaluated. While local budgets or policy may constrain feasible coverage levels for the various interventions, our findings suggest that investments in combined prevention programs can substantially reduce HIV transmission and improve health outcomes among PWID.",2017-01-25484,28542184,PLoS Med,Cora L Bernard,2017,14 / 5,e1002312,No,28542184,"Cora L Bernard; Douglas K Owens; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Margaret L Brandeau; Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention portfolios for people who inject drugs in the United States: A model-based analysis, PLoS Med, 2017 May; 14(5):1549-1676; e1002312",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"High opioid agonist therapy coverage, low needle and syringe exchange program coverage vs. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT), 50% coverage of the eligible population",Not Stated,64 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,28000,United States,2015,30574.63

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We adapted an empirically calibrated dynamic compartmental model and used it to assess the discounted costs (in 2015 US dollars), health outcomes (HIV infections averted, change in HIV prevalence, and discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the four prevention programs, considered singly and in combination over a 20-y time horizon. We obtained epidemiologic, economic, and health utility parameter estimates from the literature, previously published models, and expert opinion. We estimate that expansions of OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat implemented singly up to 50% coverage levels can be cost-effective relative to the next highest coverage level (low, medium, and high at 40%, 45%, and 50%, respectively) and that OAT, which we assume to have immediate and direct health benefits for the individual, has the potential to be the highest value investment, even under scenarios where it prevents fewer infections than other programs. Although a model-based analysis can provide only estimates of health outcomes, we project that, over 20 y, 50% coverage with OAT could avert up to 22,000 (95% CI: 5,200, 46,000) infections and cost US$18,000 (95% CI: US$14,000, US$24,000) per QALY gained, 50% NSP coverage could avert up to 35,000 (95% CI: 8,900, 43,000) infections and cost US$25,000 (95% CI: US$7,000, US$76,000) per QALY gained, 50% Test & Treat coverage could avert up to 6,700 (95% CI: 1,200, 16,000) infections and cost US$27,000 (95% CI: US$15,000, US$48,000) per QALY gained, and 50% PrEP coverage could avert up to 37,000 (22,000, 58,000) infections and cost US$300,000 (95% CI: US$162,000, US$667,000) per QALY gained. When coverage expansions are allowed to include combined investment with other programs and are compared to the next best intervention, the model projects that scaling OAT coverage up to 50%, then scaling NSP coverage to 50%, then scaling Test & Treat coverage to 50% can be cost-effective, with each coverage expansion having the potential to cost less than US$50,000 per QALY gained relative to the next best portfolio. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 59% of portfolios prioritized the addition of OAT and 41% prioritized the addition of NSPs, while PrEP was not likely to be a priority nor a cost-effective addition. Our findings are intended to be illustrative, as data on achievable coverage are limited and, in practice, the expansion scenarios considered may exceed feasible levels. We assumed independence of interventions and constant returns to scale. Extensive sensitivity analyses allowed us to assess parameter sensitivity, but the use of a dynamic compartmental model limited the exploration of structural sensitivities. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat, implemented singly or in combination, have the potential to effectively and cost-effectively prevent HIV in US PWID. PrEP is not likely to be cost-effective in this population, based on the scenarios we evaluated.

18510,Cost-effectiveness of using recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone before radioiodine ablation for thyroid cancer treatment in Spanish hospitals,"OBJECTIVES: In thyroid cancer treatment, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) must be elevated before radioiodine ablation, either by exogenous (with recombinant human thyrotropin [rhTSH]) or endogenous stimulation by thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW). The use of rhTSH avoids hypothyroidism and favours the subsequent elimination of radioiodine, but involves the cost of the product. For this reason, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed, taking into account all costs involved and the benefits associated with the use of this therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a Markov modelling with two analysis arms (rhTSH and THW), stratified into high (100mCi/3700 MBq) and low (30mCi/1110 MBq) radioiodine doses, and using 17 weekly cycles, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) related to the use of rhTSH was determined. The clinical inputs included in the model were based on published studies and in a treatment survey conducted in Spain. RESULTS: Radioablation preparation with rhTSH is superior to THW, showing additional benefits (0.048 AVAC), as well as cost savings (-euro614.16), with an incremental cost-effectiveness rate (ICER) of -euro12,795/QALY. The univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses showed the result to be robust. CONCLUSIONS: The use of rhTSH previous to radioablation in Spain has cost savings, as well as a series of health benefits for the patient, making it highly cost-effective.",2017-01-25489,28539216,Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol,J A Vallejo,2017,36 / 6,362-370,No,28539216,"J A Vallejo; M A Muros; Cost-effectiveness of using recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone before radioiodine ablation for thyroid cancer treatment in Spanish hospitals, Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol, 2017 Nov - Dec; 36(6):2253-8070; 362-370",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exogenous stimulation - recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) vs. Endogenous stimulation - thyroid hormone withdrawal,Patients that were newly diagnosed with well differentiated thyroid cancer (follicular or pappillar ),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,17 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-12795,Euro,2015,-15504.6

18514,Cost-effectiveness analysis of using dermatologists versus pediatricians to treat mild to moderate acne,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness from the payer perspective of using dermatologists versus pediatricians to treat acne in adolescents ages 10-18. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to explore outcomes over a 2-year period from the US private payer perspective. Patients ages 10-18 with acne entered the model under the ""dermatologist""and ""pediatrician"" conditions. In each 3-month cycle,each modeled patient received topical retinoids,benzoyl peroxide (BP), antibiotics, or no treatment,and could progress to an acne-free state or remain in an acne state. RESULTS: The average patient spent42.3% of the time in acne-free states under the dermatologist condition and 28.0% of the time in acne-free states under the pediatrician condition.The cohort of 1000 patients experienced 1900 total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of $2.33 million in the dermatologist condition and 1883 total QALYs at a cost of $1.62 million in the pediatrician condition, yielding an ICER of $40,000/QALY. Most sensitivity analyses confirmed the base case results.

18515,Randomized Controlled Trial of Rituximab and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Treating Fatigue and Oral Dryness in Primary Sjogren's Syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether rituximab, an anti-B cell therapy, improves symptoms of fatigue and oral dryness in patients with primary Sjogren''s syndrome (SS). METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that included health economic analysis. Anti-Ro-positive patients with primary SS, symptomatic fatigue, and oral dryness were recruited from 25 UK rheumatology clinics from August 2011 to January 2014. Patients were centrally randomized to receive either intravenous (IV) placebo (250 ml saline) or IV rituximab (1,000 mg in 250 ml saline) in 2 courses at weeks 0, 2, 24, and 26, with pre- and postinfusion medication including corticosteroids. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a 30% reduction in either fatigue or oral dryness at 48 weeks, as measured by visual analog scale. Other outcome measures included salivary and lacrimal flow rates, quality of life, scores on the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren''s Syndrome Patient Reported Index and EULAR Sjogren''s Syndrome Disease Activity Index, symptoms of ocular and overall dryness, pain, globally assessed disease activity, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: All 133 patients who were randomized to receive placebo (n = 66) or rituximab (n = 67) were included in the primary analysis. Among patients with complete data, 21 of 56 placebo-treated patients and 24 of 61 rituximab-treated patients achieved the primary end point. After multiple imputation of missing outcomes, response rates in the placebo and rituximab groups were 36.8% and 39.8%, respectively (adjusted odds ratio 1.13 [95% confidence interval 0.50, 2.55]). There were no significant improvements in any outcome measure except for unstimulated salivary flow. The mean +/- SD costs per patient for rituximab and placebo were pound10,752 +/- 264.75 and pound2,672 +/- 241.71, respectively. There were slightly more adverse events (AEs) reported in total for rituximab, but there was no difference in serious AEs (10 in each group).

18516,Cost-effectiveness study of the microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis using geneXpert MTB/RIF(R),"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of a molecular biology technique for the diagnosis of tuberculosis compared to the classical diagnostic alternative. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate the theoretical implementation of a molecular biology method including two alternative techniques for early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex, and resistance to rifampicin (alternative1: one determination in selected patients; alternative2: two determinations in all the patients). Both alternatives were compared with the usual procedure for microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis (staining and microbiological culture), and was accomplished on 1,972 patients in the period in 2008-2012. The effectiveness was measured in QALYs, and the uncertainty was assessed by univariate, multivariate and probabilistic analysis of sensitivity. RESULTS: A value of euro8,588/QALYs was obtained by the usual method. Total expenditure with the alternative1 was euro8,487/QALYs, whereas with alternative2, the cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to euro2,960/QALYs.

18517,Cost-effectiveness study of the microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis using geneXpert MTB/RIF(R),"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of a molecular biology technique for the diagnosis of tuberculosis compared to the classical diagnostic alternative. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate the theoretical implementation of a molecular biology method including two alternative techniques for early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex, and resistance to rifampicin (alternative1: one determination in selected patients; alternative2: two determinations in all the patients). Both alternatives were compared with the usual procedure for microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis (staining and microbiological culture), and was accomplished on 1,972 patients in the period in 2008-2012. The effectiveness was measured in QALYs, and the uncertainty was assessed by univariate, multivariate and probabilistic analysis of sensitivity. RESULTS: A value of euro8,588/QALYs was obtained by the usual method. Total expenditure with the alternative1 was euro8,487/QALYs, whereas with alternative2, the cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to euro2,960/QALYs. Greater diagnostic efficiency was observed by applying the alternative2, reaching a 75% reduction in the number of days that a patient with tuberculosis remains without an adequate treatment, and a 70% reduction in the number of days that a patient without tuberculosis remains in hospital. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a molecular microbiological technique in the diagnosis of tuberculosis is extremely cost-effective compared to the usual method.

18518,Cost-Effectiveness of Ibrutinib Compared With Obinutuzumab With Chlorambucil in Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients With Comorbidities in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib shows superiority over obinutuzumab with chlorambucil (G-Clb) in untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with comorbidities who cannot tolerate fludarabine-based therapy. However, ibrutinib is relatively more expensive than G-Clb. In this study we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ibrutinib compared with G-Clb from the United Kingdom (UK) health care perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-state semi-Markov model was parameterized to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits associated with ibrutinib compared with G-Clb as first-line treatment. Idelalisib with rituximab was considered as second-line treatment. Unit costs were derived from standard sources, (dis)utilities from UK elicitation studies, progression-free survival, progression, and death from clinical trials, and postprogression survival and background mortality from published sources. Additional analyses included threshold analyses with ibrutinib and idelalisib at various discount rates, and scenario analysis with ibrutinib as second-line treatment after G-Clb. RESULTS: An average gain of 1.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was estimated for ibrutinib compared with G-Clb at an average additional cost of pound112,835 per patient. To be cost-effective as per the UK thresholds, ibrutinib needs to be discounted at 30%, 40%, and 50% if idelalisib is discounted at 0%, 25%, and 50% respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound75,648 and pound-143,279 per QALY gained for the base-case and scenario analyses, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: As per base-case analyses, an adequate discount on ibrutinib is required to make it cost-effective as per the UK thresholds. The scenario analysis substantiates ibrutinib''s cost-savings for the UK National Health Services and advocates patient''s access to ibrutinib in the UK.",2017-01-25584,29398648,Korean J Pediatr,Richa Sinha,2017,/,,No,29398648,"Richa Sinha; William Ken Redekop; Cost-Effectiveness of Ibrutinib Compared With Obinutuzumab With Chlorambucil in Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients With Comorbidities in the United Kingdom, Korean J Pediatr, 2017 Dec 29; ():1738-1061",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ibrutinib vs. Standard/Usual Care- Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (G-Clb),Untreated patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,75648,United Kingdom,2015,126260.43
18519,Diabetic retinopathy and the use of laser photocoagulation: is it cost-effective to treat early?,"Background/aims: The aim of the study was to explore whether it would be cost-effective to apply panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) at the severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (early treatment) stage, compared with waiting until high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HR-PDR) characteristics (deferred treatment) developed. Methods: A Markov model with a 30-year time horizon was developed, in which patients presenting with moderate NPDR could progress through all stages of DR (severe NPDR>early PDR>HR-PDR>severe PDR) to severe vision loss and blindness (and to death). A National Health Service and personal social services perspective was adopted. Transition probabilities were mainly derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study. Health state utilities, costs and complications were based on information from the literature, supplemented by expert opinion. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Administering PRP at the severe NPDR stage could be more effective and less costly than waiting until HR-PDR developed. Sensitivity analyses gave similar results, with early treatment continuing to dominate deferred treatment. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that at willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20- pound30 000 per quality-adjusted life year, the probability of early treatment being cost-effective is 60%. Conclusion: PRP administered at the severe NPDR stage is likely to be cost-effective compared with delaying photocoagulation until HR-PDR develops. However, given the limitations of the evidence, these results need to be interpreted with caution.

18520,Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis of Apatinib for Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer from the Perspective of Health Insurance System,"Objective: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of apatinib in patients with chemotherapy-refractory mGC. Patients and Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate the clinical course of typical patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic gastric cancer (mGC). We estimated the 10-year quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Model inputs were derived from the published literature and government sources. Direct costs were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health insurance system. A scenario analysis for a Patient Assistance Programme (PAP) was performed. Results: Baseline analysis showed that apatinib increased the cost and QALYs by $7859 and 0.192, respectively, relative to conventional chemotherapy, resulting in an ICER of $40,997/QALY gained. When PAP was available, the ICER was $21,132/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed that apatinib with PAP achieved nearly 65% likelihood of cost-effectiveness at the threshold of $22,200. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the utility of progression-free survival was the most influential factor on the robustness of the model.

18522,Cost-Utility Analysis of Heberprot-P as an Add-on Therapy to Good Wound Care for Patients in Slovakia with Advanced Diabetic Foot Ulcer,"Objectives: To explore whether Heberprot-P (an epidermal growth factor) is a cost-effective option for the treatment of advanced diabetic foot ulcer as an add-on therapy to good wound care (GWC) in Slovakia from the perspective of health care payers. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to compare the costs and effects of Heberprot-P plus GWC to those of GWC alone from the perspective of health care payers. The 52-week clinical trial period was extended to 5- and 10-year time horizons. Transition probabilities were calculated based on a previous clinical trial of Heberprot, utility values were derived from the scientific literature, and cost vectors were collected from the General Health Insurance Fund database in Slovakia. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis was employed to explore the influence of uncertainty for each input parameter on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: Based on the ICER threshold of euro30,030 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) recommended by the Slovak Ministry of Health, Heberprot-P therapy plus GWC is not a cost-effective alternative to GWC alone over a 10-year time horizon. The ICER increases if a longer time horizon is applied, as the incremental costs are similar, but the aggregated utility gain from avoided amputation is lower. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the utility multiplier for the health state ""no ulcer after small amputation"" had the most impact on the ICER; however, the model was robust to changes in all input parameters. Conclusions: Heberprot-P, as an add-on therapy to GWC in the treatment of advanced diabetic foot ulcer, is not a cost-effective alternative to GWC alone. However, if the unit cost of Heberprot-P were to be reduced to <euro273, its ICER would be <euro30,030.",2017-01-25682,29311943,Front Pharmacol,Tomas Tesar,2017,8 /,946,No,29311943,"Tomas Tesar; Laszlo Szilberhorn; Bertalan Nemeth; Balazs Nagy; Martin Wawruch; Zoltan Kalo; Cost-Utility Analysis of Heberprot-P as an Add-on Therapy to Good Wound Care for Patients in Slovakia with Advanced Diabetic Foot Ulcer, Front Pharmacol, 2017; 8():1663-9812; 946",QALY,Slovakia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Heberprot-P plus Good Wound Care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Good wound care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"10 Years, 5 years",5.00,5.00,90344,Euro,2015,109476.14
18523,Cost-effectiveness analysis of endoscopic tympanoplasty versus microscopic tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Health care systems and physicians need to conform to budgets and streamline resources to provide cost-effective quality care. Although endoscopic tympanoplasty (ET) has been performed for decades, no studies on the cost-effectiveness of ET and microscopic tympanoplasty (MT) for treating chronic otitis media have been published. The present study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ET and MT for treating chronic otitis media. METHODS: This study was performed using a Cohort-style Markov decision-tree economic model with a 30-year time horizon. The economic perspective was that of a third-party payer (Taiwan National Health Insurance System). Two treatment strategies were compared, namely ET and MT. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilities were obtained from meta-analyses. Costs were obtained from the published literature and Taiwan National Health Insurance System database. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to account for data uncertainty. RESULTS: The reference case revealed that the total cost of ET was $NT 20,901 for 17.08 QALY per patient. By contrast, the total cost of MT was $NT 21,171 for 17.15 QALY per patient. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for ET versus that of MT was $NT 3703 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that ET was comparable to MT at a willingness-to-pay threshold of larger than $NT 35,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: This cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that ET is comparable to MT for treating chronic otitis media in Taiwan.

18524,Cost-effectiveness analysis of IDegLira versus basal-bolus insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes in the Slovak health system,"Aims: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of once-daily insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus basal-bolus therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets on basal insulin from a healthcare payer perspective in Slovakia. Methods: Long-term clinical and economic outcomes for patients receiving IDegLira and basal-bolus therapy were estimated using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model based on a published pooled analysis of patient-level data. Results: IDegLira was associated with an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.29 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with basal-bolus therapy. The average lifetime cost per patient in the IDegLira arm was EUR 2,449 higher than in the basal-bolus therapy arm. Increased treatment costs with IDegLira were partially offset by cost savings from avoided diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was highly cost-effective versus basal-bolus therapy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 8,590 per QALY gained, which is well below the cost-effectiveness threshold set by the law in Slovakia. Conclusion: IDegLira is cost-effective in Slovakia, providing a simple option for intensification of basal insulin therapy without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain and with fewer daily injections than a basal-bolus regimen.",2017-01-25716,29276398,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Marek Psota,2017,9 /,749-762,No,29276398,"Marek Psota; Maria Bucek Psenkova; Natalia Racekova; Antonio Ramirez de Arellano; Tom Vandebrouck; Barnaby Hunt; Cost-effectiveness analysis of IDegLira versus basal-bolus insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes in the Slovak health system, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2017; 9():1178-6981; 749-762",QALY,Slovakia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin degludec/liraglutide (iDeglira) vs. Basal-bolus therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,8590,Euro,2015,10409.1
18525,The Cost-Effectiveness of Total Hip Arthroplasty in Patients 80 Years of Age and Older,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients 80 years old. METHODS: A Markov, state-transition model projecting lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was constructed to determine cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. Costs (in 2016 US dollars), health state utilities, and state transition probabilities were obtained from published literature. Primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate parameter assumptions. RESULTS: At our base-case values, THA was cost-effective compared to non-operative treatment with a total lifetime accrued cost of $186,444 vs $182,732, and a higher lifetime accrued utility (5.60 vs 5.09). Cost per QALY for THA was $33,318 vs $35,914 for non-operative management, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $7307 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated THA to be cost-effective with a utility of successful primary THA above 0.67, a peri-operative mortality risk below 0.14, and a risk of primary THA failure below 0.14. Analysis further demonstrated that THA is a cost-effective option below a base-rate mortality threshold of 0.19, corresponding to the average base-rate mortality of a 93-year-old individual. Markov cohort analysis indicated that for patients undergoing THA at age 80 there was an approximate 28% reduction in total lifetime long-term assisted living expenditure compared to non-operatively managed patients with end-stage hip osteoarthritis.

18526,Cost-effectiveness of posterior lumbar interbody fusion in the Japanese universal health insurance system,"BACKGROUND: Globally, the cost-effectiveness of spinal surgery is becoming increasingly important. However, these data are limited to a few countries. The purpose of our study was to examine the cost/quality adjusted life year (cost/QALY) gained for posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) in the Japanese universal health insurance system. METHODS: Fifty five patients underwent PLIF for lumbar degenerative spinal canal stenosis between July 2013 and September 2015 was included. Effectiveness was measured using Euro QOL 5-dimension (EQ-5D), Short-Form 8 physical component summary (PCS), and visual analog scale (VAS). The cost was calculated from the perspective of the public healthcare payer. Effectiveness and cost were measured one year after surgery. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the utility value (EQ-5D) and life years. Only direct costs were included on the basis of actual reimbursements. Cost/QALY at a 5-year time horizon with a 2% discount rate was estimated. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the time horizon (2 years or 10 years). The exchange rate was defined as US $1 to Japanese 100 yen. RESULTS: Mean total cost one year after surgery was 2,802,900 ($28029). Operative cost was 1,779,700 ($17797). Mean gained score was 0.22 in EQ-5D, 10.3 in PCS, and -44 in VAS. Cost/QALY was 2,697,500 ($26975). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that cost/QALY at a 10-year time horizon was 1,428,300 ($14283) and that cost/QALY at a 2-year time horizon was 6,435,400 ($64354).

18527,Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant intravaginal brachytherapy in high-intermediate risk endometrial carcinoma,"PURPOSE: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant intravaginal brachytherapy (IVBT) vs. observation after total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TH/BSO) for high-intermediate risk (HIR) endometrial carcinoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of IVBT by comparing average cumulative costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between patients allocated to (1) ''observation'' or (2) ''IVBT'' after TH/BSO. We used a prototype Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma (PORTEC)-defined HIR patient in the base case analysis. We calibrated the model to match the outcomes reported in the PORTEC-1 and PORTEC-2 trials. Utilities were obtained from published estimates, and costs were calculated based on Medicare reimbursement ($5445 for IVBT). The societal willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000 per QALY. The time horizon was 5 years. RESULTS: IVBT was associated with a net increase of 0.094 QALYs (4.512 vs. 4.418) as well as an increase in mean cost ($17,453 vs. $15,620) relative to observation. The ICER for IVBT was $19,500 per QALY. On one-way sensitivity analysis, IVBT remained cost-effective when its cost was less than $12,937. If the probability of vaginal recurrence in the observation arm was increased or decreased by 25%, the ICER became $1335 per QALY and $87,925 per QALY, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that IVBT was the preferred management option in 86% of simulations.

18528,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Primary Arthrodesis Versus Open Reduction Internal Fixation for Primarily Ligamentous Lisfranc Injuries,"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether surgical intervention with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) or primary arthrodesis (PA) for Lisfranc injuries is more cost effective. We conducted a formal cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model and decision tree to explore the healthcare costs and health outcomes associated with a scenario of ORIF versus PA for 45 years postoperatively. The outcomes assessed included long-term costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY gained. The costs were evaluated from the healthcare system perspective and are expressed in U.S. dollars at a 2017 price base. ORIF was always associated with greater costs compared with PA and was less effective in the long term. When calculating the cost required to gain 1 additional QALY, the PA group cost $1429/QALY and the ORIF group cost $3958/QALY. The group undergoing PA overall spent, on average, $43,192 less than the ORIF group, and PA was overall a more effective technique.

18529,Randomised controlled trial to improve health and reduce substance use in established psychosis (IMPaCT): cost-effectiveness of integrated psychosocial health promotion,"BACKGROUND: There is mounting evidence that people with severe mental illness have unhealthy lifestyles, high rates of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and greater risk of early mortality. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a health promotion intervention seeking to improve physical health and reduce substance use in people with psychosis. METHODS: Participants with a psychotic disorder, aged 18-65 years old and registered on an enhanced care approach programme or equivalent were recruited from community mental health teams in six mental health trusts in England. Participants were randomisation to either standard community mental health team care (treatment as usual) or treatment as usual with an integrated health promotion intervention (IMPaCT). Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from health and social care and societal perspectives were conducted alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial. Total health and social care costs and total societal costs at 12 and 15 months were calculated as well as cost-effectiveness (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves) at 15 months based on quality of life (SF-36 mental and physical health components, primary outcome measures) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) using two measures, EQ-5D-3 L and SF-36. Data were analysed using bootstrapped regressions with covariates for relevant baseline variables. RESULTS: At 12-15 months 301 participants had full data needed to be included in the economic evaluation. There were no differences in adjusted health and social care costs ( pound95, 95% CI - pound1410 to pound1599) or societal costs ( pound675, 95% CI - pound1039 to pound2388) between the intervention and control arms. Similarly, there were no differences between the groups in the SF-36 mental component (-0.80, 95% CI -3.66 to 2.06), SF-36 physical component (-0.68, 95% CI -3.01 to 1.65), QALYs estimated from the SF-36 (-0.00, -0.01 to 0.00) or QALYs estimated from the EQ-5D-3 L (0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02).

18531,Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer,"BACKGROUND: A recent Cochrane review compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy for people with for cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas and found that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy may reduce the length of hospital stay. We compared the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. METHOD: Model based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. A decision tree model was constructed using probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources. A time horizon of 5 years was used. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental net monetary benefit was positive ( pound3,708.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI) - pound9,473.62 to pound16,115.69) but the 95% CI includes zero, indicating that there is significant uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy. The probability laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was cost-effective compared to open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer was between 70% and 80% at the willingness-to-pay thresholds generally used in England ( pound20,000 to pound30,000 per QALY gained).

18532,Cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) represents a major public health issue and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan (formerly LCZ696) compared with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) (enalapril) in the treatment of HF-REF from the perspective of healthcare providers in the UK, Denmark and Colombia. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed based on data from a multinational, Phase III randomised controlled trial. A decision-analytic model was developed based on a series of regression models, which extrapolated health-related quality of life, hospitalisation rates and survival over a lifetime horizon. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the UK, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for sacubitril/valsartan (using cardiovascular mortality) was pound17 100 (euro20 400) versus enalapril. In Denmark, the ICER for sacubitril/valsartan was Kr 174 000 (euro22 600). In Colombia, the ICER was COP$39.5 million (euro11 200) per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the extrapolation of mortality, duration of treatment effect and time horizon, but were robust to other structural changes, with most scenarios associated with ICERs below the willingness-to-pay threshold for all three country settings. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested the probability that sacubitril/valsartan was cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds was 68%-94% in the UK, 84% in Denmark and 95% in Colombia.

DESIGN: Mathematical modelling. SETTING: Pharmaco-economic simulation projection. POPULATION: Singapore demography. METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological and financial data from Singapore were used in a validated HPV transmission dynamic mathematical model to analyse the impact of nonavalent HPV vaccination over quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines in a school-based 2-dose vaccination for 11-to-12-year-old girls in the country. The model assumed routine cytology screening in the current rate (50%) and vaccine coverage rate of 80%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes over a 100-year time horizon in the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer, case load of genital warts, and incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Compared to bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccination programme, nonavalent HPV universal vaccination resulted in an additional reduction of HPV31/33/45/52/58 related CIN1 by 40.5%, CIN 2/3 by 35.4%, cervical cancer by 23.5%, and cervical cancer mortality by 20.2%. Compared to bivalent HPV vaccination, there was an additional reduction in HPV-6/11 related CIN1 by 75.7%, and genital warts by 78.9% in women and 73.4% in men.

18537,Cost-effectiveness of curettage vs. expectant management in women with an incomplete evacuation after misoprostol treatment for first-trimester miscarriage: a randomized controlled trial and cohort study,"INTRODUCTION: Curettage is more effective than expectant management in women with suspected incomplete evacuation after misoprostol treatment for first-trimester miscarriage. The cost-effectiveness of curettage vs. expectant management in this group is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From June 2012 until July 2014 we conducted a randomized controlled trial and parallel cohort study in the Netherlands, comparing curettage with expectant management in women with an incomplete evacuation of the uterus after misoprostol treatment for first-trimester miscarriage. Successful treatment was defined as a sonographic finding of an empty uterus 6 weeks after study entry, or an uneventful course. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed. We included costs of healthcare utilization, informal care and lost productivity. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: We included 256 women from 27 hospitals; 95 curettage and 161 expectant management. Treatment was successful in 96% of the women treated with curettage vs. 83% of the women after expectant management (mean difference 13%, 95% confidence interval 5-20). Mean costs were significantly higher in the curettage group (mean difference euro1157; 95% C confidence interval euro955-1388). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for curettage vs. expectant management was euro8586 per successfully treated woman. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that at a willingness-to-pay of euro18 200/extra successfully treated women, the probability that curettage is cost-effective is 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Curettage is not cost-effective compared with expectant management in women with an incomplete evacuation of the uterus after misoprostol treatment.

Cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact assessment,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) effectiveness has been well established. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of providing PrEP, estimate the number of eligible MSM, and its budget impact in Catalonia. Cost-effectiveness analysis compared costs of on daily basis and ""on demand"" PrEP to prevent one infection with lifetime costs of one HIV infection. We estimated the total cost of providing PrEP by estimating number of eligible MSM, and included in the budget impact assessment antiretroviral and laboratory costs.

18540,Palivizumab in the prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with congenital heart disease; a novel cost-utility modeling study reflecting evidence-based clinical pathways in Spain,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection remains one of the major reasons of re-hospitalization among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis versus placebo, in Spain, from the societal perspective, using a novel cost-effectiveness model reflecting evidence-based clinical pathways. METHODS: A decision-analytic model, combining a decision tree structure in the first year and a Markov structure in later years, was constructed to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with palivizumab versus no prophylaxis among children with CHD. In the first year of the model, children were at risk of mild (i.e. medically attended, MA-RSV) and severe (hospitalized, RSV-H) RSV infection. The impact of delayed corrective CHD surgery due to RSV infection and the consequence of performed surgery despite severe infection were considered. In later years, patients were at risk of developing asthma and allergic sensitization as sequelae of RSV infection. Input data for the model were derived from the pivotal clinical trial and systematic literature reviews. Indirect costs included parental absence from work and nosocomial infections. In agreement with Spanish guidelines, costs and effects were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, palivizumab prophylaxis yielded 0.11 and 0.07 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs), respectively, at additional costs of euro 1,693, resulting in an ICER of euro 15,748 per QALY gained and euro 24,936 per LY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the probability of palivizumab prophylaxis being cost-effective at a euro 30,000 per QALY threshold was 92.7%. The ICER remained below this threshold for most extreme scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The model demonstrated that palivizumab prophylaxis results in more QALYs than no prophylaxis in children with CHD. Palivizumab prophylaxis was shown to be a cost-effective health care intervention according to the commonly accepted standards of cost-effectiveness in Spain (ICER below the threshold of euro 30,000 per QALY).",2017-01-25742,29260345,Health Econ Rev,Ralph Schmidt,2017,7 / 1,47,No,29260345,"Ralph Schmidt; Istvan Majer; Natalia Garcia Roman; Alejandra Rivas Basterra; ElizaBeth Grubb; Constancio Medrano Lopez; Palivizumab in the prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with congenital heart disease; a novel cost-utility modeling study reflecting evidence-based clinical pathways in Spain, Health Econ Rev, 2017 Oct 10; 7(1):2191-1991; 47",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Palivizumab vs. No prophylaxis,Congenital heart disease,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15748,Euro,2016,18791.4
18541,Advanced Imaging Adds Little Value in the Diagnosis of Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome is an increasingly recognized source of hip pain and disability in young active adults. In order to confirm the diagnosis, providers often supplement physical examination maneuvers and radiographs with intra-articular hip injection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA). Since diagnostic imaging represents the fastest rising cost segment in U.S. health care, there is a need for value-driven diagnostic algorithms. The purpose of this study was to identify cost-effective diagnostic strategies for symptomatic FAI, comparing history and physical examination (H&P) alone (utilizing only radiographic imaging) with supplementation with injection, MRI, or MRA. METHODS: A simple-chain decision model run as a cost-utility analysis was constructed to assess the diagnostic value of the MRI, MRA, and injection that are added to the H&P and radiographs in diagnosing symptomatic FAI. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) with a willingness to pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY (quality-adjusted life year). Direct costs were measured using the Humana database (PearlDiver). Diagnostic test accuracy, treatment outcome probabilities, and utilities were extracted from the literature. RESULTS: H&P with and without supplemental diagnostic injection was the most cost-effective. Adjunct injection was preferred in situations with a WTP of >$60,000/QALY, low examination sensitivity, and high FAI prevalence. With low disease prevalence and low examination sensitivity, as may occur in a general practitioner''s office, H&P with injection was the most cost-effective strategy, whereas in the reciprocal scenario, H&P with injection was only favored at exceptionally high WTP ( approximately $990,000). CONCLUSIONS: H&P and radiographs with supplemental diagnostic injection are preferred over advanced imaging, even with reasonable deviations from published values of disease prevalence, test sensitivity, and test specificity. Providers with low examination sensitivity in situations with low disease prevalence may benefit most from including injection in their diagnostic strategy. Providers with high examination sensitivity in situations with high disease prevalence may not benefit from including injection in their diagnostic strategy. Providers should not routinely rely on advanced imaging to diagnose FAI syndrome, although advanced imaging may have a role in challenging clinical scenarios.

18544,Cost Effectiveness of Intracranial Pressure Monitoring in Pediatric Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Simulation Modeling Approach,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct an economic evaluation of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring on the basis of current evidence from pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury, through a statistical model. METHODS: The statistical model is a decision tree, whose branches take into account the severity of the lesion, the hospitalization costs, and the quality-adjusted life-year for the first 6 months post-trauma. The inputs consist of probability distributions calculated from a sample of 33 surviving children with severe traumatic brain injury, divided into two groups: with ICP monitoring (monitoring group) and without ICP monitoring (control group). The uncertainty of the parameters from the sample was quantified through a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the Monte-Carlo simulation method. The model overcomes the drawbacks of small sample sizes, unequal groups, and the ethical difficulty in randomly assigning patients to a control group (without monitoring). RESULTS: The incremental cost in the monitoring group was Mex$3,934 (Mexican pesos), with an increase in quality-adjusted life-year of 0.05. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was Mex$81,062. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve had a maximum at 54% of the cost effective iterations. The incremental net health benefit for a willingness to pay equal to 1 time the per capita gross domestic product for Mexico was 0.03, and the incremental net monetary benefit was Mex$5,358.

18545,Cost Effectiveness of Dulaglutide Compared with Liraglutide and Glargine in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in Colombia,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes treatment includes very diverse drugs. It is essential to identify which drugs offer the best value for their costs. OBJECTIVES: To estimate comparative cost effectiveness for treating diabetes mellitus with dulaglutide, liraglutide, or glargine in Colombia. METHODS: A Markov model including diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications was used to estimate cost-effectiveness. We used annual cycles, a 5-year time horizon, 5% discount rate, and third-party payer''s perspective. Main outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Transition probabilities were obtained from primary studies and costs from local databases and studies. We used a threshold of 3 times the Colombian per capita gross domestic product (US $17,270 for 2015; US $1 = 2,743 Columbian pesos) to assess cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Total costs related to dulaglutide, liraglutide, and glargine were US $8,633, US $10,756, and US $5,783, yielding 3.311 QALYs, 3.229 QALYs, and 3.156 QALYs, respectively. Dulaglutide dominated liraglutide given lower total costs and higher QALYs. The estimated ICER for dulaglutide compared with glargine was US $18,385, greater than the accepted threshold. Sensibility analysis shows that decreased dulaglutide cost, increased consumption of glargine, nondaily injection, and number and cost of glucometry could result in ICERs lower than the threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: This estimation indicates that dulaglutide dominates liraglutide.

Combining naloxone distribution with linkage to addiction treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention through syringe service programmes has the potential to save lives and be cost-effective. We estimated the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of five alternative strategies: no additional intervention, naloxone distribution, naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment, naloxone distribution plus PrEP, and naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment and PrEP. METHODS: We developed a decision analytical Markov model to simulate opioid overdose, HIV incidence, overdose-related deaths, and HIV-related deaths in people who inject drugs in Connecticut, USA. Model input parameters were derived from published sources. We compared each strategy with no intervention, as well as simultaneously considering all strategies. Sensitivity analysis was done for all variables. Linkage to addiction treatment was referral to an opioid treatment programme for methadone. Endpoints were survival, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), number and percentage of overdose deaths averted, number of HIV-related deaths averted, total costs (in 2015 US$) associated with each strategy, and incremental cost per QALY gained. FINDINGS: In the base-case analysis, compared with no additional intervention, the naloxone distribution strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $323 per QALY, and naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment was cost saving compared with no additional intervention (greater effectiveness and less expensive). The most efficient strategies (ie, those conferring the greatest health benefit for a particular budget) were naloxone distribution combined with linkage to addiction treatment (cost saving), and naloxone distribution combined with PrEP and linkage to addiction treatment (ICER $95 337 per QALY) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the combination of naloxone distribution, PrEP, and linkage to addiction treatment was the optimal strategy in 37% of iterations and the combination of naloxone distribution and linkage to addiction treatment was the optimal strategy in 34% of iterations.

18550,Effects of naloxone distribution alone or in combination with addiction treatment with or without pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention in people who inject drugs: a cost-effectiveness modelling study,"BACKGROUND: In the USA, an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths is occurring, many of which are from heroin. Combining naloxone distribution with linkage to addiction treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention through syringe service programmes has the potential to save lives and be cost-effective. We estimated the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of five alternative strategies: no additional intervention, naloxone distribution, naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment, naloxone distribution plus PrEP, and naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment and PrEP. METHODS: We developed a decision analytical Markov model to simulate opioid overdose, HIV incidence, overdose-related deaths, and HIV-related deaths in people who inject drugs in Connecticut, USA. Model input parameters were derived from published sources. We compared each strategy with no intervention, as well as simultaneously considering all strategies. Sensitivity analysis was done for all variables. Linkage to addiction treatment was referral to an opioid treatment programme for methadone. Endpoints were survival, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), number and percentage of overdose deaths averted, number of HIV-related deaths averted, total costs (in 2015 US$) associated with each strategy, and incremental cost per QALY gained. FINDINGS: In the base-case analysis, compared with no additional intervention, the naloxone distribution strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $323 per QALY, and naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment was cost saving compared with no additional intervention (greater effectiveness and less expensive). The most efficient strategies (ie, those conferring the greatest health benefit for a particular budget) were naloxone distribution combined with linkage to addiction treatment (cost saving), and naloxone distribution combined with PrEP and linkage to addiction treatment (ICER $95 337 per QALY) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the combination of naloxone distribution, PrEP, and linkage to addiction treatment was the optimal strategy in 37% of iterations and the combination of naloxone distribution and linkage to addiction treatment was the optimal strategy in 34% of iterations. INTERPRETATION: Naloxone distribution through syringe service programmes is cost-effective compared with syringe distribution alone, but when combined with linkage to addiction treatment is cost saving compared with no additional services. A strategy that combines naloxone distribution, PrEP, and linkage to addiction treatment results in greater health benefits in people who inject drugs and is also cost-effective.

However, the long-term cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision analytical modelling and a Markov simulation were used to compare long-term costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness from a third-party payer (National Health Service) perspective for treatment strategies after chemoradiotherapy; watch and wait with CXB when a cCR was not initially achieved after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (WWCXB), watch and wait with EBRT alone (WWEBRT) and radical surgery for all patients. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters and patient demographics was investigated. RESULTS: WWCXB had a higher QALY payoff than both radical surgery and WWEBRT and was less costly in most scenarios and demographic cohorts. In all plausible scenarios, WWCXB was the most cost-effective, at a threshold of pound20 000/QALY. This finding was insensitive to uncertainty associated with model parameters.

18557,Biologic treatment sequences for plaque psoriasis: a cost-utility analysis based on 10 years of Dutch real-world evidence from BioCAPTURE,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with biologics may be indicated for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, but comparative evidence on cost-effectiveness is limited. Switching of biologics is common, but it is unclear what the effect is of differences in sequences of biologics. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different biologic treatment sequences for psoriasis based on real-world evidence. METHODS: A sequence model was developed to evaluate the costs and health effects of three consecutive lines of biologic treatments (for example adalimumab-etanercept-ustekinumab versus etanercept-ustekinumab-adalimumab) over a 10-year time horizon in the Netherlands. The model was populated with data from the Dutch BioCAPTURE registry and scientific literature. Analyses were conducted of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and uncertainty was addressed by probabilistic as well as scenario analyses. RESULTS: Treatment of psoriasis with biologics for a 10-year period was estimated to be associated with a cost of euro 141,962 to euro 148,442 per patient depending on the treatment sequence used. Cumulative health effects ranged from 7.79 to 8.03 QALYs. Starting with adalimumab or ustekinumab seems favourable concerning cost and utilities compared to strategies starting with etanercept, though credible intervals were partly overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: The order in which biologics are used influences treatment cost-effectiveness, both in terms of costs and health effects. Initiation of a biologic treatment sequence for psoriasis may best be done with adalimumab or ustekinumab; etanercept seems less optimal from a health-economic perspective.

METHODS: A sequence model was developed to evaluate the costs and health effects of three consecutive lines of biologic treatments (for example adalimumab-etanercept-ustekinumab versus etanercept-ustekinumab-adalimumab) over a 10-year time horizon in the Netherlands. The model was populated with data from the Dutch BioCAPTURE registry and scientific literature. Analyses were conducted of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and uncertainty was addressed by probabilistic as well as scenario analyses. RESULTS: Treatment of psoriasis with biologics for a 10-year period was estimated to be associated with a cost of euro 141,962 to euro 148,442 per patient depending on the treatment sequence used. Cumulative health effects ranged from 7.79 to 8.03 QALYs. Starting with adalimumab or ustekinumab seems favourable concerning cost and utilities compared to strategies starting with etanercept, though credible intervals were partly overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: The order in which biologics are used influences treatment cost-effectiveness, both in terms of costs and health effects. Initiation of a biologic treatment sequence for psoriasis may best be done with adalimumab or ustekinumab; etanercept seems less optimal from a health-economic perspective.

18567,Cost-effectiveness of increasing the reach of smoking cessation interventions in Germany: results from the EQUIPTMOD,"AIMS: To evaluate costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of increased reach of specific smoking cessation interventions in Germany. DESIGN: A Markov-based state transition return on investment model (EQUIPTMOD) was used to evaluate current smoking cessation interventions as well as two prospective investment scenarios. A health-care perspective (extended to include out-of-pocket payments) with life-time horizon was considered. A probabilistic analysis was used to assess uncertainty concerning predicted estimates. SETTING: Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Cohort of current smoking population (18+ years) in Germany. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included group-based behavioural support, financial incentive programmes and varenicline. For prospective scenario 1 the reach of group-based behavioral support, financial incentive programme and varenicline was increased by 1% of yearly quit attempts (= 57 915 quit attempts), while prospective scenario 2 represented a higher reach, mirroring the levels observed in England. MEASUREMENTS: EQUIPTMOD considered reach, intervention cost, number of quitters, quality-of-life years (QALYs) gained, cost-effectiveness and return on investment. FINDINGS: The highest returns through reduction in smoking-related health-care costs were seen for the financial incentive programme (euro2.71 per euro1 invested), followed by that of group-based behavioural support (euro1.63 per euro1 invested), compared with no interventions. Varenicline had lower returns (euro1.02 per euro1 invested) than the other two interventions. At the population level, prospective scenario 1 led to 15 034 QALYs gained and euro27 million cost-savings, compared with current investment. Intervention effects and reach contributed most to the uncertainty around the return-on-investment estimates. At a hypothetical willingness-to-pay threshold of only euro5000, the probability of being cost-effective is approximately 75% for prospective scenario 1. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the reach of group-based behavioural support, financial incentives and varenicline for smoking cessation by just 1% of current annual quit attempts provides a strategy to German policymakers that improves the population''s health outcomes and that may be considered cost-effective.",2017-01-25759,29243347,Addiction,Manuel B Huber,2017,/,,No,29243347,"Manuel B Huber; Maximilian Prager; Kathryn Coyle; Doug Coyle; Adam Lester-George; Marta Trapero-Bertran; Bertalan Nemeth; Kei Long Cheung; Renee Stark; Matthias Vogl; Subhash Pokhrel; Reiner Leidl; Cost-effectiveness of increasing the reach of smoking cessation interventions in Germany: results from the EQUIPTMOD, Addiction, 2017 Mar 20; ():0965-2140",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Current investment: includes all currently implemented smoking cessation interventions vs. Standard/Usual Care- Zero investment: only the top-level policies (i.e. indoor smoking ban in public places and tobacco taxes; both at their current levels),Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,323.33,Euro,2015,391.8

METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed from a US payer perspective. The model included five health states: 1) mild lung disease (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] >70%), 2) moderate lung disease (40% </= FEV1 </= 70%), 3) severe lung disease (FEV1 < 40%), 4) lung transplantation, and 5) death. All inputs were derived from published literature. We estimated lumacaftor/ivacaftor''s improvement in outcomes compared with a non-CF referent population as well as CF-specific mortality estimates. RESULTS: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with additional 2.91 life-years (95% credible interval 2.55-3.56) and additional 2.42 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% credible interval 2.10-2.98). Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with improvements in survival and QALYs equivalent to 27.6% and 20.7%, respectively, for the survival and QALY gaps between CF usual care and their non-CF peers. The incremental lifetime cost was $2,632,249.

It takes many days for peritoneal-fluid fungal culture to become positive, and the recommended empirical antifungal therapy involves excessive costs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should produce results more rapidly than fungal culture. OBJECTIVES: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the combination of several diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to manage Candida peritonitis in non-neutropenic adult patients in ICUs. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model to evaluate the cost effectiveness. Cost and effectiveness were taken into account in a 1-year time horizon and from the French National Health Insurance perspective. Six strategies were compared: fluconazole or echinocandin as an empirical therapy, plus diagnosis by fungal culture or detection by PCR of all Candida species, or use of PCR to detect most fluconazole-resistant Candida species (i.e., Candida krusei and Candida glabrata). RESULTS: The use of fluconazole empirical treatment and PCR to detect all Candida species is more cost effective than using fluconazole empirical treatment without PCR (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro40,055/quality-adjusted life-year).

OBJECTIVES: To use economic analysis before a large-scale clinical trial of molecular testing to confirm the value of the trial and help prioritize between candidate tests as randomized comparators. METHODS: Women with surgically treated breast cancer (estrogen receptor-positive and lymph node-positive or tumor size >/=30 mm) were randomized to standard care (chemotherapy for all) or test-directed care using Oncotype DX. Additional testing was undertaken using alternative tests: MammaPrint(TM), PAM-50 (Prosigna(TM)), MammaTyper(TM), IHC4, and IHC4-AQUA (NexCourse Breast).

OBJECTIVES: To derive a trial-informed estimate of the incremental costs of intensive treatment as delivered in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care-Europe (ADDITION) trial and to revisit the long-term cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: We analyzed the electronic primary care records of a subsample of the ADDITION-Cambridge trial cohort (n = 173). Unit costs of used primary care services were taken from the published literature. Incremental annual costs of intensive treatment versus routine care in years 1 to 5 after diagnosis were calculated using multilevel generalized linear models. We revisited the long-term cost-utility analyses for the ADDITION-UK trial cohort and reported results for ADDITION-Cambridge using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model and the trial-informed cost estimates according to a previously developed evaluation framework. RESULTS: Incremental annual costs of intensive treatment over years 1 to 5 averaged pound29.10 (standard error = pound33.00) for consultations with general practitioners and nurses and pound54.60 (standard error = pound28.50) for metabolic and cardioprotective medication.

OBJECTIVES: To derive a trial-informed estimate of the incremental costs of intensive treatment as delivered in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care-Europe (ADDITION) trial and to revisit the long-term cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: We analyzed the electronic primary care records of a subsample of the ADDITION-Cambridge trial cohort (n = 173). Unit costs of used primary care services were taken from the published literature. Incremental annual costs of intensive treatment versus routine care in years 1 to 5 after diagnosis were calculated using multilevel generalized linear models. We revisited the long-term cost-utility analyses for the ADDITION-UK trial cohort and reported results for ADDITION-Cambridge using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model and the trial-informed cost estimates according to a previously developed evaluation framework. RESULTS: Incremental annual costs of intensive treatment over years 1 to 5 averaged pound29.10 (standard error = pound33.00) for consultations with general practitioners and nurses and pound54.60 (standard error = pound28.50) for metabolic and cardioprotective medication.

18593,Cost Effectiveness of the Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitor Sacubitril/Valsartan for Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction in the Netherlands: A Country Adaptation Analysis Under the Former and Current Dutch Pharmacoeconomic Guidelines,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the adaptation of a global health economic model to determine whether treatment with the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 is cost effective compared with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in adult patients with chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in the Netherlands; and to explore the effect of performing the cost-effectiveness analyses according to the new pharmacoeconomic Dutch guidelines (updated during the submission process of LCZ696), which require a value-of-information analysis and the inclusion of indirect medical costs of life-years gained. METHODS: We adapted a UK model to reflect the societal perspective in the Netherlands by including travel expenses, productivity loss, informal care costs, and indirect medical costs during the life-years gained and performed a preliminary value-of-information analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio obtained was euro17,600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. This was robust to changes in most structural assumptions and across different subgroups of patients. Probability sensitivity analysis results showed that the probability that LCZ696 is cost-effective at a euro50,000 per QALY threshold is 99.8%, with a population expected value of perfect information of euro297,128. On including indirect medical costs of life-years gained, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro26,491 per QALY gained, and LCZ696 was 99.46% cost effective at euro50,000 per QALY, with a population expected value of perfect information of euro2,849,647.

18594,Cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa in adult patients with Pompe disease,"BACKGROUND: Pompe disease is a rare, progressive, metabolic disease, and the first treatable inheritable muscle disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa is disease specific and the only medicinal product authorized for the treatment of Pompe disease. Costs of ERT are very high as for most orphan drugs. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of ERT compared to supportive treatment in adult patients with Pompe disease. METHODS: Survival probabilities were estimated from an international observational dataset (n = 283) using a time-dependent Cox model. Quality of life was estimated on a Dutch observational dataset using a previously developed conceptual model which links clinical factors to quality of life. Costs included costs of ERT, costs of drug administration and other healthcare costs. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using a patient-level simulation model (n = 90), synthesising the information from underlying models for survival, quality of life and costs. The cost-effectiveness model estimated the (difference in) lifetime effects and costs for both treatments. Two scenarios were modelled: (1) a worse case scenario with no extrapolation of the survival gain due to ERT beyond the observed period (i.e. from 10 years onwards); and (2) a best case scenario with lifetime extrapolation of the survival gain due to ERT. Effects were expressed in (quality adjusted) life years (QALYs). Costs were discounted at 4.0% and effects at 1.5%. RESULTS: Substantial increases in survival were estimated - discounted incremental life years of ERT ranged from 1.9 years to 5.4 years in the scenarios without and with extrapolation of survival gains beyond the observed period. Quality of life was also significantly better for patients receiving ERT. Incremental costs were considerable and primarily consisted of the costs of ERT. Incremental costs per QALY were euro3.2 million for scenario 1 and euro1.8 million for scenario 2.

18595,Cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa in adult patients with Pompe disease,"BACKGROUND: Pompe disease is a rare, progressive, metabolic disease, and the first treatable inheritable muscle disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa is disease specific and the only medicinal product authorized for the treatment of Pompe disease. Costs of ERT are very high as for most orphan drugs. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of ERT compared to supportive treatment in adult patients with Pompe disease. METHODS: Survival probabilities were estimated from an international observational dataset (n = 283) using a time-dependent Cox model. Quality of life was estimated on a Dutch observational dataset using a previously developed conceptual model which links clinical factors to quality of life. Costs included costs of ERT, costs of drug administration and other healthcare costs. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using a patient-level simulation model (n = 90), synthesising the information from underlying models for survival, quality of life and costs. The cost-effectiveness model estimated the (difference in) lifetime effects and costs for both treatments. Two scenarios were modelled: (1) a worse case scenario with no extrapolation of the survival gain due to ERT beyond the observed period (i.e. from 10 years onwards); and (2) a best case scenario with lifetime extrapolation of the survival gain due to ERT. Effects were expressed in (quality adjusted) life years (QALYs). Costs were discounted at 4.0% and effects at 1.5%. RESULTS: Substantial increases in survival were estimated - discounted incremental life years of ERT ranged from 1.9 years to 5.4 years in the scenarios without and with extrapolation of survival gains beyond the observed period. Quality of life was also significantly better for patients receiving ERT. Incremental costs were considerable and primarily consisted of the costs of ERT. Incremental costs per QALY were euro3.2 million for scenario 1 and euro1.8 million for scenario 2. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of extended, prospectively collected, longitudinal observational data on the most important input parameters required to construct a cost-effectiveness model is quite exceptional for orphan diseases.

18596,"Using Microsimulation to Estimate the Future Health and Economic Costs of Salmonellosis under Climate Change in Central Queensland, Australia","BACKGROUND: The incidence of salmonellosis, a costly foodborne disease, is rising in Australia. Salmonellosis increases during high temperatures and rainfall, and future incidence is likely to rise under climate change. Allocating funding to preventative strategies would be best informed by accurate estimates of salmonellosis costs under climate change and by knowing which population subgroups will be most affected. OBJECTIVE: We used microsimulation models to estimate the health and economic costs of salmonellosis in Central Queensland under climate change between 2016 and 2036 to inform preventative strategies. METHODS: We projected the entire population of Central Queensland to 2036 by simulating births, deaths, and migration, and salmonellosis and two resultant conditions, reactive arthritis and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. We estimated salmonellosis risks and costs under baseline conditions and under projected climate conditions for Queensland under the A1FI emissions scenario using composite projections from 6 global climate models (warm with reduced rainfall). We estimated the resulting costs based on direct medical expenditures combined with the value of lost quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on willingness-to-pay. RESULTS: Estimated costs of salmonellosis between 2016 and 2036 increased from 456.0 QALYs (95% CI: 440.3, 473.1) and AUD29,900,000 million (95% CI: AUD28,900,000, AUD31,600,000), assuming no climate change, to 485.9 QALYs (95% CI: 469.6, 503.5) and AUD31,900,000 (95% CI: AUD30,800,000, AUD33,000,000) under the climate change scenario. CONCLUSION: We applied a microsimulation approach to estimate the costs of salmonellosis and its sequelae in Queensland during 2016-2036 under baseline conditions and according to climate change projections. This novel application of microsimulation models demonstrates the models'' potential utility to researchers for examining complex interactions between weather and disease to estimate future costs. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1370.",2017-01-25771,29233795,Environ Health Perspect,Dimity Maree Stephen,2017,125 / 12,127001,No,29233795,"Dimity Maree Stephen; Adrian Gerard Barnett; Using Microsimulation to Estimate the Future Health and Economic Costs of Salmonellosis under Climate Change in Central Queensland, Australia, Environ Health Perspect, 2017 Dec 11; 125(12):0091-6765; 127001",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Climate change scenario to impact rates of salmonellosis (year 2036) vs. no climate changes, year 2016",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-61855.67,Australia,2015,-50804.81
18597,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Probiotic Use to Prevent Clostridium difficile Infection in Hospitalized Adults Receiving Antibiotics,"Background: Systematic reviews with meta-analyses and meta-regression suggest that timely probiotic use can prevent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in hospitalized adults receiving antibiotics, but the cost effectiveness is unknown. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of probiotic use for prevention of CDI versus no probiotic use in the United States. Methods: We programmed a decision analytic model using published literature and national databases with a 1-year time horizon. The base case was modeled as a hypothetical cohort of hospitalized adults (mean age 68) receiving antibiotics with and without concurrent probiotic administration. Projected outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (2013 US dollars), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; $/QALY), and cost per infection avoided. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted, and scenarios of different age cohorts were considered. The ICERs less than $100000 per QALY were considered cost effective. Results: Probiotic use dominated (more effective and less costly) no probiotic use. Results were sensitive to probiotic efficacy (relative risk <0.73), the baseline risk of CDI (>1.6%), the risk of probiotic-associated bactermia/fungemia (<0.26%), probiotic cost (<$130), and age (>65). In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000/QALY, probiotics were the optimal strategy in 69.4% of simulations.
