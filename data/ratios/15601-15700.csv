15601,Cost-effectiveness of national mandatory screening of all admissions to English National Health Service hospitals for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a mathematical modelling study,"BACKGROUND: In December, 2010, National Health Service (NHS) England introduced national mandatory screening of all admissions for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this policy, from a regional or national health-care decision makers' perspective, compared with alternative screening strategies. METHODS: We used an individual-based dynamic transmission model parameterised with national MRSA audit data to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of admission screening of patients in English NHS hospitals compared with five alternative strategies (including no screening, checklist-activated screening, and high-risk specialty-based screening), accompanied by patient isolation and decolonisation, over a 5 year time horizon. We evaluated strategies for different NHS hospital types (acute, teaching, and specialist), MRSA prevalence, and transmission potentials using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of screening all admissions was pound89 000-148 000 (range pound68 000-222 000), and this strategy was consistently more costly and less effective than alternatives for all hospital types. At a pound30 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and current prevalence, only the no-screening strategy was cost effective. The next best strategies were, in acute and teaching hospitals, targeting of high-risk specialty admissions (30-40% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] pound45 200 [range pound35 300-61 400] and pound48 000/QALY [ pound34 600-74 800], respectively) and, in specialist hospitals, screening these patients plus risk-factor-based screening of low-risk specialties (a roughly 20% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean ICER pound62 600/QALY [ pound48 000-89 400]). As prevalence and transmission increased, targeting of high-risk specialties became the optimum strategy at the NHS willingness-to-pay threshold ( pound30 000/QALY). Switching from screening all admissions to only high-risk specialty admissions resulted in a mean reduction in total costs per year (not considering uncertainty) of pound2.7 million per acute hospital, pound2.9 million per teaching, and pound474 000 per specialist hospital for a minimum rise in infections (about one infection per year per hospital). INTERPRETATION: Our results show that screening all admissions for MRSA is unlikely to be cost effective in England at the current NHS willingness-to-pay threshold, and our findings informed modified guidance to NHS England in 2014. Screening admissions to high-risk specialties is likely to represent better resource use in terms of cost per QALY gained.

15609,Cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia,"AIM: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for sequential treatments of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after failure of 1st line imatinib, from a commercial payer perspective in the US. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate lifetime treatment costs and health outcomes for TKI sequences for treatment of patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib. Five health states were included, chronic phase 2nd-line TKI, chronic phase 3rd-line TKI, chronic phase post-TKI, advanced phases, and death. Efficacy (response achievement, loss of response, transformation, death) and safety (adverse events incidence, discontinuation) data are based on clinical trials. Resource utilization, costs, and utilities were based on product labels and publically available data. Uncertainty analyses were conducted for key inputs. RESULTS: In patients failing imatinib, dasatinib-initiating treatment sequences provide the most survival (DeltaLYs = 0.2-2.0), QALYs (DeltaQALYs = 0.2-1.9), and accrue highest CML-related costs (DeltaCosts = $64,000-$222,000). The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs imatinib-initiating sequences is $100,000 for an imatinib-resistant population. The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs nilotinib-initiating sequences is $170,000 for an imatinib-resistant population, and $160,000 for an imatinib-intolerant population. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that dasatinib is associated with increased survival and quality of life compared to high dose imatinib and to a smaller extent with nilotinib, among patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib, primarily based on higher cytogenetic response rates observed in clinical studies of dasatinib. Head-to-head studies of sequential use of dasatinib and nilotinib are needed to validate the model findings of improved survival (LYs) with better quality-of-life (QALYs) for patients initiating dasatinib in 2nd-line.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate lifetime treatment costs and health outcomes for TKI sequences for treatment of patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib. Five health states were included, chronic phase 2nd-line TKI, chronic phase 3rd-line TKI, chronic phase post-TKI, advanced phases, and death. Efficacy (response achievement, loss of response, transformation, death) and safety (adverse events incidence, discontinuation) data are based on clinical trials. Resource utilization, costs, and utilities were based on product labels and publically available data. Uncertainty analyses were conducted for key inputs. RESULTS: In patients failing imatinib, dasatinib-initiating treatment sequences provide the most survival (DeltaLYs = 0.2-2.0), QALYs (DeltaQALYs = 0.2-1.9), and accrue highest CML-related costs (DeltaCosts = $64,000-$222,000). The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs imatinib-initiating sequences is $100,000 for an imatinib-resistant population.

15620,Cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia,"AIM: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for sequential treatments of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after failure of 1st line imatinib, from a commercial payer perspective in the US. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate lifetime treatment costs and health outcomes for TKI sequences for treatment of patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib. Five health states were included, chronic phase 2nd-line TKI, chronic phase 3rd-line TKI, chronic phase post-TKI, advanced phases, and death. Efficacy (response achievement, loss of response, transformation, death) and safety (adverse events incidence, discontinuation) data are based on clinical trials. Resource utilization, costs, and utilities were based on product labels and publically available data. Uncertainty analyses were conducted for key inputs. RESULTS: In patients failing imatinib, dasatinib-initiating treatment sequences provide the most survival (DeltaLYs = 0.2-2.0), QALYs (DeltaQALYs = 0.2-1.9), and accrue highest CML-related costs (DeltaCosts = $64,000-$222,000). The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs imatinib-initiating sequences is $100,000 for an imatinib-resistant population. The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs nilotinib-initiating sequences is $170,000 for an imatinib-resistant population, and $160,000 for an imatinib-intolerant population.

Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir and ribavirin (3D+R) was approved by the FDA in December 2014 for liver transplant recipients with recurrent genotype 1 HCV, in whom it is effective and well-tolerated. METHODS: Using a two-phase Markov model, we analysed the cost-effectiveness of 3D+R in liver transplant recipients, the only HCV treatment with FDA approval in this population. As a sensitivity analysis, we also considered the cost-effectiveness of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, the only other therapy with data from Phase III trials in this population.

15623,Endoscopic resection is cost-effective compared with laparoscopic resection in the management of complex colon polyps: an economic analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic resection (ER) is an efficacious treatment for complex colon polyps (CCPs). Many patients are referred for surgical resection because of concerns over procedural safety, incomplete polyp resection, and adenoma recurrence after ER. Efficacy data for both resection strategies are widely available, but a paucity of data exist on the cost-effectiveness of each modality. The aim of this study was to perform an economic analysis comparing ER and laparoscopic resection (LR) strategies in patients with CCP. METHODS: A decision analysis tree was constructed using decision analysis software. The 2 strategies (ER vs LR) were evaluated in a hypothetical cohort of patients with CCPs. A hybrid Markov model with a 10-year time horizon was used. Patients entered the model after colonoscopic diagnosis at age 50. Under Strategy I, patients underwent ER followed by surveillance colonoscopy at 3 to 6 months and 12 months. Patients with failed ER and residual adenoma at 12 months were referred for LR. Under Strategy II, patients underwent LR as primary treatment. Patients with invasive cancer were excluded. Estimates regarding ER performance characteristics were obtained from a systematic review of published literature. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (2012-2013) and the 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases were used to determine the costs and loss of utility. We assumed that all procedures were performed with anesthesia support, and patients with adverse events in both strategies required inpatient hospitalization. Baseline estimates and costs were varied by using a sensitivity analysis through the ranges. RESULTS: LR was found to be more costly and yielded fewer quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with ER. The cost of ER of a CCP was $5570 per patient and yielded 9.640 QALYs. LR of a CCP cost $18,717 per patient and yielded fewer QALYs (9.577). For LR to be more cost-effective, the thresholds of 1-way sensitivity analyses were (1) technical success of ER for complete resection in <75.8% of cases, (2) adverse event rates for ER > 12%, and (3) LR cost of <$14,000. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ER is a cost-effective strategy for removal of CCPs. The effectiveness is driven by high technical success and low adverse event rates associated with ER, in addition to the increased cost of LR.",2016-01-20623,26608129,Gastrointest Endosc,Ryan Law,2016,83 / 6,1248-57,No,26608129,"Ryan Law; Ananya Das; Dyanna Gregory; Srinadh Komanduri; Raman Muthusamy; Amit Rastogi; John Vargo; Michael B Wallace; G S Raju; Rawad Mounzer; Jason Klapman; Janak Shah; Rabindra Watson; Robert Wilson; Steven A Edmundowicz; Sachin Wani; Endoscopic resection is cost-effective compared with laparoscopic resection in the management of complex colon polyps: an economic analysis, Gastrointest Endosc, 2016 Jun; 83(6):0016-5107; 1248-57",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endoscopic resection followed by surveillance colonoscopy at 3 to 6 months and 12 months. vs. Standard/Usual Care- Laparoscopic resection,"patient who underwent an initial colonoscopy with identification of a complex, sessile colon polyp without features of deep submucuosal invasion (>1000 micrometers)",50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-208682.53,United States,2012,-235238.44
15624,Cost-effectiveness of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy in diagnosing prostate cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB) is the recommended approach to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa). Overdiagnosis and sampling errors represent major limitations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy (MRTB) detects higher proportion of significant PCa and reduces diagnosis of insignificant PCa. Costs prevent MRTB from becoming the new standard in PCa diagnosis. The present study aimed at assessing whether added costs of MRI outweigh benefits of MRTB in a cost-utility model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY) and costs for 2 strategies (the standard 12-core TRUSGB strategy and the MRTB strategy) over 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. MRI was used as triage test in biopsy-naive men with clinical suspicion of PCa. The model takes into account probability of men harboring PCa, diagnostic accuracy of both procedures, and probability of being assigned to various treatment options. Direct medical costs based on health care system perspective were included. RESULTS: Following standard TRUSGB pathway, calculated cumulative effects at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were 4.25, 7.17, 9.03, and 10.09 QALY, respectively. Cumulative effects in MRTB pathway were 4.29, 7.26, 9.17, and 10.26 QALY, correspondingly. Costs related to TRUSGB strategy were $8,027, $11,406, $14,883, and $17,587 at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively, as compared with $7,231, $10,450, $13,267, and $15,400 for the MRTB strategy. At 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, MRTB was the established dominant strategy.

15625,Cost-effectiveness of Simvastatin plus Ezetimibe for Cardiovascular Prevention in CKD: Results of the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP),"BACKGROUND: Simvastatin, 20mg, plus ezetimibe, 10mg, daily (simvastatin plus ezetimibe) reduced major atherosclerotic events in patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness of simvastatin plus ezetimibe in SHARP, a randomized controlled trial. SETTING & POPULATION: 9,270 patients with CKD randomly assigned to simvastatin plus ezetimibe versus placebo; participants in categories by 5-year cardiovascular risk (low, <10%; medium, 10%-<20%; or high, >/=20%) and CKD stage (3, 4, 5 not on dialysis, or on dialysis therapy). MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMELINE: Assessment during SHARP follow-up from the UK perspective; long-term projections. INTERVENTION: Simvastatin plus ezetimibe (2015 UK pound1.19 per day) during 4.9 years' median follow-up in SHARP; scenario analyses with high-intensity statin regimens (2015 UK pound0.05- pound1.06 per day). OUTCOMES: Additional health care costs per major atherosclerotic event avoided and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In SHARP, the proportional reductions per 1mmol/L of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction with simvastatin plus ezetimibe in all major atherosclerotic events of 20% (95% CI, 6%-32%) and in the costs of vascular hospital episodes of 17% (95% CI, 4%-28%) were similar across participant categories by cardiovascular risk and CKD stage. The 5-year reduction in major atherosclerotic events per 1,000 participants ranged from 10 in low-risk to 58 in high-risk patients and from 28 in CKD stage 3 to 36 in patients on dialysis therapy. The net cost per major atherosclerotic event avoided with simvastatin plus ezetimibe compared to no LDL-lowering regimen ranged from pound157,060 in patients at low risk to pound15,230 in those at high risk ( pound30,500- pound39,600 per QALY); and from pound47,280 in CKD stage 3 to pound28,180 in patients on dialysis therapy ( pound13,000- pound43,300 per QALY). In scenario analyses, generic high-intensity statin regimens were estimated to yield similar benefits at substantially lower cost. LIMITATIONS: High-intensity statin-alone regimens were not studied in SHARP. CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin plus ezetimibe prevented atherosclerotic events in SHARP, but other less costly statin regimens are likely to be more cost-effective for reducing cardiovascular risk in CKD.",2016-01-20654,26597925,Am J Kidney Dis,Borislava Mihaylova,2016,67 / 4,576-84,No,26597925,"Borislava Mihaylova; Iryna Schlackow; William Herrington; Jingky Lozano-Kuhne; Seamus Kent; Jonathan Emberson; Christina Reith; Richard Haynes; Alan Cass; Jonathan Craig; Alastair Gray; Rory Collins; Martin J Landray; Colin Baigent; SHARP Collaborative Group; Cost-effectiveness of Simvastatin plus Ezetimibe for Cardiovascular Prevention in CKD: Results of the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), Am J Kidney Dis, 2016 Apr; 67(4):1523-6838; 576-84",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Simvastatin (20 mg daily) plus ezetimibe (10 mg daily) vs. Placebo,Have chronic kidney disease (CKD),Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,30390,United Kingdom,2011,56096.37
15626,Cost-effectiveness of Early Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 by Stage of Liver Fibrosis in a US Treatment-Naive Population,"IMPORTANCE: Novel treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are highly efficacious but costly. Thus, many insurers cover therapy only in advanced fibrosis stages. The added health benefits and costs of early treatment are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) treating all patients with HCV vs only those with advanced fibrosis and (2) treating each stage of fibrosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a decision-analytic model for the treatment of HCV genotype 1. The model used a lifetime horizon and societal perspective and was representative of all US patients with HCV genotype 1 who had not received previous treatment. Comparisons in the model included antiviral treatment of all fibrosis stages (METAVIR [Meta-analysis of Histological Data in Virial Hepatitis] stages F0 [no fibrosis] to F4 [cirrhosis]) vs treatment of stages F3 (numerous septa without cirrhosis) and F4 only and by specific fibrosis stage. Data were collected from March 1 to September 1, 2014, and analyzed from September 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Six HCV therapy options (particularly combined sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy) or no treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost and health outcomes were measured using total medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), calculated as the difference in costs between strategies divided by the difference in QALYs. RESULTS: We simulated 1000 individuals, but present the results normalized to a single HCV-infected person. In the base-case analysis, among patients receiving 8 or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir treatment, treating all fibrosis stages compared with treating stages F3 and F4 adds 0.73 QALYs and $28,899, for an ICER of $39,475 per QALY gained. Treating at stage F2 (portal fibrosis with rare septa) costs $19,833 per QALY gained vs waiting until stage F3; treating at stage F1 (portal fibrosis without septa), $81,165 per QALY gained compared with waiting until stage F2; and treating at stage F0, $187,065 per QALY gained compared with waiting until stage F1. Results for other regimens show a similar pattern. At base-case drug prices, treating 50% of all eligible US patients with HCV genotype 1 would cost $53 billion. In sensitivity analyses, the ICER for treating all stages vs treating stages F3 and F4 was most sensitive to cohort age, drug costs, utility values in stages F1 and F2, and percentage of patients eligible for 8-week therapy. Except for patients aged 70 years, the ICER remains less than $100,000 per QALY gained. A 46% reduction in cost of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir therapy decreases the ICER for treating at all fibrosis stages by 48%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulated model, treating HCV infection at early stages of fibrosis appeared to improve health outcomes and to be cost-effective but incurred substantial aggregate costs.

15627,Prevention of Hepatitis C by Screening and Treatment in U.S. Prisons,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in U.S. prisoners is high; however, HCV testing and treatment are rare. Infected inmates released back into society contribute to the spread of HCV in the general population. Routine hepatitis screening of inmates followed by new therapies may reduce ongoing HCV transmission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health and economic effect of HCV screening and treatment in prisons on the HCV epidemic in society. DESIGN: Agent-based microsimulation model of HCV transmission and progression of HCV disease. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Population in U.S. prisons and general community. TIME HORIZON: 30 years. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Risk-based and universal opt-out hepatitis C screening in prisons, followed by treatment in a portion of patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevention of HCV transmission and associated disease in prisons and society, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and total prison budget. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Implementing risk-based and opt-out screening could diagnose 41,900 to 122,700 new HCV cases in prisons in the next 30 years. Compared with no screening, these scenarios could prevent 5500 to 12,700 new HCV infections caused by released inmates, wherein about 90% of averted infections would have occurred outside of prisons. Screening could also prevent 4200 to 11,700 liver-related deaths. The ICERs of screening scenarios were $19,600 to $29,200 per QALY, and the respective first-year prison budget was $900 to $1150 million. Prisons would require an additional 12.4% of their current health care budget to implement such interventions. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the time horizon, and ICERs otherwise remained less than $50,000 per QALY.

15629,Prevention of Hepatitis C by Screening and Treatment in U.S. Prisons,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in U.S. prisoners is high; however, HCV testing and treatment are rare. Infected inmates released back into society contribute to the spread of HCV in the general population. Routine hepatitis screening of inmates followed by new therapies may reduce ongoing HCV transmission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health and economic effect of HCV screening and treatment in prisons on the HCV epidemic in society. DESIGN: Agent-based microsimulation model of HCV transmission and progression of HCV disease. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Population in U.S. prisons and general community. TIME HORIZON: 30 years. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Risk-based and universal opt-out hepatitis C screening in prisons, followed by treatment in a portion of patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevention of HCV transmission and associated disease in prisons and society, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and total prison budget. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Implementing risk-based and opt-out screening could diagnose 41,900 to 122,700 new HCV cases in prisons in the next 30 years. Compared with no screening, these scenarios could prevent 5500 to 12,700 new HCV infections caused by released inmates, wherein about 90% of averted infections would have occurred outside of prisons. Screening could also prevent 4200 to 11,700 liver-related deaths. The ICERs of screening scenarios were $19,600 to $29,200 per QALY, and the respective first-year prison budget was $900 to $1150 million. Prisons would require an additional 12.4% of their current health care budget to implement such interventions. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the time horizon, and ICERs otherwise remained less than $50,000 per QALY. LIMITATION: Data on transmission network, reinfection rate, and opt-out HCV screening rate are lacking. CONCLUSION: Universal opt-out HCV screening in prisons is highly cost-effective and would reduce HCV transmission and HCV-associated diseases primarily in the outside community.

Based on long-term clinical data (follow-up of 5.9 years) from the CLL8-trial, a Markov-model with three health states (Free from disease progression, Progressive disease, Death) was used to evaluate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost per life years gained (LYG) of R-FC from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI). The addition of rituximab to FC chemotherapy results in a gain of 1.1 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of R-FC compared with FC was euro17,979 per QALY (euro15,773 per LYG). Results were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

15632,Cost-effective Decisions in Detecting Silent Common Bile Duct Gallstones During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS), cholangiography (IOC), or expectant management without imaging (EM) for investigation of clinically silent common bile duct (CBD) stones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. BACKGROUND: The optimal algorithm for the evaluation of clinically silent CBD stones during routine cholecystectomy is unclear. METHODS: A decision tree model of CBD exploration was developed to determine the optimal diagnostic approach based on preoperative probability of choledocholithiasis. The model was parameterized with meta-analyses of previously published studies. The primary outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from each diagnostic strategy. A secondary outcome was the percentage of missed stones. Costs were from the perspective of the third party payer and sensitivity analyses were performed on all model parameters. RESULTS: In the base case analysis with a prevalence of stones of 9%, IOUS was the optimal strategy, yielding more QALYs (0.9858 vs 0.9825) at a lower expected cost ($311 vs $574) than EM. IOC yielded more QALYs than EM in the base case (0.9854) but at a much higher cost ($1122).

15634,Cost-effectiveness of motivational intervention with significant others for patients with alcohol misuse,"AIMS: To estimate the incremental cost, cost-effectiveness and benefit-cost ratio of incorporating a significant other (SO) into motivational intervention for alcohol misuse. DESIGN: We obtained economic data from the one year with the intervention in full operation for patients in a recent randomized trial. SETTING: The underlying trial took place at a major urban hospital in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: The trial randomized 406 (68.7% male) eligible hazardous drinkers (196 during the economic study) admitted to the emergency department or trauma unit. INTERVENTION: The motivational interview condition consisted of one in-person session featuring personalized normative feedback. The significant other motivational interview condition comprised one joint session with the participant and SO in which the SO''s perspective and support were elicited. MEASUREMENTS: We ascertained activities across 445 representative time segments through work sampling (including staff idle time), calculated the incremental cost in per patient of incorporating an SO, expressed the results in 2014 US$, incorporated quality and mortality effects from a closely related trial and derived the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. FINDINGS: From a health system perspective, the incremental cost per patient of adding an SO was $341.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) = $244.44-437.74]. The incremental cost per year per hazardous drinker averted was $3623 (CI = $1777-22,709), the cost per QALY gained $32,200 (CI = $15,800-201,700), and the benefit-cost ratio was 4.73 (95% CI = 0.7-9.66). If adding an SO into the intervention strategy were concentrated during the hours with highest risk or in a trauma unit, it would become even more cost-beneficial.

15635,Cost-Effectiveness of Dabigatran (150 mg Twice Daily) and Warfarin in Patients >/= 65 Years With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation,"Dabigatran has been shown to be superior to warfarin for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) but with higher out-of-pocket costs for patients. Although dabigatran has been shown to be cost effective from a societal perspective, cost implications for individual patients and insurers are not well described. We aimed to assess cost perspectives of each payer (Medicare and patient) in relation to administration, monitoring, and adverse outcomes for dabigatran and warfarin in patients with and without prescription drug coverage. Using a Markov model, we performed a decision analysis comparing 2 treatment strategies (dose-adjusted warfarin and dabigatran 150 mg twice daily) in patients 65 years old with NVAF, CHADS2 scores >/= 1, and Medicare insurance. Patients have a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 8.998 quality-adjusted life years with warfarin and 9.39 quality-adjusted life years with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. From Medicare's perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing dabigatran with warfarin was $35,311 for patients with Part D coverage and cost saving for patients without coverage. From the patient's perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing dabigatran with warfarin was cost saving for patients with Part D coverage and $63,884 for those without coverage. In patients >/= 65 years with NVAF and prescription insurance coverage, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily is both cost effective (Medicare's perspective) and cost saving (patient perspective) compared with warfarin, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000. However, patients without prescription drug coverage have a high out-of-pocket cost burden with dabigatran therapy, leading to a reduction in its cost-effectiveness compared with warfarin therapy. In conclusion, this Markov model suggests that Medicare Part D coverage influences the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran 150 mg daily compared with dose-adjusted warfarin from multiple payer perspectives.",2016-01-20729,26552509,Am J Cardiol,Brian M Salata,2016,117 / 1,54-60,No,26552509,"Brian M Salata; David W Hutton; Deborah A Levine; James B Froehlich; Geoffrey D Barnes; Cost-Effectiveness of Dabigatran (150 mg Twice Daily) and Warfarin in Patients >/= 65 Years With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation, Am J Cardiol, 2016 Jan 1; 117(1):0002-9149; 54-60",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily vs. Warfarin,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,Not Stated,Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,21980,United States,2013,24419.38
15636,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Microscopic and Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery Versus Medical Therapy in the Management of Microprolactinoma in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Although prolactinomas are treated effectively with dopamine agonists, some have proposed curative surgical resection for select cases of microprolactinomas to avoid life-long medical therapy. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing transsphenoidal surgery (either microsurgical or endoscopic) and medical therapy (either bromocriptine or cabergoline) with decision analysis modeling. METHODS: A 2-armed decision tree was created with TreeAge Pro Suite 2012 to compare upfront transsphenoidal surgery versus medical therapy. The economic perspective was that of the health care third-party payer. On the basis of a literature review, we assigned plausible distributions for costs and utilities to each potential outcome, taking into account medical and surgical costs and complications. Base-case analysis, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of each strategy at 5-year and 10-year time horizons. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, microscopic transsphenoidal surgery was the most cost-effective option at 5 years from the time of diagnosis; however, by the 10-year time horizon, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery became the most cost-effective option. At both time horizons, medical therapy (both bromocriptine and cabergoline) were found to be more costly and less effective than transsphenoidal surgery (i.e., the medical arm was dominated by the surgical arm in this model). Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that endoscopic resection would be the most cost-effective strategy if the cure rate from endoscopic surgery was greater than 90% and the complication rate was less than 1%. Monte Carlo simulation was performed for endoscopic surgery versus microscopic surgery at both time horizons. This analysis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $80,235 per quality-adjusted life years at 5 years and $40,737 per quality-adjusted life years at 10 years, implying that with increasing time intervals, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery is the more cost-effective treatment strategy. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the results of our model, transsphenoidal surgical resection of microprolactinomas, either microsurgical or endoscopic, appears to be more cost-effective than life-long medical therapy in young patients with life expectancy greater than 10 years.

This analysis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $80,235 per quality-adjusted life years at 5 years and $40,737 per quality-adjusted life years at 10 years, implying that with increasing time intervals, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery is the more cost-effective treatment strategy. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the results of our model, transsphenoidal surgical resection of microprolactinomas, either microsurgical or endoscopic, appears to be more cost-effective than life-long medical therapy in young patients with life expectancy greater than 10 years.

15640,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Microscopic and Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery Versus Medical Therapy in the Management of Microprolactinoma in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Although prolactinomas are treated effectively with dopamine agonists, some have proposed curative surgical resection for select cases of microprolactinomas to avoid life-long medical therapy. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing transsphenoidal surgery (either microsurgical or endoscopic) and medical therapy (either bromocriptine or cabergoline) with decision analysis modeling. METHODS: A 2-armed decision tree was created with TreeAge Pro Suite 2012 to compare upfront transsphenoidal surgery versus medical therapy. The economic perspective was that of the health care third-party payer. On the basis of a literature review, we assigned plausible distributions for costs and utilities to each potential outcome, taking into account medical and surgical costs and complications. Base-case analysis, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of each strategy at 5-year and 10-year time horizons. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, microscopic transsphenoidal surgery was the most cost-effective option at 5 years from the time of diagnosis; however, by the 10-year time horizon, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery became the most cost-effective option. At both time horizons, medical therapy (both bromocriptine and cabergoline) were found to be more costly and less effective than transsphenoidal surgery (i.e., the medical arm was dominated by the surgical arm in this model).

15648,Nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis in children: A feasibility study,"PURPOSE: Nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis appears to be feasible in adults. It is unclear whether the same is true for children. METHODS: Children 5-18 years with <48 h symptoms of acute appendicitis were offered nonoperative treatment: 2 doses of piperacillin IV, then ampicillin/clavulanate x1 week. Treatment failure (worsening on therapy) and recurrence (after completion of therapy) were noted. Patients who declined enrollment were asked to participate as controls. Cost-utility analysis was performed using Pediatric Quality of Life Scale (PedsQL(R)) to calculate quality-adjusted life month (QALM) for study and control patients. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients agreed to undergo nonoperative management, and 50 acted as controls. At a mean follow-up of 14 months, three of the 24 failed on therapy, and 2/21 returned with recurrent appendicitis at 43 and 52 days, respectively. Two patients elected to undergo an interval appendectomy despite absence of symptoms. Appendectomy-free rate at one year was therefore 71% (C.I. 50-87%). No patient developed perforation or other complications. Cost-utility analysis shows a 0.007-0.03 QALM increase and a $1359 savings from $4130 to $2771 per nonoperatively treated patient.

15649,Cost Effectiveness of the 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccination Program in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients Aged 50+ Years in Spain,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at elevated risk of pneumococcal infection. A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was approved for protection against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults. This study estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccinating COPD patients >/=50 years old with PCV13 compared with current vaccination policy (CVP) with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. METHODS: A Markov model accounting for the risks and costs for all-cause non-bacteremic pneumonia (NBP) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was developed. All parameters, such as disease incidence and costs (euro; 2015 values), were based on published data. The perspective of the analysis was that of the Spanish National Healthcare System, and the horizon of evaluation was lifetime in the base case. Vaccine effectiveness considered waning effect over time. Outcomes and costs were both discounted by 3% annually. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon and for a 629,747 COPD total population, PCV13 would prevent 2224 cases of inpatient NBP, 3134 cases of outpatient NBP, and 210 IPD extra cases in comparison with CVP. Additionally, 398 related deaths would be averted. The ICER was euro1518 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for PCV13 versus CVP. PCV13 was found to be cost effective versus CVP from a 5-year modelling horizon (1302 inpatient NBP and 1835 outpatient NBP cases together with 182 deaths would be prevented [ICER euro25,573/QALY]). Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model.

15650,Comparing the cost-effectiveness of four novel risk markers for screening asymptomatic individuals to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US population,"BACKGROUND: High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), coronary artery calcification on CT (CT calcium), carotid artery intima media thickness on ultrasound (cIMT) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) improve prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, but the benefit of screening with these novel risk markers in the U.S. population is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: A microsimulation model evaluating lifelong cost-effectiveness for individuals aged 40-85 at intermediate risk of CVD, using 2003-2004 NHANES-III (N=3736), Framingham Heart Study, U.S. Vital Statistics, meta-analyses of independent predictive effects of the four novel risk markers and treatment effects was constructed. Using both an intention-to-treat (assumes adherence <100% and incorporates disutility from taking daily medications) and an as-treated (100% adherence and no disutility) analysis, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (2014 US $), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER in $/QALY gained) of screening with hsCRP, CT coronary calcium, cIMT and ABI were established compared with current practice, full adherence to current guidelines, and ubiquitous statin therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis in men, screening with CT calcium was cost effective ($32,900/QALY) compared with current practice. In women, screening with hsCRP was cost effective ($32,467/QALY). In the as-treated analysis, statin therapy was both more effective and less costly than all other strategies for both men and women.

15665,Cost-effectiveness of new antiviral regimens for treatment-naive U.S. veterans with hepatitis C,"Recently approved, interferon-free medication regimens for treating hepatitis C are highly effective, but extremely costly. We aimed to identify cost-effective strategies for managing treatment-naive U.S. veterans with new hepatitis C medication regimens. We developed a Markov model with 1-year cycle length for a cohort of 60-year-old veterans with untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C seeking treatment in a typical year. We compared using sofosbuvir/ledipasvir or ombitasvir/ritonavir/paritaprevir/dasabuvir to treat: (1) any patient seeking treatment; (2) only patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; or (3) patients with advanced disease first and healthier patients 1 year later. The previous standard of care, sofosbuvir/simeprevir or sofosbuvir/pegylated interferon/ribavirin, was included for comparison. Patients could develop progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma, undergo transplantation, or die. Complications were less likely after sustained virological response. We calculated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and varied model inputs in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We used the Veterans Health Administration perspective with a lifetime time horizon and 3% annual discounting. Treating any patient with ombitasvir-based therapy was the preferred strategy ($35,560; 14.0 QALYs). All other strategies were dominated (greater costs/QALY gained than more effective strategies). Varying treatment efficacy, price, and/or duration changed the preferred strategy. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, treating any patient with ombitasvir-based therapy was cost-effective in 70% of iterations at a $50,000/QALY threshold and 65% of iterations at a $100,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSION: Managing any treatment-naive genotype 1 hepatitis C patient with ombitasvir-based therapy is the most economically efficient strategy, although price and efficacy can impact cost-effectiveness.

15668,Cost Effectiveness of Ofatumumab Plus Chlorambucil in First-Line Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of ofatumumab plus chlorambucil (OChl) versus chlorambucil in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia for whom fludarabine-based therapies are considered inappropriate from the perspective of the publicly funded healthcare system in Canada. METHODS: A semi-Markov model (3-month cycle length) used survival curves to govern progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Efficacy and safety data and health-state utility values were estimated from the COMPLEMENT-1 trial. Post-progression treatment patterns were based on clinical guidelines, Canadian treatment practices and published literature. Total and incremental expected lifetime costs (in Canadian dollars [$Can], year 2013 values), life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were computed. Uncertainty was assessed via deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The discounted lifetime health and economic outcomes estimated by the model showed that, compared with chlorambucil, first-line treatment with OChl led to an increase in QALYs (0.41) and total costs ($Can27,866) and to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $Can68,647 per QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, the ICER was most sensitive to the modelling time horizon and to the extrapolation of OS treatment effects beyond the trial duration. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can100,000 per QALY gained was 59 %. CONCLUSIONS: Base-case results indicated that improved overall response and PFS for OChl compared with chlorambucil translated to improved quality-adjusted life expectancy.

METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to estimate expected life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), direct costs and incremental costs per QALY and LY gained associated with use of Rd vs VMP over a patient's lifetime. Information on the efficacy and safety of Rd and VMP was based on data from multinational phase III clinical trials and a network meta-analysis. Pre-progression direct costs included the costs of Rd and VMP, treatment of adverse events (including prophylaxis) and routine care and monitoring associated with MM. Post-progression direct costs included costs of subsequent treatment(s) and routine care and monitoring for progressive disease, all obtained from published literature and estimated from a US payer perspective. Utilities were obtained from the aforementioned trials. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: Relative to VMP, use of Rd was expected to result in an additional 2.22 LYs and 1.47 QALYs (discounted). Patients initiated with Rd were expected to incur an additional $78,977 in mean lifetime direct costs (discounted) vs those initiated with VMP. The incremental costs per QALY and per LY gained with Rd vs VMP were $53,826 and $35,552, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, results were found to be most sensitive to differences in survival associated with Rd vs VMP, the cost of lenalidomide and the discount rate applied to effectiveness outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Rd was expected to result in greater LYs and QALYs compared with VMP, with similar overall costs per LY for each regimen. Results of this analysis indicated that Rd may be a cost-effective alternative to VMP as initial treatment for transplant-ineligible patients with MM, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well within the levels for recent advancements in oncology.",2016-01-20861,26517601,J Med Econ,S Z Usmani,2016,19 / 3,243-58,Yes,26517601,"S Z Usmani; J D Cavenagh; A R Belch; C Hulin; S Basu; D White; A Nooka; A Ervin-Haynes; W Yiu; Y Nagarwala; A Berger; C G Pelligra; S Guo; G Binder; C J Gibson; T Facon; Cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone vs bortezomib plus melphalan and prednisone in transplant-ineligible US patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma, J Med Econ, 2016; 19(3):1369-6998; 243-58",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bortezomib plus melphalan and prednisone (VMP) vs. Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,53826,United States,2014,58845.13
15670,Cost-effectiveness of treating chronic hepatitis C virus with direct-acting antivirals in people who inject drugs in Australia,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Reducing the burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver disease will require treating people who inject drugs (PWID), the group at most risk of infection and transmission. We determine the cost-effectiveness of treating PWID with interferon-free direct-acting antiviral therapy in Australia. METHODS: Using a deterministic model of HCV treatment and liver disease progression, including a fixed rate of re-infection, the expected healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of a cohort of newly HCV-infected PWID were calculated for: no treatment; treatment after initial infection (""early-treatment""); and treatment prior to developing compensated cirrhosis (""late-treatment""). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare scenarios. RESULTS: Late-treatment was cost-effective compared to no treatment, with a discounted average gain of 2.98 (95%confidence interval 2.88-5.22) QALYs per person for an additional cost of $15 132 ($11 246-18 922), giving an ICER of $5078 ($2847-5295) per QALY gained. Compared to late-treatment, early-treatment gained a further discounted average of 2.27 (0.58-4.80) QALYs per person for $38 794 ($34 789-41 367), giving an ICER of $17 090 ($2847-63 282), which was cost-effective in approximately 90% of Monte-Carlo uncertainty simulations.

CONCLUSIONS: Treating HCV-infected PWID with new therapies is cost-effective and could prevent a significant number of liver-related deaths.

15672,Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Screening Strategies in Singapore,"The objective of this study was to conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer's perspective in Singapore of 3 gestational diabetes mellitus screening strategies: universal, targeted, or no screening. A decision tree model assessed the primary outcome: incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort study, and the KK Women's and Children's Hospital's database.

15674,Long-term health economic benefits of sensor-augmented pump therapy vs continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion alone in type 1 diabetes: a UK perspective,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is an important treatment option for type 1 diabetes patients unable to achieve adequate glycemic control with multiple daily injections (MDI). Combining CSII with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) with a low glucose-suspend (LGS) feature may further improve glycemic control and reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia. A cost-effectiveness analysis of SAP + LGS vs CSII plus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was performed to determine the health economic benefits of SAP + LGS in type 1 diabetes patients using CSII in the UK. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the CORE diabetes model. Treatment effects were sourced from the literature, where SAP + LGS was associated with a projected HbA1c reduction of -1.49% vs -0.62% for CSII, and a reduced frequency of severe hypoglycemia. The time horizon was that of patient lifetimes; future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% and 1.5% per annum, respectively. RESULTS: Projected outcomes showed that SAP + LGS was associated with higher mean quality-adjusted life expectancy (17.9 vs 14.9 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], SAP + LGS vs CSII), and higher life expectancy (23.8 vs 21.9 years), but higher mean lifetime direct costs (GBP 125,559 vs GBP 88,991), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 12,233 per QALY gained for SAP + LGS vs CSII. Findings of the base-case analysis remained robust in sensitivity analyses.

We used a decision tree and Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the current U.S. strategy and two alternatives: (1) Universal hepatitis B vaccination (HepB) strategy: No pregnant women are screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). All infants receive HepB before hospital discharge; no infants receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). (2) Current strategy: All pregnant women are screened for HBsAg. Infants of HBsAg-positive women receive HepB and HBIG </=12 hours of birth. All other infants receive HepB before hospital discharge. (3) Antiviral prophylaxis strategy: All pregnant women are screened for HBsAg. HBsAg-positive women have HBV-DNA load measured. Antiviral prophylaxis is offered for 4 months starting in the third trimester to women with DNA load >/=10(6) copies/mL. HepB and HBIG are administered at birth to infants of HBsAg-positive women, and HepB is administered before hospital discharge to infants of HBsAg-negative women. Effects were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Compared to the universal HepB strategy, the current strategy prevented 1,006 chronic HBV infections and saved 13,600 QALYs (ICER: $6,957/QALY saved).

15677,Health economic assessment of universal immunization of toddlers against Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) in Mexico,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) has shifted from high to intermediate endemicity in Mexico, which may increase the risk of clinically significant HAV infections in older children, adolescents and adults. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of single-dose or 2-dose universal infant HAV vaccination strategy in Mexico, compared with no vaccination. A previously published dynamic model estimated the expected number of HAV cases with each strategy, and a decision model was used to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) expected with each strategy.

Costs and QALYs after the first year were discounted at 5% annually. Input data were taken from national databases and published sources where available. The single-dose HAV vaccination strategy had an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of Mexican peso (MXN) 2,270 per QALY gained, compared with no vaccination. The two-dose strategy had an ICUR of MXN 14,961/QALY compared with no vaccination, and an ICUR of MXN 78,280/QALY compared with the single-dose strategy.

15680,Cost-Effectiveness of Laparoscopic Hysterectomy With Morcellation Compared With Abdominal Hysterectomy for Presumed Myomas,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Hysterectomy for presumed leiomyomata is 1 of the most common surgical procedures performed in nonpregnant women in the United States. Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) with morcellation is an appealing alternative to abdominal hysterectomy (AH) but may result in dissemination of malignant cells and worse outcomes in the setting of an occult leiomyosarcoma (LMS). We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LH versus AH. DESIGN: Decision-analytic model of 100 000 women in the United States assessing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING: U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: Adult premenopausal women undergoing LH or AH for presumed benign leiomyomata. INTERVENTIONS: We developed a decision-analytic model from a provider perspective across 5 years, comparing the cost-effectiveness of LH to AH in terms of dollar (2014 US dollars) per QALY gained. The model included average total direct medical costs and utilities associated with the procedures, complications, and clinical outcomes. Baseline estimates and ranges for cost and probability data were drawn from the existing literature. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Estimated overall deaths were lower in LH versus AH (98 vs 103). Death due to LMS was more common in LH versus AH (86 vs 71). Base-case assumptions estimated that average per person costs were lower in LH versus AH, with a savings of $2193 ($24 181 vs $26 374). Over 5 years, women in the LH group experienced 4.99 QALY versus women in the AH group with 4.91 QALY (incremental gain of .085 QALYs). LH dominated AH in base-case estimates: LH was both less expensive and yielded greater QALY gains. The ICER was sensitive to operative costs for LH and AH. Varying operative costs of AH yielded an ICER of $87 651/QALY gained (minimum) to AH being dominated (maximum). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, in which all input parameters and costs were varied simultaneously, demonstrated a relatively robust model. The AH approach was dominated 68.9% of the time; 17.4% of simulations fell above the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY gained. CONCLUSION: When considering total direct hospital costs, complications, and morbidity, LH was less costly and yielded more QALYs gained versus AH. Driven by the rarity of occult LMS and the reduced incidence of intra- and postoperative complications, LH with morcellation may be a more cost-effective and less invasive alternative to AH and should remain an option for women needing hysterectomy for leiomyomata.",2016-01-20954,26475764,J Minim Invasive Gynecol,Sarah E Rutstein,2016,23 / 2,223-33,No,26475764,"Sarah E Rutstein; Matthew T Siedhoff; Elizabeth J Geller; Kemi M Doll; Jennifer M Wu; Daniel L Clarke-Pearson; Stephanie B Wheeler; Cost-Effectiveness of Laparoscopic Hysterectomy With Morcellation Compared With Abdominal Hysterectomy for Presumed Myomas, J Minim Invasive Gynecol, 2016 Feb 1; 23(2):1553-4669; 223-33",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic hyterectomy with morcellation vs. Abdominal hysterectomy,Premenopausal with presumed benign leiomyomata,64 Years,19 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-25800,United States,2014,-28205.78
15681,Cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir-based regimen for treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 3 infection in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: New regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 have demonstrated substantial improvement in sustained virologic response (SVR) compared with existing therapies, but are considerably more expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two novel all-oral, interferon-free regimens for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 3: daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir (DCV + SOF) and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF + RBV), from a Canadian health-system perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was developed to compare the effect of various treatment strategies on the natural history of the disease and their associated costs in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Patients were initially distributed across fibrosis stages F0-F4, and may incur disease progression through fibrosis stages and on to end-stage liver disease complications and death; or may achieve SVR. Clinical efficacy, health-related quality-of-life, costs, and transition probabilities were based on published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess parameter uncertainty associated with the analysis. RESULTS: In treatment-naive patients, the expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for interferon-free regimens were higher for DCV + SOF (12.37) and SOF + RBV (12.48) compared to that of pINF + RBV (11.71) over a lifetime horizon, applying their clinical trial treatment durations. The expected costs were higher for DCV + SOF ($170,371) and SOF + RBV ($194,776) vs pINF + RBV regimen ($90,905). Compared to pINF + RBV, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were $120,671 and $135,398 per QALYs for DCV + SOF and SOF + RBV, respectively. In treatment-experienced patients, DCV + SOF regimen dominated the SOF + RBV regimen. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 100% probability that a DCV + SOF regimen was cost saving in treatment-experienced patients.

We constructed a probabilistic decision analytical model to estimate health care costs and outcomes quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) using data from the meta-analysis, literature, and national UK data. We compared the cost-effectiveness of four decision-making strategies: testing with NITs and treating patients with fibrosis stage >/=F2, testing with liver biopsy and treating patients with >/=F2, treat none (watchful waiting) and treat all irrespective of fibrosis. Treating all patients without prior fibrosis assessment had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound28,137 per additional QALY gained for HBeAg-negative patients. For HBeAg-positive patients, using Fibroscan was the most cost-effective option with an ICER of pound23,345. The base case results remained robust in the majority of sensitivity analyses, but were sensitive to changes in the >/= F2 prevalence and the benefit of treatment in patients with F0-F1. For HBeAg-negative patients, strategies excluding NITs were the most cost-effective: treating all patients regardless of fibrosis level if the high cost-effectiveness threshold of pound30,000 is accepted; watchful waiting if not.

15698,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir in difficult to treat Japanese patients chronically infected with hepatitis C genotype 1b,"AIM: Standard of care for chronic hepatitis C in Japan is currently a pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha + ribavirin (PR)-based regimen, notably associated with efficacy and tolerability issues. The advent of novel direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has provided more efficacious and better tolerated treatments. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of the daclatasvir + asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) DAA regimen in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b who had previously not responded to or were ineligible for IFN-containing regimens. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using an established Markov model compared DCV + ASV with simeprevir + PR (SMV + PR), telaprevir + PR (TVR + PR) and no treatment using Japanese-specific model inputs, with costs and utility values discounted at 2%. A cohort of patients was simulated until death and predicted quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and costs were estimated. A subgroup analysis of patients with no DCV resistance was conducted. RESULTS: In all scenarios, DCV + ASV was predicted to be dominant over the comparator; namely, DCV + ASV was associated with increased QALY gains and decreased cost. In patients treated during the chronic hepatitis C stage, cost reductions were yen1 057 288-2 619 206, and in patients treated during the compensated cirrhosis (CC) stage, reductions were yen1 032 224-2 531 930. QALY gains were 0.749-2.609 and 0.874-3.043, respectively. Results improved when considering the subgroup of patients without DCV resistance.
