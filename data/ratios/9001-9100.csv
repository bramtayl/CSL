9031,Economic outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents versus bypass surgery for patients with left main or 3-vessel coronary artery disease: One-year results from the SYNTAX trial,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to revascularization for patients with 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD). BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that, despite higher initial costs, long-term costs with bypass surgery (CABG) in multivessel CAD are similar to those for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The impact of drug-eluting stents (DES) on these results is unknown. METHODS: The SYNTAX trial randomized 1800 patients with left main or 3-vessel CAD to either CABG (n=897) or PCI using paclitaxel-eluting stents (n=903). Resource utilization data were collected prospectively for all patients, and cumulative 1-year costs were assessed from the perspective of the U.S. healthcare system. RESULTS: Total costs for the initial hospitalization were $5693/patient higher with CABG, whereas follow-up costs were $2282/patient higher with PCI due mainly to more frequent revascularization procedures and higher outpatient medication costs. Total 1-year costs were thus $3590/patient higher with CABG, while quality-adjusted life expectancy was slightly higher with PCI. Although PCI was an economically dominant strategy for the overall population, cost-effectiveness varied considerably according to angiographic complexity. For patients with high angiographic complexity (SYNTAX score > 32), total 1-year costs were similar for CABG and PCI, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for CABG was $43,486 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with 3-vessel or left main CAD, PCI is an economically attractive strategy over the first year for patients with low and moderate angiographic complexity, while CABG is favored among patients with high angiographic complexity.

9036,A cost-effectiveness analysis of using azacitidine vs. decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.,"Abstract Objective: Azacitidine and decitabine are used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the United States (US). This study sought to assess their relative cost-effectiveness. Design and methods: The authors developed a cost-effectiveness Markov model (1-month cycles) tracking hypothetical cohorts of MDS patients treated with azacitidine or decitabine over 2 years. The model used a US payer perspective and 2009 costs. Health states modeled included MDS with Transfusion Dependence, MDS with Transfusion Independence, Progression to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and Death. Incremental cost-effectiveness outcomes included cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), cost per life year (LY), cost per patient-month of transfusion independence, and cost per case of AML progression avoided. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on key model parameters. Results: Compared to decitabine, azacitidine was associated with better survival (1.512 LYs vs 1.292), more QALYs gained (1.041 vs 0.870), more patient-months with transfusion independence (8.328 vs 6.224), and a greater proportion of patients avoiding progression to AML (50.9&percnt; vs 28.5&percnt;). Total per-patient costs over 2 years for azacitidine were lower than for decitabine (&dollar;150,322 vs &dollar;166, 212). Limitations: To inform and update the model over time, it will be important that randomized or observational clinical studies be conducted to directly compare azacitidine and decitabine, provide new information on how these medicines are used, and on their relative clinical effectiveness. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that azacitidine provides greater clinical benefit and costs less than decitabine across all key outcomes. These results accentuate the positive role of azacitidine in providing cost-effective care for MDS.",2012-01-07897,21988635,J Med Econ,Risha Gidwani,2012,/,,Yes,21988635,"Risha Gidwani; Zeba M Khan; Pierre Fenaux; C L Beach; Chris L Pashos; A cost-effectiveness analysis of using azacitidine vs. decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes., J Med Econ, ; ():1369-6998",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Azacitidine vs. Decitabine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-92923.98,United States,2009,-112100.7
9037,COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF THE SPANISH RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY PROGRAM.,"BACKGROUND: We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis of the Spanish Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) program for end-stage renal disease patients from a societal perspective. The current Spanish situation was compared with several hypothetical scenarios. METHODS: A Markov chain model was used as a foundation for simulations of the Spanish RRT program in three temporal horizons (5, 10, and 15 years). The current situation (scenario 1) was compared with three different scenarios: increased proportion of overall scheduled (planned) incident patients (scenario 2); constant proportion of overall scheduled incident patients, but increased proportion of scheduled incident patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), resulting in a lower proportion of scheduled incident patients on hemodialysis (HD) (scenario 3); and increased overall proportion of scheduled incident patients together with increased scheduled incidence of patients on PD (scenario 4). RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of scenarios 2, 3, and 4, when compared with scenario 1, were estimated to be, respectively, -?83 150, -?354 977, and -?235 886 per incremental quality-adjusted life year (?QALY), evidencing both moderate cost savings and slight effectiveness gains.

9040,"Cost-effectiveness of the Concord Minimal Trauma Fracture Liaison service, a prospective, controlled fracture prevention study.","We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a fracture liaison service prospectively designed to have a parallel control group treated by standard care. The clinical effectiveness of this service was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio versus standard care of Australian dollars (AUD) 17,291 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. INTRODUCTION: Osteoporotic fractures are a major burden for national health services. The risk of re-fracture following an osteoporotic fracture is particularly high. In a study unique in prospectively having a control group treated by standard care, we recently demonstrated that a Minimal Trauma Fracture Liaison (MTFL) service significantly reduces the risk of re-fracture by 80%. Since the service involves greater use of resources, we have now evaluated whether it is cost-effective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed that incorporated fracture probabilities and resource utilization data (expressed in AUD) obtained directly from the 4-year MTFL service clinical study. Resource utilization, local cost and mortality data and fracture-related health utility data were used to calculate QALYs with the MTFL service and standard care. Main outcome measures were: additional costs of the MTFL service over standard care, the financial savings achieved through reduced fractures and changes in QALYs associated with reduced fractures calculated over a 10-year simulation period. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 5% annually. Sensitivity analyses quantified the effects of different assumptions of effectiveness and resource utilization associated with the MTFL service. RESULTS: The MTFL service improved QALYs by 0.089?years and led to increased costs of AUD 1,486 per patient versus standard care over the 10-year simulation period. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio versus standard care was AUD 17,291 per QALY gained. Results were robust under all plausible assumptions.

9041,"Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of reduced mild hypoglycaemia in subjects with Type 1 diabetes treated with Insulin detemir or NPH insulin in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands.","Aims: To estimate short-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir vs. NPH insulin based on the incidence of mild hypoglycaemia in subjects with Type 1 diabetes in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands. Methods: A model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness based on mild (self-treated) hypoglycaemia and pharmacy costs over 1 year. Published rates of mild hypoglycaemia were used for NPH insulin and insulin detemir. Effectiveness was calculated in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy. Pharmacy costs were accounted using published prices and defined daily doses for both insulins. Costs were expressed in 2010 euros (?). Results: Treatment with insulin detemir was associated with fewer mild hypoglycaemic events than NPH insulin (mean rates of 26.3 vs. 35.5 events per person-year), leading to an improvement in mean quality-adjusted life expectancy of approximately 0.019 (0.030) quality-adjusted life years (standard deviation). Annual costs were ? 573.55 (110.42) vs. ? 332.76 (62.18) in Denmark for insulin detemir and NPH insulin, respectively. These values were ? 545.79 (106.54) vs. ? 306.12 (57.78) in Sweden, ? 720.10 (140.74) vs. ? 408.73 (78.61) in Finland and ? 584.01 (109.47) vs. ? 359.60 (64.84) in the Netherlands.

Published rates of mild hypoglycaemia were used for NPH insulin and insulin detemir. Effectiveness was calculated in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy. Pharmacy costs were accounted using published prices and defined daily doses for both insulins. Costs were expressed in 2010 euros (?). Results: Treatment with insulin detemir was associated with fewer mild hypoglycaemic events than NPH insulin (mean rates of 26.3 vs. 35.5 events per person-year), leading to an improvement in mean quality-adjusted life expectancy of approximately 0.019 (0.030) quality-adjusted life years (standard deviation). Annual costs were ? 573.55 (110.42) vs. ? 332.76 (62.18) in Denmark for insulin detemir and NPH insulin, respectively.

9045,Head-to-head comparison of the 70-gene signature versus the 21-gene assay: cost-effectiveness and the effect of compliance.,"Both the 70-gene signature and the 21-gene assay are novel prognostic tests used to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in patients with early breast cancer. Although the results of ongoing prospective trials will only become available in some years, the tests have already been included in clinical guidelines such as St. Gallen's. In literature, the cost-effectiveness (CE) of both tests as compared to conventional prognostic tests has been described. We report on a direct comparison of CE; as different compliance rates were reported, we also taken these into account. A Markov decision model with a time horizon of 20?years was developed to assess the effects, costs and CE of three alternatives; 21-gene, 70-gene, and St. Gallen (SG) or Adjuvant Online (AO), dependent on the dataset used in patients with early, node-negative, breast cancer. Sensitivity and specificity were based on two datasets, incorporating compliances rates based on literature. For both datasets, whereas the 70-gene signature yielded more quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and was less costly; the 21-gene amounted more life years (LYs) but was more costly. The decision uncertainty surrounding the probability of CE of the Thomassen-series amounted 55% for both cost/LY and cost/QALY, for the Fan-series 80% for LY and 65% for QALYs. Taking reported compliance with discordant test results into account, in general, the effect of all strategies decreased, while the costs increased, without relatively influencing the CEA performance. This comparison indicates that the performances of the 70-gene and the 21-gene based on reported studies are close.

9049,Fondaparinux for isolated superficial vein thrombosis of the legs: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"According to the Comparison of Arixtra in Lower Limb Superficial Vein Thrombosis with Placebo (CALISTO) study, a recent randomized, controlled trial, prophylactic fondaparinux can prevent thrombotic complications following superficial vein thrombosis (SVT). The cost-effectiveness of this treatment remains to be determined.We developed a decision-tree model comparing fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days vs no treatment of SVT. It included all clinical events associated with SVT, its treatment, its complications, and all respective quality-adjustment factors. Data were mainly derived from the CALISTO study and the published literature. Measured outcomes comprised clinical events (VTE, major hemorrhage, death), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The analysis was conducted using a lifetime time horizon from a health-care system perspective. We performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate parameter uncertainty.In 10,000 patients, we estimated that fondaparinux would prevent 123 VTE events and two deaths. On a per-patient basis, the incremental QALY compared with no treatment was 0.04 (1 day) at an incremental cost of $1,734, resulting in an ICER of $500,000 per QALY. This result remained robust in the one-way sensitivity analyses, with an ICER remaining > $100,000 per QALY throughout all ranges. Based on probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability that fondaparinux was cost-effective was 1% at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY.Fondaparinux for 45 days does not appear to be cost-effective when treating patients with isolated SVT of the legs. A better value for money could be obtained in subgroups of patients with a higher incidence of VTE after SVT.

9052,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C virus antiviral treatment for injection drug user populations,"Injecting drug use is the main risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in most developed countries. HCV antiviral treatment (peginterferon-a + ribavirin) has been shown to be cost-effective for patients with no reinfection risk. We examined the cost-effectiveness of providing antiviral treatment for injecting drug users (IDUs) as compared with treating ex/non-IDUs or no treatment. A dynamic model of HCV transmission and disease progression was developed, incorporating: a fixed number of antiviral treatments allocated at the mild HCV stage over 10 years, no retreatment after treatment failure, potential reinfection, and three baseline IDU HCV chronic prevalence scenarios (20%, 40%, and 60%). We performed a probabilistic cost-utility analysis estimating long-term costs and outcomes measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing treating IDUs, ex/non-IDUs, or no treatment. Antiviral treatment for IDUs is the most cost-effective option in the 20% and 40% baseline chronic prevalence settings, with ICERs compared with no treatment of ? 521 and ? 2,539 per QALY saved, respectively. Treatment of ex/non-IDUs is dominated in these scenarios. At 60% baseline prevalence, treating ex/non-IDUs is slightly more likely to be the more cost-effective option (with an ICER compared with no treatment of ? 6,803), and treating IDUs dominated due to high reinfection. A sensitivity analysis indicates these rankings hold even when IDU sustained viral response rates as compared with ex/non-IDUs are halved.

HCV antiviral treatment (peginterferon-a + ribavirin) has been shown to be cost-effective for patients with no reinfection risk. We examined the cost-effectiveness of providing antiviral treatment for injecting drug users (IDUs) as compared with treating ex/non-IDUs or no treatment. A dynamic model of HCV transmission and disease progression was developed, incorporating: a fixed number of antiviral treatments allocated at the mild HCV stage over 10 years, no retreatment after treatment failure, potential reinfection, and three baseline IDU HCV chronic prevalence scenarios (20%, 40%, and 60%). We performed a probabilistic cost-utility analysis estimating long-term costs and outcomes measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing treating IDUs, ex/non-IDUs, or no treatment. Antiviral treatment for IDUs is the most cost-effective option in the 20% and 40% baseline chronic prevalence settings, with ICERs compared with no treatment of ? 521 and ? 2,539 per QALY saved, respectively. Treatment of ex/non-IDUs is dominated in these scenarios.

9056,Cost-effectiveness of internal limiting membrane peeling versus no peeling for patients with an idiopathic full-thickness macular hole: results from a randomised controlled trial,"Aim To determine whether internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling is cost-effective compared with no peeling for patients with an idiopathic stage 2 or 3 full-thickness macular hole. Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed alongside a randomised controlled trial. 141 participants were randomly allocated to receive macular-hole surgery, with either ILM peeling or no peeling. Health-service resource use, costs and quality of life were calculated for each participant. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated at 6 months. Results At 6 months, the total costs were on average higher (?424, 95% CI -182 to 1045) in the No Peel arm, primarily owing to the higher reoperation rate in the No Peel arm. The mean additional QALYs from ILM peel at 6 months were 0.002 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.013), adjusting for baseline EQ-5D and other minimisation factors. A mean incremental cost per QALY was not computed, as Peeling was on average less costly and slightly more effective. A stochastic analysis suggested that there was more than a 90% probability that Peeling would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?20?000 per QALY. Conclusion Although there is no evidence of a statistically significant difference in either costs or QALYs between macular hole surgery with or without ILM peeling, the balance of probabilities is that ILM Peeling is likely to be a cost-effective option for the treatment of macular holes.

9057,Comparative cost-effectiveness of strategies to prevent postoperative clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease,"BACKGROUND: A number of treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD). The optimal strategy is unknown. The aim was to evaluate the comparative cost-effectiveness of postoperative strategies to prevent clinical recurrence of CD. METHODS: Three prophylactic strategies were compared to ""no prophylaxis""; mesalamine, azathioprine (AZA) / 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), and infliximab. The probability of clinical recurrence, endoscopic recurrence, and therapy discontinuation due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were extracted from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Quality-of-life scores and treatment costs were derived from published data. The primary model evaluated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness at 1 year after surgery. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of a range of recurrence rates on cost-effectiveness. An exploratory analysis evaluated cost-effectiveness outcomes 5 years after surgery. RESULTS: A strategy of ""no prophylaxis"" was the least expensive one at 1 and 5 years after surgery. Compared to this approach, AZA/6-MP had the most favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ($299,188/QALY gained), and yielded the highest net health benefits of the medication strategies at 1 year. Sensitivity analysis determined that the ICER of AZA/6-MP was preferable to mesalamine up to a recurrence rate of 52%, but mesalamine dominated at higher rates. In the 5-year exploratory analysis, mesalamine had the most favorable ICER over 5 years ($244,177/QALY gained).

9097,SF-6D and EQ-5D result in widely divergent incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in a clinical trial of older women: implications for health policy decisions,"Using two instruments (SF-6D and EQ-5D) to estimate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), we conducted an economic evaluation of a 12-month randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up study in older women to evaluate the value for money of two doses of resistance training compared with balance and tone classes. We found that the incremental QALYs estimated from the SF-6D were two- to threefold greater than those estimated from the EQ-5D. INTRODUCTION: Decision makers must continually choose between existing and new interventions. Hence, economic evaluations are increasingly prevalent. The impact of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates using different instruments on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) is not well understood in older adults. Thus, we compared ICERs, in older women, estimated by the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and the Short Form-6D (SF-6D) to discuss implications on decision making. METHODS: Using both the EQ-5D and the SF-6D, we compared the incremental cost per QALY gained in a randomized controlled trial of resistance training in 155 community-dwelling women aged 65 to 75?years. The 12-month randomized controlled trial included a subsequent 12-month follow-up. Our focus, the follow-up study, included 123 of the 155 participants from the Brain Power study; 98 took part in the economic evaluation (twice-weekly balance and tone exercises, n?=?28; once-weekly resistance training, n?=?35; twice-weekly resistance training, n?=?35). Our primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per QALY gained of once- or twice-weekly resistance training compared with balance and tone exercises. RESULTS: At cessation of the follow-up study, the incremental QALY was -0.051 (EQ-5D) and -0.144 (SF-6D) for the once-weekly resistance training group and -0.081 (EQ-5D) and -0.127 (SF-6D) for the twice-weekly resistance training group compared with balance and tone classes. CONCLUSION: The incremental QALYs estimated from the SF-6D were two- to threefold greater than those estimated from the EQ-5D.
