16401,Adjuvant Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer by Age and Hormone Receptor Status: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibody trastuzumab improves outcomes in patients with node-positive HER2+ early breast cancer. Given trastuzumab''s high cost, we aimed to estimate its cost-effectiveness by heterogeneity in age and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, which has previously been unexplored, to assist prioritisation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov macro-simulation model, with a lifetime horizon, comparing a 12-mo regimen of trastuzumab with chemotherapy alone using the latest (2014) effectiveness measures from landmark randomised trials. A New Zealand (NZ) health system perspective was adopted, employing high-quality national administrative data. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years for trastuzumab versus chemotherapy alone are two times higher (2.33 times for the age group 50-54 y; 95% CI 2.29-2.37) for the worst prognosis (ER-/PR-) subtype compared to the best prognosis (ER+/PR+) subtype, causing incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the former to be less than half those of the latter for the age groups from 25-29 to 90-94 y (0.44 times for the age group 50-54 y; 95% CI 0.43-0.45). If we were to strictly apply an arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold equal to the NZ gross domestic product per capita (2011 purchasing power parity [PPP]-adjusted: US$30,300; euro23,700; pound21,200), our study suggests that trastuzumab (2011 PPP-adjusted US$45,400/euro35,900/ pound21,900 for 1 y at formulary prices) may not be cost-effective for ER+ (which are 61% of all) node-positive HER2+ early breast cancer patients but cost-effective for ER-/PR- subtypes (37% of all cases) to age 69 y. Market entry of trastuzumab biosimilars will likely reduce the ICER to below this threshold for premenopausal ER+/PR- cancer but not for ER+/PR+ cancer. Sensitivity analysis using the best-case effectiveness measure for ER+ cancer had the same result. A key limitation was a lack of treatment-effect data by hormone receptor subtype. Heterogeneity was restricted to age and hormone receptor status; tumour size/grade heterogeneity could be explored in future work. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how cost-effectiveness can vary greatly by heterogeneity in age and hormone receptor subtype. Resource allocation and licensing of subsidised therapies such as trastuzumab should consider demographic and clinical heterogeneity; there is currently a profound disconnect between how funding decisions are made (largely agnostic to heterogeneity) and the principles of personalised medicine.",2016-01-22384,27504960,PLoS Med,William Leung,2016,13 / 8,e1002067,No,27504960,"William Leung; Giorgi Kvizhinadze; Nisha Nair; Tony Blakely; Adjuvant Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer by Age and Hormone Receptor Status: A Cost-Utility Analysis, PLoS Med, 2016 Aug; 13(8):1549-1676; e1002067",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Not Stated,12 month trastuzumab regimen vs. Chemotherapy alone (treatment with an anthracycline),Estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive (ER+/PR+),Not Stated,85 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,337945,New Zealand,2011,491840.06

Given trastuzumab''s high cost, we aimed to estimate its cost-effectiveness by heterogeneity in age and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, which has previously been unexplored, to assist prioritisation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov macro-simulation model, with a lifetime horizon, comparing a 12-mo regimen of trastuzumab with chemotherapy alone using the latest (2014) effectiveness measures from landmark randomised trials. A New Zealand (NZ) health system perspective was adopted, employing high-quality national administrative data. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years for trastuzumab versus chemotherapy alone are two times higher (2.33 times for the age group 50-54 y; 95% CI 2.29-2.37) for the worst prognosis (ER-/PR-) subtype compared to the best prognosis (ER+/PR+) subtype, causing incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the former to be less than half those of the latter for the age groups from 25-29 to 90-94 y (0.44 times for the age group 50-54 y; 95% CI 0.43-0.45). If we were to strictly apply an arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold equal to the NZ gross domestic product per capita (2011 purchasing power parity [PPP]-adjusted: US$30,300; euro23,700; pound21,200), our study suggests that trastuzumab (2011 PPP-adjusted US$45,400/euro35,900/ pound21,900 for 1 y at formulary prices) may not be cost-effective for ER+ (which are 61% of all) node-positive HER2+ early breast cancer patients but cost-effective for ER-/PR- subtypes (37% of all cases) to age 69 y.

If we were to strictly apply an arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold equal to the NZ gross domestic product per capita (2011 purchasing power parity [PPP]-adjusted: US$30,300; euro23,700; pound21,200), our study suggests that trastuzumab (2011 PPP-adjusted US$45,400/euro35,900/ pound21,900 for 1 y at formulary prices) may not be cost-effective for ER+ (which are 61% of all) node-positive HER2+ early breast cancer patients but cost-effective for ER-/PR- subtypes (37% of all cases) to age 69 y. Market entry of trastuzumab biosimilars will likely reduce the ICER to below this threshold for premenopausal ER+/PR- cancer but not for ER+/PR+ cancer. Sensitivity analysis using the best-case effectiveness measure for ER+ cancer had the same result. A key limitation was a lack of treatment-effect data by hormone receptor subtype. Heterogeneity was restricted to age and hormone receptor status; tumour size/grade heterogeneity could be explored in future work. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how cost-effectiveness can vary greatly by heterogeneity in age and hormone receptor subtype.

16426,Interval Appendectomy: Finding the Breaking Point for Cost-Effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Patients with phlegmonous appendicitis can be managed nonoperatively, yet debate continues about the need for interval appendectomy (IA), given the low risk of recurrence or neoplasm. We sought to determine for which patient age interval appendectomy is cost-effective. METHODS: Using TreeAge software, a cost-effectiveness model was developed. Two strategies were compared, IA and no interval appendectomy (NIA). Interval appendectomy patients were modeled with probability of benign pathology, cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, and possible operative complications. Patients with NIA were modeled with the probability of recurrence. The probability of malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease developing, or death occurring during a lifetime, was modeled. Base case scenarios at 18, 35, and 50 years old were completed using a Monte Carlo microsimulation. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was completed using 2-dimensional sample as a Monte Carlo microsimulation to account for variability for patients 18 to 60 years old. Probabilities of complications developing, pathologic diagnosis requiring additional management, and state utility were extracted from published data. Costs were collected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and utility was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: For an 18-year-old patient, IA costs $9,417.22 with a gain of 16.59 QALYs compared with NIA, which costs $11,613.57 with a gain of 16.52 QALYs. For a 35-year-old, IA costs $8,989.16 with 9.1 QALYs gained. No interval appendectomy costs $6,614.61 and 9.09 QALYs gained. For the 35-year-old patient, the interval cost-effectiveness ratio comparing NIA with IA is $237,455/QALY. As patient age increases, the interval cost-effectiveness ratio increases. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, IA remains cost-effective until the patient is 33 years old.

Costs were collected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and utility was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: For an 18-year-old patient, IA costs $9,417.22 with a gain of 16.59 QALYs compared with NIA, which costs $11,613.57 with a gain of 16.52 QALYs. For a 35-year-old, IA costs $8,989.16 with 9.1 QALYs gained. No interval appendectomy costs $6,614.61 and 9.09 QALYs gained. For the 35-year-old patient, the interval cost-effectiveness ratio comparing NIA with IA is $237,455/QALY. As patient age increases, the interval cost-effectiveness ratio increases.

16428,Interval Appendectomy: Finding the Breaking Point for Cost-Effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Patients with phlegmonous appendicitis can be managed nonoperatively, yet debate continues about the need for interval appendectomy (IA), given the low risk of recurrence or neoplasm. We sought to determine for which patient age interval appendectomy is cost-effective. METHODS: Using TreeAge software, a cost-effectiveness model was developed. Two strategies were compared, IA and no interval appendectomy (NIA). Interval appendectomy patients were modeled with probability of benign pathology, cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, and possible operative complications. Patients with NIA were modeled with the probability of recurrence. The probability of malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease developing, or death occurring during a lifetime, was modeled. Base case scenarios at 18, 35, and 50 years old were completed using a Monte Carlo microsimulation. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was completed using 2-dimensional sample as a Monte Carlo microsimulation to account for variability for patients 18 to 60 years old. Probabilities of complications developing, pathologic diagnosis requiring additional management, and state utility were extracted from published data. Costs were collected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and utility was quality-adjusted life years (QALY).

16429,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Using the JBR.10-Based 15-Gene Expression Signature to Guide Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Early Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) improved survival in the NCIC Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 trial of resected stage IB/II non-small-cell lung cancer. A prognostic 15-gene expression signature was developed, which may also predict for benefit from ACT. An exploratory economic analysis was conducted to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of using the 15-gene signature in guiding ACT decisions. METHODS: A decision analytic model was populated by study patients with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tumor profiling, current costs, and quality-adjusted survival. Analysis was performed over the 6-year follow-up from the perspective of the Canadian public health care system in 2015 Canadian dollars (discounted 5%/year). Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were determined for ACT versus observation using clinical stage, gene signature, or a combined approach to select treatment. RESULTS: The mean survival gain of ACT versus observation was higher using the gene signature (1.86 years) compared with clinical stage (1.28 years). Although more costly, ACT guided by the gene signature remained cost-effective at $10,421/life-year gained (95% confidence interval [CI], $466-$19,568 Canadian), comparable to stage-directed selection ($7081/life-year gained; 95% CI, -$2370 to $14,721; P = .52). Incremental cost-utility ratios were $13,452/quality-adjusted life-year (95% CI, $373-$31,949) and $9194/quality-adjusted life-year (95% CI, -$4104 to $23,952), respectively (P = .53). Comparing the standard and test-and-treat approaches, use of the gene signature did not significantly alter survival compared with the standard strategy, but it reduced the ACT rate by 25%. CONCLUSION: If validated, the use of the 15-gene expression signature to select patients for ACT may increase the survival gain of treatment in patients with high-risk stage IB/II non-small-cell lung cancer, while avoiding toxicities in low-risk patients.",2016-01-22387,27502323,Clin Lung Cancer,Kit Man Wong,2017,18 / 1,,No,27502323,"Kit Man Wong; Keyue Ding; Suzanne Li; Penelope Bradbury; Ming-Sound Tsao; Sandy D Der; Frances A Shepherd; Carmen Chung; Raymond Ng; Lesley Seymour; Natasha B Leighl; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Using the JBR.10-Based 15-Gene Expression Signature to Guide Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Early Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer, Clin Lung Cancer , 2017 Jan; 18(1):1938-0690",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genomic profiling via 15-gene expression microarraysignature to select patients for adjuvant chemotherapy vs. Observation,Not Stated,82 Years,34 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Years,5.00,5.00,13452,Canada,2015,11501.75
16430,Cost-utility analysis of 1-year treatment with adalimumab/standard care and standard care alone for ulcerative colitis in Poland,"PURPOSE: Until recently, surgery was the only remaining choice for moderate to severe chronic ulcerative colitis patients who failed standard treatment or when it was not tolerated. Anti-TNFalpha treatment is a new, non-invasive option for the management of ulcerative colitis. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1 year of ulcerative colitis with adalimumab/standard care and standard care alone in Poland. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of adalimumab/standard care and a standard care alone. For each treatment option, the costs and quality adjusted life years were calculated to estimate the incremental cost-utility ratio. The analysis was performed from the perspective of the Polish public payer and society over a 30-year time horizon. Different direct and indirect costs and utility values were assigned to the various model health states. RESULTS: The treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with adalimumab/standard care up to 1 year instead of a standard care alone resulted in 0.14 additional years of life with full health (QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio of adalimumab/standard care compared to the standard care alone is estimated to be 76,120 euro/QALY gained from NHF perspective and 71,457 euro/QALY gained from social perspective.

16431,The Optimal Timing of Hepatitis C Therapy in Transplant Eligible Patients With Child B and C Cirrhosis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Ledipasvir (LDV)/sofosbuvir (SOF) has demonstrated high efficacy, safety, and tolerability in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. There is limited data, however, regarding the optimal timing of therapy in the context of possible liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of 12 weeks of HCV therapy before or after LT or nontreatment using a decision analytical microsimulation state-transition model for a simulated cohort of 10 000 patients with HCV Genotype 1 or 4 with Child B or C cirrhosis. All model parameters regarding the efficacy of therapy, adverse events and the effect of therapy on changes in model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores were derived from the SOLAR-1 and 2 trials. The simulations were repeated with 10 000 samples from the parameter distributions. The primary outcome was cost (2014 US dollars) per quality adjusted life year. RESULTS: Treatment before LT yielded more quality-adjusted life year for less money than treatment after LT or nontreatment. Treatment before LT was cost-effective in 100% of samples at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $100 000 in the base-case and when the analysis was restricted to Child B alone, Child C, or MELD > 15. Treatment before transplant was not cost-effective when MELD was 6-10. In sensitivity analyses, the MELD after which treatment before transplant was cost-effective was 13 and the maximum cost of LDV/SOF therapy at which treatment before LT is cost-effective is US $177 381.

METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of golimumab/standard care and a standard care alone. For each treatment option the costs and quality adjusted life years were calculated to estimate the incremental cost-utility ratio. The analysis was performed from the perspective of the Polish public payer and society over a 30-years time horizon.

RESULTS: The treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with golimumab/standard care instead of a standard care alone resulted in 0.122 additional years of life with full health. The treatment with golimumab/standard care was found to be more expensive than treatment with the standard care alone from the public payer perspective and from social perspective. The incremental cost-utility ratio of golimumab/standard care compared to the standard care alone is estimated to be 391,252 PLN/QALY gained (93,155 euro/QALYG) from public payer perspective and 374,377 PLN/QALY gained (89,137 euro/QALYG) from social perspective.

16434,Cost utility modeling of early vs late total knee replacement in osteoarthritis patients,"Given the dramatic increase in the number of total knee replacement (TKR) surgeries in developed countries, the issue of the best time for surgery needs to be addressed from an economic perspective. OBJECTIVE: To assess, from the perspective of the healthcare payer, the cost-utility of two surgical strategies in which knee replacement is performed at the early or late stage of the disease in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). DESIGN: Patient data and evidence from published literature on economic costs and outcomes in OA, including utilities, non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical options, combined with population life tables were entered in a Markov model of OA. The model represented the lifetime experience of a cohort of patients following their therapeutic management, discounting costs (euros) and utilities (quality-adjusted life-years) at 4% annually. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, early TKR cost euro6,624 more than late TKR (euro76,223 vs euro69,599) with a 0.15 gain in QALYs (18.675 vs 18.524). This yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of 43,631 euro/QALY. Sensitivity analyses of the most influential uncertain parameters were performed and did not modify the direction of the conclusions: early TKR cost between euro3,655 and euro7,194 more than late TKR with a gain in QALYs between 0.15 and 0.39. The ICUR ranged from 17,131 euro/QALY to 48,241 euro/QALY.

16435,The Cost-Effectiveness of Oral Nutrition Supplementation for Malnourished Older Hospital Patients,"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition, which is associated with increased medical complications in older hospitalized patients, can be attenuated by providing nutritional supplements. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of a specialized oral nutritional supplement (ONS) in malnourished older hospitalized patients. METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial (NOURISH Study). The target population was malnourished older hospitalized patients in the USA. We used 90-day (base case) and lifetime (sensitivity analysis) time horizons. The study compared a nutrient-dense ONS, containing high protein and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate to placebo. Outcomes included health-care costs, measured as the product of resource use and per unit cost; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (90-day time horizon); life-years (LYs) saved (lifetime time horizon); and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). All costs were inflated to 2015 US dollars. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, 90-day treatment group costs averaged US$22,506 per person, compared to US$22,133 for the control group. Treatment group patients gained 0.011 more QALYs than control group subjects, reflecting the treatment group''s significantly greater probability of survival through 90 days'' follow-up, as reported by the clinical trial. Hence, the 90-day follow-up period ICER was US$33,818/QALY. Assuming a lifetime time horizon, estimated treatment group life expectancy exceeded control group life expectancy by 0.71 years. Hence, the lifetime ICER was US$524/LY. The follow-up period for the trial was relatively short. Some of the patients were lost to follow-up, thus reducing collection of health-care utilization data during the clinical trial.

16436,Economic evaluation of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Thailand: genotype 1 and 6,"BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon alpha 2a, alpha 2b and ribavirin have been included to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) for treatment of only chronic hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3 in Thailand. This reimbursement policy has not covered for other genotypes of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) especially for genotypes 1 and 6 that account for 30-50 % of all HCV infection in Thailand. Therefore, this research determined whether pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b plus ribavirin is more cost-effective than a palliative care for treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 6 in Thailand. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a model-based economic evaluation was conducted based on a societal perspective. A Markov model was developed to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) comparing between the combination of pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b and ribavirin with a usual palliative care for genotype 1 and 6 HCV patients. Health-state transition probabilities, virological responses, and utility values were obtained from published literatures. Direct medical and direct non-medical costs were included and retrieved from published articles and Thai Standard Cost List for Health Technology Assessment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was presented as costs in Thai baht per QALY gained. RESULTS: HCV treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b plus ribavirin was dominant or cost-saving in Thailand compared to a palliative care.

16439,Economic evaluation of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Thailand: genotype 1 and 6,"BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon alpha 2a, alpha 2b and ribavirin have been included to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) for treatment of only chronic hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3 in Thailand. This reimbursement policy has not covered for other genotypes of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) especially for genotypes 1 and 6 that account for 30-50 % of all HCV infection in Thailand. Therefore, this research determined whether pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b plus ribavirin is more cost-effective than a palliative care for treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 6 in Thailand. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a model-based economic evaluation was conducted based on a societal perspective. A Markov model was developed to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) comparing between the combination of pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b and ribavirin with a usual palliative care for genotype 1 and 6 HCV patients. Health-state transition probabilities, virological responses, and utility values were obtained from published literatures. Direct medical and direct non-medical costs were included and retrieved from published articles and Thai Standard Cost List for Health Technology Assessment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was presented as costs in Thai baht per QALY gained. RESULTS: HCV treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b plus ribavirin was dominant or cost-saving in Thailand compared to a palliative care. The ICER value was negative with lower in total costs (peg 2a- 747,718vs. peg 2b- 819,921 vs. palliative care- 1,169,121 Thai baht) and more in QALYs (peg 2a- 13.44 vs. peg 2b- 13.14 vs. palliative care- 11.63 years) both in HCV genotypes 1 and 6.

16440,Cost-Effectiveness of Deep Brain Stimulation for Advanced Parkinson's Disease in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: Deep brain stimulation (DBS), which uses an implantable device to modulate brain activity, is clinically superior to medical therapy for treating advanced Parkinson''s disease (PD). We studied the cost-effectiveness of DBS in conjunction with medical therapy compared to best medical therapy (BMT) alone, using the latest clinical and cost data for the U.S. healthcare system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a decision-analytic state-transition (Markov) model to project PD progression and associated costs for the two treatment strategies. We estimated the discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the Medicare payer perspective, considering a ten-year horizon, and evaluated the robustness of our projections through extensive deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Over ten years, DBS treatment led to discounted total costs of $130,510 compared to $91,026 for BMT and added 1.69 QALYs more than BMT, resulting in an ICER of $23,404 per QALY. This ICER was relatively insensitive to variations in input parameters, with neurostimulator replacement, costs for DBS implantation, and costs for treatment of disease-related falls having the greatest effects. Across all investigated scenarios, including a five-year horizon, ICERs remained under $50,000 per QALY. Longer follow-up periods and younger treatment age were associated with greater cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: DBS is a cost-effective treatment strategy for advanced PD in the U.S. healthcare system across a wide range of assumptions.

16444,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of bortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (VR-CAP) in patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma","BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma. Bortezomib is the first product to be approved for the treatment of patients with previously untreated MCL, for whom haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is unsuitable, and is used in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (VR-CAP). The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recently recommended the use of VR-CAP in the UK following a technology appraisal. We present the cost effectiveness analysis performed as part of that assessment: VR-CAP versus the current standard of care regimen of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) in a UK setting. METHODS: A lifetime economic model was developed with health states based upon line of treatment and progression status. Baseline patient characteristics, dosing, safety and efficacy were based on the LYM-3002 trial. As overall survival data were immature, survival was modelled by progression status, and post-progression survival was assumed equal across arms. Utilities were derived from LYM-3002 and literature, and standard UK cost sources were used. RESULTS: Treatment with VR-CAP compared to R-CHOP gave an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.81 at an additional cost of pound16,212, resulting in a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound20,043. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that treatment with VR-CAP was cost effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds ( pound20,000- pound30,000 per QALY).

16445,FOLFOX4 or sorafenib as the first-line treatments for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the pharmaco-economic implications of FOLFOX4 or sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in China. METHODS: To conduct the analysis, we performed a Markov model to simulate the process of advanced HCC treated with sorafenib or FOLFOX4. Clinical data were obtained from the ORIENTAL trial and the EACH trial. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was regarded as the primary outcome in the analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis as well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of essential variables on the results of the analysis. RESULTS: Treatment with sorafenib provided an effectiveness gain of 0.3935 quality-adjusted life year at an average cost of $18,748.00, whereas chemotherapy of FOLFOX4 brought 0.3808 quality-adjusted life year at a cost of $6876.02.

16450,Economic Evaluation of Companion Diagnostic Testing for EGFR Mutations and First-Line Targeted Therapy in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients in South Korea,"BACKGROUND: As targeted therapy becomes increasingly important, diagnostic techniques for identifying targeted biomarkers have also become an emerging issue. The study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients as guided by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status compared with a no-testing strategy that is the current clinical practice in South Korea. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted to compare an EGFR mutation testing strategy with a no-testing strategy from the Korean healthcare payer''s perspective. The study population consisted of patients with stage 3b and 4 lung adenocarcinoma. A decision tree model was employed to select the appropriate treatment regimen according to the results of EGFR mutation testing and a Markov model was constructed to simulate disease progression of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The length of a Markov cycle was one month, and the time horizon was five years (60 cycles). RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the testing strategy was a dominant option. Quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYs) were 0.556 and 0.635, and total costs were $23,952 USD and $23,334 USD in the no-testing and testing strategy respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed overall robust results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) increased when the number of patients to be treated with erlotinib increased, due to the high cost of erlotinib. CONCLUSION: Treating advanced adenocarcinoma based on EGFR mutation status has beneficial effects and saves the cost compared to no testing strategy in South Korea.

INTERVENTIONS: Restrictive (transfuse if haemoglobin <7.5 g/dL) or liberal (transfuse if haemoglobin <9 g/dL) threshold during hospitalisation after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health-related quality of life measured using the EQ-5D-3L to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The total costs from surgery up to 3 months were pound17 945 and pound18 127 in the restrictive and liberal groups (mean difference is - pound182, 95% CI - pound1108 to pound744). The cost difference was largely attributable to the difference in the cost of red blood cells. Mean QALYs to 3 months were 0.18 in both groups (restrictive minus liberal difference is 0.0004, 95% CI -0.0037 to 0.0045). The point estimate for the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the restrictive group was slightly more effective and slightly less costly than the liberal group and, therefore, cost-effective. However, there is great uncertainty around these results partly due to the negligible differences in QALYs gained. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is no clear difference in the cost-effectiveness of restrictive and liberal thresholds for red blood cell transfusion after cardiac surgery.

16452,Potential Cost-Effectiveness of Ambulatory Cardiac Rhythm Monitoring After Cryptogenic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring after cryptogenic stroke improves detection of covert atrial fibrillation, but its long-term cost-effectiveness is uncertain. METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of noninvasive ECG monitoring in patients aged >/=55 years after a recent cryptogenic stroke and negative 24-hour ECG. A Markov model used observed rates of atrial fibrillation detection and anticoagulation from a randomized controlled trial (EMBRACE) and the published literature to predict lifetime costs and effectiveness (ischemic strokes, hemorrhages, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for 30-day ECG (primary analysis) and 7-day or 14-day ECG (secondary analysis), when compared with a repeat 24-hour ECG. RESULTS: Prolonged ECG monitoring (7, 14, or 30 days) was predicted to prevent more ischemic strokes, decrease mortality, and improve QALYs. If anticoagulation reduced stroke risk by 50%, 30-day ECG (at a cost of USD $447) would be highly cost-effective ($2000 per QALY gained) for patients with a 4.5% annual ischemic stroke recurrence risk. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to stroke recurrence risk and anticoagulant effectiveness, which remain uncertain, especially at higher costs of monitoring. Shorter duration (7 or 14 days) monitoring was cost saving and more effective than an additional 24-hour ECG; its cost-effectiveness was less sensitive to changes in ischemic stroke risk and treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: After a cryptogenic stroke, 30-day ECG monitoring is likely cost-effective for preventing recurrent strokes; 14-day monitoring is an attractive value alternative, especially for lower risk patients. These results strengthen emerging recommendations for prolonged ECG monitoring in secondary stroke prevention.

16455,The Cost-Effectiveness of Ranibizumab Treat and Extend Regimen Versus Aflibercept in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic eye condition that causes severe deterioration of vision and even blindness. Current wet AMD treatment in the UK involves the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors ranibizumab and aflibercept. Patients with wet AMD require frequent and long-term monitoring for treatment to be effective, contributing to a substantial resource burden at wet AMD centers. The European license for ranibizumab was recently updated with an individualized ''treat and extend'' (T&E) regimen, comprising a structured monitoring and treatment protocol. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab T&E versus aflibercept within a UK setting. METHODS: An individual patient-level simulation model was developed utilizing treatment effects from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. The model was conducted from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective over a lifetime horizon and the base case utilized probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess uncertainty in the model. Additional scenario analyses were conducted to assess the impact of changes to the model inputs. RESULTS: Ranibizumab T&E was found to be more effective and less costly than aflibercept, providing, on average, an additional 1.058 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a cost-saving of pound19,604 over a lifetime horizon. At list price, ranibizumab T&E was found to be cost-effective versus aflibercept in 100% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. The robustness of the results was tested in several scenario analyses; ranibizumab T&E was found to be more effective, and less costly, than aflibercept in the vast majority of cases. CONCLUSION: This evaluation suggests that treating patients with ranibizumab according to the T&E regimen could be a better use of NHS resources than aflibercept, and could, therefore, be considered as a first-line regimen for patients with wet AMD in the UK.

16456,Determining the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance for gastric cancer in patients with precancerous lesions,"AIM: To identify the optimal strategy for gastric cancer (GC) prevention by evaluating the cost-effectiveness of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)-based preventive strategies. METHODS: We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. Adopting a healthcare payer''s perspective, Markov models simulated the clinical experience of the target population (Singaporean Chinese 50-69 years old) undergoing endoscopic screening, endoscopic surveillance and usual care of do-nothing. The screening strategy examined the cohort every alternate year whereas the surveillance strategy provided annual EGD only to people with precancerous lesions. For each strategy, discounted lifetime costs ($) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated and compared to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify influential parameters and quantify the impact of model uncertainties. RESULTS: Annual EGD surveillance with an ICER of $34 200/QALY was deemed cost-effective for GC prevention within the Singapore healthcare system. To inform implementation, the models identified six influential factors and their respective thresholds, namely discount rate (<4.20%), age of starting surveillance (>51.6 years), proportion of program cost in delivering endoscopy (<65%), cost of follow-up EGD (<$484), utility of stage 1 GC patients (>0.72) and odds ratio of GC for high-risk subjects (>3.93).

16458,Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease with Early Motor Complications: A UK Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson''s disease (PD) is a debilitating illness associated with considerable impairment of quality of life and substantial costs to health care systems. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical treatment option for some patients with advanced PD. The EARLYSTIM trial has recently demonstrated its clinical benefit also in patients with early motor complications. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBS, compared to best medical therapy (BMT), among PD patients with early onset of motor complications, from a United Kingdom (UK) payer perspective. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to represent the progression of PD as rated using the Unified Parkinson''s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) over time in patients with early PD. Evidence sources were a systematic review of clinical evidence; data from the EARLYSTIM study; and a UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset including DBS patients. A mapping algorithm was developed to generate utility values based on UPDRS data for each intervention. The cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to explore the effect of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Over a 15-year time horizon, DBS was predicted to lead to additional mean cost per patient of pound26,799 compared with BMT ( pound73,077/patient versus pound46,278/patient) and an additional mean 1.35 QALYs (6.69 QALYs versus 5.35 QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound19,887 per QALY gained with a 99% probability of DBS being cost-effective at a threshold of pound30,000/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were not significantly impacted by plausible changes in the input parameter values. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that DBS is a cost-effective intervention in PD patients with early motor complications when compared with existing interventions, offering additional health benefits at acceptable incremental cost.

IDegLira was associated with lower costs of pound971 and pound1698 vs. basal insulin plus liraglutide and basal-bolus therapy, respectively, and increased costs of pound1441 vs. up-titrated IGlar. IDegLira was dominant, i.e., both more effective and less costly vs. basal insulin plus liraglutide and basal-bolus therapy, and highly cost effective vs. up-titrated IGlar with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound6090/QALY gained.

16463,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Sacubitril/Valsartan vs Enalapril in Patients With Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction,"IMPORTANCE: The angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and hospitalizations compared with enalapril. Sacubitril/valsartan has been approved for use in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction in the United States and cost has been suggested as 1 factor that will influence the use of this agent. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from US adults (mean [SD] age, 63.8 [11.5] years) with HF with reduced ejection fraction and characteristics similar to those in the PARADIGM-HF trial were used as inputs for a 2-state Markov model simulated HF. Risks of all-cause mortality and hospitalization from HF or other reasons were estimated with a 30-year time horizon. Quality of life was based on trial EQ-5D scores. Hospital costs combined Medicare and private insurance reimbursement rates; medication costs included the wholesale acquisition cost for sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril. A discount rate of 3% was used. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key inputs including: hospital costs, mortality benefit, hazard ratio for hospitalization reduction, drug costs, and quality-of-life estimates. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalizations, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental costs per QALY gained. RESULTS: The 2-state Markov model of US adult patients (mean age, 63.8 years) calculated that there would be 220 fewer hospital admissions per 1000 patients with HF treated with sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril over 30 years. The incremental costs and QALYs gained with sacubitril/valsartan treatment were estimated at $35512 and 0.78, respectively, compared with enalapril, equating to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $45017 per QALY for the base-case. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated ICERs ranging from $35357 to $75301 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For eligible patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, the Markov model calculated that sacubitril/valsartan would increase life expectancy at an ICER consistent with other high-value accepted cardiovascular interventions.

16464,Economic Analysis Comparing Dalteparin to Vitamin K Antagonists to Prevent Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Cancer Having Renal Impairment,"BACKGROUND: In a randomized trial (ie, Comparison of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer [CLOT]) that evaluated secondary prophylaxis of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer, dalteparin reduced the relative risk by 52% compared to oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; hazard ratio = 0.48, P = .002). A recent subgroup analysis in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment also revealed lower absolute VTE rates with dalteparin (3% vs 17%; P = .011). To measure the economic value of dalteparin in these populations, a pharmacoeconomic analysis was conducted from the Dutch health-care system perspective. METHODS: Resource utilization data contained within the CLOT trial database were extracted and converted into direct cost estimates. Univariate analysis was then conducted to compare the total cost of therapy between patients randomized to dalteparin or VKA therapy. Health state utilities were then measured in 24 members of the general public using the time trade-off technique. RESULTS: When all of the cost components were combined for the entire population (n = 676), the dalteparin group had significantly higher overall costs than the VKA control group (dalteparin = euro2375 vs VKA = euro1724; P < .001). However, dalteparin was associated with a gain of 0.14 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10-0.18) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over VKA. When the incremental cost was combined with the utility gain, dalteparin had a cost of euro4,697 (95% CI: euro3824-euro4951) per QALY gained.

16466,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the direct and indirect impact of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccination strategies in children: alternative country profiles,"BACKGROUND: Influenza poses a significant burden on healthcare systems and society, with under-recognition in the paediatric population. Existing vaccination policies (largely) target the elderly and other risk groups where complications may arise. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of annual paediatric vaccination (in 2-17-year-olds) with live attenuated influenza vaccination (LAIV), as well as the protective effect on the wider population in England and Wales (base). The study aimed to demonstrate broad applications of the model in countries where epidemiological and transmission data is limited and that have sophisticated vaccination policies (Brazil, Spain, and Taiwan). METHODS: The direct and indirect impact of LAIV in the paediatric cohort was simulated using an age-stratified dynamic transmission model over a 5-year time horizon of daily cycles and applying discounting of 3.5% in the base case. Pre-existing immunity structure was based on a 1-year model run. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the base case for England and Wales, the annual paediatric strategy with LAIV was associated with improvements in influenza-related events and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, yielding an incremental cost per QALY of pound6,208. The model was robust to change in the key input parameters. The probabilistic analysis demonstrated LAIV to be cost effective in more than 99% of iterations, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30,000. Incremental costs per QALY for Brazil were pound2,817, and for the cases of Spain and Taiwan the proposed strategy was dominant over the current practice. CONCLUSION: In addition to existing policies, annual paediatric vaccination using LAIV provides a cost-effective strategy that offers direct and indirect protection in the wider community.

DESIGN: A Markov-style model of cost-effectiveness and cost utility. PARTICIPANTS: There were no participants. METHODS: Based on results from Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Network Protocol S, we performed a Markov-style analysis to generate the total 2-year costs for each treatment arm. The cost per line-year saved and cost utility were calculated based on the estimated life years remaining. Both treatment arms were assumed to result in 9 lines of vision saved in 20% of patients. Medicare reimbursement data were acquired to determine costs, which were then separately calculated for practice settings of a hospital-based facility as the highest end of the cost range and a nonfacility in the same geographic area as the lowest end. Cost parameters for a prototypical patient''s life expectancy also were modeled and calculated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inputed cost of therapy, cost per line saved, cost per line-year saved, and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: When PRP was the primary treatment, the 2-year cost in the facility setting was $13 053, with cost per line saved $7252, cost per line-year $240, and cost per QALY $7988. In the nonfacility setting costs were approximately 21% lower. When IVR was the primary treatment, the 2-year cost in the facility setting was $30 328, cost per line saved was $16 849, cost per line-year $575, and cost per QALY $19 150. In the nonfacility setting costs were approximately 15% lower. Extrapolation to lifetime therapy yielded the cost per QALY with PRP treatment of $14 219 to $24 005 and with IVR of $138 852 to $164 360. Cost utility for PRP would be 85% lower than IVR in the facility setting and 90% lower than IVR in the nonfacility setting. CONCLUSIONS: PRP compared with IVR as primary treatment for PDR is less expensive over 2 years, but both fall well below the accepted cost per QALY upper limit.

16473,Cost Evaluation of Panretinal Photocoagulation versus Intravitreal Ranibizumab for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy,"PURPOSE: To evaluate costs of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) vs. intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). DESIGN: A Markov-style model of cost-effectiveness and cost utility. PARTICIPANTS: There were no participants. METHODS: Based on results from Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Network Protocol S, we performed a Markov-style analysis to generate the total 2-year costs for each treatment arm. The cost per line-year saved and cost utility were calculated based on the estimated life years remaining. Both treatment arms were assumed to result in 9 lines of vision saved in 20% of patients. Medicare reimbursement data were acquired to determine costs, which were then separately calculated for practice settings of a hospital-based facility as the highest end of the cost range and a nonfacility in the same geographic area as the lowest end. Cost parameters for a prototypical patient''s life expectancy also were modeled and calculated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inputed cost of therapy, cost per line saved, cost per line-year saved, and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: When PRP was the primary treatment, the 2-year cost in the facility setting was $13 053, with cost per line saved $7252, cost per line-year $240, and cost per QALY $7988. In the nonfacility setting costs were approximately 21% lower. When IVR was the primary treatment, the 2-year cost in the facility setting was $30 328, cost per line saved was $16 849, cost per line-year $575, and cost per QALY $19 150. In the nonfacility setting costs were approximately 15% lower. Extrapolation to lifetime therapy yielded the cost per QALY with PRP treatment of $14 219 to $24 005 and with IVR of $138 852 to $164 360. Cost utility for PRP would be 85% lower than IVR in the facility setting and 90% lower than IVR in the nonfacility setting. CONCLUSIONS: PRP compared with IVR as primary treatment for PDR is less expensive over 2 years, but both fall well below the accepted cost per QALY upper limit.

METHODS: Individual patient data from 13 randomised trials were used to inform a decision analytical model. A series of regression equations were used to predict baseline all-cause mortality, hospitalisation rates and health-related quality of life and device-related treatment effects. Clinical variables used in these equations were age, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ischaemic aetiology and left bundle branch block (LBBB). A UK National Health Service perspective and a lifetime time horizon were used. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results were reported for 24 subgroups based on LBBB status, QRS duration and NYHA class. RESULTS: At a threshold of pound30 000 per QALY gained, CRT-D was cost-effective in 10 of the 24 subgroups including all LBBB morphology patients with NYHA I/II/III.

METHODS: Individual patient data from 13 randomised trials were used to inform a decision analytical model. A series of regression equations were used to predict baseline all-cause mortality, hospitalisation rates and health-related quality of life and device-related treatment effects. Clinical variables used in these equations were age, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ischaemic aetiology and left bundle branch block (LBBB). A UK National Health Service perspective and a lifetime time horizon were used. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results were reported for 24 subgroups based on LBBB status, QRS duration and NYHA class. RESULTS: At a threshold of pound30 000 per QALY gained, CRT-D was cost-effective in 10 of the 24 subgroups including all LBBB morphology patients with NYHA I/II/III.
