34401,Health and economic impact at a population level of both primary and secondary preventive lung cancer interventions: A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Robust economic evaluations are needed to identify efficient strategies for lung cancer prevention that combine brief and intensive smoking cessation intervention programmes with screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) at different ages, frequencies, and coverages. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation approaches combined with lung cancer screening in the European context at a population level from a societal perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model that describes the natural history of lung cancer and incorporates several prevention strategies was developed. Discounted lifetime QALYs and costs at a rate of 3% were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, defined as additional costs in 2017 Euros per QALY gained. RESULTS: Smoking cessation interventions reduce the incidence of lung cancer by 8%-46% and are consistently more effective and cost-effective when starting at younger ages. Screening reduces lung cancer mortality by 1%-24% and is generally less effective and more costly than smoking cessation interventions. The most cost-effective strategy would be to implement intensive smoking cessation interventions at ages 35, 40 and 45, combined with screening every three years between the ages of 55 and 65. CONCLUSIONS: Combining smoking cessation interventions with LDCT screening is a very attractive prevention strategy that substantially diminishes the burden of lung cancer. These combined prevention strategies, especially when providing several intensive interventions for smoking cessation at early ages, are more cost-effective than both approaches separately and allow for a more intensified LDCT without losing efficiency.",2021-01-42039,34352591,Lung Cancer,Mireia Diaz,2021,159 /,153-161,No,34352591,"Mireia Diaz; Montse Garcia; Carmen Vidal; Albert Santiago; Gerard Gnutti; David Gómez; Marta Trapero-Bertran; Marcela Fu; Health and economic impact at a population level of both primary and secondary preventive lung cancer interventions: A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis., Lung Cancer, 2021 Sep; 159():; 153-161",QALY,Spain,Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Screening",thrice in a lifetime intensive smoking cessation intervention at 35 and 40 and 45 + every year screening-high risk at 55-65 vs. thrice in a lifetime intensive smoking cessation intervention at 35 and 40 and 45 + every 3 years screening-high risk at 55-65,Not Stated,65 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,46376,Euro,2017,57934.04
34402,Clinical and economic impact of current ALK rearrangement testing in Spain compared with a hypothetical no-testing scenario.,"BACKGROUND: Currently biomarkers play an essential role in diagnosis, treatment, and management of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) determination of biomarkers such as ALK, EGFR, ROS1 or PD-L1 is mandatory for an adequate treatment decision. The aim of this study is to determine the clinical and economic impact of current anaplastic lymphoma kinase testing scenario in Spain. METHODS: A joint model, composed by decision-tree and Markov models, was developed to estimate the long-term health outcomes and costs of NSCLC patients, by comparing the current testing scenario for ALK in Spain vs a hypothetical no-testing. The current distribution of testing strategies for ALK determination and their sensitivity and specificity data were obtained from the literature. Treatment allocation based on the molecular testing result were defined by a panel of Spanish experts. To assess long-term effects of each treatment, 3-states Markov models were developed, where progression-free survival and overall survival curves were extrapolated using exponential models. Medical direct costs (expressed in €, 2019) were included. A lifetime horizon was used and a discount rate of 3% was applied for both costs and health effects. Several sensitivity analyses, both deterministic and probabilistic, were performed in order test the robustness of the analysis. RESULTS: We estimated a target population of 7628 NSCLC patients, including those with non-squamous histology and those with squamous carcinomas who were never smokers. Over the lifetime horizon, the current ALK testing scenario produced additional 5060 and 3906 life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively, compared with the no-testing scenario. Total direct costs were increased up to € 51,319,053 for testing scenario. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 10,142 €/QALY. The sensitivity analyses carried out confirmed the robustness of the base-case results, being the treatment allocation and the test accuracy (sensitivity and specificity data) the key drivers of the model. CONCLUSIONS: ALK testing in advanced NSCLC patients, non-squamous and never-smoker squamous, provides more than 3000 QALYs in Spain over a lifetime horizon. Comparing this gain in health outcomes with the incremental costs, the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio reinforces that testing non-squamous and never-smoker squamous NSCLC is a cost-effective strategy in Spain.",2021-01-42040,34112097,BMC Cancer,Ernest Nadal,2021,21 / 1,689,No,34112097,"Ernest Nadal; Dolores Bautista; Luis Cabezón-Gutiérrez; Ortega, Ana Laura; Torres, Héctor; David Carcedo; Ruiz de Alda, Lucía; Garcia, J Francisco; Paula Vieitez; Federico Rojo; Clinical and economic impact of current ALK rearrangement testing in Spain compared with a hypothetical no-testing scenario., BMC Cancer, 2021 Jun 10; 21(1):; 689",QALY,Spain,Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs,Diagnostic,anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement testing vs. no testing,candidates for first-line treatment according to the molecular diagnosis,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,13136,Euro,2020,15708.87
34403,Prostate Cancer Screening Using Prostate-Specific Antigen Tests in a High-Risk Population in China: A Cost-Utility Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Both National Comprehensive Cancer Network and Chinese guidelines recommend beginning prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for men aged 50 years or 45 years with a family history because they were at a higher risk of developing prostate cancer. Several model-based economic evaluations of PSA screening studies have been conducted, but with little evidence from China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of the cost-utility of PSA-based prostate cancer screening in Chinese men. METHODS: We developed a decision-tree and Markov model in Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington) to compare 2 strategies that can be used to detect prostate cancer: PSA-based screening followed by a biopsy, and non-PSA screening. We assumed that the patients would repeat screening in subsequent years if their first-year PSA value was higher than 4.0 ng/mL. The model adopted health care system perspective and lifetime horizon. Screening efficacy, cost, utility, and long-term survival of prostate cancer were retrieved from published literature and physician surveys. Both quality-adjusted life year and costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. Uncertainty was assessed by 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Our model also calculated the risk-to-benefit ratio as the ratio of overdiagnosis (biopsy without diagnosed) to prostate cancer-related deaths prevented in different age groups. RESULTS: The results suggested that PSA-based screening was cost-effective compared with no PSA screening, with an incremental cost-utility ratio of ¥11,381 ($1821/€1480) per quality-adjusted life year. This value was less than the threshold of 1-time gross domestic product per capita in China (ie, ¥70,892 [$11,343/€9216]). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. The risk-to-benefit ratios of the 50 to 65 years and the 65 to 80 years age groups were 1.3 and 2.8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PSA-based prostate cancer screening appears to be cost-effective in some high-risk Chinese men. PSA screening (PSA testing followed by magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy if positive) can be recommended for Chinese men aged 50 to 65 years because this approach had the lowest risk-to-benefit ratio. The approach should be further adapted based on future updated data.

34404,Cost-effectiveness of varicella and herpes zoster vaccination in Sweden: An economic evaluation using a dynamic transmission model.,"OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses of introducing varicella and/or herpes zoster vaccination in the Swedish national vaccination programme. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analyses based on epidemiological results from a specifically developed transmission model. SETTING: National vaccination programme in Sweden, over an 85- or 20-year time horizon depending on the vaccination strategy. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of people aged 12 months and 65-years at baseline. INTERVENTIONS: Four alternative vaccination strategies; 1, not to vaccinate; 2, varicella vaccination with one dose of the live attenuated vaccine at age 12 months and a second dose at age 18 months; 3, herpes zoster vaccination with one dose of the live attenuated vaccine at 65 years of age; and 4, both vaccine against varicella and herpes zoster with the before-mentioned strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accumulated cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for each strategy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). RESULTS: It would be cost-effective to vaccinate against varicella (dominant), but not to vaccinate against herpes zoster (ICER of EUR 200,000), assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of EUR 50,000 per QALY. The incremental analysis between varicella vaccination only and the combined programme results in a cost per gained QALY of almost EUR 1.6 million. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study are central components for policy-relevant decision-making, and suggest that it was cost-effective to introduce varicella vaccination in Sweden, whereas herpes zoster vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine for the elderly was not cost-effective-the health effects of the latter vaccination cannot be considered reasonable in relation to its costs. Future observational and surveillance studies are needed to make reasonable predictions on how boosting affects the herpes zoster incidence in the population, and thus the cost-effectiveness of a vaccination programme against varicella. Also, the link between herpes zoster and sequelae need to be studied in more detail to include it suitably in health economic evaluations.",2021-01-42042,33984060,PLoS One,Ellen Wolff,2021,16 / 5,e0251644,No,33984060,"Ellen Wolff; Katarina Widgren; Gianpaolo Scalia Tomba; Adam Roth; Tiia Lep; Andersson, Sören; Cost-effectiveness of varicella and herpes zoster vaccination in Sweden: An economic evaluation using a dynamic transmission model., PLoS One, 2021; 16(5):; e0251644",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Immunization,varicella immunization vs. no immunization,Not Stated,Not Stated,12 Months,"Male, Female",Full,"82 Years, 20 Years",Not Stated,Not Stated,-226085.76,Euro,2018,-288297.62

34407,Comparative Value of Cholinesterase Inhibitors and Memantine in Persons with Moderate-to-Severe Alzheimer's Disease in the United States: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves symptomatic improvement of cognition using cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine. The cost-effectiveness of these medications will guide decision-makers in making judicious use of scarce healthcare resources, particularly during the advanced disease stages. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ChEIs, memantine, and ChEI-memantine combinations in persons with moderate-to-severe AD from the US healthcare perspective. METHODS: This pharmacoeconomic evaluation study used a state-transition Markov cohort model to simulate the costs and effectiveness of ChEI-memantine combinations compared with monotherapies of ChEI (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine in persons with moderate-to-severe AD over a lifetime horizon with a 1-year cycle length. We estimated expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2020 $US), net monetary benefits, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We discounted future costs and QALYs at the rate of 3%. RESULTS: In this study, donepezil monotherapy, galantamine-memantine combination, and rivastigmine transdermal patch formed the cost-effectiveness frontier. Findings suggests that rivastigmine transdermal patch is the optimal treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY (ICER = $93,307/QALY [versus donepezil monotherapy]). Results across subgroups by age and sex also suggest that the rivastigmine transdermal patch is the optimal treatment strategy with the highest net benefit. CONCLUSION: From the US healthcare perspective, we found that, for persons with moderate-to-severe AD at a WTP threshold of $150,000/QALY, the rivastigmine transdermal patch is the most cost-effective pharmacological treatment option.

The cost-effectiveness of these medications will guide decision-makers in making judicious use of scarce healthcare resources, particularly during the advanced disease stages. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ChEIs, memantine, and ChEI-memantine combinations in persons with moderate-to-severe AD from the US healthcare perspective. METHODS: This pharmacoeconomic evaluation study used a state-transition Markov cohort model to simulate the costs and effectiveness of ChEI-memantine combinations compared with monotherapies of ChEI (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine in persons with moderate-to-severe AD over a lifetime horizon with a 1-year cycle length. We estimated expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2020 $US), net monetary benefits, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We discounted future costs and QALYs at the rate of 3%. RESULTS: In this study, donepezil monotherapy, galantamine-memantine combination, and rivastigmine transdermal patch formed the cost-effectiveness frontier.

We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of maintenance therapy with avelumab plus best supportive care (BSC) in patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy from the US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was used to analyze the economic outcomes of maintenance avelumab plus BSC (avelumab strategy) in the treatment of urothelial carcinoma. The clinical data were derived from the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial. All cost information was obtained from Medicare and published literature. The total cost, total life years (LYs), total quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental net health benefit (INHB) were calculated. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Our results showed that avelumab strategy versus BSC strategy cost US $176,352 and $238,661 and yielded an additional 0.465 and 1.007 QALY in all patients with unknown programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status and the PD-L1-positive subpopulation, respectively, which led to an ICER of $102,365/QALY and $106,253/QALY gained. In all patients with unknown PD-L1 status, maintenance avelumab plus BSC therapy guiding by PD-L1 expression testing (PD-L1-guided strategy) compared with the avelumab strategy and BSC strategy resulted in ICER of $105,360/QALY and $122,653/QALY, respectively. The probabilities of the avelumab strategy and the PD-L1-guided strategy being cost-effective in the simultaneous competition of the three strategies were 38.49% and 48.82%. In patients with PD-L1-positive status, the avelumab strategy had an 87.51% probability of cost-effectiveness. The most influential parameter for the model was the cost of avelumab and pembrolizumab. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated that maintenance therapy with avelumab plus BSC may be a cost-effective option for patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY, especially for patients with PD-L1-positive status.",2021-01-42045,34693504,Adv Ther,Ye Peng,2021,38 / 12,5710-5720,No,34693504,"Ye Peng; Zhihua She; Liubao Peng; Qiao Liu; Lidan Yi; Xia Luo; Sini Li; Liting Wang; Shuxia Qin; Xiaomin Wan; Chongqing Tan; Cost-Effectiveness of Avelumab Maintenance Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma in the United States., Adv Ther, 2021 Dec; 38(12):; 5710-5720",QALY,United States of America,Malignant neoplasms of urinary tract,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",avelumab + best supportive care vs. best supportive care,unknown programmed-death ligand 1,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,102365,United States,2019,108496.32

34420,Cost-utility of azithromycin in patients with severe asthma.,"BACKGROUND: An important proportion of asthma patients remain uncontrolled despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Some add-on therapies, like azithromycin, have been recommended for this subgroup of patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of azithromycin as an add-on therapy to ICS + LABA for patients with severe asthma. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with severe asthma in Colombia. The total costs and QALYS of two interventions, including standard therapy (ICS + LABA), and add-on therapy with azithromycin, were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $19,000. RESULTS: The model suggests a potential gain of 0.037 QALYs per patient per year on azithromycin, with a difference of US $718 in favor of azithromycin, showing dominance with respect to SOC. A position of dominance negates the need to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In the deterministic sensitivity analyses, our base-case results were robust to variations in all assumptions and parameters.

34421,Cost-Effectiveness of Apixaban versus Other Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Warfarin in the Prevention of Thromboembolic Complications Among Finnish Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.,"PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) has increased steadily in Finland. DOACs have been shown to be cost-effective in comparison to warfarin, but published evidence of relative cost-effectiveness between DOACs is still scarce and mostly based on indirect comparisons of clinical trial evidence. The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of apixaban to dabigatran, rivaroxaban and warfarin in a Finnish setting using real-life evidence where available. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov simulation model used previously in a published Finnish assessment comparing apixaban and warfarin was modified and updated with the relative effectiveness and safety data available from the real-world NAXOS-study and representative Finnish input data for patient characteristics, event risks, mortality, resource use, costs, and quality of life. Apixaban's cost-effectiveness was assessed from health care payer perspective (using 3% per year discount rate) based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained), probability of cost-effectiveness (at willingness-to-pay [WTP] of 35,000 euros/QALY), and net monetary benefit (NMB). RESULTS: Apixaban increased the average modelled quality-adjusted life-expectancy and reduced the average total health care costs of AF patients when compared to warfarin (+0.14 QALYs, -3691 euros), dabigatran (+0.11 QALYs, -404 euros), and rivaroxaban (+0.03 QALYs, -43 euros). The resulting NMB of apixaban versus warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban was 8723, 4168, and 1129 euros, respectively.

34423,Cost-Effectiveness of Apixaban versus Other Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Warfarin in the Prevention of Thromboembolic Complications Among Finnish Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.,"PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) has increased steadily in Finland. DOACs have been shown to be cost-effective in comparison to warfarin, but published evidence of relative cost-effectiveness between DOACs is still scarce and mostly based on indirect comparisons of clinical trial evidence. The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of apixaban to dabigatran, rivaroxaban and warfarin in a Finnish setting using real-life evidence where available. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov simulation model used previously in a published Finnish assessment comparing apixaban and warfarin was modified and updated with the relative effectiveness and safety data available from the real-world NAXOS-study and representative Finnish input data for patient characteristics, event risks, mortality, resource use, costs, and quality of life. Apixaban's cost-effectiveness was assessed from health care payer perspective (using 3% per year discount rate) based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained), probability of cost-effectiveness (at willingness-to-pay [WTP] of 35,000 euros/QALY), and net monetary benefit (NMB). RESULTS: Apixaban increased the average modelled quality-adjusted life-expectancy and reduced the average total health care costs of AF patients when compared to warfarin (+0.14 QALYs, -3691 euros), dabigatran (+0.11 QALYs, -404 euros), and rivaroxaban (+0.03 QALYs, -43 euros). The resulting NMB of apixaban versus warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban was 8723, 4168, and 1129 euros, respectively. The respective probabilities of apixaban being cost-effective against each comparator were 100%, 92.7%, and 64.0%.

34424,Economic Evaluation of First-Line Atezolizumab for Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer in the US.,"Introduction: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab + chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy as first-line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the United States (US). Methods: The three health states partitioned survival (PS) model was used over the lifetime. Effectiveness and safety data were derived from the IMpower133 trial. The parametric survival model and mixture cure model were used for the atezolizumab + chemotherapy group to explore the long-term uncertainty of the effect of immunotherapy, and the parametric survival model was used for the chemotherapy group. Costs were derived from the pricing files of Medicare and Medicaid Services, and utility values were derived from previous studies. Sensitivity analyses were performed to observe model stability. Results: If the mixture cure model was considered for the intervention group, compared with chemotherapy alone, atezolizumab + chemotherapy yielded an additional 0.11 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with an incremental cost of US$84,257. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was US$785,848/QALY. If the parametric survival model was considered for the intervention group, atezolizumab + chemotherapy yielded an additional 0.10 QALYs, with an incremental cost of US$84,257; the ICUR was US$827,610/QALY. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, progression-free (PF) and postprogression (PP) utilities were the main drivers. In the scenario analysis (PF utility = 0.673, PP utility = 0.473), the results showed that the ICUR was US$910,557/QALY and US$965,607/QALY when the mixture cure model and parametric survival model was considered for the intervention group, respectively. In the PSA, the probabilities that atezolizumab + chemotherapy would not be cost-effective were 100% if the willingness-to-pay threshold was US$100,000/QALY.

34426,Cost effectiveness of outpatient lumbar discectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Microdiscectomy is the most commonly performed spine surgery and the first transitioning for outpatient settings. However, this transition was never studied, in what comes to cost-utility assessment. Accordingly, this economic study aims to access the cost-effectiveness of outpatient lumbar microdiscectomy when compared with the inpatient procedure. METHODS: This is a cost utility study, adopting the hospital perspective. Direct medical costs were retrieved from the assessment of 20 patients undergoing outpatient lumbar microdiscectomy and 20 undergoing inpatient lumbar microdiscectomy Quality-adjusted life-years were calculated from Oswestry Disability Index values (ODI). ODI was prospectively assessed in outpatients in pre and 3- and 6-month post-operative evaluations. Inpatient ODI data were estimated from a meta-analysis. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated. RESULTS: Outpatient procedure was cost-saving in all models tested. At 3-month assessment ICER ranged from €135,753 to €345,755/QALY, higher than the predefined threshold of €60,000/QALY gained. At 6-month costs were lower and utilities were higher in outpatient, overpowering the inpatient procedure. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that in 65% to 73% of simulations outpatient was the better option. The savings with outpatient were about 55% of inpatient values, with similar utility scores. No 30-day readmissions were recorded in either group.

34432,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Minimally Invasive Trabecular Meshwork Stents with Phacoemulsification.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the costs and effects of implanting trabecular meshwork bypass stents during cataract surgery from a societal perspective in the United States. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using Markov models and efficacy/safety data from published pivotal or randomized control trials (RCTs) of devices investigated. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years and older with mild to moderate primary open-angle glaucoma with or without visually significant cataract. METHODS: With the use of Markov models, glaucoma progression through 4 glaucoma states (mild, moderate, advanced, severe/blind) and death were simulated over 35 years. The cohort with cataract entered the model and received cataract surgery with or without device implantation. We included a medication management only reference group to calculate total costs and outcomes for those without cataract. Intraocular pressure (IOP) reductions from RCTs were converted to glaucoma state transition probabilities using visual field (VF) mean deviation (MD) decline rates from the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial. Progressive thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) on OCT imaging related to IOP control warranted further intervention, including adding medication, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), or incisional glaucoma surgery. We estimated whole costs at Medicare rates and obtained utility values for glaucoma states from previous studies. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were evaluated at a QALY threshold of $50 000. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis, scenario analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses addressed parameter uncertainty and demonstrated model robustness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total costs, QALY, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Over 35 years in the base case, the Hydrus (Ivantis, Inc.) implanted with cataract surgery arm cost $48 026.13 and gained 12.26 QALYs. The iStent inject (Glaukos Corp.) implanted with cataract surgery arm cost $49 599.86 and gained 12.21 QALYs. Cataract surgery alone cost $54 409.25 and gained 12.04 QALYs. Initial nonsurgical management cost $57 931.22 and gained 11.74 QALY. The device arms dominated or were cost-effective compared with cataract surgery alone within 5 years and throughout sensitivity analyses.

34436,Cost-effectiveness of gilteritinib for relapsed/refractory FLT3(mut+) acute myeloid leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and confirmed feline McDonough sarcoma (FMS)-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene mutations (FLT3(mut+)) have a poor prognosis and limited effective treatment options. Gilteritinib is the first targeted therapy approved in the United States and Europe for R/R FLT3(mut+) AML with significantly improved efficacy compared with existing treatments. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate gilteritinib against salvage chemotherapy (SC) and best supportive care (BSC) over a lifetime horizon among adult patients with R/R FLT3(mut+) AML from a US third-party payer's perspective. METHODS: The model structure of this cost-effectiveness analysis included a decision tree to stratify patients based on their hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) status, followed by 2 separate 3-state partitioned survival models to predict the long-term health status conditional on HSCT status. The ADMIRAL trial data and literature were used to predict probabilities of patients being in different health states until a conservative cure point at year 3. Afterwards, living patients followed the survival outcomes of long-term survivors with AML. Model inputs for utilities, medical resource use, and costs were based on the ADMIRAL trial, published literature, and public sources. All costs were inflated to 2019 US dollars (USD). Total incremental costs (in 2019 USD), life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Deterministic sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon with a 3.0% annual discount rate, the base-case model estimated that gilteritinib led to an increase of 1.29 discounted QALYs at an additional cost of $148,106 vs SC, corresponding to an ICER of $115,192 per QALY; for BSC, results were an increase of 2.32 discounted QALYs, $249,674, and $107,435, respectively. The base-case findings were robust in sensitivity analyses. The estimated probabilities of gilteritinib being cost-effective vs SC and BSC were 90.5% and 99.8%, respectively, in the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY.

34442,Multifactorial falls prevention programme compared with usual care in UK care homes for older people: multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation.,"Objectives: To determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of a multifactorial fall prevention programme compared with usual care in long term care homes. Design: Multicentre, parallel, cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: Long term care homes in the UK, registered to care for older people or those with dementia. Participants: 1657 consenting residents and 84 care homes. 39 were randomised to the intervention group and 45 were randomised to usual care. Interventions: Guide to Action for Care Homes (GtACH): a multifactorial fall prevention programme or usual care. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome measure was fall rate at 91-180 days after randomisation. The economic evaluation measured health related quality of life using quality adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the five domain five level version of the EuroQoL index (EQ-5D-5L) or proxy version (EQ-5D-5L-P) and the Dementia Quality of Life utility measure (DEMQOL-U), which were self-completed by competent residents and by a care home staff member proxy (DEMQOL-P-U) for all residents (in case the ability to complete changed during the study) until 12 months after randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were falls at 1-90, 181-270, and 271-360 days after randomisation, Barthel index score, and the Physical Activity Measure-Residential Care Homes (PAM-RC) score at 91, 180, 270, and 360 days after randomisation. Results: Mean age of residents was 85 years. 32% were men. GtACH training was delivered to 1051/1480 staff (71%). Primary outcome data were available for 630 participants in the GtACH group and 712 in the usual care group.

34444,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.,"Background: The phase III KEYNOTE-604 study confirmed the benefit of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Taken into account the clinical benefits of pembrolizumab and its high cost, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding pembrolizumab to standard first-line etoposide-platinum (EP) for patients with ES-SCLC from the US payer perspective. Methods: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of pembrolizumab plus EP and placebo plus EP over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical efficacy and safety data were pooled from the KEYNOTE-604 trial. Utilities were obtained from published resources. Costs were mainly collected from Medicare in 2020. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our model. Results: Adding pembrolizumab to standard first-line EP resulted in the better effectiveness than EP chemotherapy alone for ES-SCLC by 0.22 QALYs. Pembrolizumab plus EP was dominated economically by placebo plus EP, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $334,373/ QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the uncertainty in model parameters exerted no substantial effect on our results. Probability sensitivity analysis indicated that probabilities for pembrolizumab plus EP being cost-effective within a wide range of willingness to pay were modest. Conclusion: From the US payer perspective, the first-line treatment for ES-SCLC with pembrolizumab plus EP was not cost-effective compared with placebo plus EP.

34445,Cost Effectiveness of Screening for Hepatitis C Virus in Iraq in the Era of Simplified Testing and Treatment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic testing methods allow for a one-stop simplified 'test and cure' approach. The cost effectiveness of incorporating this simplified approach into HCV screening in Iraq remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the cost effectiveness of different HCV testing and diagnostic approaches, and screening strategies in Iraq from a health service perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using a hybrid model comprising a screening decision tree linked to a lifetime Markov model to estimate outcomes in HCV-infected people. Cost and utility estimates were sourced from the published literature and expert guidance provided by clinicians and policy makers in Iraq. Cost estimates were reported in 2019 USD or 2019 Iraqi Dinar and both costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: Strategies using a simplified approach were found to be cost saving in addition to improving patient outcomes when compared with a standard testing and diagnostic approach. When considering risk-based screening, a simplified approach was associated with a total cost saving of Iraqi Dinar 4375 billion (USD 3.7 billion) and per patient life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gains of 0.30 and 0.55, compared with a standard approach. Benefits and cost savings were driven by a 32.2% and 23.6% reduction in the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Estimated benefits and cost savings increased under total population screening. All screening and testing and diagnostic approaches were cost effective compared with a no screening scenario.

34449,Cost-utility analysis of imrecoxib compared with celecoxib for patients with osteoarthritis.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to compare the long-term cost-utility of imrecoxib and celecoxib for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. METHODS: An economic model was built based on the model from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The simulation was carried out initially for 100 cycles of 3 months each, starting with 10,000 patients. A discount rate of 5% was applied both for cost and utility. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were adopted as the utility indicator, and real-world data from the hospital information systems of 170 hospitals was collected to indicate cost. The relative incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) with imrecoxib and celecoxib were collected from randomized controlled trials. Sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the robustness of the model. RESULTS: In the base case analysis (6-month treatment duration, 55 years old and above), imrecoxib was the more cost-effective option compared to celecoxib, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $3,041.14. This finding remained unchanged after varying the treatment duration and the age of the patients. The main drivers of the results were the relative incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), the cost of imrecoxib, and the utility of OA patients without any AEs. Probability sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed that there was a 59.02% probability of imrecoxib as the more cost-effective option, with a threshold of $30,000.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective Observational Study. SETTINGS: Hospital. PATIENTS: A clinical group of 22 adult patients (59.1% men, 40.9% women) aged from 59.13 ± 8.9 years were included in the study. The study comprised two arms: patients in group 1 received the second cochlear implant one to three months after the first implant; while patients in group 2 got the second cochlear implant approximately one year after the first implant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All participants were first asked to complete an AQoL-8D questionnaire. For the cost-effectiveness analyses, a Markov model analyzed as microsimulation was developed to compare the different treatment options. RESULTS: The analyses show that bilateral cochlear implantation strategies are cost-effective compared to the 'no treatment' alternative when having a 10-year model time horizon. When all three model scenarios are compared, the bilateral simultaneous cochlear implantation strategy (Scenario 3) compared to the 'no treatment' option is even more cost-effective than the Scenarios 1 and 2, compared with the 'no treatment' alternative.

34453,Cost-effectiveness of bacteriuria screening before urogynecologic surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is controversy over who requires preoperative screening for bacteriuria in the urogynecologic population and whether treating asymptomatic bacteriuria reduces postoperative urinary tract infection rates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of selective, universal, and no preoperative bacteriuria screening protocols in women undergoing surgery for prolapse or stress urinary incontinence. STUDY DESIGN: A simple decision tree model was created from a societal perspective to evaluate cost and effectiveness of 3 strategies to prevent postoperative urinary tract infection: (1) a universal protocol where all women undergoing urogynecologic surgery are screened for bacteriuria and receive preemptive treatment if bacteriuria is identified; (2) a selective protocol, where only women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection are screened and treated for bacteriuria; and (3) a no-screening protocol, where no women are screened for bacteriuria. Our primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, calculated in cost per quality-adjusted life-years. Secondary outcomes were the number of urine cultures, postoperative urinary tract infections, and pyelonephritis associated with each strategy. Costs were derived from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Clinical estimates were derived from published literature and data from a historic surgical cohort. Quality-of-life-associated utilities for urinary tract infection (0.73), pyelonephritis (0.66), and antibiotic use (0.964) were derived from the published literature using the HALex scale, reported directly by affected patients. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed over the range of reported values. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, selective screening is more costly (no screen: $101.69, selective: $101.98) and more effective (no screen: 0.096459 quality-adjusted-life-year, selective: 0.096464 quality-adjusted-life-year) than no screening, and is cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $49,349 per quality-adjusted-life-year. Both selective screening and no screening dominate universal screening in being less costly (universal: $111.92) and more effective (universal: 0.096446 quality-adjusted-life-year), with a slightly higher rate of postoperative urinary tract infection (no screen: 17.1%, selective: 16.9%, universal: 16.6%). In 1-way sensitivity analyses, selective screening is no longer cost-effective compared with no screening when the cost of a urine culture exceeds $12, cost of a preoperative urinary tract infection exceeds $93, the cost of a postoperative urinary tract infection is below $339, the specificity of a urine culture is less than 96%, or preoperative bacteriuria rates in those without symptoms but a history of recurrent urinary tract infection is <23%. Universal screening only becomes cost-effective when the postoperative urinary tract infection rate increases to >50% in those without risk factors and untreated preoperative bacteriuria. When compared with no screening, selective screening costs an additional $104 per urinary tract infection avoided and $2607 per pyelonephritis avoided. Compared with selective screening, universal screening costs $4609 per urinary tract infection avoided and $115,223 per pyelonephritis avoided. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a selective preoperative bacteriuria protocol is cost-effective in most scenarios and associated with only a <1% increase in the 30-day postoperative urinary tract infection rate.

34459,Cost-effectiveness of combined catheter ablation and left atrial appendage closure for symptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients with high stroke and bleeding risk,"BACKGROUND: Combined catheter ablation (CA) and left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) have been proposed for management of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with high stroke and bleeding risk. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of combined CA and LAAC compared with CA and standard oral anticoagulation (OAC) in symptomatic AF. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio among 2 post-CA strategies: (1) standard OAC and (2) LAAC (combined CA and LAAC procedure). The base-case used a 10-year time horizon and consisted of a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 65?years with symptomatic AF, with high thrombotic (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc?=?3) and bleeding risk (HAS-BLED?=?3), and planned for AF ablation. Values for transition probabilities, utilities, and costs were derived from the literature. Costs were converted to 2020 US dollars. Half-cycle correction was applied, and costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed for significant variables and scenario analyses for higher embolic risk. RESULTS: In the base-case cohort of 10,000 patients followed for 10?years, total costs for the LAAC strategy were $29,027 and for OAC strategy were $27,896. The LAAC strategy was associated with 122 fewer disabling strokes and 203 fewer intracranial hemorrhages per 10,000 patients compared with the OAC strategy. The LAAC strategy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $11,072/QALY. In sensitivity analyses, although cost-effectiveness was highly dependent on the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in the LAAC strategy and the cost of the combined procedure, LAAC was superior to OAC under the most circumstances. Scenario analyses demonstrated that the combined procedure was more cost-effective in patients with higher stroke risk. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic AF patients with high stroke and bleeding risk who are planned for CA, the combined CA and LAAC procedure may be a cost-effective therapeutic option and be more beneficial to patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc risk score?=3.",2021-01-34054,32822655,Am Heart J,Hiroshi Kawakami,2021,231 /,110-120,No,32822655,"Hiroshi Kawakami; Mark T Nolan; Karen Phillips; Paul A Scuffham; Thomas H Marwick; Cost-effectiveness of combined catheter ablation and left atrial appendage closure for symptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients with high stroke and bleeding risk, Am Heart J, 2021 Jan; 231():1097-6744; 110-120",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical, Surgical",left atrial appendage closure strategy vs. Standard/Usual Care- oral anticoagulation strategy,high thrombotic and bleeding risk,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Not Stated / None, 10 Years",3.00,3.00,11072,United States,2020,11592.17

Transcatheter arterial embolization first was introduced by Rosch et al as an alternative to surgery for upper GI bleeding. The clinical success in patients with GI bleeding treated with transcatheter arterial embolization previously has been reported. However, there are no cost-effectiveness analyses reported to date. Here we report cost-effectiveness analysis of N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate glue (NBCA) and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx) versus coil (gold standard) for treatment of GI bleeding from a healthcare payer perspective. Methods: Fixed-effects modeling with a generalized linear mixed method was used in NBCA and coil intervention arms to determine the pooled probabilities of clinical success and mortality with complications with their confidence intervals, while the Clopper-Pearson model was used for Onyx to determine the same parameters. Models were provided by the “Meta-Analysis with R” software package. A decision tree was built for cost-effectiveness analysis, and Microsoft Excel was used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The cost-effective option was determined based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and scatter plots of incremental cost versus incremental quality-adjusted life-years. Results: Comparing scatter plots and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results, –$1024 and –$1349 per quality-adjusted life-year for Onyx and N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate glue, respectively, Onyx was the least expensive and most effective intervention.

Methods: Fixed-effects modeling with a generalized linear mixed method was used in NBCA and coil intervention arms to determine the pooled probabilities of clinical success and mortality with complications with their confidence intervals, while the Clopper-Pearson model was used for Onyx to determine the same parameters. Models were provided by the “Meta-Analysis with R” software package. A decision tree was built for cost-effectiveness analysis, and Microsoft Excel was used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The cost-effective option was determined based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and scatter plots of incremental cost versus incremental quality-adjusted life-years. Results: Comparing scatter plots and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results, –$1024 and –$1349 per quality-adjusted life-year for Onyx and N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate glue, respectively, Onyx was the least expensive and most effective intervention. Conclusion: Onyx was the dominant strategy regardless of threshold values. Our analyses provide a framework for researchers to predict the target clinical effectiveness for early-stage TAE interventions and guide resource allocation decisions.",2020-01-33960,0,Europace,Taleshi J.M.

Our project collected data from a random sample of HTA reports published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH); the U.S.-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER); Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS) in Colombia; and Brazil’s Comissão Nacional de Incorporação de Tecnologias no Sus (CONITEC). Data for this cost-effectiveness analysis were retrieved from an HTA report as part of the pilot project.
