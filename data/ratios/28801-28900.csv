28801,Where to deploy pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in sub-Saharan Africa?,"OBJECTIVE: Two randomised controlled trials showed that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) reduces HIV transmission between heterosexual men and women. We model the potential impact on transmission and cost-effectiveness of providing PrEP in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We use a deterministic, compartmental model of HIV transmission to evaluate the potential of a 5-year PrEP intervention targeting the adult population of 42 sub-Saharan African countries. We examine the incremental impact of adding PrEP at pre-existing levels of male circumcision and antiretroviral therapy (ART). The base case assumes efficacy of 68%; adherence at 80%; country coverage at 10% of the HIV-uninfected adult population; and annual costs of PrEP and ART at US$200 and US$880 per person, respectively. RESULTS: After 5 years, 390,000 HIV infections (95% UR 190,000 to 630,000) would be prevented, 24% of these in South Africa. HIV infections averted per 100 000 people (adult) would range from 500 in Lesotho to 10 in Somalia. Incremental cost-effectiveness would be US$5800/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) (95% UR 3100 to 13500). Cost-effectiveness would range from US$500/DALY in Lesotho to US$44 600/DALY in Eritrea. CONCLUSIONS: In a general adult population, PrEP is a high-cost intervention which will have maximum impact and be cost-effective only in countries that have high levels of HIV burden and low levels of male circumcision in the population. Hence, PrEP will likely be most effective in Southern Africa as a targeted intervention added to existing strategies to control the HIV pandemic.",2013-99-11758,23912819,Sex Transm Infect,Stephane Verguet,2013,89 / 8,,No,23912819,"Stephane Verguet; Meg Stalcup; Julia A Walsh; Where to deploy pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in sub-Saharan Africa?, Sex Transm Infect, 2013 Dec; 89(8):1368-4973",DALY,Chad,Not Stated,"Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Pharmaceutical","Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for reducing HIV transmission vs. Standard/Usual Care- pre-existing male circumcision levels, antiretroviral therapy (ART) & codom use",Not Stated,64 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,8100,United States,2011,9319.72

METHODS: We use a deterministic, compartmental model of HIV transmission to evaluate the potential of a 5-year PrEP intervention targeting the adult population of 42 sub-Saharan African countries. We examine the incremental impact of adding PrEP at pre-existing levels of male circumcision and antiretroviral therapy (ART). The base case assumes efficacy of 68%; adherence at 80%; country coverage at 10% of the HIV-uninfected adult population; and annual costs of PrEP and ART at US$200 and US$880 per person, respectively. RESULTS: After 5 years, 390,000 HIV infections (95% UR 190,000 to 630,000) would be prevented, 24% of these in South Africa. HIV infections averted per 100 000 people (adult) would range from 500 in Lesotho to 10 in Somalia. Incremental cost-effectiveness would be US$5800/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) (95% UR 3100 to 13500). Cost-effectiveness would range from US$500/DALY in Lesotho to US$44 600/DALY in Eritrea. CONCLUSIONS: In a general adult population, PrEP is a high-cost intervention which will have maximum impact and be cost-effective only in countries that have high levels of HIV burden and low levels of male circumcision in the population.

RESULTS: After 5 years, 390,000 HIV infections (95% UR 190,000 to 630,000) would be prevented, 24% of these in South Africa. HIV infections averted per 100 000 people (adult) would range from 500 in Lesotho to 10 in Somalia. Incremental cost-effectiveness would be US$5800/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) (95% UR 3100 to 13500). Cost-effectiveness would range from US$500/DALY in Lesotho to US$44 600/DALY in Eritrea. CONCLUSIONS: In a general adult population, PrEP is a high-cost intervention which will have maximum impact and be cost-effective only in countries that have high levels of HIV burden and low levels of male circumcision in the population. Hence, PrEP will likely be most effective in Southern Africa as a targeted intervention added to existing strategies to control the HIV pandemic.",2013-99-11758,23912819,Sex Transm Infect,Stephane Verguet,2013,89 / 8,,No,23912819,"Stephane Verguet; Meg Stalcup; Julia A Walsh; Where to deploy pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in sub-Saharan Africa?, Sex Transm Infect, 2013 Dec; 89(8):1368-4973",DALY,Senegal,Not Stated,"Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Pharmaceutical","Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for reducing HIV transmission vs. Standard/Usual Care- pre-existing male circumcision levels, antiretroviral therapy (ART) & codom use",Not Stated,64 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,39300,United States,2011,45217.91

28836,Making wider use of the world's most widely used vaccine: Bacille Calmette-Guerin revaccination reconsidered,"Approximately 100 million newborn children receive Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) annually, because vaccination is consistently protective against childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB. By contrast, BCG efficacy against pulmonary TB in children and adults is highly variable, ranging from 0% to 80%, though it tends to be higher in individuals who have no detectable prior exposure to mycobacterial infections, as judged by the absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity response (a negative tuberculin skin test, TST). The duration of protection against pulmonary TB is also variable, but lasts about 10 years on average. These observations raise the possibility that BCG revaccination, following primary vaccination in infancy, could be efficacious among TST-negative adolescents as they move into adulthood, the period of highest risk for pulmonary disease. To inform continuing debate about revaccination, this paper assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of revaccinating adolescents in a setting with intense transmission-Cape Town, South Africa. For a cost of revaccination in the range US$1-10 per person, and vaccine efficacy between 10% and 80% with protection for 10 years, the incremental cost per year of healthy life recovered (disability-adjusted life years, DALY) in the vaccinated population lies between US$116 and US$9237. The intervention is about twice as cost-effective when allowing for the extra benefits of preventing transmission, with costs per DALY recovered in the range US$52-$4540. At 80% efficacy, revaccination averted 17% of cases. Under the scenarios investigated, BCG revaccination is cost-effective against international benchmarks, though not highly effective. Cost-effectiveness ratios would be more favourable if we also allow for TB cases averted by preventing transmission to HIV-positive people, for the protection of HIV-negative people who later acquire HIV infection, for the possible non-specific benefits of BCG, for the fact that some adolescents would receive BCG for the first time, and for cost sharing when BCG is integrated into an adolescent immunization programme. These findings suggest, subject to further evaluation, that BCG revaccination could be cost-effective in some settings.",2013-99-11746,23904584,J R Soc Interface,Christopher Dye,2013,10 / 87,20130365,No,23904584,"Christopher Dye; Making wider use of the world's most widely used vaccine: Bacille Calmette-Guerin revaccination reconsidered, J R Soc Interface, ; 10(87):1742-5662; 20130365",DALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Immunization,Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) revaccination against tuberculosis vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,116,United States,2011,133.47
28837,Economic assessment of Q fever in the Netherlands,"In this paper the economic impact of controlling the Q fever epidemic in 2007-2011 in the Netherlands is assessed. Whereas most of the long-term benefits of the implemented control programme stem from reduced disease burden and human health costs, the majority of short-term intervention costs were incurred in the dairy goat sector.

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of introducing either PCV10 or the13-valent vaccine (PCV13) from a societal perspective and explored the incremental impact of including indirect vaccine effects.The costs and effects of pneumococcal vaccination among infants born in Kenya in 2010 were assessed using a decision analytic model comparing PCV10 or PCV13, in turn, with no vaccination. Direct vaccine effects were estimated as a reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. Pneumococcal disease incidence was extrapolated from a population-based hospital surveillance system in Kilifi and adjustments were made for variable access to care across Kenya. We used vaccine efficacy estimates from a trial in The Gambia and accounted for serotype distribution in Kilifi. We estimated indirect vaccine protection and serotype replacement by extrapolating from the USA. Multivariable sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. We assumed a vaccine price of US$ 3.50 per dose.The annual cost of delivering PCV10 was approximately US$14 million. We projected a 42.7% reduction in pneumococcal disease episodes leading to a US$1.97 million reduction in treatment costs and a 6.1% reduction in childhood mortality annually. In the base case analysis, costs per discounted DALY and per death averted by PCV10, amounted to US$ 59 (95% CI 26-103) and US$ 1,958 (95% CI 866-3,425), respectively.

28849,Impact and cost-effectiveness of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccination in India,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of nationwide Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination in India. STUDY DESIGN: A decision support model was used, bringing together estimates of demography, epidemiology, Hib vaccine effectiveness, Hib vaccine costs, and health care costs. Scenarios favorable and unfavorable to the vaccine were evaluated. State-level analyses indicate where the vaccine might have the greatest impact and value. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2031, Hib conjugate vaccination is estimated to prevent over 200 000 child deaths ( approximately 1% of deaths in children <5 years of age) in India at an incremental cost of US$127 million per year. From a government perspective, state-level cost-effectiveness ranged from US$192 to US$1033 per discounted disability adjusted life years averted. With the inclusion of household health care costs, cost-effectiveness ranged from US$155-US$939 per discounted disability adjusted life year averted. These values are below the World Health Organization thresholds for cost effectiveness of public health interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Hib conjugate vaccination is a cost-effective intervention in all States of India. This conclusion does not alter with plausible changes in key parameters.

STUDY DESIGN: A decision support model was used, bringing together estimates of demography, epidemiology, Hib vaccine effectiveness, Hib vaccine costs, and health care costs. Scenarios favorable and unfavorable to the vaccine were evaluated. State-level analyses indicate where the vaccine might have the greatest impact and value. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2031, Hib conjugate vaccination is estimated to prevent over 200 000 child deaths ( approximately 1% of deaths in children <5 years of age) in India at an incremental cost of US$127 million per year. From a government perspective, state-level cost-effectiveness ranged from US$192 to US$1033 per discounted disability adjusted life years averted. With the inclusion of household health care costs, cost-effectiveness ranged from US$155-US$939 per discounted disability adjusted life year averted.

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a deterministic Markov model, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted over a lifetime as the outcome measure. POPULATION: Current smokers, motivated to quit. RESULTS: Call-back counselling for smoking cessation provided by the Quitline is an intervention that both improves health with additional quitters, and achieves net cost savings due to the cost offsets being greater than the cost of the intervention. If cost offsets are excluded, the cost per quitter is $A773 (95% uncertainty interval $A769$-$A779), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is $A294 per DALY (95% uncertainty interval $A293-$A298).

28875,Cost-effectiveness of asthma clinic approach in the management of chronic asthma in Australia,"OBJECTIVES: To compare cost-effectiveness of an asthma clinic that would provide education, promotion of self-monitoring of symptoms, regular review of treatment by a medical practitioner and a written asthma action plan to current practice in Australia. METHODS: A decision tree model was used to compare treatment and improved management using asthma clinics under three scenarios: 1) intervention reduces only emergency department visits; 2) in addition, it leads to a reduction in days out of role; and 3) it also reduces unplanned general practitioner visits and hospitalisations. Evidence from existing published studies was used for asthma incidence, duration, treatment practices and health seeking behaviours. Costs for one year were estimated based on an asthma clinic trial in Australia. RESULTS: The estimated $274 million annual cost of asthma clinics is much greater than the potential cost savings of $11 million resulting from reduced emergency department visits, and an overall potential cost saving of $85 million resulting from decreased GP visits and hospitalisations. The incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) is $24,000 if a reduction in days out of role is quantified as a health benefit in estimating disability-adjusted life years (DALY). If a potential $85 million in cost-savings from decreased emergency department visits, GP visits and hospitalisation is taken into account, the ICER drops to $17,000 per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: An asthma clinic as an intervention for improving self-management may be cost-effective in Australia if multiple benefits can be achieved.

28876,Cost-effectiveness of a quality improvement collaborative for obstetric and newborn care in Niger,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to describe a quality improvement collaborative conducted in 33 Nigerian facilities to improve maternal and newborn care outcomes by increasing compliance with high-impact, evidence-based care standards. Intervention costs and cost-effectiveness were examined and costs to the Niger Health Ministry (MoH) were estimated if they were to scale-up the intervention to additional sites. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Facility-based maternal care outcomes and costs from pre-quality improvement collaborative baseline monitoring data in participating facilities from January to May 2006 were compared with outcomes and costs from the same facilities from June 2008 to September 2008. Cost data were collected from project accounting records. The MoH costs were determined from interviews with clinic managers and quality improvement teams. Effectiveness data were obtained from facilities'' records. FINDINGS: The average delivery-cost decreased from $35 before to $28 after the collaborative. The USAID/HCI project''s incremental cost was $2.43/delivery. The collaborative incremental cost-effectiveness was $147/disability-adjusted life year averted. If the MoH spread the intervention to other facilities, substantive cost-savings and improved health outcomes can be predicted. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The intervention achieved significant positive health benefits for a low cost. The Niger MoH can expect approximately 50 per cent return on its investment if it implements the collaborative in new facilities. The improvement collaborative approach can improve health and save health care resources.

28877,The cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in the morbidly obese adult population of Australia,"BACKGROUND: To examine the cost-effectiveness of providing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) surgery to all morbidly obese adults in the 2003 Australian population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Analyzed costs and benefits associated with two intervention scenarios, one providing LAGB surgery to individuals with BMI >40 and another to individuals with BMI >35, with each compared relative to a ''do nothing'' scenario. A multi-state, multiple cohort Markov model was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of LAGB surgery over the lifetime of each cohort. All costs and health outcomes were assessed from an Australian health sector perspective and were discounted using a 3% annual rate. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyzes were conducted to test the robustness of model outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured in 2003 Australian dollars per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The ICER for the scenario providing LAGB surgery to all individuals with a BMI >40 was dominant [95% CI: dominant -$588] meaning that the intervention led to both improved health and cost savings. The ICER when providing surgery to those with a BMI >35 was $2,154/DALY averted [95% CI: dominant -$6,033]. Results were highly sensitive to changes in the likelihood of long-term complications. CONCLUSION: LAGB surgery is highly cost-effective when compared to the $50,000/DALY threshold for cost-effectiveness used in Australia. LAGB surgery also ranks highly in terms of cost-effectiveness when compared to other population-level interventions for weight loss in Australia.

28879,Provision of bednets and water filters to delay HIV-1 progression: cost-effectiveness analysis of a Kenyan multisite study,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness, costs and cost-effectiveness of providing long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and point-of-use water filters to antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV-infected adults and their family members, in the context of a multisite study in Kenya of 589 HIV-positive adults followed on average for 1.7 years. METHODS: The effectiveness, costs and cost-effectiveness of the intervention were estimated using an epidemiologic-cost model. Model epidemiologic inputs were derived from the Kenya multisite study data, local epidemiological data and from the published literature. Model cost inputs were derived from published literature specific to Kenya. Uncertainty in the model estimates was assessed through univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We estimated net cost savings of about US$ 26 000 for the intervention, over 1.7 years. Even when ignoring net cost savings, the intervention was found to be very cost-effective at a cost of US$ 3100 per death averted or US$ 99 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The findings were robust to the sensitivity analysis and remained most sensitive to both the duration of ART use and the cost of ART per person-year. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of LLINs and water filters to ART-naive HIV-infected adults in the Kenyan study resulted in substantial net cost savings, due to the delay in the initiation of ART. The addition of an LLIN and a point-of-use water filter to the existing package of care provided to ART-naive HIV-infected adults could bring substantial cost savings to resource-constrained health systems in low- and middle-income countries.",2013-99-11336,23659539,Trop Med Int Health,Eli Kern,2013,18 / 8,916-24,No,23659539,"Eli Kern; Stephane Verguet; Krista Yuhas; Frederick H Odhiambo; James G Kahn; Judd Walson; Provision of bednets and water filters to delay HIV-1 progression: cost-effectiveness analysis of a Kenyan multisite study, Trop Med Int Health, ; 18(8):1360-2276; 916-24",DALY,Kenya,Not Stated,Environmental,Providing long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and point-of-use water filters to delay HIV-1 progression vs. None,ART (antiretroviral therapy)-naÃ¯ve,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,99,United States,2009,119.43
28880,Use of the non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) for life-threatening obstetric hemorrhage: a cost-effectiveness analysis in Egypt and Nigeria,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) for obstetric hemorrhage in tertiary hospitals in Egypt and Nigeria. METHODS: We combined published data from pre-intervention/NASG-intervention clinical trials with costs from study sites. For each country, we used observed proportions of initial shock level (mild: mean arterial pressure [MAP] >60 mmHg; severe: MAP </=60 mmHg) to define a standard population of 1,000 women presenting in shock. We examined three intervention scenarios: no women in shock receive the NASG, only women in severe shock receive the NASG, and all women in shock receive the NASG. Clinical data included frequencies of adverse health outcomes (mortality, severe morbidity, severe anemia), and interventions to manage bleeding (uterotonics, blood transfusions, hysterectomies). Costs (in 2010 international dollars) included the NASG, training, and clinical interventions. We compared costs and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) across the intervention scenarios. RESULTS: For 1000 women presenting in shock, providing the NASG to those in severe shock results in decreased mortality and morbidity, which averts 357 DALYs in Egypt and 2,063 DALYs in Nigeria. Differences in use of interventions result in net savings of $9,489 in Egypt (primarily due to reduced transfusions) and net costs of $6,460 in Nigeria, with a cost per DALY averted of $3.13. Results of providing the NASG for women in mild shock has smaller and uncertain effects due to few clinical events in this data set. CONCLUSION: Using the NASG for women in severe shock resulted in markedly improved health outcomes (2-2.9 DALYs averted per woman, primarily due to reduced mortality), with net savings or extremely low cost per DALY averted. This suggests that in resource-limited settings, the NASG is a very cost-effective intervention for women in severe hypovolemic shock.

28884,"Cost-effectiveness of scaling up voluntary counselling and testing in West-Java, Indonesia","AIM: to evaluate the costs-effectiveness of scaling up community-based VCT in West-Java. METHODS: the Asian epidemic model (AEM) and resource needs model (RNM) were used to calculate incremental costs per HIV infection averted and per disability-adjusted life years saved (DALYs). Locally monitored demographic, epidemiological behavior and cost data were used as model input. RESULTS: scaling up community-based VCT in West-Java will reduce the overall population prevalence by 36% in 2030 and costs US$248 per HIV infection averted and US$9.17 per DALY saved. Cost-effectiveness estimation were most sensitive to the impact of VCT on condom use and to the population size of clients of female sex workers (FSWs), but were overall robust. The total costs for scaling up community-based VCT range between US$1.3 and 3.8 million per year and require the number of VCT integrated clinics at public community health centers to increase from 73 in 2010 to 594 in 2030.

28885,Cost-effectiveness of novel first-line treatment regimens for tuberculosis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of novel first-line treatment regimens for tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: Using decision analysis, we projected the costs and effectiveness, from the health care perspective, of treating a patient cohort in the public sector for active TB without known or suspected resistance to first-line drugs. We compared standard (6-month) treatment to hypothetical regimens of equal efficacy, higher cost and shorter duration. RESULTS: For every 100 TB patients treated, replacing standard treatment with shorter-course regimens would avert an estimated 2-4 failures/relapses, 0.2-0.4 deaths and 8-14 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), or 6-11% of all DALYs suffered. We identified three primary determinants of cost-effectiveness: drug price, continuation phase treatment delivery costs and deaths averted through fewer relapses. In a high treatment cost scenario (similar to Brazil), averted delivery costs outweighed higher drug costs, making novel regimens cost-saving. In a low treatment cost scenario (similar to the Philippines), a 4-month regimen with a drug price of $1/day cost $66 per patient, or $840 per DALY averted, and became cost-saving if the drug price dropped below $0.37/day.

28887,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Option B+ for HIV prevention and treatment of mothers and children in Malawi,"BACKGROUND: The Ministry of Health in Malawi is implementing a pragmatic and innovative approach for the management of all HIV-infected pregnant women, termed Option B+, which consists of providing life-long antiretroviral treatment, regardless of their CD4 count or clinical stage. Our objective was to determine if Option B+ represents a cost-effective option. METHODS: A decision model simulates the disease progression of a cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women receiving prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, and estimates the number of paediatric infections averted and maternal life years gained over a ten-year time horizon. We assess the cost-effectiveness from the Ministry of Health perspective while taking into account the practical realities of implementing ART services in Malawi. RESULTS: If implemented as recommended by the World Health Organization, options A, B and B+ are equivalent in preventing new infant infections, yielding cost effectiveness ratios between US$ 37 and US$ 69 per disability adjusted life year averted in children. However, when the three options are compared to the current practice, the provision of antiretroviral therapy to all mothers (Option B+) not only prevents infant infections, but also improves the ten-year survival in mothers more than four-fold. This translates into saving more than 250,000 maternal life years, as compared to mothers receiving only Option A or B, with savings of 153,000 and 172,000 life years respectively. Option B+ also yields favourable incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of US$ 455 per life year gained over the current practice. CONCLUSION: In Malawi, Option B+ represents a favorable policy option from a cost-effectiveness perspective to prevent future infant infections, save mothers'' lives and reduce orphanhood.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental, longitudinal design was used with anthropometric data collected at baseline (1001 children-intervention; 1183-comparator) and follow-up. A societal perspective was employed, with intervention resource use measured retrospectively based on process evaluation reports, school newsletters, reports, and key stakeholder interviews, and valued in 2006 Australian dollars (AUD). Outcomes were measured as Body Mass Index (BMI) units saved and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted over the predicted cohort lifetime, and reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (with 95% uncertainty intervals). RESULTS: The intervention cost AUD0.34M ($0.31M; $0.38M) annually, and resulted in savings of 547 (-104; 1209) BMI units and 10.2 (-0.19; 21.6) DALYs. This translated to modest cost offsets of AUD27 311 (-$1803; $58 242) and a net cost per DALY saved of AUD29 798 (dominated; $0.26M).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) test when added to existing strategies for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in human immunodeficiency virus infected adults (CD4(+) T-cell counts < 100 cells/l) with symptoms of active TB. DESIGN: Decision-analytic cost-utility model, with the primary outcome being the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed in 2010 US dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted from the perspective of a public sector TB control program. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For every 1000 patients tested, adding lateral-flow urine LAM generated 80 incremental appropriate anti-tuberculosis treatments and averted 224 DALYs. Estimated cost utility was US$353 per DALY averted (95% uncertainty range $192$1161) in South Africa and $86 per DALY averted (95% uncertainty range $49$239) in Uganda, reflecting the lower treatment costs in Uganda. Cost utility was most sensitive to assay specificity, cost of anti-tuberculosis treatment, life expectancy after TB cure and cohort TB prevalence, but did not rise above $1500 per DALY averted in South Africa under any one-way sensitivity analysis. The probability of acceptability was >99.8% at a per-DALY willingness-to-pay threshold equal to the per capita gross domestic product in South Africa ($7275) and Uganda ($509).",2013-99-11008,23485389,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,D Sun,2013,17 / 4,552-8,No,23485389,"D Sun; S Dorman; M Shah; Y C Manabe; V M Moodley; M P Nicol; D W Dowdy; Cost utility of lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan for tuberculosis diagnosis in HIV-infected African adults, Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, ; 17(4):1027-3719; 552-8",DALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Diagnostic,Lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (TB-LAM Alere) for tuberculosis diagnosis vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,353,United States,2010,418.98

28893,Obstacles to surgical services in a rural Cameroonian district hospital,"BACKGROUND: There are significant obstacles to the delivery of surgical care in low income countries. Few studies have defined or characterized these constraints. The present study aimed to identify financial and demographic factors limiting the utilization of surgical services in rural Cameroon. METHODS: A review was performed of all surgical records for patients presenting for surgery at the District Hospital of Kolofata in rural Cameroon over the 3-year study period (2004-2007). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated using disease- and patient-specific outcomes while accounting for postoperative morbidity. Univariate and multivariate analysis identified factors associated with failure to return for care. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,213 patients presented for preoperative evaluation, were informed of the cost to be paid preoperatively, and had surgery scheduled. Of these, 544 patients did not return for treatment, representing 2,163 DALYs potentially lost. Multivariate analysis revealed significant factors associated with increased likelihood of not returning for care as required preoperative payment >$US 310 (OR 0.44-0.86) and a recommended procedure for cancer (OR 0.47-0.86) or cutaneous disease (OR 0.28-0.95). Factors associated with increased odds of returning were male gender (OR 1.03-1.98), preoperative payment <$US 50 (OR 2.86-16.2), and a procedure with low DALYs (OR 1.71-9.89).
