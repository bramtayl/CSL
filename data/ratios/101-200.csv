111,Tuberculin screening: cost-effectiveness analysis of various testing schedules,"Because there is no tuberculin screening schedule currently recommended for adults, we used a Markov process in a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine an optimal strategy. We simulated the prognosis of a cohort of black 20-year-olds to evaluate the effects of various screening schedules with intradermal tuberculin and administration of isoniazid prophylaxis to those with positive results. The schedule with the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio is a single screening at 50 years of age, which costs $41,672 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The cost-effectiveness ratio is nearly the same for all schedules involving a single screening between 30 and 70 years of age. Repeated screening strategies are less cost effective. Sensitivity analysis shows that the range of acceptable screening strategies changes significantly under alternate assumptions about the mortality from isoniazid hepatitis. However, screening at 50 years of age remains nearly optimal under the alternatives considered. Altering the values of other parameters generally produced only small changes. Tuberculin screening at 50 years of age should be added to primary care preventive practices because the strategy is as cost effective as standard health interventions and is robust to alternative assumptions. If further research confirms the base case assumptions about isoniazid toxicity, consideration should be given to increasing screening to every 10 years, which would produce a larger health benefit, albeit at substantially higher cost.",1990-01-01750,2118787,Am J Prev Med,C B Schechter,1990,6 / 3,167-75,No,2118787,"C B Schechter; D N Rose; M C Fahs; A L Silver; Tuberculin screening: cost-effectiveness analysis of various testing schedules, Am J Prev Med, 1990 May-Jun; 6(3):0749-3797; 167-75",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,TB screen age 50 vs. no screen,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,Male,Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,41672,United States,1985,100233.94

113,Cost effectiveness of screening perimenopausal white women for osteoporosis: bone densitometry and hormone replacement therapy,"Bone mass measurement at menopause to identify and selectively prescribe hormone replacement therapy for women at high risk for fractures has seen limited clinical use. We used epidemiologic, clinical, and economic data in a decision-analytic model to compare the following clinical strategies for perimenopausal, asymptomatic, white women with intact uteri: no intervention; bone mineral density measurement followed by selective, long-term (15-year) estrogen-progestin therapy in women with low bone mass; and unselective, universal hormone replacement therapy. Life expectancy and direct medical cost per patient were estimated for each strategy. Strategies for screening and treating women with perimenopausal bone mineral density less than 0.9 g/cm2 or less than 1.0 g/cm2 would cost $11,700 or $22,100, respectively, per year of additional life gained. If the cost of screening is less than $84, then resource savings from hip fractures prevented would be more than the cost of screening and treatment. Universal treatment without screening would prevent additional fatal fractures but would expose many more women to the adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy and would cost an additional $349,000 per year of life gained compared with the screening strategies. When quality of life was considered, screening was found to be cost effective over a wide range of assumptions. The choice between universal treatment and screening depends on the risks (breast cancer), perceived side effects (menstrual bleeding), and benefits (prevention of ischemic heart disease) of estrogen-progestin therapy. We conclude that screening asymptomatic, perimenopausal white women to detect low bone mass and to target hormone replacement therapy at women who are at the greatest risk for fracture is a reasonably cost-effective use of health care resources.

117,Cost of surfactant replacement treatment for severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome: a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE--To estimate the cost of treating babies with severe respiratory distress syndrome with natural porcine surfactant. DESIGN--Retrospective controlled survey. SETTING--Regional neonatal intensive care unit, Belfast. PATIENTS--33 Preterm babies with severe respiratory distress syndrome who were enrolled in a European multicentre trial during 1985-7. 19 Babies were treated with surfactant and 14 served as controls. INTERVENTIONS--Treatment with natural porcine surfactant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Cost associated with surfactant replacement treatment per extra survivor in the treatment group and cost per quality adjusted life year for each extra survivor. RESULTS--Fifteen (79%) of the 19 treated babies and five (36%) of the 14 control babies survived. On average, the control babies required 20 days in hospital compared with 61 days for the treated babies (or 95 [corrected] days per extra survivor in the treatment group). The cost per extra survivor in the treatment group was pounds 13,720, with the cost per quality adjusted life year estimated at pounds 710. CONCLUSION--These costs compare favourably with those of established forms of treatment in adults. Thus surfactant replacement treatment for severe respiratory distress syndrome is fairly inexpensive and cost effective.",1990-01-01752,2126475,BMJ,T R Tubman,1990,301 / 6756,842-5,No,2126475,"T R Tubman; H L Halliday; C Normand; Cost of surfactant replacement treatment for severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome: a randomised controlled trial, BMJ, 1990-Oct-13; 301(6756):0959-8138; 842-5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,surfactant vs. no surfactant,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,710,United Kingdom,1989,2427.65

122,Medical management of gallstones: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) is an oral dissolution agent recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of cholelithiasis. The authors conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing ursodiol with elective cholecystectomy and expectant management for men and women of ages 50 and 70 with typical chronic biliary symptoms. DESIGN: Using published literature and national cost data, the authors performed a decision analysis in which the outcome measures were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and expected lifetime treatment cost. PATIENTS: The analysis applies to patients with symptoms of biliary colic, noncalcified gallstones less than 20 mm in diameter, and functioning oral cholecystograms, who are candidates for elective cholecystectomy. Excluded were patients with acute cholecystitis or known or suspected common bile duct stones. RESULTS: Ursodiol is both clinically advantageous and less expensive than surgery for symptomatic men aged 64 or more, and for symptomatic women aged 69 or more. At ages younger than these, the clinical advantage of surgery is small and could be nullified if ursodiol were targeted at patients for whom dissolution is most likely to be effective, based on evidence of stone size and composition. Expected lifetime costs of ursodiol range from $300-400 more than surgery for 50-year-olds to $700-1,000 less than surgery for 70-year-olds. Ursodiol is the preferred choice for patients throughout this age range who are at significantly elevated risk of operative mortality.

Analysis of the role of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty based on data available in 1989,"No prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and conservative therapy has been reported. To address when revascularization is indicated, we constructed a decision analytic model. Our model incorporates procedure-related mortality and morbidity, coronary artery disease-related mortality, and the benefit of revascularization. We determined the quality-adjusted life expectancy and expected costs for each strategy. Our model suggests that angioplasty is a reasonable alternative to bypass surgery in patients with favorable lesions if angioplasty would provide a comparable degree of revascularization. Our model predicts that patients treated with angioplasty will have more revascularization procedures than will patients treated with bypass surgery but predicts that both treatments will cost the same over the typical patient's lifetime. In many patients with severe angina or documented ischemia, angioplasty is indicated for stenosis of a single artery. In patients with two vessel disease that is amenable to angioplasty, angioplasty may be a reasonable alternative to bypass surgery.

The level of well-being was based on interviews with staff and relatives and related to the economic outcome--a cost utility analysis. A 6 month period prior to day care was compared with the first 6 months in such care. The use of resources at home increased by 20% while the use of institutional care was reduced by 22%.

150,Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy vs. cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones, a model was constructed that projects charges and survival for both treatments. For a 45-year-old woman with one small stone, treatment with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy rather than cholecystectomy is projected to result in an average gain of only 3 days of life and an average increase in direct medical charges of $1729 over 5 years of follow-up. The resulting marginal cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy vs. cholecystectomy is $216,000 of extra charges per year of life gained with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to be much more cost-effective for elderly than for young patients (10-20-fold difference), but considerably less cost-effective for multiple stones than a single stone (2-4-fold difference), and less cost-effective for women than men (twofold difference). Adjusting for effects of morbidity on quality of life, extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to have slightly better quality-adjusted survival than cholecystectomy for the small subset of patients with one stone (by 8 to 43 days at 5 years) but not for young patients with multiple stones. It is concluded that decisions about appropriate use of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy should consider the effects of patient characteristics on clinical and economic outcomes.",1991-01-01758,1904378,Gastroenterology,E B Bass,1991,101 / 1,189-99,No,1904378,"E B Bass; E P Steinberg; H A Pitt; G P Saba; K D Lillemoe; D R Kafonek; T R Gadacz; T A Gordon; G F Anderson; Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones, Gastroenterology, 1991-Jul; 101(1):0016-5085; 189-99",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,lithotripsy vs. cholecystectomy,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,61095.41,United States,1988,133661.57

In 29 BMTs a full two year period of follow up was available and a quality of life analysis was carried out on these patients. It was calculated that 59 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) had been gained by the BMT procedure at the time of analysis. By combining these two analyses the cost of each QALY gained by BMT is NZ$13,272.

The impact on quality of life (QoL) is limited: for the 2-yearly screening policy for women aged 50-70, the cost per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) gained is 4,050, whereas the cost per life-year gained is US $3,825. The CE ratio for 2-yearly screening of women aged 40-70 is 5,400, but the additional cost per additional life-year gained is US $35,000. It would be preferable by far to extend the screening programme to women over the age of 70 or to shorten the screening interval for women aged 50-70. Screening performances, the demand for mammograms outside screening and the possibility of a survival improvement irrespective of screening have a strong impact on QoL and CE.",1991-01-01761,1917154,Int J Cancer,H J de Koning,1991,49 / 4,531-7,No,1917154,"H J de Koning; B M van Ineveld; G J van Oortmarssen; J C de Haes; H J Collette; J H Hendriks; P J van der Maas; Breast cancer screening and cost-effectiveness; policy alternatives, quality of life considerations and the possible impact of uncertain factors, Int J Cancer, 1991-Oct-21; 49(4):0020-7136; 531-7",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biennial breast cancer screening in 50-75 yo vs. Biennial breast cancer screening in 50-70 yo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,16000,United States,1990,31683.06
165,Economic evaluation of a support program for caregivers of demented elderly,"An economic evaluation was undertaken concurrently with a randomized trial comparing a Caregiver Support Program (CSP) with existing conventional community nursing care for those caring for elderly relatives at home. The differences in resource consumption were compared with changes in caregiver quality of life, as measured by the Caregiver Quality of Life Instrument (CQLI). A 20% difference from baseline in the CQLI favored the experimental (CSP) group, although this did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. A comparison of improvement in quality of life with costs implies an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of Canadian $20,000 for the CSP, which compares favorably with other health care interventions.

166,Primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected people with CD4 counts below 200/mm3: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the effectiveness and costs of dapsone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or aerosolized pentamidine as initial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected people without prior symptoms AIDS and with CD4 counts less than 200/mm3. Each strategy increased life expectancy by about 18% compared with no prophylaxis; annual per-person costs were $440, $700, and $1,680 for dapsone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and aerosolized pentamidine, respectively. These cost differences make a strategy beginning with dapsone most cost effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,400 per life year saved compared with no prophylaxis. Aerosolized pentamidine was substantially less cost effective, but the incremental cost effectiveness ratios were highly dependent on estimates for quality of life, efficacy, toxicity, and compliance. We conclude that, based on currently available data, initial prophylaxis with either dapsone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is most cost effective. For every 100,000 people treated, starting prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or dapsone--with crossover to aerosolized pentamidine if oral therapy is not tolerated--may save between $98 million and $124 million per year.",1991-01-01763,1673157,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,K A Freedberg,1991,4 / 5,521-31,No,1673157,"K A Freedberg; A N Tosteson; C J Cohen; D J Cotton; Primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected people with CD4 counts below 200/mm3: a cost-effectiveness analysis, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 1991; 4(5):0894-9255; 521-31",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aerosolized pentamidine as primary prophylaxis for PCP vs. Oral dapsone as primary prophylaxis for PCP,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,1989,Not Stated

Age was confirmed as a highly significant prognostic factor, and cost utility analysis showed that the cost of thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase in the elderly was lower per quality adjusted life year than in younger patients.

168,Efficacy and cost effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with node-negative breast cancer. A decision-analysis model,"BACKGROUND. In 1988 the National Cancer Institute issued a Clinical Alert that has been widely interpreted as recommending that all women with node-negative breast cancer receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Acceptance of this recommendation is controversial, since many women who would not have a recurrence would be treated. METHODS. Using a decision-analysis model, we studied the cost effectiveness of chemotherapy in cohorts of 45-year-old and 60-year-old women with node-negative breast cancer by calculating life expectancy as adjusted for quality of life. The analysis evaluated different scenarios of the benefit of therapy: improved disease-free survival for five years, with a lesser effect on overall survival (base line); a lifelong benefit from chemotherapy; and a benefit in disease-free survival with no change in overall survival by year 10. The base-line analysis assumed a 30 percent reduction in the relative risk of recurrence for five years after treatment. RESULTS. For the 45-year-old woman, the base-line analysis found an average lifetime benefit from chemotherapy of 5.1 quality-months at a cost of $15,400 per quality-year. The 60-year-old women gained 4.0 quality-months at a cost of $18,800 per quality-year. Under the more and less optimistic scenarios, the benefit of chemotherapy varied from 1.4 to 14.0 quality-months for both groups. CONCLUSIONS. Chemotherapy substantially increases the quality-adjusted life expectancy of an average woman at a cost comparable to that of other widely accepted therapies. This benefit decreases markedly if the changes in long-term survival are less than in disease-free survival.

179,Circumcision: a decision analysis of its medical value,"Routine neonatal circumcision has long been controversial. Presented here is a cost-effectiveness analysis of the consequences of the treatment choices (circumcision versus no circumcision) using a decision tree model. For a simulated 85-year life expectancy, routine neonatal circumcision had an expected lifetime cost of $164.61 per patient circumcised and a quality-adjusted survival of 84.999 years. Conversely, for the noncircumcision approach, the expected average lifetime cost was $139.26 per patient, and the quality-adjusted survival was 84.971 years. The net cost-effectiveness ($919.87 per quality-adjusted life year) is within the range usually considered worthwhile for public health policy. However, because of the minor differences in lifetime cost ($25) and benefit (10 days of life) for an individual and the tenuous values available for disease incidence and surgical risk, we conclude that there is no medical indication for or against circumcision. Additional analyses suggested that reported benefits in preventing penile cancer and infant urinary tract infections are insignificant compared to the surgical risks of post neonatal circumcision. The decision regarding circumcision may most reasonably be made on nonmedical factors such as parent preference or religious convictions.",1991-01-01767,1794670,Fam Med,F H Lawler,1991,23 / 8,587-93,No,1794670,"F H Lawler; R S Bisonni; D R Holtgrave; Circumcision: a decision analysis of its medical value, Fam Med, 1991 Nov-Dec; 23(8):0742-3225; 587-93",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine neonatal circumcision vs. No neonatal circumcision,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Not Stated,5.00,Not Stated,919.87,United States,1990,1821.52
180,Biliary lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy: a cost-utility analysis,"Evaluating the economic impact of medical procedures is of increasing importance in the American health care system, and this is especially true in the case of new medical technologies. Both the cost and the outcome of a treatment, and its alternatives must be evaluated. A cost-utility analysis was performed to compare cholecystectomy with biliary lithotripsy accompanied by bile acid therapy. Using a Markov approach, a model was designed to project expected cost and quality-adjusted survival over a 5-year period in patients with solitary stones of less than or equal to 20 mm in diameter. The viewpoint of the analysis was chosen to be that of the general society, since it can be considered as a consensus of all interest groups. Direct costs were obtained from hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia; indirect costs are based on average United States earnings. Utility was estimated using a model that combines different scales of well-being with an underlying etiology. The findings indicate that from society's point of view for all patients meeting lithotripsy inclusion criteria, based on this cost-utility analysis, biliary lithotripsy would be the procedure of choice.",1991-01-01768,10149153,J Lithotr Stone Dis,U Stengele,1991,3 / 2,133-40,No,10149153,"U Stengele; B R Baumgartner; J L Chezmar; D P Slaker; Biliary lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy: a cost-utility analysis, J Lithotr Stone Dis, 1991-Apr; 3(2):1040-2152; 133-40",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biliary lithotripsy accompanied by oral chemolysis therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid vs. Cholecystectomy,Not Stated,90 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,1990,Not Stated
181,Cost effectiveness of prophylactic intravenous immune globulin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"BACKGROUND. A recent randomized controlled trial of intravenous immune globulin in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the rate of bacterial infections among patients who received intravenous immune globulin. We used decision-analysis techniques to determine whether prophylactic intravenous immune globulin is likely to result in an overall clinical benefit to patients who receive this treatment and to examine its cost effectiveness. METHODS. We constructed a model to compare two strategies: treatment with intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 400 mg per kilogram of body weight every three weeks and no immune globulin therapy. Baseline estimates of the efficacy of intravenous immune globulin were derived from the published results of the randomized trial. The costs of treatment, complications, and infections were estimated on the basis of component costs. Health outcomes were measured in terms of gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS. Intravenous immune globulin therapy can result in a loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy when the inconvenience of treatment is taken into account. If the inconvenience of treatment is not considered, therapy results in a gain of 0.8 quality-adjusted days per patient per year of therapy at a cost of $6 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS. Decision-analysis modeling may be applied to the results of randomized controlled trials to assess the potential clinical and financial effects of adopting the intervention in medical practice. In the case of intravenous immune globulin therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, this type of analysis suggests that treatment might not result in improved quality or length of life and that it is extraordinarily expensive in comparison with other treatments generally accepted as cost effective.",1991-01-01769,1904989,N Engl J Med,J C Weeks,1991,325 / 2,81-6,No,1904989,"J C Weeks; M R Tierney; M C Weinstein; Cost effectiveness of prophylactic intravenous immune globulin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, N Engl J Med, 1991-Jul-11; 325(2):1533-4406; 81-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,IV immune globulin vs. no IV immune globulin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,6000000,United States,1989,12523112.9
182,Cost-utility analysis of thrombolytic therapy,"An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy was performed, based on 3- to 5-year follow-up data, from 533 patients randomized to receive conventional therapy or intracoronary streptokinase. At the 3-year follow-up, mortality was 22% in the former group and 14% after thrombolysis. The estimated average gain in life years by thrombolytic therapy was 3.4, whereas this figure was only 1.6 years in patients with inferior wall infarction, and 5.1 years in patients with anterior wall infarction. The lifetime costs for conventional therapy, estimated as ECU 15,110, were increased by ECU 5530 when thrombolytic therapy was applied, including direct treatment costs and the additional costs of extra coronary bypass surgery and PTCA. After correction for quality of life, and discounting future costs and future events at 5% year-1, the additional costs for each life year were ECU 2940 for all patients treated. This was broken down into ECU 7030 and ECU 2000 for patients with inferior and anterior wall infarction respectively. These figures compare favourably with other modes of cardiovascular therapy. Thrombolytic therapy does not substantially increase the need for bypass surgery or PTCA. It is very cost-effective, and its application should not be limited by economic resources.",1991-01-01770,1907241,Eur Heart J,M L Simoons,1991,12 / 6,694-9,No,1907241,"M L Simoons; J Vos; L L Martens; Cost-utility analysis of thrombolytic therapy, Eur Heart J, 1991-Jun; 12(6):0195-668X; 694-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase vs. Conventional therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,2940,Euro,1988,7608.53

186,Recurrent otitis media: a cost-utility analysis of simulated treatment using tympanostomy tubes vs antibiotic prophylaxis,"Using a cost-utility analysis, the effectiveness of tympanostomy tubes was compared to that of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis in young patients with recurrent otitis media. The tympanostomy approach (T-tubes) consisted of placement of a polyethylene grommet in the tympanic membrane, with systemic and local antibiotics administered for one week. The chemoprophylaxis approach consisted of antibiotics in full doses for seven to ten days, followed by continuous antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for six months. Because the T-tube strategy under the model assumptions was more expensive ($396.44 vs $281.30) and yielded slightly less benefit (net utility of .9325 vs. .9476 for initial antibiotic therapy), the chemoprophylaxis option was preferred. We conclude that the initial treatment for recurrent otitis media should consist of acute antibiotics followed by chemoprophylaxis, with T-tubes reserved for treatment failure. Extreme changes in the baseline probabilities of cure or recurrence with antibiotic therapy or in the cost of antibiotic therapy or tympanostomy surgery were required to alter this conclusion.

187,A cost-effectiveness analysis of hormone replacement therapy in the menopause,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in the menopause with particular reference to osteoporotic fracture and myocardial infarction. DESIGN: The multiple-decrement form of the life table was the mathematical model used to follow women of age 50 through their lifetime under the ""no hormone replacement"" and ""hormone replacement"" assumptions. Standard demographic and health economic techniques were used to calculate the corresponding lifetime differences in direct health care costs (net costs in dollars) and health effects (""net effectiveness"" in terms of life expectancy and quality, in ""quality-adjusted life-years""). This was then expressed as a cost-effectiveness ratio or the cost ($) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for each of the chosen hormone replacement regimens. SETTING AND PATIENTS: All women of age 50 in New South Wales, Australia (n = 27,021). RESULTS: The analysis showed that the lifetime net increments in direct medical care costs were largely contributed by hormone drug and consultation costs. Hormone replacement was associated with increased quality-adjusted life expectancy, a large percentage of which was attributed to a relief of menopausal symptoms. Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from under 10,000 to over a million dollars per QALY. Factors associated with improved cost-effectiveness were prolonged treatment duration, the presence of menopausal symptoms, minimum progestogen side effects (in the case of oestrogen with progestogen regimens), oestrogen use after hysterectomy and the inclusion of cardiac benefits in addition to fracture prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Hormone replacement therapy for symptomatic women is cost-effective when factors that enhance its efficiency are considered.

192,A cost-effectiveness analysis of hormone replacement therapy in the menopause,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in the menopause with particular reference to osteoporotic fracture and myocardial infarction. DESIGN: The multiple-decrement form of the life table was the mathematical model used to follow women of age 50 through their lifetime under the ""no hormone replacement"" and ""hormone replacement"" assumptions. Standard demographic and health economic techniques were used to calculate the corresponding lifetime differences in direct health care costs (net costs in dollars) and health effects (""net effectiveness"" in terms of life expectancy and quality, in ""quality-adjusted life-years""). This was then expressed as a cost-effectiveness ratio or the cost ($) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for each of the chosen hormone replacement regimens. SETTING AND PATIENTS: All women of age 50 in New South Wales, Australia (n = 27,021). RESULTS: The analysis showed that the lifetime net increments in direct medical care costs were largely contributed by hormone drug and consultation costs. Hormone replacement was associated with increased quality-adjusted life expectancy, a large percentage of which was attributed to a relief of menopausal symptoms. Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from under 10,000 to over a million dollars per QALY. Factors associated with improved cost-effectiveness were prolonged treatment duration, the presence of menopausal symptoms, minimum progestogen side effects (in the case of oestrogen with progestogen regimens), oestrogen use after hysterectomy and the inclusion of cardiac benefits in addition to fracture prevention.

200,Optimal management strategies for HIV-infected patients who present with cough or dyspnea: a cost-effective analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and costs of alternative management strategies for patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who present with pulmonary symptoms. DESIGN: Decision analysis comparing initial testing (arterial blood gas analysis, induced sputum analysis, or bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage) with empiric antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or erythromycin). Subsequent steps in management are detailed based on the results of initial management. Patients were stratified by initial CD4 lymphocyte count (less than 200/mm3, 200-500/mm3, or greater than 500/mm3) and results of chest radiography. SETTING: Hypothetical. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The estimated levels of effectiveness among strategies were relatively similar, but costs varied markedly. If potentially reasonable strategies are defined as those that have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), the recommended strategies would be: for patients at highest risk for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), with a probability of PCP above 30% (CD4 less than 200/mm3 and abnormal chest radiograph or prior history of PCP), begin with induced sputum analysis ($34,174/QALY); for intermediate-risk patients, with a probability of PCP between 6% and 30% (CD4 less than 200/mm3, regardless of chest radiograph; or CD4 200-500/mm3, regardless of chest radiograph findings), begin with arterial blood gas analysis ($4,593 to $8,310/QALY); for low-risk patients, with a probability of PCP below 6% (CD4 greater than 500/mm3, regardless of chest radiograph findings), begin with one week of erythromycin, followed by induced sputum examination if symptoms persist ($675 to $3,306/QALY). For highest-risk patients, if empiric trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was considered entirely to be outpatient therapy, it was preferred management if the probability of PCP was above 38%. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that preferred management strategies are determined more by differences in costs than by differences in levels of effectiveness, and that they vary depending on the probability of PCP in definable patient subgroups.",1992-01-01774,1351940,J Gen Intern Med,K A Freedberg,1992,7 / 3,261-72,No,1351940,"K A Freedberg; A N Tosteson; D J Cotton; L Goldman; Optimal management strategies for HIV-infected patients who present with cough or dyspnea: a cost-effective analysis, J Gen Intern Med, 1992 May-Jun; 7(3):1525-1497; 261-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Empiric treatment with erythromycin vs. no treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,675,United States,1991,1282.65
