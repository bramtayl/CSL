15901,Cost-Effectiveness Comparison Between the Response-Guided Therapies and Monotherapies of Nucleos(t)ide Analogues for Chronic Hepatitis B Patients in China,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) monotherapies are typically used as the primary treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, including lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (TBV), adefovir (ADV), entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF). For high-resistance NAs (LAM, TBV, ADV), they can generate excellent clinical outcomes by using response-guided therapy; however, their pharmacoeconomic profiles remain unclear in China. We aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness between response-guided therapies and monotherapies of NAs for Chinese hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative CHB patients. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate CHB progression associated with 12 treatment strategies using effectiveness and cost data from the published literature. We measured the lifetime costs, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way sensitivity (especially to extend the range of the TDF price) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore the uncertainties of the model. RESULTS: For both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, no treatment strategy generated the lowest lifetime costs (US$31,185-US$31,338) and QALYs (7.54-7.58). ETV and TDF monotherapies were not dominated by other treatments, whereas, the ICER of ETV monotherapy was the lowest (US$6112/QALY-US$8533/QALY). For each high-resistance NA, compared with its monotherapy, the ICERs of its response-guided therapies were below the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$22,833/QALY. Additionally, TDF monotherapy was the preferred treatment when its price dropped to US$1820/year or lower. CONCLUSION: Among 12 treatment strategies evaluated, ETV monotherapy is the most cost-effective treatment for treatment-naive CHB patients in China.

METHODS: We compared pretransplant DAA treatment versus deferred DAA treatment using a cost-effectiveness decision analysis model to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per quality-adjusted life year gained) from the societal perspective across a range of HCV(+) liver availability rates.

METHODS: A life-long decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes of three strategies: universal clopidogrel (75 mg daily), universal alternative P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel 10 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily), and LOF/GOF-guided therapy (LOF/GOF allele carriers receiving alternative P2Y12 inhibitor, wild-type patients receiving clopidogrel). Model outcomes included clinical event rates, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and direct medical costs from perspective of US healthcare provider. RESULTS: Base-case analysis found nonfatal myocardial infarction (5.62%) and stent thrombosis (1.2%) to be the lowest in universal alternative P2Y12 inhibitor arm, whereas nonfatal stroke (0.72%), cardiovascular death (2.42%), and major bleeding (2.73%) were lowest in LOF/GOF-guided group.

15932,Assessing the value of mepolizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Adding mepolizumab to standard treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and controller medications could decrease asthma exacerbations and use of long-term oral steroids in patients with severe disease and increased eosinophils; however, mepolizumab is costly and its cost effectiveness is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of mepolizumab. METHODS: A Markov model was used to determine the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for mepolizumab plus standard of care (SoC) and for SoC alone. The population, adults with severe eosinophilic asthma, was modeled for a lifetime time horizon. A responder scenario analysis was conducted to determine the cost effectiveness for a cohort able to achieve and maintain asthma control. RESULTS: Over a lifetime treatment horizon, 23.96 exacerbations were averted per patient receiving mepolizumab plus SoC. Avoidance of exacerbations and decrease in long-term oral steroid use resulted in more than $18,000 in cost offsets among those receiving mepolizumab, but treatment costs increased by more than $600,000. Treatment with mepolizumab plus SoC vs SoC alone resulted in a cost-effectiveness estimate of $386,000 per QALY. To achieve cost effectiveness of approximately $150,000 per QALY, mepolizumab would require a more than 60% price discount. At current pricing, treating a responder cohort yielded cost-effectiveness estimates near $160,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: The estimated cost effectiveness of mepolizumab exceeds value thresholds. Achieving these thresholds would require significant discounts from the current list price. Alternatively, treatment limited to responders improves the cost effectiveness toward, but remains still slightly above, these thresholds.

15933,Cost-effectiveness of primarily surgical versus primarily conservative treatment of acute and subacute radiculopathies due to intervertebral disc herniation from the Swiss perspective,"AIMS OF THE STUDY: To assess the cost-effectiveness of primarily surgical treatment (PST) versus primarily conservative treatment (PCT) in adults with intermediate severity, acute or subacute, lumbar radicular syndrome due to intervertebral disc herniation. METHODS: A decision analytic model from healthcare system and societal perspectives was used to compare outcomes and costs of PST with those of PCT (physiotherapy, epidural injection and medication). Treatment pathways and quality of life were obtained from published clinical trials. Costs were derived from Swiss health insurance claims data. Swiss clinical experts provided information on use of medication and physiotherapy. The main outcome of interest was incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained over a period of 2 years. Costs and QALYs gained were discounted from the second year, at a rate of 2% per year. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis from a healthcare system perspective, over 2 years, PST compared with PCT led to 0.0634 additional QALYs per person, at an additional net cost of CHF 7198 per person. The corresponding incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) amounted to CHF 113 396 per QALY gained. From a societal perspective the ICER was CHF 70 711 per QALY gained. ICERs were subject to substantial uncertainty because of limitations in available data. CONCLUSION: A PST approach, when compared with PCT, may be cost effective from a societal perspective based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100 000 per QALY gained. However, it is less likely to be cost effective from the perspective of the Swiss healthcare system.

METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate expected costs and outcomes (measured as quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs) for each strategy. Transition probabilities were estimated using published studies; utility weights were obtained from a sample of Colombian patients with hemophilia and costs were gathered using local data. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: The additional cost per QALY gained of primary prophylaxis compared with on-demand treatment was 105,081,022 Colombian pesos (COP) (55,204 USD), and thus not considered cost-effective according to a threshold of up to three times the current Colombian gross domestic product (GDP) per-capita. When primary prophylaxis was provided throughout life using recombinant FVIII (rFVIII), which is much costlier than FVIII, the additional cost per QALY gained reached 174,159,553 COP (91,494 USD). CONCLUSIONS: using a decision rule of up to three times the Colombian GDP per capita, primary prophylaxis (with either FVIII or rFVIII) would not be considered as cost-effective in this country. However, a final decision on providing or preventing patients from primary prophylaxis as a gold standard of care for severe hemophilia type A should also consider broader criteria than the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results itself.

15936,Cost-effectiveness of screening for ovarian cancer amongst postmenopausal women: a model-based economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) was the biggest ovarian cancer screening trial to date. A non-significant effect of screening on ovarian cancer was reported, but the authors noted a potential delayed effect of screening, and suggested the need for four years further follow-up. There are no UK-based cost-effectiveness analyses of ovarian cancer screening. Hence we assessed the lifetime outcomes associated with, and the cost-effectiveness of, screening for ovarian cancer in the UK, along with the value of further research. METHODS: We performed a model-based economic evaluation. Effectiveness data were taken from UKCTOCS, which considered strategies of multimodal screening (MMS), ultrasound screening (USS) and no screening. We conducted systematic reviews to identify the remaining model inputs, and performed a rigorous and transparent prospective evaluation of different methods for extrapolating the effect of screening on ovarian cancer mortality. We considered costs to the UK healthcare system and measured effectiveness using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We used value of information methods to estimate the value of further research. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, MMS and USS were estimated to be both more expensive and more effective than no screening. USS was dominated by MMS, being both more expensive and less effective. Compared with no screening, MMS cost on average pound419 more (95% confidence interval pound255 to pound578), and generated 0.047 more QALYs (0.002 to 0.088). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing MMS with no screening was pound8864 per QALY ( pound2600 to pound51,576). Alternative extrapolation methods increased the ICER, with the highest value being pound36,769 ( pound13,888 to dominated by no screening). Using the UKCTOCS trial horizon, both MMS and USS were dominated by no screening, as they produced fewer QALYs at a greater cost. The value of research into eliminating all uncertainty in long-term effectiveness was estimated to be worth up to pound20 million, or approximately pound5 million for four years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for ovarian cancer with MMS is both more effective and more expensive than not screening.

Although the incremental clinical benefits are modest, both treatments represent significant advances in the treatment of a high-mortality cancer. In this independent economic evaluation for the US, the aim was to estimate the comparative cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of these three regimens from the payer perspective. METHODS: In the absence of a direct treatment comparison in a single clinical trial, the Bucher indirect comparison method was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of each regimen. A Markov model evaluated life years (LY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained with NAB-P + GEM and FOLFIRINOX over GEM, expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) and cost-utility ratios (ICUR). All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%/year. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the model was assessed by probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: NAB-P + GEM was associated with differentials of +0.180 LY and +0.127 QALY gained over GEM at an incremental total cost of $25,965; yielding an ICER of $144,096/LY and ICUR of $204,369/QALY gained. FOLFIRINOX was associated with differentials of +0.368 LY and +0.249 QALY gained over GEM at an incremental total cost of $93,045; yielding an ICER of $253,162/LY and ICUR of $372,813/QALY gained. In indirect comparison, the overall survival hazard ratio (OS HR) for NAB-P + GEM vs FOLFIRINOX was 0.79 (95%CI = 0.59-1.05), indicating no superiority in OS of either regimen. FOLFIRINOX had an ICER of $358,067/LY and an ICUR of $547,480/QALY gained over NAB-P + GEM.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HLA-B*5801 testing according to race/ethnicity in the United States. METHODS: We determined the cost-effectiveness of universal testing for HLA-B*5801 compared to no testing prior to the initiation of allopurinol per US major race/ethnicity groups. Using US-specific data, SJS/TEN risks and HLA-B*5801 prevalences were modeled per race/ethnicity (i.e., 1/3846 and 0.7% among Caucasians and Hispanics, 1/735 and 3.8% among African Americans, and 1/336 and 7.4% among Asians, respectively). Those who tested positive for HLA-B*5801 received febuxostat. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over a lifetime. RESULTS: Compared to no testing, universal testing for HLA-B*5801 costs more and was more effective for all races/ethnicities. The ICERs varied substantially across racial/ethnic groups, following their HLA-B*5801 prevalences. HLA-B*5801 testing was cost-effective for African Americans (ICER $83,450) and Asians (ICER $64,190), but not for Caucasians or Hispanics (ICER $183,720), using accepted US willingness-to-pay threshold ($109,000/QALY).

15944,Cost-Utility of Video-Electroencephalography Monitoring Followed by Surgery in Adults with Drug-Resistant Focal Epilepsy in Thailand,"OBJECTIVES: This study assessed whether video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring followed by surgery was cost-effective in adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy under Thai health care context, as compared with continued medical treatment without VEEG. METHODS: The total cost (in Thai Baht, THB) and effectiveness (in quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were estimated over a lifetime horizon, using a decision tree and a Markov model. Data on short-term surgical outcomes, direct health care costs, and utilities were collected from Thai patients in a specialized hospital. Long-term outcomes and relative effectiveness of the surgery over medical treatment were derived, using systematic reviews of published literature. RESULTS: Seizure-free rates at years 1 and 2 after surgery were 79.4% and 77.8%, respectively. Costs of VEEG and surgery plus 1-year follow-up care were 216,782 THB, of which the VEEG and other necessary investigations were the main cost drivers (42.8%). On the basis of societal perspective, the total cost over a 40-year horizon accrued to 1,168,679 THB for the VEEG option, 64,939 THB higher than that for no VEEG. The VEEG option contributed to an additional 1.50 QALYs over no VEEG, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 43,251 THB (USD 1236) per 1 QALY gained. Changes in key parameters had a minimal impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Accounting for uncertainty, there was an 84% probability that the VEEG option was cost-effective on the basis of Thailand''s cost-effective threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of baseline testing for NS5A RAVs in EBR/GZR-treated patients compared without testing, and with current treatments for GT1a patients. METHODS: We simulated the course of treatment with EBR/GZR, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvir (3D) with or without RBV and natural history of disease of GT1a patients. Treatment-related data from clinical trials were used in a state-transition model of the natural history of chronic HCV GT1a infection and liver disease to project lifetime costs (US$2015) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Other clinical and economic inputs were estimated from published sources. We conducted base case and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: RAVs testing-guided treatment with EBR/GZR resulted in more QALYs than EBR/GZR without testing, 3D+RBV, or LDV/SOF8.

15960,"Costs, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic and open repair for rotator cuff tears: an economic evaluation alongside the UKUFF trial","AIMS: A trial-based comparison of the use of resources, costs and quality of life outcomes of arthroscopic and open surgical management for rotator cuff tears in the United Kingdom NHS was performed using data from the United Kingdom Rotator Cuff Study (UKUFF) randomised controlled trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data from 273 patients, healthcare-related use of resources, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated at 12 months and 24 months after surgery on an intention-to-treat basis with adjustment for covariates. Uncertainty about the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for arthroscopic versus open management at 24 months of follow-up was incorporated using bootstrapping. Multiple imputation methods were used to deal with missing data. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the arthroscopic and open groups in terms of total mean use and cost of resources or QALYs at any time post-operatively. Open management dominated arthroscopic management in 59.8% of bootstrapped cost and effect differences. The probability that arthroscopic management was cost-effective compared with open management at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per QALY gained was 20.9%. CONCLUSION: There was no significant overall difference in the use or cost of resources or quality of life between arthroscopic and open management in the trial. There was uncertainty about which strategy was most cost-effective.

15961,Long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune liver disease that mainly affects middle-aged women. Obeticholic acid (OCA), which was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for PBC treatment, has demonstrated positive effects on biochemical markers of liver function. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of OCA as a second-line treatment for PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA. We developed a mathematical model to simulate the lifetime course of PBC patients treated with OCA+UDCA versus UDCA alone. Efficacy data were derived from the phase 3 PBC OCA International Study of Efficacy trial, and the natural history of PBC was informed by published clinical studies. Model outcomes were validated using the PBC Global Study. We found that in comparison with UDCA, OCA+UDCA could decrease the 15-year cumulative incidences of decompensated cirrhosis from 12.2% to 4.5%, hepatocellular carcinoma from 9.1% to 4.0%, liver transplants from 4.5% to 1.2%, and liver-related deaths from 16.2% to 5.7% and increase 15-year transplant-free survival from 61.1% to 72.9%. The lifetime cost of PBC treatment would increase from $63,000 to $902,000 (1,330% increment). The discounted quality-adjusted life years with UDCA and OCA+UDCA were 10.74 and 11.78, respectively, and the corresponding costs were $142,300 and $633,900, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $473,400/quality-adjusted life year gained. The results were most sensitive to the cost of OCA. CONCLUSION: OCA is a promising new therapy to substantially improve the long-term outcomes of PBC patients, but at its current annual price of $69,350, it is not cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year; pricing below $18,450/year is needed to make OCA cost-effective.

15962,Laparoscopic Versus Open Cholecystectomy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis at Rwanda Military Hospital,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is first-line treatment for uncomplicated gallstone disease in high-income countries due to benefits such as shorter hospital stays, reduced morbidity, more rapid return to work, and lower mortality as well-being considered cost-effective. However, there persists a lack of uptake in low- and middle-income countries. Thus, there is a need to evaluate laparoscopic cholecystectomy in comparison with an open approach in these settings. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate laparoscopic and open cholecystectomies at Rwanda Military Hospital (RMH), a tertiary care referral hospital in Rwanda. Sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed to determine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy costs and effectiveness values were $2664.47 with 0.87 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and $2058.72 with 0.75 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for laparoscopic over open cholecystectomy was $4946.18. Results are sensitive to the initial laparoscopic equipment investment and number of cases performed annually but robust to other parameters. The laparoscopic intervention is more cost-effective with investment costs less than $91,979, greater than 65 cases annually, or at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds greater than $3975/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: At RMH, while laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be a more effective approach, it is also more expensive given the low caseload and high investment costs. At commonly accepted WTP thresholds, it is not cost-effective. However, as investment costs decrease and/or case volume increases, the laparoscopic approach may become favorable. Countries and hospitals should aspire to develop innovative, low-cost options in high volume to combat these barriers and provide laparoscopic surgery.",2016-01-21572,27905020,World J Surg,Allison Silverstein,2017,41 / 5,,No,27905020,"Allison Silverstein; Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri; Mussa R Gakwaya; Joseph Lule; Swagoto Mukhopadhyay; John G Meara; Mark G Shrime; Laparoscopic Versus Open Cholecystectomy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis at Rwanda Military Hospital, World J Surg, 2017 May; 41(5):0364-2313",QALY,Rwanda,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Open Cholecystectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,4946.18,United States,2014,5407.4
15963,Cost-effectiveness analysis of routine pneumococcal vaccination in the UK: a comparison of the PHiD-CV vaccine and the PCV-13 vaccine using a Markov model,"OBJECTIVES: In 2010, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) replaced the 7-valent vaccine (introduced in 2006) for vaccination against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), pneumonia and acute otitis media (AOM) in the UK. Using recent evidence on the impact of PCVs and epidemiological changes in the UK, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to compare the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) with PCV-13 in the ongoing national vaccination programme. DESIGN: CEA was based on a published Markov model. The base-case scenario accounted only for direct medical costs. Work days lost were considered in alternative scenarios. SETTING: Calculations were based on serotype and disease-specific vaccine efficacies, serotype distributions and UK incidence rates and medical costs. POPULATION: Health benefits and costs related to IPD, pneumonia and AOM were accumulated over the lifetime of a UK birth cohort. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination of infants at 2, 4 and 12 months with PHiD-CV or PCV-13, assuming complete coverage and adherence. OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was computed by dividing the difference in costs between the programmes by the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). RESULTS: Under our model assumptions, both vaccines had a similar impact on IPD and pneumonia, but PHiD-CV generated a greater reduction in AOM cases (161 918), AOM-related general practitioner consultations (31 070) and tympanostomy tube placements (2399). At price parity, PHiD-CV vaccination was dominant over PCV-13, saving 734 QALYs as well as pound3.68 million to the National Health Service (NHS). At the lower list price of PHiD-CV, the cost-savings would increase to pound45.77 million. CONCLUSIONS: This model projected that PHiD-CV would provide both incremental health benefits and cost-savings compared with PCV-13 at price parity. Using PHiD-CV could result in substantial budget savings to the NHS. These savings could be used to implement other life-saving interventions.",2016-01-21573,27903558,BMJ Open,Emmanuelle Delgleize,2016,6 / 11,e010776,No,27903558,"Emmanuelle Delgleize; Oscar Leeuwenkamp; Eleni Theodorou; Nicolas Van de Velde; Cost-effectiveness analysis of routine pneumococcal vaccination in the UK: a comparison of the PHiD-CV vaccine and the PCV-13 vaccine using a Markov model, BMJ Open , 2016 Nov 30; 6(11):2044-6055; e010776",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pneumococcal Non-Typeable Haemophilus influenzae Protein D Conjugate Vaccine (PHiD-CV) vs. Standard/Usual Care- 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-13),Not Stated,4 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-5.02,United Kingdom,2014,-9.04

The purpose of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of treating up to 10 brain metastases with SRS, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or SRS and immediate WBRT (SRS+WBRT). METHODS A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of SRS, WBRT, and SRS+WBRT in patients with 1 or 2-10 brain metastases. Transition probabilities were derived from the JLGK0901 study and modified according to the recurrence rates observed in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9508 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22952-26001 studies to simulate the outcomes for patients who receive WBRT. Costs are based on 2015 Medicare reimbursements. Health state utilities were prospectively collected using the Standard Gamble method. End points included cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was $100,000 per QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty with regard to the model assumptions. RESULTS In patients with 1 brain metastasis, the ICERs for SRS versus WBRT, SRS versus SRS+WBRT, and SRS+WBRT versus WBRT were $117,418, $51,348, and $746,997 per QALY gained, respectively. In patients with 2-10 brain metastases, the ICERs were $123,256, $58,903, and $821,042 per QALY gained, respectively. On the sensitivity analyses, the model was sensitive to the cost of SRS and the utilities associated with stable post-SRS and post-WBRT states. In patients with 2-10 brain metastases, SRS versus WBRT becomes cost-effective if the cost of SRS is reduced by $3512. SRS versus WBRT was also cost effective at a WTP of $200,000 per QALY on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

15968,"Cost-Effectiveness of the ""One4All"" HIV Linkage Intervention in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China","BACKGROUND: In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, an estimated 80% of newly-identified antiretroviral therapy (ART)-eligible patients are not engaged in ART. Delayed ART uptake ultimately translates into high rates of HIV morbidity, mortality, and transmission. To enhance HIV testing receipt and subsequent treatment uptake in Guangxi, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) executed a cluster-randomized trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a streamlined HIV testing algorithm (the One4All intervention) in 12 county-level hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the One4All intervention delivered at county hospitals in Guangxi, China, compared to the current standard of care (SOC). PERSPECTIVE: Health System. TIME HORIZON: 1-, 5-and 25-years. METHODS: We adapted a dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model to simulate HIV transmission and progression in Guangxi, China and identify the economic impact and health benefits of implementing the One4All intervention in all Guangxi hospitals. The One4All intervention algorithm entails rapid point-of-care HIV screening, CD4 and viral load testing of individuals presenting for HIV screening, with same-day results and linkage to counselling. We populated the model with data from the One4All trial (CTN-0056), China CDC HIV registry and published reports. Model outcomes were HIV incidence, mortality, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the One4All intervention compared to SOC. RESULTS: The One4All testing intervention was more costly than SOC (CNY 2,182 vs. CNY 846), but facilitated earlier ART access, resulting in delayed disease progression and mortality. Over a 25-year time horizon, we estimated that introducing One4All in Guangxi would result in 802 averted HIV cases and 1629 averted deaths at an ICER of CNY 11,678 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis revealed that One4All remained cost-effective at even minimal levels of effectiveness. Results were robust to changes to a range of parameters characterizing the HIV epidemic over time. CONCLUSIONS: The One4All HIV testing strategy was highly cost-effective by WHO standards, and should be prioritized for widespread implementation in Guangxi, China.

15970,Impact of old age on patient-report outcomes and cost utility for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery for degenerative spine disease,"PURPOSE: With growing older population and increasing rates of cervical spinal surgery, it is vital to understand the value of cervical surgery in this population. We set forth to determine the cost utility following anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative disease in older patients. METHODS: Patients undergoing ACDF for degenerative diseases were enrolled into prospective longitudinal registry. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were recorded at baseline, 1-year, and 2-year postoperatively. Two-year medical resource utilization, missed work, and health-state values [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] were assessed to compute cost per QALY gained. Patients were dichotomized based on age: <65 years (younger) and >/=65 years (older) to compare the cost utility in these age groups. RESULTS: Total 218 (87%) younger patients and 33 (13%) older patients who underwent ACDF were analyzed. Both the groups demonstrated a significant improvement in PROs 2-year following surgery. The older patients had a lower mean cumulative gain in QALYs compared to younger patients at 1 year (0.141 vs. 0.28, P = 0.05) and 2 years (0.211 vs. 0.424, P = 0.04).

15972,Cost-Effectiveness of Endovascular Femoropopliteal Intervention Using Drug-Coated Balloons Versus Standard Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty: Results From the IN.PACT SFA II Trial,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty versus standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). BACKGROUND: Recent trials have reported lower rates of target lesion revascularization with DCB angioplasty versus standard PTA. However, the cost-effectiveness of DCB angioplasty is unknown. METHODS: A prospective economic study was performed alongside the IN.PACT SFA II (IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Superficial Femoral Artery [SFA] and Proximal Popliteal Artery [PPA]) trial, which randomized 181 patients with femoropopliteal disease to the IN.PACT DCB versus standard PTA. Resource use data were collected over 2-year follow-up, and costs were assigned using resource-based accounting and billing data. Health utilities were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensions questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using a decision-analytic model on the basis of empirical data from the trial assuming identical long-term mortality. RESULTS: Initial costs were $1,129 per patient higher with DCB angioplasty than standard PTA, driven by higher costs for the DCB itself. Between discharge and 24 months, target limb-related costs were $1,212 per patient lower with DCB angioplasty such that discounted 2-year costs were similar for the 2 groups ($11,277 vs. $11,359, p = 0.97), whereas QALYs tended to be greater among patients treated with DCBs (1.53 +/- 0.44 vs. 1.47 +/- 0.42, p = 0.40). The probability that DCB angioplasty is cost-effective compared with standard PTA was 70% using a threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained and 79% at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with femoropopliteal disease, DCB angioplasty is associated with better 2-year outcomes and similar target limb-related costs compared with standard PTA.

15973,Quality of Life and Cost-Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Ablation versus Open Surgery for Benign Thyroid Nodules: a retrospective cohort study,"This study is to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and open thyroidectomy (OT) for benign thyroid nodules (BTNs) treatment. HRQoL and utility were assessed for 404 BTN patients immediately before treatments (RFA:OT = 137:267) and at 6-month visit. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from societal perspective in the China context. Resource use (hospitalization, sick leaves) was collected. We used the net monetary benefit approach and computed cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for RFA and OT. Sensitivity analyses of costs of RFA were performed. At 6-month visit, patients treated with RFA had significantly better HRQoL than patients treated with OT on general health (68.5 versus 66.7, P = 0.029), vitality (71.3 versus 67.5, P < 0.001) and mental health (80.9 versus 79.3, P = 0.038). RFA was more effective than OT in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 0.01QALY/patient) but more expensive (US$823/patient). The probability that RFA would be cost effective at a US$50,000/QALY threshold was 15.5% in China, and it would be increased to 88.4% when price of the RFA device was lowered by 30%. RFA exhibited a significant improvement of HRQoL relative to OT, but is unlikely to be cost effective at its current price in short time.",2016-01-21613,27883069,Sci Rep,Wen-Wen Yue,2016,6 /,37838,No,27883069,"Wen-Wen Yue; Xiao-Long Li; Hui-Xiong Xu; Feng Lu; Li-Ping Sun; Le-Hang Guo; Ya-Ping He; Dan Wang; Zhi-Qiang Yin; Quality of Life and Cost-Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Ablation versus Open Surgery for Benign Thyroid Nodules: a retrospective cohort study, Sci Rep, 2016; 6():2045-2322; 37838",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Open thyroidectomy (OT),Benign thyroid nodules (BTNs),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,547500,China,2014,97145.38
15974,Cost Effectiveness of Apixaban versus Warfarin or Aspirin for Stroke Prevention in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: A Greek Perspective,"BACKGROUND: Strokes attributed to atrial fibrillation (AF) represent a major cause of adult disability and a great burden to society and healthcare systems. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of apixaban, a direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC), versus warfarin or aspirin for patients with AF in the Greek healthcare setting. METHODS: We used a previously published Markov model to simulate clinical events for patients with AF treated with apixaban, the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin, or aspirin. Clinical events (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleed, clinically relevant non-major bleed, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular [CV] hospitalizations) were modeled using efficacy data from the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES clinical trials. The cohort''s baseline characteristics also sourced from these trials. Among VKA-suitable patients, 64.7% were men with a mean age of 70 years and average CHADS2 (cardiac failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke2) score of 2.1, whereas 58.5% of VKA-unsuitable patients were men with a mean age of 70 years and a CHADS2 score of 2.0. A panel of experts (cardiologists and internists) provided information on the resource use associated with the management of AF. Cost calculations reflect the local clinical setting and a third-party payer perspective (euro, discounted at 3%). RESULTS: Based on a simulation of 1000 VKA-suitable patients over a lifetime horizon, the use of apixaban versus warfarin resulted in 26 fewer strokes and systemic embolisms in total, 65 fewer bleeds, 41 fewer myocardial infarctions, and 29 fewer CV-related deaths, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro14,478/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). For VKA-unsuitable patients, apixaban versus aspirin resulted in 72 fewer strokes and systemic embolisms and 57 fewer CV-related deaths, with an ICER of euro7104/QALY.

15976,Toward More Efficient Surveillance of Barrett's Esophagus: Identification and Exclusion of Patients at Low Risk of Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance of Barrett''s esophagus (BE) is probably not cost-effective. A sub-population with BE at increased risk of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) who could be targeted for cost-effective surveillance was sought. METHODS: The outcome for BE surveillance from 2003 to 2012 in a structured program was reviewed. Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios for developing HGD or EAC were calculated. Risk stratification identified individuals who could be considered for exclusion from surveillance. A health-state transition Markov cohort model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of focusing on higher-risk individuals. RESULTS: During 2067 person-years of follow-up of 640 patients, 17 individuals progressed to HGD or EAC (annual IR 0.8%). Individuals with columnar-lined esophagus (CLE) >/=2 cm had an annual IR of 1.2% and >8-fold increased relative risk of HGD or EAC, compared to CLE <2 cm [IR-0.14% (IRR 8.6, 95% CIs 4.5-12.8)]. Limiting the surveillance cohort after the first endoscopy to individuals with CLE >/=2 cm, or dysplasia, followed by a further restriction after the second endoscopy-exclusion of patients without intestinal metaplasia-removed 296 (46%) patients, and 767 (37%) person-years from surveillance. Limiting surveillance to the remaining individuals reduced the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from US$60,858 to US$33,807 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Further restrictions were tested but failed to improve cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Based on stratification of risk, the number of patients requiring surveillance can be reduced by at least a third.

15977,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Tocilizumab in Comparison with Infliximab in Iranian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with Inadequate Response to tDMARDs: A Multistage Markov Model,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of two common treatment strategies in Iran, comparing infliximab plus methotrexate with tocilizumab plus methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with inadequate response to traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. METHODS: A multistage Markov decision model was applied to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a tocilizumab-containing regimen versus an infliximab-containing regimen over a 5-year time period. In the case of no response, we assumed that patients switched to the next treatment (adalimumab, rituximab, or supportive care) in sequence for each strategy. We considered major cost items, such as direct medical costs and direct nonmedical costs, from a payer (patients and third-party payers) perspective. A deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the model results over the uncertainty of key parameters. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the ICER of the tocilizumab-containing regimen was US $60,800 per quality-adjusted life-year as compared to the infliximab-containing regimen. In the sensitivity analysis, changes in the price of the drugs by generic substitution, in utility scores, and in discount rate did not change our overall conclusions. Among all inputs to the primary study and the sensitivity analyses, however, the price of tocilizumab had the most impact on the ICER. CONCLUSIONS: Although tocilizumab and methotrexate provide a larger gain in quality-adjusted life-years, their current price is quite high as compared with those of our other interventions. Therefore, a regimen containing tocilizumab is not cost-effective as compared with an infliximab-containing regimen for patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Iran.",2016-01-21619,27881258,Value Health Reg Issues,Amir Hashemi-Meshkini,2016,9 /,42-48,No,27881258,"Amir Hashemi-Meshkini; Shekoufeh Nikfar; Elizabeth Glaser; Ahmadreza Jamshidi; Seyed Alireza Hosseini; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Tocilizumab in Comparison with Infliximab in Iranian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with Inadequate Response to tDMARDs: A Multistage Markov Model, Value Health Reg Issues, 2016 May; 9():2212-1099; 42-48",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tocilizumab plus methotrexate vs. Infliximab plus methotrexate,Patients with rheumatoid arthritis with inadequate response to traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (tDMARDs),Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,60800,United States,2014,66469.44

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and prasugrel as compared with generic clopidogrel in patients with ACS in Singapore. METHODS: A Markov model simulating a typical cohort of 62-year-old patients with ACS was constructed from a patient''s perspective over a lifetime horizon. Treatment effects and adverse events, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, major bleeding related to non-coronary artery bypass grafting, dyspnea, or death, were estimated from pivotal trials comparing clopidogrel with ticagrelor and prasugrel, respectively. Costs were estimated from a tertiary hospital with more than 1500 admissions for ACS per year. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per life-year gained for ticagrelor was about three times more favorable than for prasugrel (Singapore dollar [SGD] 13,276 vs. SGD 38,809). The ICER per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for prasugrel and ticagrelor, however, was comparable at SGD 18,921 and SGD 18,647, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed that the ICER per QALY gained for prasugrel and ticagrelor was most sensitive to the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality and utility for dyspnea, respectively.

Bariatric surgery may be an effective but expensive treatment for NASH. Using a state-transition model, our analysis assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgery to manage NASH. We simulated the benefits and harms of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in patients defined by weight class (overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity) and fibrosis stage (F0-F3). Comparators included intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and no treatment. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Our results showed that surgery and ILI in obese patients (with F0-F3) increased QALYs by 0.678-2.152 and 0.452-0.618, respectively, compared with no treatment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for surgery in all F0-F3 patients with mild, moderate, or severe obesity were $48,836/QALY, $24,949/QALY, and $19,222/QALY, respectively. In overweight patients (with F0-F3), surgery increased QALYs by 0.050-0.824 and ILI increased QALYs by 0.031-0.164.

Our results showed that surgery and ILI in obese patients (with F0-F3) increased QALYs by 0.678-2.152 and 0.452-0.618, respectively, compared with no treatment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for surgery in all F0-F3 patients with mild, moderate, or severe obesity were $48,836/QALY, $24,949/QALY, and $19,222/QALY, respectively. In overweight patients (with F0-F3), surgery increased QALYs by 0.050-0.824 and ILI increased QALYs by 0.031-0.164. In overweight patients, it was cost-effective to reserve treatment only for F3 patients; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for providing surgery or ILI only to F3 patients were $30,484/QALY and $25,367/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was both effective and cost-effective for obese patients with NASH, regardless of fibrosis stage; in overweight patients, surgery increased QALYs for all patients regardless of fibrosis stage, but was cost-effective only for patients with F3 fibrosis; our results highlight the promise of bariatric surgery for treating NASH and underscore the need for clinical trials in this area.
