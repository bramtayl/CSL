27901,Cost effectiveness of tobacco control policies in Vietnam: the case of population-level interventions,"Background: Tobacco smoking is one of the leading public health problems in the world. It is also possible to prevent and/or reduce the harm from tobacco use through the use of cost-effective tobacco control measures. However, most of this evidence comes from developed countries and little research has been conducted on this issue in developing countries. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyse the cost effectiveness of four population-level tobacco control interventions in Vietnam. Methods: Four tobacco control interventions were evaluated: excise tax increase; graphic warning labels on cigarette packs; mass media campaigns; and smoking bans (in public or in work places). A multi-state life table model was constructed in Microsoft® Excel to examine the cost effectiveness of the tobacco control intervention options. A government perspective was adopted, with costing conducted using a bottom-up approach. Health improvement was considered in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. All assumptions were subject to sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Results: All the interventions fell within the definition of being very cost effective according to the threshold level suggested by the WHO (i.e. <GDP per capita). Graphic warning labels on cigarette packs was the most cost-effective option, followed by excise tax increases, mass media campaigns, public smoking bans and work place smoking bans. If the cost offset was included in the analysis, all interventions would provide cost savings to the government health sector. Conclusions: All four interventions to reduce the harm from tobacco use appear to be highly cost effective and should be considered as priorities in the context of Vietnam. The government may initially consider graphic warning labels and tax increase, followed by other interventions.",2011-99-07697,21506624,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Hideki Higashi,2011,9 / 3,183-96,Yes,21506624,"Hideki Higashi; Khoa D Truong; Jan J Barendregt; Phuong K Nguyen; Mai L Vuong; Thuy T Nguyen; Phuong T Hoang; Angela L Wallace; Tien V Tran; Cuong Q Le; Christopher M Doran; Cost effectiveness of tobacco control policies in Vietnam: the case of population-level interventions, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2011-May-01; 9(3):1179-1896; 183-96",DALY,Viet Nam,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Legislation / Regulation",Smoking ban vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,", 5 year for costs 10 year for DALYS",3.00,3.00,-348177,Vietnam,2006,-27.96
27902,Cost-effectiveness of new WHO recommendations for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in a resource-limited setting,"Objective: Nigeria has high rates of mother-to-child HIV transmission. We sought to determine whether new WHO recommendations for long-course antiretroviral therapy (ART) prophylaxis are cost-effective for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV compared to short-course strategies in Nigeria. Design: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from a health-system perspective, with a target population consisting of HIV-infected pregnant women in Nigeria. Methods: A decision-analysis model compared two strategies for PMTCT: intervention – long-course maternal triple ART [zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz (ZDV/3TC/EFV)] beginning at 14 weeks gestation through the end of breastfeeding, with infant ART, per new WHO guidelines (option B); and minimal standard of care (MSOC) in Nigeria – short-course dual ART (ZDV/3TC) from 34 weeks gestation to 1 week postpartum, with single-dose nevirapine for infant and mother at labor/delivery. The primary outcomes were expected costs, pediatric HIV cases, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) accrued with each strategy; cost-effectiveness was represented using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: If implemented at the level of antenatal coverage in Nigeria (58%), mother-to-child HIV transmission could be reduced to 16.1% with MSOC and 12.8% with the intervention. At current pregnancy rates, the intervention would prevent 7680 infant HIV cases and avert 230 400 DALYs annually, compared to MSOC. The average health-system cost of the intervention was US$ 401 per pregnancy compared to $293 per pregnancy with MSOC. The intervention was associated with an ICER of $113 per-DALY-averted compared to MSOC, and was highly cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of per-capita Nigerian GDP.

27903,Cost-effectiveness of Essential Newborn Care Training in Urban First-Level Facilities,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Newborn Care (ENC) training of health care providers in first-level facilities in the 2 largest cities in Zambia. METHODS: Data were extracted from a study in which the effectiveness of the ENC training was evaluated (including universal precautions and cleanliness, routine neonatal care, resuscitation, thermoregulation, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin care, care of the small infant, danger signs, and common illnesses). The costs to train an ENC instructor for each first-level delivery facility and the costs of salary/benefits for 2 coordinators responsible for maintenance of the program were recorded in 2005 US dollars. The incremental costs per life gained and per disability-adjusted life-year averted were calculated. SETTING: A 5-day ENC training-of-trainers was conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, to certify 18 college-trained midwives as ENC instructors. The instructors trained all clinic midwives working in their first-level facilities as part of a before-and-after study of the effect of ENC training on early neonatal mortality conducted from Oct 2004 to Nov 2006. RESULTS: All-cause 7-day (early) neonatal mortality decreased from 11.5 per 1000 to 6.8 per 1000 live births after ENC training of the clinic midwives (relative risk: 0.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.48-0.77; P < .001; 40 615 births). The intervention costs were $208 per life saved and $5.24 per disability-adjusted life-year averted.

27904,Cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination of people aged 50-64 years in Australia: results are inconclusive,"Influenza cost-effectiveness studies use models for influenza clinical evolution based on a range of assumptions. We explore the importance of these assumptions and its implications in policy decisions.An influenza model was constructed to measure the cost-effectiveness of universal influenza vaccination of people over 50 years compared to current policy to vaccinate people over 65 years in Australia using available epidemiological data. We explored two scenarios, one with an Australian estimate of influenza like illness incidence, and one with a European estimate. Further, we estimated uncertainty of model structure and various parameter assumptions, and compared with a previous study.The scenario and sensitivity analysis has shown the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the proposed compared to current policy varies from $112,000 to $6,000 per DALY. The model structure, parameter assumptions and limitations of existing epidemiological data lead to extensive unaccounted uncertainties in previous studies.The lack of influenza epidemiological data makes the influenza cost-effectiveness studies that compare the universal influenza vaccinations of people over 50 years to current policy unreliable.It is imperative to appraise unreliability of influenza cost-effectiveness studies in policy decisions.

27905,Cost effectiveness of targeted HIV prevention interventions for female sex workers in India,"Objective To ascertain the cost effectiveness of targeted interventions for female sex workers (FSW) under the National AIDS Control Programme in India. Methods A compartmental mathematical Markov state model was used over a 20-year time horizon (1995-2015) to estimate the cost effectiveness of FSW targeted interventions, with a health system perspective. The incremental costs and effects of FSW targeted interventions were compared against a baseline scenario of mass media for the general population alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was computed at a 3% discount rate using HIV infections averted and disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) as benefit measures. It was assumed that the transmission of the HIV virus moves from a high-risk group (FSW) to the client population and finally to the general population (partners of clients). Result Targeted interventions for FSW result in a reduction of 47% (1.6 million) prevalent and 36% (2.7 million) cumulative HIV cases, respectively, in 2015. Adult HIV prevalence in India, with and without (mass media only) FSW interventions, would be 0.25% and 0.48% in 2015. Indian government and development partners spend an average US$104 (INR4680) per HIV infection averted and US$10.7 (INR483) per DALY averted. Discounting at 3%, FSW targeted interventions cost US$105.5 (INR4748) and US$10.9 (INR490) per HIV case and DALY averted, respectively.

27908,A cost-benefit analysis of scaling up tuberculosis control in India,"Objectives: To measure the economic costs and benefits of scaling up tuberculosis (TB) control under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in India. Design: Modelling based on country-level programme and epidemiological data from 1997 to 2006. Results: The scale-up of TB control in India has resulted in a total health benefit of 29.2 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), including 1.3 million deaths averted. In 2006, the burden of TB measured in terms of DALYs lost would have been 1.8 times higher in the absence of the programme. The total gain in economic well-being from TB control is estimated at US$88.1 billion over the 1997-2006 10-year period. Total public expenditure on TB control over this period amounted to US$768 million, with the RNTCP accounting for US$299 million and other health sector costs accounting for US$469 million. The cost of TB control averaged just US$26 per DALY gained over 1997-2006 and generated a return of US$115 per dollar spent.

27910,"Projected impact and cost-effectiveness of a rotavirus vaccination program in India, 2008","BACKGROUND: To assess the value of rotavirus vaccination in India, we determined the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of a national rotavirus vaccination program. METHODS: We compared the national rotavirus disease and cost burden with and without a vaccination program and assessed the cost-effectiveness of vaccination. Model inputs included measures of disease and cost burden, vaccine performance, and vaccination coverage and cost. We measured the annual number of health-related events and treatment costs averted, as well as the cost-effectiveness in US dollars per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) and cost per death averted. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed by individually varying each model input. RESULTS: With use of a vaccine that has an estimated effectiveness of 50%, a rotavirus vaccination program in India would prevent ~44,000 deaths, ~293,000 hospitalizations, and ~328,000 outpatient visits annually, which would avert $20.6 million in medical treatment costs. Vaccination would be cost-saving at the GAVI Alliance price of $0.15 per dose. At $1.00 per dose, a vaccination program would cost $49.8 million, which would result in an expenditure of $21.41 per DALY averted or $662.94 per life saved. Even at $7.00 per dose, vaccination would be highly cost-effective. In sensitivity analyses, varying efficacy against severe rotavirus disease and vaccine price had the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: A national rotavirus vaccination program in India would prevent substantial rotavirus morbidity and mortality and would be highly cost-effective at a range of vaccine prices.

27911,An economic evaluation of setting up physical barriers in railway stations for preventing railway injury: evidence from Hong Kong,"Background Setting physical barriers, for example platform screen doors (PSDs), has been proven to be effective in preventing falls onto railway tracks, but its cost-effectiveness is not known. For economic evaluation of public health interventions, the importance of including non-health factors has been noted despite a lack of empirical studies. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PSDs, which are installed in part of the Hong Kong railway system, for preventing railway injuries. Methods Data on railway injuries from 1997 to 2007 were obtained from the railway operators. Poisson regression was used to examine the risk reduction. Two incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated to assess the cost-effectiveness based on (1) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) only and (2) DALYs with potential fare revenue and passengers' waiting time lost due to railway circulation collapse. Results The PSD installation has effectively reduced railway injuries (adjusted 5-year average percentage change: -68.8%, p<0.0001) with no apparent substitution effect to the other platforms observed. To be cost-effective, the cost of gaining a healthy life year (ICER) should not exceed three times the per capita GDP (US$74?700). The PSD installation would only be cost-effective if the loss of fare revenue and passengers' waiting time, in addition to DALY, were included (ICER: US$65?400), while the ICER based on DALY only would be US$77?900. Conclusion The challenges of complexity for economic evaluation appear in many community-based health interventions.

The target population was the overweight and obese adult population in Australia in 2003. We used a lifetime horizon for health effects and costs, and a health sector perspective for costs. We populated the model with data identified from Medline and Cochrane searches, Australian Bureau of Statistics published catalogues, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and Department of Health and Ageing.Outcome measures:Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and proportions of disease burden avoided. ICERs under AUS$50?000 per DALY are considered cost-effective.Results:The DASH and low-fat diet programs have ICERs of AUS$12?000 per DALY (95% uncertainty range: Cost-saving-68?000) and AUS$13?000 per DALY (Cost-saving-130?000), respectively. Neither intervention reduced the body weight-related disease burden at population level by more than 0.1%. The sensitivity analysis showed that when participants' costs for time and travel are included, the ICERs increase to AUS$75?000 per DALY for DASH and AUS$49?000 per DALY for the low-fat diet.

One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the base-case results. The uncertainty surrounding the estimates of cost effectiveness was illustrated through a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and cost-effectiveness plane. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, AMC can be regarded as cost saving because it is associated with higher DALYs gained and lower costs than no AMC. The probability that AMC is cost effective is above 0.96 at a threshold value of $150 and remains high over a wide range of threshold values. Thus, there is very little uncertainty surrounding the decision to adopt AMC for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV in men. The results were found to be sensitive to varying any of the following parameters: DALYs averted, discount, and circumcision efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: AMC is found to be cost saving. AMC may be seen as a promising new form of strategy for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV in men, but should never replace other known methods of HIV prevention and should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package.",2011-99-07254,21211488,Value Health,Olalekan A Uthman,2011,14 / 1,70-9,Yes,21211488,"Olalekan A Uthman; Taiwo Aderemi Popoola; Ismail Yahaya; Mubashir M B Uthman; Olatunde Aremu; The cost-utility analysis of adult male circumcision for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV in men in sub-Saharan Africa: a probabilistic decision model, Value Health, 2011-Jan; 14(1):1098-3015; 70-9",DALY,"Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Democratic Republic, Comoros, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe",Not Stated,Surgical,Circumcision for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,,3.00,3.00,-325.39,United States,2008,-391.15
27915,'Traffic-light' nutrition labelling and 'junk-food' tax: a modelled comparison of cost-effectiveness for obesity prevention,"Introduction:Cost-effectiveness analyses are important tools in efforts to prioritise interventions for obesity prevention. Modelling facilitates evaluation of multiple scenarios with varying assumptions. This study compares the cost-effectiveness of conservative scenarios for two commonly proposed policy-based interventions: front-of-pack 'traffic-light' nutrition labelling (traffic-light labelling) and a tax on unhealthy foods ('junk-food' tax).Methods:For traffic-light labelling, estimates of changes in energy intake were based on an assumed 10% shift in consumption towards healthier options in four food categories (breakfast cereals, pastries, sausages and preprepared meals) in 10% of adults. For the 'junk-food' tax, price elasticities were used to estimate a change in energy intake in response to a 10% price increase in seven food categories (including soft drinks, confectionery and snack foods). Changes in population weight and body mass index by sex were then estimated based on these changes in population energy intake, along with subsequent impacts on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Associated resource use was measured and costed using pathway analysis, based on a health sector perspective (with some industry costs included). Costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3%. The cost-effectiveness of each intervention was modelled for the 2003 Australian adult population.Results:Both interventions resulted in reduced mean weight (traffic-light labelling: 1.3?kg (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.2; 1.4); 'junk-food' tax: 1.6?kg (95% UI: 1.5; 1.7)); and DALYs averted (traffic-light labelling: 45?100 (95% UI: 37?700; 60?100); 'junk-food' tax: 559?000 (95% UI: 459?500; 676?000)). Cost outlays were AUD81 million (95% UI: 44.7; 108.0) for traffic-light labelling and AUD18 million (95% UI: 14.4; 21.6) for 'junk-food' tax. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed both interventions were 'dominant' (effective and cost-saving).Conclusion:Policy-based population-wide interventions such as traffic-light nutrition labelling and taxes on unhealthy foods are likely to offer excellent 'value for money' as obesity prevention measures.International Journal of Obesity advance online publication, 16 November 2010; doi:10.1038/ijo.2010.228.",2010-XX-07025,21079620,Int J Obes (Lond),Kerry McBrien,2010,/,,No,21079620,"Kerry McBrien; 'Traffic-light' nutrition labelling and 'junk-food' tax: a modelled comparison of cost-effectiveness for obesity prevention, Int J Obes (Lond), 2010-Nov-16; ():0307-0565",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Other,"Front-of-pack 'traffic-light' nutrition labeling (TLL) (as well as a 1-year social marketing campaign to educate population on interpretation of the labels) in order to prevent obesity vs. Standard/Usual Care- mandatory ""back-of-pack"" nutrition labeling",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,-10088.7,Australia,2003,-9257.52

27917,Do indicated preventive interventions for depression represent good value for money?,"OBJECTIVE: The prevention of depression is of growing interest to researchers and policy makers. However, the question of whether interventions designed to prevent depression provide value for money at a population level remains largely unanswered. The current study assesses the cost-effectiveness of two indicated interventions designed to prevent depression: a brief psychological intervention based on bibliotherapy and a more comprehensive group-based psychological intervention following opportunistic screening for sub-syndromal depression in general practice. METHOD: Economic modelling using a cost utility framework was used to assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the two interventions within the Australian population context, modelled as add-ons to current practice. The perspective was the health sector and outcomes were measured using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Uncertainty was measured using probabilistic uncertainty testing and important model assumptions were tested using univariate sensitivity testing. RESULTS: The brief bibliotherapy intervention had an ICER of AU$8600 per DALY and the group-based psychological intervention had an ICER of AU$20 000 per DALY. The majority of the uncertainty simulations for both interventions fell below the cost-effectiveness threshold value of $50 000 per DALY. Extensive sensitivity testing showed that the results were robust to the assumptions made in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Following screening in general practice, both psychological interventions, particularly brief bibliotherapy, appear to be good value for money and worthy of further evaluation under routine care circumstances.

If more resources become available, greatest population health gains can be achieved via individual treatment of systolic blood pressure and the absolute risk approach to CVD prevention.

27950,"Needle and syringe programs in Yunnan, China yield health and financial return","As a harm reduction strategy in response to HIV epidemics needle and syringes programs (NSPs) were initiated throughout China in 2002. The effectiveness of NSPs in reducing the spread of infection in such an established epidemic is unknown. In this study we use data from Yunnan province, the province most affected by HIV in China, to (1) estimate the population benefits in terms of infections prevented due to the programs; (2) calculate the cost-effectiveness of NSPs. We developed a mathematical transmission model, informed by detailed behavioral and program data, which accurately reflected the unique HIV epidemiology among Yunnan injecting drug users (IDUs) in the presence of NSPs. We then used the model to estimate the likely epidemiological and clinical outcomes without NSPs and conducted a health economics analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness of the program. It is estimated that NSPs in Yunnan have averted approximately 16-20% (5,200-7,500 infections) of the expected HIV cases since 2002 and led to gains of 1,300-1,900 DALYs. The total $1.04 million spending on NSPs from 2002 to 2008 has resulted in an estimated cost-saving over this period of $1.38-$1.97 million due to the prevention of HIV and the associated costs of care and management.

27952,Global eradication of measles: An epidemiologic and economic evaluation,"Background. Measles remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. Due to the success of the measles mortality reduction and elimination efforts thus far, the WHO has raised the question of whether global eradication of measles is economically feasible. Methods. The cost-effectiveness of various measles mortality reduction and eradication scenarios was evaluated vis-à-vis the current mortality reduction goal in six countries and globally. Data collection on costs of measles vaccination were conducted in six countries in four regions: Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, Tajikistan, and Uganda. The number of measles cases and deaths were projected from 2010 to 2050 using a dynamic, age-structured compartmental model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were then calculated for each scenario vis a vis the baseline. Results. Measles eradication by 2020 was the found to be the most cost-effective scenario, both in the six countries and globally. Eradicating measles by 2020 is projected to cost an additional discounted $7.8 billion and avert a discounted 346 million DALYs between 2010 and 2050. Conclusions. In conclusion, the study found that, compared to the baseline, reaching measles eradication by 2020 would be the most cost-effective measles mortality reduction scenario, both for the six countries and on a global basis. © The Author 2011.

27956,Global eradication of measles: An epidemiologic and economic evaluation,"Background. Measles remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. Due to the success of the measles mortality reduction and elimination efforts thus far, the WHO has raised the question of whether global eradication of measles is economically feasible. Methods. The cost-effectiveness of various measles mortality reduction and eradication scenarios was evaluated vis-à-vis the current mortality reduction goal in six countries and globally. Data collection on costs of measles vaccination were conducted in six countries in four regions: Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, Tajikistan, and Uganda. The number of measles cases and deaths were projected from 2010 to 2050 using a dynamic, age-structured compartmental model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were then calculated for each scenario vis a vis the baseline. Results. Measles eradication by 2020 was the found to be the most cost-effective scenario, both in the six countries and globally. Eradicating measles by 2020 is projected to cost an additional discounted $7.8 billion and avert a discounted 346 million DALYs between 2010 and 2050. Conclusions.

27969,Global eradication of measles: An epidemiologic and economic evaluation,"Background. Measles remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. Due to the success of the measles mortality reduction and elimination efforts thus far, the WHO has raised the question of whether global eradication of measles is economically feasible. Methods. The cost-effectiveness of various measles mortality reduction and eradication scenarios was evaluated vis-à-vis the current mortality reduction goal in six countries and globally. Data collection on costs of measles vaccination were conducted in six countries in four regions: Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, Tajikistan, and Uganda. The number of measles cases and deaths were projected from 2010 to 2050 using a dynamic, age-structured compartmental model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were then calculated for each scenario vis a vis the baseline. Results. Measles eradication by 2020 was the found to be the most cost-effective scenario, both in the six countries and globally. Eradicating measles by 2020 is projected to cost an additional discounted $7.8 billion and avert a discounted 346 million DALYs between 2010 and 2050. Conclusions.

27970,Cost-effectiveness analysis of routine pneumococcal vaccination in the UK: a comparison of the PHiD-CV vaccine and the PCV-13 vaccine using a Markov model,"OBJECTIVES: In 2010, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) replaced the 7-valent vaccine (introduced in 2006) for vaccination against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), pneumonia and acute otitis media (AOM) in the UK. Using recent evidence on the impact of PCVs and epidemiological changes in the UK, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to compare the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) with PCV-13 in the ongoing national vaccination programme. DESIGN: CEA was based on a published Markov model. The base-case scenario accounted only for direct medical costs. Work days lost were considered in alternative scenarios. SETTING: Calculations were based on serotype and disease-specific vaccine efficacies, serotype distributions and UK incidence rates and medical costs. POPULATION: Health benefits and costs related to IPD, pneumonia and AOM were accumulated over the lifetime of a UK birth cohort. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination of infants at 2, 4 and 12 months with PHiD-CV or PCV-13, assuming complete coverage and adherence. OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was computed by dividing the difference in costs between the programmes by the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). RESULTS: Under our model assumptions, both vaccines had a similar impact on IPD and pneumonia, but PHiD-CV generated a greater reduction in AOM cases (161 918), AOM-related general practitioner consultations (31 070) and tympanostomy tube placements (2399). At price parity, PHiD-CV vaccination was dominant over PCV-13, saving 734 QALYs as well as pound3.68 million to the National Health Service (NHS). At the lower list price of PHiD-CV, the cost-savings would increase to pound45.77 million. CONCLUSIONS: This model projected that PHiD-CV would provide both incremental health benefits and cost-savings compared with PCV-13 at price parity. Using PHiD-CV could result in substantial budget savings to the NHS. These savings could be used to implement other life-saving interventions.",2016-01-21573,27903558,BMJ Open,Emmanuelle Delgleize,2016,6 / 11,e010776,No,27903558,"Emmanuelle Delgleize; Oscar Leeuwenkamp; Eleni Theodorou; Nicolas Van de Velde; Cost-effectiveness analysis of routine pneumococcal vaccination in the UK: a comparison of the PHiD-CV vaccine and the PCV-13 vaccine using a Markov model, BMJ Open , 2016 Nov 30; 6(11):2044-6055; e010776",DALY,Gambia,Not Stated,Immunization,Pneumococcal vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,30,United States,2005,39.76
27984,Taking ART to Scale: Determinants of the Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Antiretroviral Therapy in 45 Clinical Sites in Zambia,"We estimated the unit costs and cost-effectiveness of a government ART program in 45 sites in Zambia supported by the Centre for Infectious Disease Research Zambia (CIDRZ).We estimated per person-year costs at the facility level, and support costs incurred above the facility level and used multiple regression to estimate variation in these costs. To estimate ART effectiveness, we compared mortality in this Zambian population to that of a cohort of rural Ugandan HIV patients receiving co-trimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis. We used micro-costing techniques to estimate incremental unit costs, and calculated cost-effectiveness ratios with a computer model which projected results to 10 years.The program cost $69.7 million for 125,436 person-years of ART, or $556 per ART-year. Compared to CTX prophylaxis alone, the program averted 33.3 deaths or 244.5 disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 person-years of ART. In the base-case analysis, the net cost per DALY averted was $833 compared to CTX alone. More than two-thirds of the variation in average incremental total and on-site cost per patient-year of treatment is explained by eight determinants, including the complexity of the patient-case load, the degree of adherence among the patients, and institutional characteristics including, experience, scale, scope, setting and sector.The 45 sites exhibited substantial variation in unit costs and cost-effectiveness and are in the mid-range of cost-effectiveness when compared to other ART programs studied in southern Africa. Early treatment initiation, large scale, and hospital setting, are associated with statistically significantly lower costs, while others (rural location, private sector) are associated with shifting cost from on- to off-site. This study shows that ART programs can be significantly less costly or more cost-effective when they exploit economies of scale and scope, and initiate patients at higher CD4 counts.",2012-99-10217,23284843,PLoS One,Elliot Marseille,2012,7 / 12,e51993,No,23284843,"Elliot Marseille; Mark J Giganti; Albert Mwango; Angela Chisembele-Taylor; Lloyd Mulenga; Mead Over; James G Kahn; Jeffrey S A Stringer; Taking ART to Scale: Determinants of the Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Antiretroviral Therapy in 45 Clinical Sites in Zambia, PLoS One , ; 7(12):1932-6203; e51993",DALY,Zambia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Government Antiretroviral (ART) program vs. Ugandan co-trimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis,"(1) CD4 count ,200 cells/uL, (2) WHO clinical stage 4 disease, or (3) CD4 count ,350 cells/uL and WHO clinical stage 3 disease",Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,833,United States,2010,988.69
27985,Population health impact and cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis diagnosis with Xpert MTB/RIF: a dynamic simulation and economic evaluation,"The Xpert MTB/RIF test enables rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance. The World Health Organization recommends Xpert for initial diagnosis in individuals suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB, and many countries are moving quickly toward adopting Xpert. As roll-out proceeds, it is essential to understand the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies based on Xpert.We evaluated potential health and economic consequences of implementing Xpert in five southern African countries--Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland--where drug resistance and TB-HIV coinfection are prevalent. Using a calibrated, dynamic mathematical model, we compared the status quo diagnostic algorithm, emphasizing sputum smear, against an algorithm incorporating Xpert for initial diagnosis. Results were projected over 10- and 20-y time periods starting from 2012. Compared to status quo, implementation of Xpert would avert 132,000 (95% CI: 55,000-284,000) TB cases and 182,000 (97,000-302,000) TB deaths in southern Africa over the 10 y following introduction, and would reduce prevalence by 28% (14%-40%) by 2022, with more modest reductions in incidence. Health system costs are projected to increase substantially with Xpert, by US$460 million (294-699 million) over 10 y. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV represents a substantial fraction of these additional costs, because of improved survival in TB/HIV-infected populations through better TB case-finding and treatment. Costs for treating MDR-TB are also expected to rise significantly with Xpert scale-up. Relative to status quo, Xpert has an estimated cost-effectiveness of US$959 (633-1,485) per disability-adjusted life-year averted over 10 y. Across countries, cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from US$792 (482-1,785) in Swaziland to US$1,257 (767-2,276) in Botswana. Assessing outcomes over a 10-y period focuses on the near-term consequences of Xpert adoption, but the cost-effectiveness results are conservative, with cost-effectiveness ratios assessed over a 20-y time horizon approximately 20% lower than the 10-y values.Introduction of Xpert could substantially change TB morbidity and mortality through improved case-finding and treatment, with more limited impact on long-term transmission dynamics. Despite extant uncertainty about TB natural history and intervention impact in southern Africa, adoption of Xpert evidently offers reasonable value for its cost, based on conventional benchmarks for cost-effectiveness.

27996,Ex-ante Evaluation of Biotechnology Innovations: the Case of Folate Biofortified Rice in China,"In order to valorize novel biotechnology innovations, there is a need to evaluate ex-ante their market potential. A case in point is biofortification, i.e. the enhancement of the micronutrient content of staple crops through conventional or genetic breeding techniques. In a recent article in Nature Biotechnology, for example, De Steur et al. (2010) demonstrated the large potential consumer health benefits of folate biofortified rice as a means to reduce folate deficiency and Neural-Tube Defects. By focusing on a Chinese high-risk region of Neural-Tube Defects, the current study defines the potential cost-effectiveness of this genetically modified crop where the need to improve folate intake levels is highest. Building on the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) approach, both the potential health impacts and costs of its implementation are measured and benchmarked against similar innovations. The results show that this transgenic crop could be a highly cost-effective product innovation (US$ 120.34 - US$ 40.1 per DALY saved) to alleviate the large health burden of folate deficiency and reduce the prevalence of neural-tube birth defects. When compared with other biofortified crops and target regions, folate biofortified rice in China has a relatively high health impact and moderate cost-effectiveness. This research further supports the need for, and importance of ex-ante evaluation studies in order to adequately market and, thus, valorize biotechnology innovations. Although the cost-effectiveness analysis enables to illustrate the market potential of innovative agricultural biotechnology research, further research is required to address policy issues on transgenic biofortification, such as biosafety regulatory requirements.",2012-99-09941,23072390,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Hans De Steur,2013,13 / 15,2751-60,No,23072390,"Hans De Steur; Dieter Blancquaert; Xavier Gellynck; Willy Lambert; Dominique Van Der Straeten; Ex-ante Evaluation of Biotechnology Innovations: the Case of Folate Biofortified Rice in China, Curr Pharm Biotechnol, Dec/1/2012; 13(15):1873-4316; 2751-60",DALY,China,Not Stated,"Environmental, Other",Folate biofortified rice to reduce folate deficiency and neural-tube defects vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,120.34,United States,2011,138.46
27997,"Costs of illness due to cholera, costs of immunization and cost-effectiveness of an oral cholera mass vaccination campaign in Zanzibar","The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) as a supplementary tool to conventional prevention of cholera. Dukoral, a killed whole-cell two-dose OCV, was used in a mass vaccination campaign in 2009 in Zanzibar. Public and private costs of illness (COI) due to endemic cholera and costs of the mass vaccination campaign were estimated to assess the cost-effectiveness of OCV for this particular campaign from both the health care provider and the societal perspective.Public and private COI were obtained from interviews with local experts, with patients from three outbreaks and from reports and record review. Cost data for the vaccination campaign were collected based on actual expenditure and planned budget data. A static cohort of 50,000 individuals was examined, including herd protection. Primary outcome measures were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per death, per case and per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses were conducted. The ICER was evaluated with regard to WHO criteria for cost-effectiveness. Base-case ICERs were USD 750,000 per death averted, USD 6,000 per case averted and USD 30,000 per DALY averted, without differences between the health care provider and the societal perspective. Threshold analyses using Shanchol and assuming high incidence and case-fatality rate indicated that the purchase price per course would have to be as low as USD 1.2 to render the mass vaccination campaign cost-effective from a health care provider perspective (societal perspective: USD 1.3).Based on empirical and site-specific cost and effectiveness data from Zanzibar, the 2009 mass vaccination campaign was cost-ineffective mainly due to the relatively high OCV purchase price and a relatively low incidence. However, mass vaccination campaigns in Zanzibar to control endemic cholera may meet criteria for cost-effectiveness under certain circumstances, especially in high-incidence areas and at OCV prices below USD 1.3.",2012-99-09927,23056660,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,Christian Schaetti,2012,6 / 10,e1844,No,23056660,"Christian Schaetti; Mitchell G Weiss; Said M Ali; Claire-Lise Chaignat; Ahmed M Khatib; Rita Reyburn; Radboud J Duintjer Tebbens; Raymond Hutubessy; Costs of illness due to cholera, costs of immunization and cost-effectiveness of an oral cholera mass vaccination campaign in Zanzibar, PLoS Negl Trop Dis, ; 6(10):1935-2735; e1844",DALY,Tanzania,Not Stated,Immunization,Dokoral oral cholera mass vaccination campaign vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,30000,United States,2009,36191.1
27998,"The potential impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men and transwomen in Lima, Peru: a mathematical modelling study","HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the use of antiretroviral drugs by uninfected individuals to prevent HIV infection, has demonstrated effectiveness in preventing acquisition in a high-risk population of men who have sex with men (MSM). Consequently, there is a need to understand if and how PrEP can be used cost-effectively to prevent HIV infection in such populations.We developed a mathematical model representing the HIV epidemic among MSM and transwomen (male-to-female transgender individuals) in Lima, Peru, as a test case. PrEP effectiveness in the model is assumed to result from the combination of a ""conditional efficacy"" parameter and an adherence parameter. Annual operating costs from a health provider perspective were based on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention interim guidelines for PrEP use. The model was used to investigate the population-level impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of PrEP under a range of implementation scenarios. The epidemiological impact of PrEP is largely driven by programme characteristics. For a modest PrEP coverage of 5%, over 8% of infections could be averted in a programme prioritising those at higher risk and attaining the adherence levels of the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative study. Across all scenarios, the highest estimated cost per disability-adjusted life year averted (uniform strategy for a coverage level of 20%, US$1,036-US$4,254) is below the World Health Organization recommended threshold for cost-effective interventions, while only certain optimistic scenarios (low coverage of 5% and some or high prioritisation) are likely to be cost-effective using the World Bank threshold. The impact of PrEP is reduced if those on PrEP decrease condom use, but only extreme behaviour changes among non-adherers (over 80% reduction in condom use) and a low PrEP conditional efficacy (40%) would adversely impact the epidemic. However, PrEP will not arrest HIV transmission in isolation because of its incomplete effectiveness and dependence on adherence, and because the high cost of programmes limits the coverage levels that could potentially be attained.A strategic PrEP intervention could be a cost-effective addition to existing HIV prevention strategies for MSM populations. However, despite being cost-effective, a substantial expenditure would be required to generate significant reductions in incidence.

27999,Orthopaedic trauma care in Haiti: a cost-effectiveness analysis of an innovative surgical residency program,"In an effort to sustainably strengthen orthopaedic trauma care in Haiti, a 2-year Orthopaedic Trauma Care Specialist (OTCS) program for Haitian physicians has been developed. The program will provide focused training in orthopaedic trauma surgery and fracture care utilizing a train-the-trainer approach. The purpose of this analysis was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the program relative to its potential to decrease disability in the Haitian population.Using established methodology originally outlined in the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease project, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for the OTCS program in Haiti. Costs and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted were estimated per fellow trained in the OTCS program by using a 20-year career time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to simultaneously test the joint uncertainty of the cost and averted DALY estimates. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $1200 per DALY averted, equal to the gross domestic product per capita in Haiti, was selected on the basis of World Health Organization's definition of highly cost-effective health interventions.The OTCS program results in an incremental cost of $1,542,544 ? $109,134 and 12,213 ? 2,983 DALYs averted per fellow trained. The cost-effectiveness ratio of $133.97 ? $34.71 per DALY averted is well below the threshold of $1200 per DALY averted. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis suggests that implementing the OTCS program is the economically preferred strategy with more than 95% probability at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200 per DALY averted and across the entire range of potential variable inputs.The current economic analysis suggests the OTCS program to be a highly cost-effective intervention.

28000,Is international volunteer surgery for cleft lip and cleft palate a cost-effective and justifiable intervention? A case study from East Asia,"Although surgery provided by international volunteers is increasingly common in the developing world, there have been few assessments of the cost-effectiveness of these activities. In this context, this study covered 15 years of experience of one international nongovernmental organization, Smile for Children, in providing cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (CP) surgical services in Vietnam.We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the program and its contributions to building local capacity. To assess the cost-effectiveness of CL/CP surgery performed during Smile for Children's missions in Vietnam, we analyzed the data from four annual missions, from 2007 to 2010. According to the 2003 World Health Organization Guide to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, we calculated cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted with and without age weighting. For the data from the 2010 mission, we repeated the same calculation but with and without considering opportunity cost for labor.The discounted cost per DALY averted averaged $68, ranging from $52 to $79 depending on the year of the mission. The average discounted cost per DALY averted with age weighting was $56 (range $43-$65). For the calculation that takes into account the volunteers' possible income loss as the labor cost of the mission in 2010, the cost per DALY averted without age weighting increased by 28%, from $76 to $97; and the cost per DALY averted with age weighting increased by 27%, from $63 to $80. Under all of these varying assumptions, the CL/CP program operated by Smile for Children is a cost-effective intervention using international criteria for cost-effectiveness.The contribution of the international volunteer surgical team to building in-country capacity is notable. It was achieved primarily through training Vietnamese surgeons during the mission trips and through sending these surgeons to Korea for training.
