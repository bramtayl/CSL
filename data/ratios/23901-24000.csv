23901,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cinacalcet for haemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in China: evaluation based on the EVOLVE trial,"OBJECTIVE: As the cost-effectiveness evaluation of cinacalcet and conventional therapy in China has not been reported, the objective of this study was to make a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of cinacalcet specific to the Chinese healthcare setting in patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) undergoing dialysis. DESIGNS: Data from Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events trial were used for this analysis. A semi-Markov model was constructed to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs in cinacalcet plus conventional therapy (cinacalcet strategy) compared with conventional therapy (standard strategy), in patients with moderate-to-severe SHPT undergoing dialysis. Treatment effect estimates from the unadjusted intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and covariate-adjusted ITT analysis were used as the main analyses. Model sensitivity to variations in individual inputs and overall decision uncertainty were assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analyses. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as measured by cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: The ICER for cinacalcet strategy was US$44 400 per QALY gained using the covariate-adjusted ITT analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a 46.2% chance of the ICER being below a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$26 508. Treatment effects from unadjusted ITT analysis yielded an ICER of US$87 210 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the treatment effect on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence does not support the cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet strategy in patients with moderate-to-severe SHPT undergoing dialysis when applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$26 508 per QALY, whether it is using the treatment effect from covariate-adjusted ITT analysis or unadjusted ITT analysis.

23902,Cost-effectiveness of 2-dose human papillomavirus vaccination for 12-year-old girls in Zhejiang Province: implications for China's expanded program on immunization,"BACKGROUND: The high cost and insufficient supply of HPV vaccines have substantially slowed their implementation in lower-income countries. This study aimed to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of two doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination (bivalent 16/18 vaccine; 2vHPV) compared to a no-vaccination scenario and a three-dose scenario in one province in China. METHODS: A static Markov model was used to model a lifetime cohort of 100,000 girls aged 12 years at the start of vaccination. A two-dose vaccination schedule was assumed to be non-inferior to a three-dose schedule in terms of vaccine efficacy, and both vaccination schemes were assumed to provide lifelong protection. Incremental costs, health effects and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to measure the outcomes when comparing the different strategies. RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (Chinese yuan per quality-adjusted life year) of the two-dose vaccination strategy is 12,472, and the 2-dose strategy is calculated to be cost saving relative to the 3-dose vaccination strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing the 2vHPV vaccine would be highly cost effective at a per-dose vaccine price of CNY 500, which has implications for cervical cancer control in China and other resource-limited countries.",2020-01-33532,0,Front.

23903,Cost-Utility of Intermediate Obstetric Critical Care in a Resource-Limited Setting: A Value-Based Analysis,"Background: Sierra Leone faces among the highest maternal mortality rates worldwide. Despite this burden, the role of life-saving critical care interventions in low-resource settings remains scarcely explored. A value-based approach may be used to question whether it is sustainable and useful to start and run an obstetric intermediate critical care facility in a resource-poor referral hospital. We also aimed to investigate whether patient outcomes in terms of quality of life justified the allocated resources. Objective: To explore the value-based dimension performing a cost-utility analysis with regard to the implementation and one-year operation of the HDU. The primary endopoint was the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients admitted to the HDU, against direct and indirect costs. Secondary endpoints included key procedures or treatments performed during the HDU stay. Methods: The study was conducted from October 2, 2017 to October 1, 2018 in the obstetric high dependency unit (HDU) of Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH) in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Findings: 523 patients (median age 25 years, IQR 21-30) were admitted to HDU. The total 1 year investment and operation costs for the HDU amounted to 120,082 - resulting in 230 of extra cost per admitted patient. The overall cost per QALY gained was of 10; this value is much lower than the WHO threshold defining high cost effectiveness of an intervention, i.e. three times the current Sierra Leone annual per capita GDP of 1416. Conclusion: With an additional cost per QALY of only 10.0, the implementation and one-year running of the case studied obstetric HDU can be considered a highly cost-effective frugal innovation in limited resource contexts. The evidences provided by this study allow a precise and novel insight to policy makers and clinicians useful to prioritize interventions in critical care and thus address maternal mortality in a high burden scenario.

23904,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin plus warfarin for the treatment of hospitalised acute deep vein thrombosis in China,"OBJECTIVE: Limited economic evaluation data for rivaroxaban compared with standard of care (SoC) exists in China. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with current SoC (enoxaparin overlapped with warfarin) for the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in China. METHODS: A Markov model was adapted from a payer''s perspective to evaluate the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients with DVT treated with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin/warfarin. Clinical data from the EINSTEIN-DVT trial were obtained to estimate the transition probabilities. Data on Chinese health resource use, unit costs and utility parameters were collected from previously published literature and used to estimate the total costs and QALYs. The time horizon was set at 5 years and a 3-month cycle length was used in the model. A 5% discount rate was applied to the projected costs. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the impact of uncertainty on results. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban therapy resulted in an increase of 0.008 QALYs and was associated with lower total costs compared with enoxaparin/warfarin (US$4744.4 vs US$5572.4, respectively), demonstrating it to be a cost-saving treatment strategy. The results were mainly sensitive to length of hospitalisation due to DVT on enoxaparin/warfarin, cost per day of hospitalisation and the difference in length of stay of rivaroxaban-treated and enoxaparin/warfarin-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban therapy resulted in a cost saving compared with enoxaparin/warfarin for the anticoagulation treatment of patients with hospitalised acute DVT in China.

23905,Long-Term Functional Patency and Cost-Effectiveness of Arteriovenous Fistula Creation under Regional Anesthesia: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Regional anesthesia improves short-term blood flow through arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). We previously demonstrated that, compared with local anesthesia, regional anesthesia improves primary AVF patency at 3 months. METHODS: To study the effects of regional versus local anesthesia on longer-term AVF patency, we performed an observer-blinded randomized controlled trial at three university hospitals in Glasgow, United Kingdom. We randomly assigned 126 patients undergoing primary radiocephalic or brachiocephalic AVF creation to receive regional anesthesia (brachial plexus block; 0.5% L-bupivacaine and 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine) or local anesthesia (0.5% L-bupivacaine and 1% lidocaine). This report includes findings on primary, functional, and secondary patency at 12 months; reinterventions; and additional access procedures (primary outcome measures were previously reported). We analyzed data by intention to treat, and also performed cost-effectiveness analyses. RESULTS: At 12 months, we found higher primary patency among patients receiving regional versus local anesthesia (50 of 63 [79%] versus 37 of 63 [59%] patients; odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.6 to 3.8; P=0.02) as well as higher functional patency (43 of 63 [68%] versus 31 of 63 [49%] patients; OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.7; P=0.008). In 12 months, 21 revisional procedures, 53 new AVFs, and 50 temporary dialysis catheters were required. Regional anesthesia resulted in net savings of 195.10 (US$237.36) per patient at 1 year, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately 12,900 (US$15,694.20) per quality-adjusted life years over a 5-year time horizon. Results were robust after extensive sensitivity and scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with local anesthesia, regional anesthesia significantly improved both primary and functional AVF patency at 1 year and is cost-effective.

23906,Cost Effectiveness of External Beam Radiation Therapy versus Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoablation for Palliation of Uncomplicated Bone Metastases,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of incorporating cryoablation in the treatment regimens for uncomplicated bone metastases using radiation therapy (RT) in single-fraction RT (SFRT) or multiple-fraction RT (MFRT) regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using 1-month cycles over a lifetime horizon to compare the cost effectiveness of multiple strategies, including RT followed by RT (RT-RT) for recurrent pain, RT followed by cryoablation (RT-ablation), and cryoablation followed by RT (ablation-RT). RT-RT consisted of 8 Gy in 1 fraction/8 Gy in 1 fraction (SFRT-SFRT) and 30 Gy in 10 fractions/20 Gy in 5 fractions (MFRT-MFRT). Probabilities and utilities were extracted from a search of the medical literature. Costs were calculated from a payer perspective using 2017 Medicare reimbursement in an outpatient setting. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using strategies evaluated for willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). To account for model uncertainty, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, SFRT-ablation was cost effective relative to SFRT-SFRT at $96,387/QALY. MFRT-ablation was cost effective relative to MFRT-MFRT at $85,576/QALY. Ablation-SFRT and ablation-MFRT were not cost effective with ICERs >$100,000/QALY. In one-way sensitivity analyses, results were highly sensitive to variation in multiple model parameters, including median survival (base: 9 months), with SFRT-SFRT favored at median survival <=8.7 months. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis examining SFRT-based regimens showed that SFRT-ablation was preferred in 36.9% of simulations at WTP of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Cryoablation is a potentially cost-effective alternative to reirradiation with RT for recurrent of pain following RT; however, no strategy incorporating initial cryoablation was cost effective.

23910,Cost-utility analysis of standard dressing compared with incisional negative-pressure wound therapy among patients with closed surgical wounds following major trauma to the lower limb,"AIMS: To compare the cost-utility of standard dressing with incisional negative-pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) in adults with closed surgical wounds associated with major trauma to the lower limbs. METHODS: A within-trial economic evaluation was conducted from the UK NHS and personal social services (PSS) perspective based on data collected from the Wound Healing in Surgery for Trauma (WHiST) multicentre randomized clinical trial. Health resource utilization was collected over a six-month post-randomization period using trial case report forms and participant-completed questionnaires. Cost-utility was reported in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates while uncertainty was handled using confidence ellipses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The incremental cost of standard dressing versus iNPWT over six months was 2,037 (95% confidence interval (CI) 349 to 3,724). There was an insignificant increment in QALYs gained in the iNPWT group (0.005, 95% CI -0.018 to 0.028). The probability of iNPWT being cost-effective at 20,000 per QALY was 1.9%. The results remained robust in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: The within-trial economic evaluation suggests that iNPWT is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to standard dressing in adults with closed surgical wounds to their lower limbs.

23911,Cost effectiveness of testing HIV infected individuals for TB in a low TB/HIV setting,"OBJECTIVES: Guidelines recommend routine testing for latent TB infection (LTBI) in people living with HIV. However there are few cost-effectiveness studies to justify this in contemporary high resource, low TB/HIV incidence settings. We sought to assess the uptake, yield and cost-effectiveness of testing for latent and active TB. METHODS: Adults attending an ambulatory HIV clinic in London, UK were prospectively recruited by stratified selection and tested for TB infection using symptom questionnaires, chest radiograph (CXR), tuberculin skin test (TST), T-Spot.TB and induced sputum. From this, 30 testing strategies were compared in a cost-effectiveness model including probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: 219 subjects were assessed; 95% were using antiretroviral therapy (ART). Smear negative, culture positive TB was present in 0.9% asymptomatic subjects, LTBI in 9%. Only strategies testing those from subSaharan Africa with a TST or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) with or without CXR, or testing those from countries with a TB incidence of >40/100,000 with TST alone were cost-effective using a 30,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis in an adult HIV cohort with high ART usage suggests there is limited benefit beyond routine testing for latent TB in people from high and possibly medium TB incidence settings.

METHODS: Adults attending an ambulatory HIV clinic in London, UK were prospectively recruited by stratified selection and tested for TB infection using symptom questionnaires, chest radiograph (CXR), tuberculin skin test (TST), T-Spot.TB and induced sputum. From this, 30 testing strategies were compared in a cost-effectiveness model including probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: 219 subjects were assessed; 95% were using antiretroviral therapy (ART). Smear negative, culture positive TB was present in 0.9% asymptomatic subjects, LTBI in 9%. Only strategies testing those from subSaharan Africa with a TST or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) with or without CXR, or testing those from countries with a TB incidence of >40/100,000 with TST alone were cost-effective using a 30,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis in an adult HIV cohort with high ART usage suggests there is limited benefit beyond routine testing for latent TB in people from high and possibly medium TB incidence settings.

Only strategies testing those from subSaharan Africa with a TST or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) with or without CXR, or testing those from countries with a TB incidence of >40/100,000 with TST alone were cost-effective using a 30,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis in an adult HIV cohort with high ART usage suggests there is limited benefit beyond routine testing for latent TB in people from high and possibly medium TB incidence settings.

23927,"Cost effectiveness of benralizumab for severe, uncontrolled oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma in Sweden","Aim: We investigated cost effectiveness of benralizumab vs. standard of care (SOC) plus oral corticosteroids (OCS) for patients with severe, eosinophilic OCS-dependent asthma in Sweden. Materials and methods: A three-state, cohort-based Markov model of data from three Phase III benralizumab clinical trials (ZONDA [NCT02075255], SIROCCO [NCT01928771], and CALIMA [NCT01914757]) was used to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of benralizumab vs. SOC plus OCS. Health outcomes were estimated in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model included costs and disutilities associated with extrapolated OCS-related adverse events. Patients with severe asthma were defined as those receiving OCS >=5 mg/day. Results: Benralizumab demonstrated a cost-effectiveness ratio vs. SOC plus OCS of 2018 Swedish Kronor (SEK) 366,855 (34,127) per QALY gained, based on increases of 1.33 QALYs and SEK 488,742 (45,344) per patient. Benralizumab treatment costs contributed most to incremental costs. The probability of benralizumab''s being cost-effective with willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds between SEK 429,972 (40,000) and SEK 752,452 (70,000) ranged from 75% to 99%. Limitations: Potential limitations of these analyses include the use of combined data from three different clinical trials, a one-way sensitivity analysis that did not include mortality and transition estimates, and Observational & Pragmatic Research Institute (OPRI) data from the UK as a proxy of the Swedish health care system. Conclusions: The results of these analyses demonstrate that benralizumab has a high probability of being cost-effective compared with SOC plus OCS for a subgroup of patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma receiving regular OCS treatment and may support clinicians, payers and patients in making treatment decisions.",2020-01-33549,0,J Med Econ,M Andersson,2020,23 / 7,877-884,Yes,Not Stated,"M Andersson; C Janson; T Kristensen; A Szende; S Golam; Cost effectiveness of benralizumab for severe, uncontrolled oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma in Sweden, J Med Econ, 2020; 23(7):1369-6998; 877-884",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,benralizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- High-dosage inhaled corticosteroids + additional controllers + oral corticosteroids,oral corticosteroids >=5mg/day,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,366855,Sweden,2018,43488.62
23928,Cost-effectiveness of sequential urate lowering therapies for the management of gout in Singapore,"Aims: Allopurinol is the most common urate lowering therapy (ULT) used to treat gout but may cause life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) in a small number of patients. Risk of SCAR is increased for patients with the HLA-B*58:01 genotype. When alternative ULT is required, febuxostat or probenecid are recommended. The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis of sequential ULT treatment strategies for gout, including strategies with and without HLA-B*58:01 genotyping prior to treatment initiation, with a view to inform optimal gout management in Singapore. Materials and methods: A Markov model was developed from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Reflecting local practice, 12 different treatment strategies containing at least one ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid) were evaluated in adults with gout. Response rates (SUA < 6mg/dL) were derived from an in-house network meta-analysis and from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a 30-year time horizon, with costs and benefits discounted at 3% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties. Results: Sequential treatment of allopurinol 300 mg/day-allopurinol 600 mg/day-probenecid (""standard of care"") was cost-effective compared to no ULT, with an ICER of SGD1,584/QALY.

Materials and methods: A Markov model was developed from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Reflecting local practice, 12 different treatment strategies containing at least one ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid) were evaluated in adults with gout. Response rates (SUA < 6mg/dL) were derived from an in-house network meta-analysis and from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a 30-year time horizon, with costs and benefits discounted at 3% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties. Results: Sequential treatment of allopurinol 300 mg/day-allopurinol 600 mg/day-probenecid (""standard of care"") was cost-effective compared to no ULT, with an ICER of SGD1,584/QALY. Allopurinol300-allopurinol600-probenecid-febuxostat sequence compared to allopurinol300-allopurinol600-probenecid had an ICER of SGD11,400/QALY. All other treatment strategies were dominated by preceding strategies. Treatment strategies incorporating HLA-B*58:01 genotyping before ULT use were dominated by the corresponding non-genotyping strategy. Conclusions: Current standard of care (allopurinol300-allopurinol 600-probenecid) for gout is cost-effective compared with no ULT in the local context.

23939,Cost-Effectiveness of Follow-Up for Subsolid Pulmonary Nodules in High-Risk Patients,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a number of follow-up guidelines and variants for subsolid pulmonary nodules. METHODS: We used a simulation model informed by data from the literature and the National Lung Screening Trial to simulate patients with ground-glass nodules (GGNs) detected at baseline computed tomography undergoing follow-up. The nodules were allowed to grow and develop solid components over time. We tested the guidelines generated by varying follow-up recommendations for low-risk nodules, that is, pure GGNs or those stable over time. For each guideline, we computed average US costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient and identified the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of those on the efficient frontier. In addition, we compared the costs and effects of the most recently released version of the Lung Computed Tomography Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS), version 1.1, with those of the previous version, 1.0. Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses of our results by varying several relevant parameters. RESULTS: Relative to the no follow-up scenario, the follow-up guideline system that was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY and had the greatest QALY assigned low-risk nodules a 2-year follow-up interval and stopped follow-up after 2 years for GGNs and after 5 years for part-solid nodules; this strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $99,970. Lung-RADS version 1.1 was found to be less costly but no less effective than Lung-RADS version 1.0. These findings were essentially stable under a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Ceasing follow-up for low-risk subsolid nodules after 2 to 5 years of stability is more cost-effective than perpetual follow-up.

23947,Health economic assessment of a rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis program compared with post-exposure prophylaxis alone in high-risk age groups in the Philippines,"OBJECTIVES: Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal and accounts for 200-300 deaths annually in the Philippines. Available rabies vaccines can be administered either in pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). After exposure, PrEP-immunized individuals require fewer doses of PEP and no rabies immunoglobulin. METHODS: A static decision-tree model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness of a PrEP+PEP program vs PEP alone. Philippines-specific data for people seeking medical advice at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine between July 2015 and June 2016 were used in the model, together with data from published literature. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, in a cohort of 1 million 5-year-old children in the Philippines, PrEP+PEP was expected to prevent 297 deaths compared with PEP alone. From both payer and societal perspectives, the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 36 035 (US$759; 2016 US$ conversion) and 18 663 (US$393) Philippine Pesos (PHP) - quality-adjusted life-years gained - respectively, which are both below the willingness-to-pay threshold of PHP140 255 (US$2 953). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a universal PrEP program targeting 5-year-olds would be cost-effective in the Philippines. Copyright © 2020 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A.

Available rabies vaccines can be administered either in pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). After exposure, PrEP-immunized individuals require fewer doses of PEP and no rabies immunoglobulin. METHODS: A static decision-tree model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness of a PrEP+PEP program vs PEP alone. Philippines-specific data for people seeking medical advice at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine between July 2015 and June 2016 were used in the model, together with data from published literature. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, in a cohort of 1 million 5-year-old children in the Philippines, PrEP+PEP was expected to prevent 297 deaths compared with PEP alone. From both payer and societal perspectives, the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 36 035 (US$759; 2016 US$ conversion) and 18 663 (US$393) Philippine Pesos (PHP) - quality-adjusted life-years gained - respectively, which are both below the willingness-to-pay threshold of PHP140 255 (US$2 953). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a universal PrEP program targeting 5-year-olds would be cost-effective in the Philippines. Copyright © 2020 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A.

23949,Utility of routine evaluations for rejection in patients greater than 2 years after heart transplantation,"AIMS: Guidelines support routine surveillance testing for rejection for at least 5 years after heart transplant (HT). In patients greater than 2 years post-HT, we examined which clinical characteristics predict continuation of routine surveillance studies, outcomes following discontinuation of routine surveillance, and the cost-effectiveness of different surveillance strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively identified subjects older than 18 who underwent a first HT at our centre from 2007 to 2016 and who survived >=760 days (n = 217) post-HT. The clinical context surrounding all endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) and gene expression profiles (GEPs) was reviewed to determine if studies were performed routinely or were triggered by a change in clinical status. Subjects were categorized as following a test-based surveillance (n = 159) or a signs/symptoms surveillance (n = 53) strategy based on treating cardiologist intent to continue routine studies after the second post-transplant year. A Markov model was constructed to compare two test-based surveillance strategies to a baseline strategy of discontinuing routine studies. One thousand twenty studies were performed; 835 were routine. Significant rejection was absent in 99.0% of routine EMBs and 99.8% of routine GEPs. The treating cardiologist''s practice duration, patient age, and immunosuppressive regimen predicted surveillance strategy. There were no differences in outcomes between groups. Routine surveillance EMBs cost more and were marginally less effective than a strategy of discontinuing routine studies after 2 years; surveillance GEPs had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1.67 million/quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: Acute asymptomatic rejection is rare after the second post-transplant year. Obtaining surveillance studies beyond the second post-transplant year is not cost-effective.

23950,A 3i hip fracture liaison service with nurse and physician co-management is cost-effective when implemented as a standard clinical program,"A hip fracture liaison service that was implemented in 2 hospitals in Alberta, Canada, co-managed by a nurse and physician, was cost-effective and improved initiation of osteoporosis medication following hip fracture. PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION: To determine cost-effectiveness of a 3i hip fracture liaison service (H-FLS) with 12-month follow-up, co-managed by a nurse and physician, when implemented into standard practice. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis compared those receiving the H-FLS to a simulated usual care group using a decision analytic model that incorporated Markov processes. We estimated incremental costs and effectiveness (based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained) using a lifetime horizon and a healthcare payer perspective. The H-FLS program provided data regarding population at risk, treatment rates, persistence, and intervention costs. We also performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred fifty-two patients were included in the H-FLS between June 2015 and March 2018; 69% were female; the average age was 80 +/- 11 years. Anti-absorptive treatment following fracture was initiated in 59.6% (95% CI: 55.7-63.5) H-FLS patients relative to 20.9% (95% CI: 13.3-28.5%) receiving usual care (from our published work). Based on modeled cohort simulation cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), every 1000 H-FLS patients would experience 12 fewer hip fractures and 37 fewer total fragility fractures than patients receiving usual care. Over the study horizon, the H-FLS led to only a $54 incremental cost/patient with a modest gain of 8 QALYs/1000 patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6750/QALY gained was less than the $27,000 cost-effectiveness threshold. Eliminating the 9-month follow-up resulted in incremental savings of $218/patient while also reducing 6-month follow-ups increased cost-savings to $378/patient. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that the H-FLS would either be cost-saving (60%) or cost-effective (40%). CONCLUSION: A H-FLS implemented into standard practice significantly improved anti-absorptive medication use; a cohort simulation cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) suggested that the H-FLS was cost-effective with potential to become cost-savings.",2020-01-33568,0,Arch.

23951,Quantifying and Describing the Natural History and Costs of Alzheimer's Disease and Effects of Hypothetical Interventions,"BACKGROUND: A long-term horizon is necessary when the socioeconomic consequences and the potential effects of interventions in Alzheimer''s disease (AD) are estimated. OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the potential societal costs of AD across the disease continuum and to illustrate the potential cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention with disease modifying treatment (DMT). METHODS: Based on the Swedish dementia registry, a Markov model was used to simulate a virtual cohort of 100,000 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (AD-MCI) in Sweden for 40 years starting at the age of 60. A simulated hypothetical intervention assumed a 25% reduction in progression rate during AD-MCI and mild AD-dementia. A comprehensive set of sensitivity analyses was included. RESULTS: The cumulative risk to develop dementia was 96%. The mean simulated survival was 19.0 years. The net present value for a person year with dementia was 252,843 SEK (about 29,500 US$). The cost effectiveness model illustrated how the hypothetical scenario of a 25% reduction in progression to AD-dementia would require 41 AD-MCI patients to be treated to prevent one case of AD-dementia (2,447 avoided AD-dementia cases of 100,000 with AD-MCI). Most scenarios illustrated hypothetical cost effectiveness (based on a willingness to pay level of 600,000 SEK (70,000 US$) per gained QALY), but not cost savings. DISCUSSION: Lifetime societal costs of AD are substantial. A future DMT may be potentially cost-effective given assumed treatment effects and costs, but cost savings are unlikely.",2020-01-33571,0,J.

23952,Cost-effectiveness of second curettage for treatment of low-risk non-metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia,"OBJECTIVE: Low-risk non-metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) has been treated with single agent chemotherapy, but second curettage is emerging as an alternative strategy with reported cure rates of 40%. We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of second curettage as the first line treatment of low-risk GTN. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was created using TreeAge software to compare costs and outcomes for women with WHO staged low-risk GTN undergoing treatment with 5-day methotrexate (MTX), biweekly pulsed actinomycin-D, or second curettage. Probabilities were derived from the literature. Outcomes of interest included side effects from chemotherapy, need for additional agents, hemorrhage, uterine perforation, and cure rates. Utilities were applied to discounted life expectancy at a rate of 3% to generate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were then performed in order to assess the robustness of our assumptions. RESULTS: Of the three treatment arms, MTX was associated with the lowest cost and had similar QALYs to the other studied modalities. Second curettage was associated with 49 additional cures when applied to a theoretic cohort of 1000 women, as well as an additional 83 hemorrhages and 17 uterine perforations. Sensitivity analysis on the cure rate of second curettage revealed that second curettage was not cost-effective over MTX unless its probability of cure was 98%. CONCLUSION: Our study found 5-day MTX was the cost-effective strategy for treatment of women with low-risk, non-metastatic GTN when compared to second curettage and actinomycin-D.

23954,Cost-effectiveness Evaluation of Laparoscopic Versus Robotic Minimally Invasive Colectomy,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of open, laparoscopic, and robotic colectomy. BACKGROUND: The use of robotic-assisted colon surgery is increasing. Robotic technology is more expensive and whether a robotically assisted approach is cost-effective remains to be determined. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to evaluate the 1-year costs and quality-adjusted time between robotic, laparoscopic, and open colectomy. Model inputs were derived from available literature for costs, quality of life (QOL), and outcomes. Results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effect of clinically reasonable variations in the inputs on our results. RESULTS: Open colectomy cost more and achieved lower QOL than robotic and laparoscopic approaches. From the societal perspective, robotic colectomy costs $745 more per case than laparoscopy, resulting in an ICER of $2,322,715/QALY because of minimal differences in QOL. From the healthcare sector perspective, robotics cost $1339 more per case with an ICER of $4,174,849/QALY. In both models, laparoscopic colectomy was more frequently cost-effective across a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses suggest robotic colectomy becomes cost-effective at $100,000/QALY if robotic disposable instrument costs decrease below $1341 per case, robotic operating room time falls below 172 minutes, or robotic hernia rate is less than 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic and robotic colectomy are more cost-effective than open resection. Robotics can surpass laparoscopy in cost-effectiveness by achieving certain thresholds in QOL, instrument costs, and postoperative outcomes.

23958,No differences in cost-effectiveness and short-term functional outcomes between cemented and uncemented total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding optimal fixation of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), however cost has not been addressed as profoundly. Therefore, the current study primarily aimed to compare costs and cost-effectiveness 1 year after cemented or uncemented TKA. A secondary objective was to compare short-term functional outcomes between both groups. METHODS: A posthoc prospective observational multicenter cohort study of 60 cemented and 50 uncemented Low Contact Stress (LCS) knee systems. Outcome was evaluated using the EuroQol5D-3 L (EQ5D) index, in order to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Total costs were calculated considering direct costs within the hospital setting (inpatient cost) as well as direct and indirect costs outside the hospital. Cost-effectiveness (total costs per QALY), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) were compared between cemented and uncemented cases at 1 year after surgery. HealthBASKET project, a micro-costing approach, represents the Dutch costs and situation and was used to calculate hospital stay. (In) direct costs outside the healthcare (medical cost and productivity cost) were determined using two validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Median costs per QALY were similar between cemented and uncemented TKA patients (16,269 and 17,727 respectively; p = 0.50). Median OKS (44 and 42; p = 0.79), EQ5D (0.88 and 0.90; p = 0.82) and NRS for pain (1.0 and 1.0; p = 0.48) and satisfaction (9.0 and 9.0; p = 0.15) were also comparable between both groups.

23959,Cost-effectiveness analysis of genetic diagnostic strategies for Lynch syndrome in Italy,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes that predispose individuals to different malignancies, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer. Current guidelines recommended testing for LS in individuals with newly diagnosed CRC to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in relatives. Economic evaluations in support of such approach, however, are not available in Italy. We developed a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of LS screening from the perspective of the Italian National Health System. Three testing strategies: the sequencing of all MMR genes without prior tumor analysis (Strategy 1), a sequential IHC and MS-MLPA analysis (Strategy 2), and an age-targeted strategy with a revised Bethesda criteria assessment before IHC and methylation-specific MLPA for patients >= than 70 years old (Strategy 3) were analyzed and compared to the ""no testing"" strategy. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in relatives after colonoscopy, aspirin prophylaxis and an intensive gynecological surveillance were estimated through a Markov model. Assuming a CRC incidence rate of 0.09% and a share of patients affected by LS equal to 2.81%, the number of detected pathogenic variants among CRC cases ranges, in a given year, between 910 and 1167 depending on the testing strategy employed. The testing strategies investigated, provided one-time to the entire eligible population (CRC patients), were associated with an overall cost ranging between 1,753,059.93-10,388,000.00. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the Markov model ranged from 941.24 /QALY to 1,681.93 /QALY, thus supporting that ""universal testing"" versus ""no testing"" is cost-effective, but not necessarily in comparison with age-targeted strategies.

23960,Cost-effectiveness analysis of genetic diagnostic strategies for Lynch syndrome in Italy,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes that predispose individuals to different malignancies, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer. Current guidelines recommended testing for LS in individuals with newly diagnosed CRC to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in relatives. Economic evaluations in support of such approach, however, are not available in Italy. We developed a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of LS screening from the perspective of the Italian National Health System. Three testing strategies: the sequencing of all MMR genes without prior tumor analysis (Strategy 1), a sequential IHC and MS-MLPA analysis (Strategy 2), and an age-targeted strategy with a revised Bethesda criteria assessment before IHC and methylation-specific MLPA for patients >= than 70 years old (Strategy 3) were analyzed and compared to the ""no testing"" strategy. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in relatives after colonoscopy, aspirin prophylaxis and an intensive gynecological surveillance were estimated through a Markov model. Assuming a CRC incidence rate of 0.09% and a share of patients affected by LS equal to 2.81%, the number of detected pathogenic variants among CRC cases ranges, in a given year, between 910 and 1167 depending on the testing strategy employed. The testing strategies investigated, provided one-time to the entire eligible population (CRC patients), were associated with an overall cost ranging between 1,753,059.93-10,388,000.00.

The current analysis investigates the cost-effectiveness of novel oral regimens compared with that of pegylated interferon alpha with ribavirin (PR) therapies in adolescents in the context of the United States and China. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to measure the economic and health outcomes of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LS) for genotypes 1 and 4, sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SR) for genotype 2, and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir/ribavirin (LSR) for genotype 3 HCV infection compared with the outcomes of PR treatment. Clinical costs and utility inputs were gathered from published sources. Lifetime discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to measure the economic and health outcomes of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LS) for genotypes 1 and 4, sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SR) for genotype 2, and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir/ribavirin (LSR) for genotype 3 HCV infection compared with the outcomes of PR treatment. Clinical costs and utility inputs were gathered from published sources. Lifetime discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured. The uncertainty was facilitated by 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the United States, the ICERs of LS strategy were $14,699 and $14,946/QALY for genotypes 1 and 4 HCV infection, respectively; the ICER of SR strategy for genotype 2 was $42,472/QALY; and the ICER of LSR for genotype 3 was $49,409/QALY in comparison with the PR strategy. In Chinese adolescents, LS for genotypes 1 and 4, SR for genotype 2, and LSR for genotype 3 were the dominant alternatives to the PR strategy. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses.

23974,Long-term clinical and economic outcomes of a short-term physical activity program in knee osteoarthritis patients,"OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) in the US knee osteoarthritis (OA) population is low, despite well-established health benefits. PA program implementation is often stymied by sustainability concerns. We sought to establish parameters that would make a short-term (3-year efficacy) PA program a cost-effective component of long-term OA care. METHOD: Using a validated computer microsimulation (Osteoarthritis Policy Model), we examined the long-term clinical (e.g., comorbidities averted), quality of life (QoL), and economic impacts of a 3-year PA program, based upon the SPARKS (Studying Physical Activity Rewards after Knee Surgery) Trial, for inactive knee OA patients. We determined the cost, efficacy, and impact of PA on QoL and medical costs that would make a PA program a cost-effective addition to OA care. RESULTS: Among the 14 million with knee OA in the US, >4 million are inactive. Participation of 10% in the modeled PA program could save 200 cases of cardiovascular disease, 400 cases of diabetes, and 6,800 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The program had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $16,100/QALY. Tripling PA program cost ($860/year) raised the ICER to $108,300/QALY; varying QoL benefits from PA yielded ICERs of $8,800/QALY-$99,900/QALY; varying background cost savings from PA did not qualitatively impact ICERs. Offering the PA program to any adults with knee OA (not only inactive) yielded $31,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: A PA program with 3-year efficacy in the knee OA population carried favorable long-term clinical and economic benefits. These results offer justification for policymakers and payers considering a PA intervention incorporated into knee OA care. Copyright © 2020 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Analysis of data from the multicentre, randomised controlled WARRIOR trial","OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of a reduced imaging follow-up protocol of distal radius fractures compared with usual care. DESIGN: An economical evaluation conducted alongside a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT). SETTING: Four level-one trauma centres in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 341 patients participated (usual care (n=172), reduced imaging (n=169)). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to usual care (routine radiography at 1, 2, 6 and 12 weeks) or a reduced imaging strategy (radiographs at 6 and 12 weeks only for a clinical indication). OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional outcome was assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the EuroQol-5Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L). Costs were measured using self-reported questionnaires and medical records, and analysed from a societal perspective. Multiple imputation, seemingly unrelated regression analysis and bootstrapping were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Clinical overall outcomes of both groups were comparable. The difference in DASH was -2.03 (95% CI -4.83 to 0.77) and the difference in QALYs was 0.025 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.06). Patients in the reduced imaging group received on average 3.3 radiographs (SD: 1.9) compared with 4.2 (SD: 1.9) in the usual care group. Costs for radiographic imaging were significantly lower in the reduced imaging group than in the usual care group (-48 per patient, 95% CI -68 to -27). There was no difference in total costs between groups (-401 per patient, 95% CI -2453 to 1251). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for QALYs was -15 872; the ICER for the DASH was 198. The probability of reduced imaging being cost effective compared with usual care ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 at a willingness to pay of 20 000/QALY to 80 000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a reduced imaging strategy in the follow-up of distal radius fractures has a high probability of being cost effective for QALYs, without decreasing functional outcome. We, therefore, recommend imaging only when clinically indicated. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The Netherlands trial register (NL4477). Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

23977,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stress Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Stable Chest Pain Syndromes,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare, using results from the multicenter SPINS (Stress CMR Perfusion Imaging in the United States) study, the incremental cost-effectiveness of a stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-first strategy against 4 other clinical strategies for patients with stable symptoms suspicious for myocardial ischemia: 1) immediate x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) with selective fractional flow reserve for all patients; 2) single-photon emission computed tomography; 3) coronary computed tomographic angiography with selective computed tomographic fractional flow reserve; and 4) no imaging. BACKGROUND: Stress CMR perfusion imaging has established excellent diagnostic utility and prognostic value in coronary artery disease (CAD), but its cost-effectiveness in current clinical practice has not been well studied in the United States. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to project health care costs and lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for symptomatic patients at presentation with a 32.4% prevalence of obstructive CAD. Rates of clinical events, costs, and quality-of-life values were estimated from SPINS and other published research. The analysis was conducted from a U.S. health care system perspective, with health and cost outcomes discounted annually at 3%. RESULTS: Using hard cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death or acute myocardial infarction) as the endpoint, total costs per person were lowest for the no-imaging strategy ($16,936) and highest for the immediate XCA strategy ($20,929). Lifetime QALYs were lowest for the no-imaging strategy (12.72050) and highest for the immediate XCA strategy (12.76535). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the CMR-based strategy compared with the no-imaging strategy was $52,000/QALY, whereas the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the immediate XCA strategy was $12 million/QALY compared with CMR. Results were sensitive to variations in model inputs for prevalence of disease, hazard rate ratio for treatment of CAD, and annual discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to invasive XCA, stress CMR can be a cost-effective gatekeeping tool in patients at risk for obstructive CAD in the United States.

RESULTS: Using hard cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death or acute myocardial infarction) as the endpoint, total costs per person were lowest for the no-imaging strategy ($16,936) and highest for the immediate XCA strategy ($20,929). Lifetime QALYs were lowest for the no-imaging strategy (12.72050) and highest for the immediate XCA strategy (12.76535). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the CMR-based strategy compared with the no-imaging strategy was $52,000/QALY, whereas the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the immediate XCA strategy was $12 million/QALY compared with CMR. Results were sensitive to variations in model inputs for prevalence of disease, hazard rate ratio for treatment of CAD, and annual discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to invasive XCA, stress CMR can be a cost-effective gatekeeping tool in patients at risk for obstructive CAD in the United States.

23983,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stress Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Stable Chest Pain Syndromes,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare, using results from the multicenter SPINS (Stress CMR Perfusion Imaging in the United States) study, the incremental cost-effectiveness of a stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-first strategy against 4 other clinical strategies for patients with stable symptoms suspicious for myocardial ischemia: 1) immediate x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) with selective fractional flow reserve for all patients; 2) single-photon emission computed tomography; 3) coronary computed tomographic angiography with selective computed tomographic fractional flow reserve; and 4) no imaging. BACKGROUND: Stress CMR perfusion imaging has established excellent diagnostic utility and prognostic value in coronary artery disease (CAD), but its cost-effectiveness in current clinical practice has not been well studied in the United States. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to project health care costs and lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for symptomatic patients at presentation with a 32.4% prevalence of obstructive CAD. Rates of clinical events, costs, and quality-of-life values were estimated from SPINS and other published research.

23985,Cost-effectiveness analysis of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel for untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel (ANP) in the first-line treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Materials & methods: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of ANP versus nab-paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of metastatic TNBC. Lifetime costs, life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) were estimated. Results: ANP provided an additional 0.16 QALYs (0.24 LYs) compared with nab-paclitaxel in intention-to-treat population. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $786,131 per QALY gained. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to $361,218 per QALY gained in the PD-L1 positive subgroup analysis. Conclusion: From the perspective of a US-payer, ANP is estimated not to be cost-effective in the first-line treatment of metastatic TNBC.",2020-01-33627,0,Adv.

23986,Ending the HIV epidemic in the USA: an economic modelling study in six cities,"BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic in the USA is a collection of diverse local microepidemics. We aimed to identify optimal combination implementation strategies of evidence-based interventions to reach 90% reduction of incidence in 10 years, in six US cities that comprise 24.1% of people living with HIV in the USA. METHODS: In this economic modelling study, we used a dynamic HIV transmission model calibrated with the best available evidence on epidemiological and structural conditions for six US cities: Atlanta (GA), Baltimore (MD), Los Angeles (CA), Miami (FL), New York City (NY), and Seattle (WA). We assessed 23 040 combinations of 16 evidence-based interventions (ie, HIV prevention, testing, treatment, engagement, and re-engagement) to identify combination strategies providing the greatest health benefit while remaining cost-effective. Main outcomes included averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total cost (in 2018 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; from the health-care sector perspective, 3% annual discount rate). Interventions were implemented at previously documented and ideal (90% coverage or adoption) scale-up, and sustained from 2020 to 2030, with outcomes evaluated until 2040. FINDINGS: Optimal combination strategies providing health benefit and cost-effectiveness contained between nine (Seattle) and 13 (Miami) individual interventions. If implemented at previously documented scale-up, these strategies could reduce incidence by between 30.7% (95% credible interval 19.1-43.7; Seattle) and 50.1% (41.5-58.0; New York City) by 2030, at ICERs ranging from cost-saving in Atlanta, Baltimore, and Miami, to $95 416 per QALY in Seattle. Incidence reductions reached between 39.5% (26.3-53.8) in Seattle and 83.6% (70.8-87.0) in Baltimore at ideal implementation. Total costs of implementing strategies across the cities at previously documented scale-up reached $559 million per year in 2024; however, costs were offset by long-term reductions in new infections and delayed disease progression, with Atlanta, Baltimore, and Miami projecting cost savings over the 20 year study period. INTERPRETATION: Evidence-based interventions can deliver substantial public health and economic value; however, complementary strategies to overcome social and structural barriers to HIV care will be required to reach national targets of the ending the HIV epidemic initiative by 2030.

23992,The Impact of the Policy-Practice Gap on Costs and Benefits of Barrett's Esophagus Management,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines recommend surveillance of patients with Barrett''s esophagus (BE). However, the surveillance intervals in practice are shorter than policy recommendations. We aimed to determine how this policy-practice gap affects the costs and benefits of BE surveillance. METHODS: We used the Netherlands as an exemplary Western country and simulated a cohort of 60-year-old patients with BE using the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model-esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) microsimulation model. We evaluated surveillance according to the Dutch guideline and more intensive surveillance of patients without dysplastic BE and low-grade dysplasia. For each strategy, we computed the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs compared with no surveillance. We also performed a budget impact analysis to estimate the increased costs of BE management in the Netherlands for 2017. RESULTS: Compared with no surveillance, the Dutch guideline incurred an additional &OV0556;5.0 ($5.7) million per 1,000 patients with BE for surveillance and treatment, whereas 57 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cases (>T1a) were prevented. With intensive and very intensive surveillance strategies for both nondysplastic BE and low-grade dysplasia, the net costs increased by another &OV0556;2.5-5.6 ($2.8-6.5) million while preventing 10-19 more EAC cases and gaining 33-60 more QALYs. On a population level, this amounted to &OV0556;21-47 ($24-54) million (+32%-70%) higher healthcare costs in 2017. DISCUSSION: The policy-practice gap in BE surveillance intervals results in 50%-114% higher net costs for BE management for only 10%-18% increase in QALYs gained, depending on actual intensity of surveillance. Incentives to eliminate this policy-practice gap should be developed to reduce the burden of BE management on patients and healthcare resources.",2020-01-33633,0,Am. J.

23995,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Corticosteroid Injections and Open Surgical Release for Trigger Finger,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection(s) versus open surgical release for the treatment of trigger finger. METHODS: Using a US health care payer perspective, we created a decision tree model to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with 4 treatment strategies for trigger finger: offering up to 3 steroid injections before to surgery or immediate open surgical release. Costs were obtained from a large administrative claims database. We calculated expected quality-adjusted life-years for each treatment strategy, which were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Separate analyses were performed for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients. We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 second-order Monte Carlo simulations that simultaneously sampled from the uncertainty distributions of all model inputs. RESULTS: Offering 3 steroid injections before surgery was the optimal strategy for both commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that this strategy was cost-effective 67% and 59% of the time for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients, respectively. Our results were sensitive to the probability of injection site fat necrosis, success rate of steroid injections, time to symptom relief after a steroid injection, and cost of treatment. Immediate surgical release became cost-effective when the cost of surgery was below $902 or $853 for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple treatment strategies exist for treating trigger finger, and our cost-effectiveness analysis helps define the relative value of different approaches. From a health care payer perspective, offering 3 steroid injections before surgery is a cost-effective strategy. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analyses II.
