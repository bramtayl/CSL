5101,The cost-effectiveness of infliximab in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in Spain. Comparison of clinical trial and clinical practice data,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with infliximab (Remicade) in Spain for up to 40 years. METHODS: A previously published disease model was adapted to the Spanish setting using resource consumption from a cross-sectional burden of an illness study in 601 patients in Spain. Cost-effectiveness estimates were based on a placebo-controlled clinical trial as well as an open clinical study in Spain. In the model, patients with insufficient response to treatment at 12 weeks [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) <4 or > or =50% reduction] discontinue treatment. The results are presented in 2005 euros, from societal and health-care payer perspectives. RESULTS: In the societal perspective, infliximab treatment dominates standard treatment in both analyses. In the perspective of the health-care system, with the assumption that, over the long term, functional ability of patients on treatment would decline at half the natural rate, the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated at EUR 22 519 (double-blind trial) and EUR 8866 (open study). Assuming that patients' function on treatment remains stable, the cost-effectiveness ratios are EUR 15 157 and EUR 5307, respectively. Under the most conservative assumption (no effect of treatment on progression), the ratios are EUR 31 721 and EUR 13 659, respectively. In addition, the results are sensitive to the time horizon and discontinuation rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that infliximab therapy for patients with active AS should be cost-effective both in the societal perspective (dominating) and in the perspective of the health-care system (ranges from EUR 5300 to EUR 32 000 per QALY) in Spain.",2008-01-04115,18189197,Scand J Rheumatol,G Kobelt,2008,37 / 1,62-71,No,18189197,"G Kobelt; P Sobocki; J Mulero; J Gratacos; E Collantes-Estevez; J Braun; The cost-effectiveness of infliximab in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in Spain.

5107,Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer chemoprevention: a quality of life-years analysis,"BACKGROUND: The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) demonstrated that finasteride reduces the prevalence of prostate cancer by 24.8% (risk reduction) but questions remain regarding the cost-effectiveness of widespread utilization. The purpose of the current analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention utilizing a quality-of-life adjustment. METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis was designed to determine the lifetime prostate health-related costs, beginning at age 50 years, for men treated with finasteride compared with placebo. Model assumptions were based on data from the PCPT; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results program; literature review of costs, utilities, and transition rates among various prostate cancer health states; and local institutional cost data. RESULTS: The quality-adjusted cost-effectiveness ratio for finasteride compared with men not receiving chemoprevention was $122,747 (in U.S.$) per quality-adjusted life-years saved (QALYs). If finasteride is assumed to not increase the incidence of high-grade tumors, the quality-adjusted cost-effectiveness ratio was $112,062 per QALYs. Sensitivity analysis found that chemoprevention of prostate cancer with an agent that has no effect on the prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia can render a cost-effectiveness ratio of <$50,000 per QALYs saved when applied to a high-risk population associated with a 25% risk reduction, and a cost of $30 per month.

5110,Combination polypharmacy for cardiovascular disease prevention in men: a decision analysis and cost-effectiveness model,"Pharmacotherapies to lower blood pressure and cholesterol are effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The use of fixed-dose medication combinations has not been well studied. The authors created a Markov model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of 4 fixed-dose medications for primary CVD prevention in men. The initial decision node was to treat or not treat men older than 55 years, without CVD, hypertension, or dyslipidemia with a combination of simvastatin, captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atenolol. Probability, costs, and effectiveness were derived from the literature. The outcome variable was marginal cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed. The average cost of treatment was $70,000 compared with $93,000 for non-treatment. Treatment resulted in 13.62 QALYs vs 12.96 QALYs without treatment. Primary prevention of CVD with fixed-dose medications dominated ""no-treatment.""

5111,Economics of an adolescent meningococcal conjugate vaccination catch-up campaign in the United States,"BACKGROUND: In June 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the newly licensed quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine for routine use among all US children aged 11 years. A 1-time catch-up vaccination campaign for children and adolescents aged 11-17 years, followed by routine annual immunization of each child aged 11 years, could generate immediate herd immunity benefits. The objective of our study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of a catch-up vaccination campaign with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine for children and adolescents aged 11-17 years. METHODS: We built a probabilistic model of disease burden and economic impacts for a 10-year period with and without a program of adolescent catch-up meningococcal vaccination, followed by 9 years of routine immunization of children aged 11 years. We used US age- and serogroup-specific surveillance data on incidence and mortality. Assumptions related to the impact of herd immunity were drawn from experience with routine meningococcal vaccination in the United Kingdom. We estimated costs per case, deaths prevented, life-years saved, and quality-adjusted life-years saved. RESULTS: With herd immunity, the catch-up and routine vaccination program for adolescents would prevent 8251 cases of meningococcal disease in a 10-year period (a 48% decrease). Excluding program costs, this catch-up and routine vaccination program would save US$551 million in direct costs and $920 million in indirect costs, including costs associated with permanent disability and premature death. At $83 per vaccinee, the catch-up vaccination would cost society approximately $223,000 per case averted, approximately $2.6 million per death prevented, approximately $127,000 per life-year saved, and approximately $88,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Targeting counties with a high incidence of disease decreased the cost per life-year saved by two-thirds. CONCLUSIONS: Although costly, catch-up and routine vaccination of adolescents can have a substantial impact on meningococcal disease burden. Because of herd immunity, catch-up and routine vaccination cost per life-year saved could be up to one-third less than that previously assessed for routine vaccination of children aged 11 years.",2008-01-04130,18171206,Clin Infect Dis,Ismael R Ortega-Sanchez,2008,46 / 1,1-13,No,18171206,"Ismael R Ortega-Sanchez; Martin I Meltzer; Colin Shepard; Elizabeth Zell; Mark L Messonnier; Oleg Bilukha; Xinzhi Zhang; David S Stephens; Nancy E Messonnier; Economics of an adolescent meningococcal conjugate vaccination catch-up campaign in the United States, Clin Infect Dis, 2008-Jan-01; 46(1):1537-6591; 1-13",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adolescent catch up meningococcal vaccination vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,17 Years,11 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,120368.32,United States,2005,159511.76

5113,Economics of an adolescent meningococcal conjugate vaccination catch-up campaign in the United States,"BACKGROUND: In June 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the newly licensed quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine for routine use among all US children aged 11 years. A 1-time catch-up vaccination campaign for children and adolescents aged 11-17 years, followed by routine annual immunization of each child aged 11 years, could generate immediate herd immunity benefits. The objective of our study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of a catch-up vaccination campaign with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine for children and adolescents aged 11-17 years. METHODS: We built a probabilistic model of disease burden and economic impacts for a 10-year period with and without a program of adolescent catch-up meningococcal vaccination, followed by 9 years of routine immunization of children aged 11 years. We used US age- and serogroup-specific surveillance data on incidence and mortality. Assumptions related to the impact of herd immunity were drawn from experience with routine meningococcal vaccination in the United Kingdom. We estimated costs per case, deaths prevented, life-years saved, and quality-adjusted life-years saved. RESULTS: With herd immunity, the catch-up and routine vaccination program for adolescents would prevent 8251 cases of meningococcal disease in a 10-year period (a 48% decrease). Excluding program costs, this catch-up and routine vaccination program would save US$551 million in direct costs and $920 million in indirect costs, including costs associated with permanent disability and premature death. At $83 per vaccinee, the catch-up vaccination would cost society approximately $223,000 per case averted, approximately $2.6 million per death prevented, approximately $127,000 per life-year saved, and approximately $88,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Targeting counties with a high incidence of disease decreased the cost per life-year saved by two-thirds. CONCLUSIONS: Although costly, catch-up and routine vaccination of adolescents can have a substantial impact on meningococcal disease burden.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of digital mammography screening for breast cancer. DESIGN: Validated, discrete-event simulation model. DATA SOURCES: Data from DMIST and publicly available U.S. data. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women age 40 years or older. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal and Medicare. INTERVENTION: All-film mammography screening; all-digital mammography screening; and targeted digital mammography screening, which is age-targeted digital mammography (for women <50 years of age) and age- and density-targeted digital mammography (for women <50 years of age or women > or =50 years of age with dense breasts). OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: All-digital mammography screening cost $331,000 (95% CI, $268,000 to $403,000) per QALY gained relative to all-film mammography screening but was more costly and less effective than targeted digital mammography screening. Targeted digital mammography screening resulted in more screen-detected cases of cancer and fewer deaths from cancer than either all-film or all-digital mammography screening, with cost-effectiveness estimates ranging from $26,500 (CI, $21,000 to $33,000) per QALY gained for age-targeted digital mammography to $84,500 (CI, $75,000 to $93,000) per QALY gained for age- and density-targeted digital mammography. In the Medicare population, the cost-effectiveness of density-targeted digital mammography screening varied from a base-case estimate of $97,000 (CI, $77,000 to $131,000) to $257,000 per QALY gained (CI, $91,000 to $536,000) in the alternative-case analyses, in which the sensitivity of film mammography was increased and the sensitivity of digital mammography in women with nondense breasts was decreased. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the cost of digital mammography and to the prevalence of dense breasts.

5121,Cost-effectiveness of C-leg compared with non-microprocessor-controlled knees: a modeling approach,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs and health outcomes of C-Leg and non-microprocessor-controlled (NMC) knees using a decision-analytic model. DESIGN: Data on costs, rates and duration of problems, knee survival, and health-related quality of life were obtained from interviews with patients and prosthetists with experience of both C-Leg and NMC knees. Interview data were assessed in a decision-analytic Markov model to estimate cost-effectiveness from a health care perspective. SETTING: Outpatient. PARTICIPANTS: A population sample of 20 patients currently using the C-Leg and prior experience of nonmicroprocessor knees, and 5 prosthetists. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The mean incremental cost (in 2006 Euros) and QALYs for the C-Leg was 7657 euros and 2.38, respectively, yielding a cost per QALY gained of 3218 euros. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to provide decision-makers with relevant information on costs and health outcomes of different treatment strategies on actual decision problems despite limited evidence.

The cost-effectiveness of duloxetine was evaluated as an additional first, second, third or fourth-line therapy over a 6-month treatment period for a cohort of 1000 patients. Treatment response was modelled based on changes from baseline pain severity using a standard 11-point pain scale (0-10); full response (>or= 50% change), partial response (30-49%) and no response (< 30%). The model was populated with efficacy and discontinuation data using indirect comparisons of treatment efficacy based on relative effects to a common placebo comparator. RESULTS: The second-line use of duloxetine resulted in cost savings of pound 77,071 for every 1000 treated patients, with an additional 29 patients achieving a full pain response when compared to standard UK treatment. Additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were achieved at 1.88 QALYs per 1000 patients.

5126,The cost-effectiveness of risedronate treatment in Japanese women with osteoporosis,"We constructed a mathematical model for assessing the cost-effectiveness of providing BMD (bone mineral density) scans to Japanese women aged 55 years and over and treating, with risedronate, those that are shown to be osteoporotic. Fracture rates, cost data, utility values, and the increased risks of fractures associated with T-score and vertebral fracture history were taken from published literature. We estimated the cost of fractures avoided due to risedronate treatment, allowing the net changes in cost, incorporating both intervention and fracture costs to be calculated. The QALYs (quality adjusted life years) gained through treatment were calculated enabling cost per QALY ratios to be presented. Further analyses were undertaken assuming treatment was reserved for older women and/or those who had sustained a vertebral fracture in the previous 2 years. Cost per QALY values were inversely related to absolute risk of fracture. Assuming a cost per QALY value threshold of US dollars 100,000, we concluded that providing BMD scans to women aged 70 years and over who had sustained a vertebral fracture in the previous 2 years and treating those that were osteoporotic was cost-effective. However, providing BMD scans for women without a vertebral fracture in the previous 2 years was not cost-effective, even in women aged 85 years and older.",2008-01-04144,18095061,J Bone Miner Metab,Hansheng Ding,2008,26 / 1,34-41,No,18095061,"Hansheng Ding; Nobuo Koinuma; Matt Stevenson; Michiya Ito; Yasutake Monma; The cost-effectiveness of risedronate treatment in Japanese women with osteoporosis, J Bone Miner Metab, 2008; 26(1):0914-8779; 34-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Risedronate treatment vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,55 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,347232.85,United States,2006,445772.23
5127,Carmustine implants for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas are aggressive brain tumours that are extremely challenging to treat effectively. The intracranial implantation of carmustine wafers (BCNU-W), which delivers chemotherapy directly to the affected area, may prolong survival in this population. However, no attention has yet been paid to the economic implications of BCNU-W in this setting. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of BCNU-W as an adjunct to surgery followed by radiotherapy, compared with surgery plus radiotherapy alone. Newly diagnosed, operable grade III and IV gliomas in a population with a mean age of 55 years were considered. METHODS: A Markov cost-utility model was developed in Microsoft Excel, adopting a UK NHS perspective. Transition probabilities and cost data (year 2004 values) were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. The model incorporated utility values, obtained from members of the public, reflecting the quality of life associated with high-grade glioma. The effects of uncertainty were explored through extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Surgery with the implantation of BCNU-W followed by radiotherapy costs pound sterling 54 500 per additional QALY gained when compared with surgery plus radiotherapy alone. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows a <10% probability that BCNU-W would be considered cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound sterling 30 000 per QALY. Although model outputs were sensitive to alterations in several key parameters, the incremental cost effectiveness of the intervention remained above pound sterling 30 000 per QALY in all analyses. CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas, BCNU-W is unlikely to be considered a cost-effective use of healthcare resources when judged by the standards commonly adopted in England and Wales. However, the dreadful prognosis of the condition and the paucity of alternative therapies are additional issues that healthcare commissioners may choose to take into account when considering an adoption decision.",2008-01-04150,18088157,Pharmacoeconomics,Gabriel Rogers,2008,26 / 1,33-44,Yes,18088157,"Gabriel Rogers; Ruth Garside; Stuart Mealing; Martin Pitt; Rob Anderson; Matthew Dyer; Ken Stein; Margaret Somerville; Carmustine implants for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas: a cost-utility analysis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2008; 26(1):1179-2027; 33-44",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intracranial implantation of carmustine wafers (BCNU-W) as an adjunct to surgery followed by radiotherapy vs. Surgery plus radiotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,6.00,1.50,54500,United Kingdom,2004,136870.41
5128,National use of thrombolysis with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine in Denmark: a model of budgetary impact and cost effectiveness,"AIM: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the budgetary impact and cost effectiveness of the national use of thrombolysis with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA) for acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine in Denmark. METHODS: Computations were based on a Danish health economic model of thrombolysis treatment of acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine. Cost data for stroke units and satellite clinics were taken from the first practical experiences in Denmark with implementing thrombolysis via telemedical linkage to the Stroke Department at Aarhus University Hospital. Effectiveness data were taken from a published pooled analysis of results from randomized controlled trials of alteplase. RESULTS: The calculations showed that the additional total costs to the hospitals of implementing thrombolysis with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine were approximately $US3.0 (range 2.0-5.8) million per year in the case of five centres and five satellite clinics, or $US3.6 (range 2.4-7.0) million per year based on seven centres and seven satellite clinics. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to be approximately $US50,000 when taking a short time perspective (1 year), but thrombolysis was dominant (both cheaper and more effective) after as little as 2 years and cost effectiveness improved over longer time scales. CONCLUSION: The budgetary impact of using thrombolysis with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine depends on the existing capacity and organizational conditions at the local hospitals.

METHODS: The BENESCO-model was used to estimate the long-term health and economic benefits of smoking cessation for a cohort of smokers making a one-time quit attempt. The cohort represented the population of Dutch smokers with respect to gender, age, and prevalence of the smoking-related diseases included in the model: COPD, lung cancer, CHD, stroke, and asthma exacerbations. The model compared the cumulative incidence of smoking-related diseases, (quality-adjusted) life years, intervention costs, and direct medical costs between the cohort treated with varenicline and the same cohort either untreated (unaided cessation) or treated with bupropion, nortriptyline or NRT. The time horizon was lifetime. Future costs were discounted at 4%, health outcomes at 1.5%. RESULTS: The cost of varenicline per additional quitter ranged from 1030 Euro compared with NRT to 4270 Euro compared with nortriptyline. When including the savings due to the reduction in incidence of smoking-related diseases, varenicline generated net savings compared with bupropion and NRT. Compared with nortriptyline and unaided cessation, varenicline was estimated to cost 1650 Euro/QALY and 320 Euro/QALY gained, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay as low as 5000/QALY gained, the probability that varenicline was cost-effective was more than 80% compared to bupropion, NRT, and unaided cessation and about 60% compared to nortriptyline.

METHODS: The BENESCO-model was used to estimate the long-term health and economic benefits of smoking cessation for a cohort of smokers making a one-time quit attempt. The cohort represented the population of Dutch smokers with respect to gender, age, and prevalence of the smoking-related diseases included in the model: COPD, lung cancer, CHD, stroke, and asthma exacerbations. The model compared the cumulative incidence of smoking-related diseases, (quality-adjusted) life years, intervention costs, and direct medical costs between the cohort treated with varenicline and the same cohort either untreated (unaided cessation) or treated with bupropion, nortriptyline or NRT. The time horizon was lifetime. Future costs were discounted at 4%, health outcomes at 1.5%. RESULTS: The cost of varenicline per additional quitter ranged from 1030 Euro compared with NRT to 4270 Euro compared with nortriptyline.

METHODS: A probabilistic Bayesian Markov model simulating the outcomes of orlistat treatment on the obese Italian population has been developed with the WinBUGS software.

Analyses adopted the societal cost perspective, including direct medical costs borne by both the National Health Service and the patient, since orlistat is not included in the Italian reimbursement list. RESULTS: The simulation on the Italian obese population estimated an average increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy, a reduction of cardiovascular events and new diabetes cases.

5144,Modelling the long-term cost-effectiveness of endovascular or open repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm,"BACKGROUND: Recent randomized trials have shown that endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has a 3 per cent aneurysm-related survival benefit in patients fit for open surgery, but it also has uncertain long-term outcomes and higher costs. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of EVAR. METHODS: A decision model was constructed to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with EVAR and open repair in men aged 74 years. The model includes the risks of death from aneurysm, other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes, secondary reinterventions and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Data were taken largely from the EVAR trial 1 and supplemented from other sources. RESULTS: Under the base-case (primary) assumptions, EVAR cost 3800 pounds sterling (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 2400 pounds sterling to 5200 pounds sterling) more per patient than open repair but produced fewer lifetime QALYs (mean -0.020 (95 per cent c.i. -0.189 to 0.165)).

5145,Cost-effectiveness analysis of donepezil for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Donepezil is a drug used for treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Information regarding the cost-effectiveness of this medication was previously rare in Asia. We used techniques of decision analysis and economic evaluation in conjunction with available local epidemiological and clinical data on costs of mild to moderate AD to assess the cost-effectiveness of donepezil in Taiwan. METHODS: A four-state Markov model was built to simulate the disease progression of AD patients. Local transition probabilities and costs of different stages were from the studies published earlier. RESULTS: Over a 5-year span, donepezil treatment for mild or moderate AD patients is predicted to result in the gain of 0.505 QALYs when comparing to usual care, while at the same time reducing the cost by US$7,691. The incremental cost was US$3,647 from the payer perspective; thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be US$7,226 when considering only the medical expenditures.

5147,Cost-effectiveness of entecavir versus lamivudine for the suppression of viral replication in chronic hepatitis B patients in Brazil,"Hepatitis B virus infection is an important public-health issue. Chronic patients have a higher risk of death due to complications, which increases health-care expenses in. Cost-effectiveness analysis of entecavir (ETV) versus lamivudine (LVD) for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in e antigen (AgHBe)-positive and negative patients, based on two phase 3, controlled and randomized studies. A decision analysis model was developed, using the following endpoints: cost per patient with undetectable viral load and cost per quality life year (QALY) gained. Risks for complications (compensated or decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) were based on the cohort study REVEAL, published in 2006. The REVEAL parameters were applied to the results of the viral load levels obtained from the clinical assay data. The complication costs were based on a study of the disease cost conducted in Brazil, in 2005. The cost data were obtained predominantly from Sistema Unico de Saúde [SUS - Brazilian public health system] payment tables and drug price lists. The utility data were obtained from literature and life expectancy information was based on IBGE data. The analysis perspective was that of SUS. A discount rate of 3% per year was used. For the horizon of time of 10 years, the ETV had an incremental cost of approximately two million Brazilian Reais (R$) compared to LVD.

Chronic patients have a higher risk of death due to complications, which increases health-care expenses in. Cost-effectiveness analysis of entecavir (ETV) versus lamivudine (LVD) for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in e antigen (AgHBe)-positive and negative patients, based on two phase 3, controlled and randomized studies. A decision analysis model was developed, using the following endpoints: cost per patient with undetectable viral load and cost per quality life year (QALY) gained. Risks for complications (compensated or decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) were based on the cohort study REVEAL, published in 2006. The REVEAL parameters were applied to the results of the viral load levels obtained from the clinical assay data. The complication costs were based on a study of the disease cost conducted in Brazil, in 2005. The cost data were obtained predominantly from Sistema Unico de Saúde [SUS - Brazilian public health system] payment tables and drug price lists. The utility data were obtained from literature and life expectancy information was based on IBGE data. The analysis perspective was that of SUS. A discount rate of 3% per year was used. For the horizon of time of 10 years, the ETV had an incremental cost of approximately two million Brazilian Reais (R$) compared to LVD. Reducing the number of complications, ETV treatment reduced costs by around 3 million, reducing final costs by 1 million, for AgHBe-positive patients.

5155,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Injection versus Multiple Daily Injections in Type 1 Diabetes Patients: A Third-Party US Payer Perspective,"ABSTRACT Objective: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin in adult and child/young adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients from a third-party payer perspective in the United States. Method: A previously validated health economic model was used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CSII compared with MDI using published clinical and cost data. The primary input variable was change in HbA(1c), and was assumed to be an improvement of -0.9% to -1.2% for CSII compared with MDI for child/young adult and adults, respectively. A series of Markov constructs simulated the progression of diabetes-related complications. Results: CSII was associated with an improvement in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained of 1.061 versus MDI for adults and 0.799 versus MDI for children/young adults. ICERs were $16,992 and $27,195 per QALY gained for CSII versus MDI in adults and children/young adults, respectively. Improved glycemic control from CSII led to a lower incidence of diabetes complications, with the most significant reduction in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), end stage renal disease (ESRD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The number needed to treat (NNT) for PDR was nine patients, suggesting that only nine patients need to be treated with CSII to avoid one case of PDR. The NNT for ESRD and PVD was 19 and 41, respectively. Conclusions: Setting the willingness to pay at $50,000/QALY, the analysis demonstrated that CSII is a cost-effective option for patients with T1DM in the United States.",2008-01-04227,19171006,Value Health,Meaghan St Charles,2008,/,,Yes,19171006,"Meaghan St Charles; Peter Lynch; Claudia Graham; Michael E Minshall; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Injection versus Multiple Daily Injections in Type 1 Diabetes Patients: A Third-Party US Payer Perspective, Value Health, 2008-Dec-22; ():1098-3015",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs. Multiple daily injections,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,60 Years,3.00,3.00,16992,United States,2007,21209.96

METHODS: We constructed a Markov model with 5 states defined by visual acuity (VA) in the better-seeing eye (Snellen scale), as follows: VA >20/40, <or=20/40 to >20/80, </or20/80 to >20/200, <or=20/200 to >20/400, and <or=20/400. A death state was also included. We took transition probabilities, number of ranibizumab injections, and number of PDT treatments from the ANCHOR (Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in Age-Related Macular Degeneration) trial. Utilities were taken from a published study of patients' preferences. We used unit costs from our hospital and drug costs from a national database. Resource utilization was determined by an ophthalmologist according to current clinical practice. We performed univariate, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Incremental costs (2007 euro) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), both discounted at a 3% annual rate, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; euro/QALY) were determined for the 2-year and life-expectancy time horizons. RESULTS: Treating patients with varying degrees of visual impairment with ranibizumab instead of PDT, with a 2-year time horizon, was found to be euro18,328 more costly and to confer 0.140 additional QALY (euro131,275/QALY). This ICER was reduced to euro39,398/ QALY for the longer life-expectancy time horizon. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, PDT is the therapy of choice in all cases below the threshold of euro30,000/QALY for the 2-year time horizon.

5158,Economic evaluation of systemic therapies for moderate to severe psoriasis,"Summary Background New biologics have dramatically changed therapeutic options for psoriasis, albeit at additional cost. Objectives To determine the cost-effectiveness and optimal treatment sequence for moderate to severe psoriasis. Methods Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response rates from 22 randomized controlled trials evaluating biologic (adalimumab, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab) and nonbiologic systemic (methotrexate, ciclosporin) agents were considered. Short-term efficacy was based on relative probabilities of achieving PASI response (50/75/90) in a meta-analysis of trials. Published evidence and assumptions were used to predict long-term efficacy. Treatment benefits were determined by the relationship between PASI response and the EuroQOL 5D health utility measure. Costs included therapy, administration, monitoring and hospitalization. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and treatments ranked relative to supportive care. Results Infliximab provided the most incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) vs. supportive care (0.18 QALYs; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.13-0.24), followed by adalimumab (0.16 QALYs; 95% CI 0.11-0.22). Methotrexate and ciclosporin were less beneficial (0.13 and 0.08 QALYs, respectively) but were cost saving and considered the first two treatments in the optimal sequence. Comparing biologics, adalimumab was most cost effective (ICER pound30 000 per QALY), followed by etanercept ( pound37 000 per QALY), efalizumab ( pound40 000 per QALY) and infliximab ( pound42 000 per QALY). Conclusions Methotrexate and ciclosporin are cost effective but require monitoring for toxicities.

Treatment benefits were determined by the relationship between PASI response and the EuroQOL 5D health utility measure. Costs included therapy, administration, monitoring and hospitalization. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and treatments ranked relative to supportive care. Results Infliximab provided the most incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) vs. supportive care (0.18 QALYs; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.13-0.24), followed by adalimumab (0.16 QALYs; 95% CI 0.11-0.22). Methotrexate and ciclosporin were less beneficial (0.13 and 0.08 QALYs, respectively) but were cost saving and considered the first two treatments in the optimal sequence. Comparing biologics, adalimumab was most cost effective (ICER pound30 000 per QALY), followed by etanercept ( pound37 000 per QALY), efalizumab ( pound40 000 per QALY) and infliximab ( pound42 000 per QALY).

5166,The cost-effectiveness of universal screening in pregnancy for subclinical hypothyroidism,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether routine screening for subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy would be cost-effective. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision analysis model to compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 screening strategies during pregnancy for subclinical hypothyroidism: (1) no routine screening of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (standard) and (2) routine screening of TSH levels. In the latter, women with subclinical hypothyroidism received thyroid hormone replacement. We assumed that thyroid hormone replacement could reduce the incidence of an offspring IQ < 85 for pregnancies with subclinical hypothyroidism. The main outcome measure was marginal cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Our model predicts that universal screening is the dominant strategy. For every 100,000 pregnant women who were screened, $8,356,383 are saved, and 589.3 QALYs are gained. When subclinical hypothyroidism prevalence is reduced to 0.25%, screening remains cost-effective at $21,664/QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Screening for subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy will be a cost-effective strategy under a wide range of circumstances.",2008-01-04251,19114278,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Stephen F Thung,2008,/,,No,19114278,"Stephen F Thung; Edmund F Funai; William A Grobman; Edmund F Funai; William A Grobman; The cost-effectiveness of universal screening in pregnancy for subclinical hypothyroidism, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 2008-Dec-27; ():0002-9378",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-14180.18,United States,2007,-17700.17

METHODS: Data from a randomised controlled trial comparing cryostripping and endovenous laser ablation in 120 patients were combined to study Short Form (SF) 6D outcome, costs and cost-effectiveness 2 years after treatment. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained 2 years after treatment was calculated using different strategies, and uncertainty was assessed with bootstrapping. RESULTS: Over the total study period, mean SF-6D scores improved slightly from 0.78 at baseline to 0.80 at 2 years for patients who underwent cryostripping and from 0.77 to 0.79 for patients who underwent endovenous laser. QALY (SF-6D) was 1.59 in patients who underwent cryostripping and 1.60 in patients who underwent endovenous laser 2 years after treatment.

5170,Cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that combination therapy (CT) in the form of long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids can improve lung function for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of using CT in none, all or a selected group of COPD patients. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare four treatment strategies: no use of CT regardless of COPD severity (patients receive LABA only); use of CT in patients with stage 3 disease only (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV(1)] less than 35% of predicted); use of CT in patients with stages 2 and 3 disease only (FEV(1) less than 50% of predicted); and use of CT in all patients regardless of severity of COPD. Estimates of mortality, exacerbation and disease progression rates, quality- adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were derived from the literature. Three-year and lifetime time horizons were used. The analysis was conducted from a health systems perspective. RESULTS: CT was associated with a cost of $39,000 per QALY if given to patients with stage 3 disease, $47,500 per QALY if given to patients with stages 2 and 3 disease, and $450,333 per QALY if given to all COPD patients. Results were robust to various assumptions tested in a Monte Carlo simulation. CONCLUSION: Providing CT for COPD patients in stage 2 or 3 disease is cost-effective.

5172,Cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that combination therapy (CT) in the form of long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids can improve lung function for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of using CT in none, all or a selected group of COPD patients. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare four treatment strategies: no use of CT regardless of COPD severity (patients receive LABA only); use of CT in patients with stage 3 disease only (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV(1)] less than 35% of predicted); use of CT in patients with stages 2 and 3 disease only (FEV(1) less than 50% of predicted); and use of CT in all patients regardless of severity of COPD. Estimates of mortality, exacerbation and disease progression rates, quality- adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were derived from the literature. Three-year and lifetime time horizons were used. The analysis was conducted from a health systems perspective.

DESIGN: Cost utility analysis using a cohort Markov model, incorporating clinical data from two pivotal clinical trials (the COMMIT/CCS-2 and CLARITY-TIMI 28 trials) and data from UK and non-UK observational studies. SETTING: Health economic evaluation carried out from the perspective of the UK NHS. PATIENTS: A representative cohort of 1000 UK patients aged 60 years, diagnosed with STEMI. INTERVENTIONS: 75 mg/day clopidogrel, with and without a 300 mg loading dose, in addition to standard therapy (including aspirin, 75-325 mg/day) for 1 month, and for 1 year, followed by standard therapy alone for their remaining lifetime, or standard therapy alone (including aspirin, 75-325 mg/day) for their remaining lifetime. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (ICER). RESULTS: For the 1-month treatment option both the COMMIT/CCS-2 and CLARITY-TIMI 28 trials have ICERs below pound2500. For the 1-year treatment option both trials have ICERs below pound4000.

5177,Befriending carers of people with dementia: a cost utility analysis,"OBJECTIVE: There is very little evidence on the cost-effectiveness of social care interventions for people with dementia or their carers. The BEfriending and Costs of CAring trial (BECCA, ISRCTN08130075) aimed to establish whether a structured befriending service improved the quality of life of carers of people with dementia, and at what cost. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation alongside a single blind, randomised controlled trial in a community setting of 236 carers of people with a primary progressive dementia. The intervention was contact with a Befriender Facilitator (BF), and offer of match with a trained lay volunteer befriender compared with no BF contact. Main outcome measures were health and social care, voluntary sector, and family care costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in carers over 15 months. RESULTS: Mean QALYs per carer over 15 months were 0.017 higher in the intervention group compared with control (95%CI: -0.051, 0.083). Mean costs from a societal perspective were pound1,813 higher (- pound11,312, pound14,984). The point estimate Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is thus pound105,954 per incremental QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests a 42.2% probability that the ICER is below pound30,000 per QALY. Inclusion of dementia patient QALYs reduces the ICER to pound28,848 (51.4% probability below pound30,000). CONCLUSIONS: Befriending leads to a non-significant trend towards improved carer quality of life, and there is a non-significant trend towards higher costs for all sectors. It is unlikely that befriending is a cost-effective intervention from the point of view of society.

5181,Cost-effectiveness of strong opioids focussing on the long-term effects of opioid-related fractures: a model approach,"Opioid analgesics are known to impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These CNS side effects, such as dizziness and confusion, have been shown to lead to an increased risk of falling with subsequent fractures in elderly patients being treated with opioids. The risk of experiencing fractures has been shown to be dependent on the substance administered. Therefore, a health economic model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the most commonly used strong opiods in Germany, focussing on opioid-related fractures. By means of a Markov model, the consequences of hip, spine and forearm fractures due to the prior administration of transdermal (TD) buprenorphine, TD fentanyl, oral oxycodone as well as oral morphine were assessed from the perspectives of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) and the German social security (GSS) system over a time horizon of 6 years. The most frequently prescribed strength/package-size combinations of these opioids were taken into consideration, including generics where available. The results of the present analysis predict that TD buprenorphine is dominant compared to TD fentanyl and oxycodone by showing better effects [life years gained/quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained] at lower cost.

5195,Cost-effectiveness of gargling for the prevention of upper respiratory tract infections,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In Japan, gargling is generally accepted as a preventive method for upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). The effectiveness of gargling for preventing URTI was shown in a randomized controlled trial that compared the incidence of URTI in a gargling group and a control group. From the third party payer's perspective, gargling is dominant due to the fact that gargling costs are imposed on each participant. Yet the cost-effectiveness of gargling from the societal perspective should be considered. In this study, an economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of gargling for preventing URTI from the societal perspective. METHODS: Of the participants in the gargling trial, 122 water-gargling and 130 control subjects were involved in the economic analysis. The 60-day cumulative follow-up costs and effectiveness measured by quality adjusted life days (QALD) were compared between the groups on an intention-to-treat basis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was converted to dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The 95% confidence interval (95%CI) and the probability of gargling being cost-effective were estimated by bootstrapping. RESULTS: This study found that, after 60 days, the QALD was increased by 0.43 and the costs were $37.1 higher in the gargling group than in the control group. The ICER of the gargling group was $31,800/QALY (95%CI $1,900 to $248,100). This is similar to many acceptable forms of medical interventions, including URTI preventive measures such as influenza vaccination. Therefore, the ICER appears to be within the acceptable range. The major limitation of the study is that this trial was conducted in winter, at a time when URTI is prevalent. Care must be taken when applying the results to a season when URTI is not prevalent, since the ICER will increase due to a decrease in the incidence. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that gargling is a cost-effective preventive strategy for URTI that is acceptable both from the third party payer's and societal perspectives.",2008-01-04274,19087312,BMC Health Serv Res,Michi Sakai,2008,8 / 1,258,Yes,19087312,"Michi Sakai; Takuro Shimbo; Kazumi Omata; Yoshimitsu Takahashi; Kazunari Satomura; Tetsuhisa Kitamura; Takashi Kawamura; Hisamitsu Baba; Masaharu Yoshihara; Hiroshi Itoh; Great Cold Investigators -I; Cost-effectiveness of gargling for the prevention of upper respiratory tract infections, BMC Health Serv Res, 2008-Dec-16; 8(1):1472-6963; 258",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gargling with 20ml of water of povidone iodine for 15 seconds three times daily vs. Control: no gargling,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,8 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,31800,United States,2005,42141.27
5196,Sixty-four-slice computed tomography of the coronary arteries: cost-effectiveness analysis of patients presenting to the emergency department with low-risk chest pain,"OBJECTIVES: The aim was to use a computer model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) of the coronary arteries in the emergency department (ED) compared to an observation unit (OU) stay plus stress electrocardiogram (ECG) or stress echocardiography for the evaluation of low-risk chest pain patients presenting to the ED. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to compare health outcomes and costs that result from three different risk stratification strategies for low-risk chest pain patients in the ED: stress ECG testing after OU care, stress echocardiography after OU care, and MDCT with no OU care. Three patient populations were modeled with the prevalence of symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) being very low risk, 2%; low risk, 6% (base case); and moderate risk, 10%. Outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), the ratio of change in costs of one test over another to the change in QALY, were calculated for comparisons between each strategy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results to assumptions regarding the characteristics of the risk stratification strategies, costs, utility weights, and likelihood of events. RESULTS: In the base case, the mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) costs and QALYs for each risk stratification strategy were MDCT arm $2,684 (+/- $1,773 to $4,418) and 24.69 (+/- 24.54 to 24.76) QALYs, stress echocardiography arm $3,265 (+/- $2,383 to $4,836) and 24.63 (+/- 24.28 to 24.74) QALYs, and stress ECG arm $3,461 (+/- $2,533 to $4,996) and 24.59 (+/- 24.21 to 24.75) QALYs. The MDCT dominated (less costly and more effective) both OU plus stress echocardiography and OU plus stress ECG. This resulted in an ICER where the MDCT arm dominated the stress echocardiography arm (95% confidence interval [CI] = dominant to $29,738) and where MDCT dominated the ECG arm (95% CI = dominant to $7,332). The MDCT risk stratification arm also dominated stress echocardiography and stress ECG in the 2 and 10% prevalence scenarios, which demonstrated the same ICER trends as the 6% prevalence CAD base case. The thresholds where the MDCT arm remained a cost-saving strategy compared to the other risk stratification strategies were cost of MDCT, < $2,097; cost of OU care, > $1,092; prevalence of CAD, < 70%; MDCT specificity, > 65%; and a MDCT indeterminate rate, < 30%. CONCLUSIONS: In this computer-based model analysis, the MDCT risk stratification strategy is less costly and more effective than both OU-based stress echocardiography and stress ECG risk stratification strategies in chest pain patients presenting to the ED with low to moderate prevalence of CAD.",2008-01-04276,19086322,Acad Emerg Med,Rahul K Khare,2008,15 / 7,623-32,No,19086322,"Rahul K Khare; D Mark Courtney; Emilie S Powell; Arjun K Venkatesh; Todd A Lee; Sixty-four-slice computed tomography of the coronary arteries: cost-effectiveness analysis of patients presenting to the emergency department with low-risk chest pain, Acad Emerg Med, 2008-Jul; 15(7):1069-6563; 623-32",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Echocardiogram vs. Electrocardiogram,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-21300,United States,2007,-26587.35
