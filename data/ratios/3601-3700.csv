3601,Cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure therapy for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (OSAH) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent collapse of the upper airway during sleep, and is associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). Common first-line therapy for OSAH is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of CPAP therapy vs none for the treatment of OSAH. METHODS: We used a 5-year Markov model that considers the costs and quality-of-life improvements of CPAP therapy, accounting for the gains from reduced MVC rates. Utility values were obtained from published studies. The MVC rates under the CPAP and no-CPAP scenarios were calculated from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data and a systematic review of published studies. Costs of MVCs, equipment, and physicians were obtained from US Medicare and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The target population included male and female patients aged 25 to 54 years and newly diagnosed as having moderate to severe OSAH. We examined the findings from the perspectives of a third-party payer and society. RESULTS: From a third-party payer or a societal perspective, CPAP therapy was more effective but more costly than no CPAP, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $3354 or $314 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimate was most dependent on viewpoint (varying more than 10-fold between societal and third-party payer perspectives) and choice of utility measurement method (varying more than 5-fold between the use of standard gamble and EuroQol 5D utility assessment values). CONCLUSION: When quality of life, costs of therapy, and MVC outcomes are considered, CPAP therapy for patients with OSAH is economically attractive.",2006-01-02676,16682570,Arch Intern Med,Najib T Ayas,2006,166 / 9,977-84,No,16682570,"Najib T Ayas; J Mark FitzGerald; John A Fleetham; David P White; Michael Schulzer; C Frank Ryan; Reza Ghaeli; G William Mercer; Peter Cooper; Michael C Y Tan; Carlo A Marra; Cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure therapy for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea, Arch Intern Med, 2006-May-08; 166(9):0003-9926; 977-84",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,OSAH treatment with continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP),Not Stated,55 Years,25 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,314,United States,2003,441.67
3602,Decision analysis in aerospace medicine: costs and benefits of a hyperbaric facility in space,"INTRODUCTION: Assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station (ISS) requires an unprecedented number of spacewalks, which expose astronauts to the risk of decompression sickness (DCS). We illustrate the use of decision analysis to compare a hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) chamber to currently available therapy for DCS treatment on the ISS. METHODS: A decision-analytic model that simulates events over the lifespan of the ISS was constructed. Inputs to the model for probabilities, costs, and measures of morbidity and mortality were derived from a variety of sources, including a systematic literature review and an iterative consultation process with personnel at the Canadian Space Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The decision model was analyzed using the methods of Monte-Carlo simulation and expected value calculation. Main outcome measures included the present value of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and the cumulative probability of mission-related events over the life cycle of the ISS. Sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: The HBO chamber strategy is associated with a mean cost of -12.5 million dollarsw (a net cost saving of 12.5 million dollars) with a 95% CI (-112.8 million dollars, 51.3 million dollars). An HBO chamber reduces the likelihood of a premature shuttle return and a premature Soyuz return by 8% and 3%, respectively. The result is sensitive to the lifespan of the ISS. CONCLUSIONS: At a 50 million dollars cost, an HBO chamber is likely, though not certain, to result in cost savings.

3603,Value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of biliary abnormalities in postcholecystectomy patients: a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis of diagnostic strategies,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is considered the gold standard for imaging of the biliary tract but is associated with complications. Less invasive imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), have a much lower complication rate. The accuracy of MRCP is comparable to that of ERCP, and MRCP may be more effective and cost-effective, particularly in cases for which the suspected prevalence of disease is low and further intervention can be avoided. A model was constructed to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MRCP and ERCP in patients with a previous history of cholecystectomy, presenting with abdominal pain and/or abnormal liver function tests. METHODS: Diagnostic accuracy estimates came from a systematic review of MRCP. A decision analytic model was constructed to represent the diagnostic and treatment pathway of this patient group. The model compared the following two diagnostic strategies: (i) MRCP followed with ERCP if positive, and then management based on ERCP; and (ii) ERCP only. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were used to assess the likelihood of MRCP being cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses examined the impact of prior probabilities of common bile duct stones (CBDS) and test performance characteristics. The outcomes considered were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost per additional QALY. RESULTS: The deterministic analysis indicated that MRCP was dominant over ERCP. At prior probabilities of CBDS, less than 60 percent MRCP was the less costly initial diagnostic test; above this threshold, ERCP was less costly. Similarly, at probabilities of CBDS less than 68 percent, MRCP was also the more effective strategy (generated more QALYs). Above this threshold, ERCP became the more effective strategy. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that, in this patient group for which there is a low to moderate probability of CBDS, there was a 59 percent likelihood that MRCP was cost-saving, an 83 percent chance that MRCP was more effective with a higher quality adjusted survival, and an 83 percent chance that MRCP had a cost-effectiveness ratio more favorable than dollars 50,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Costs and cost-effectiveness are dependent upon the prior probability of CBDS. However, probabilistic analysis indicated that, with a high degree of certainty, MRCP was the more effective and cost-effective initial test in postcholecystectomy patients with a low to moderate probability of CBDS.",2006-01-02678,16673687,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Kirsten Howard,2006,22 / 1,109-18,No,16673687,"Kirsten Howard; Sarah J Lord; Anthony Speer; Robert N Gibson; Robert Padbury; Brendon Kearney; Value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of biliary abnormalities in postcholecystectomy patients: a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis of diagnostic strategies, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2006; 22(1):0266-4623; 109-18",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatograpy (MRCP) with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if positive, then management based on ERCP",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1318.87,Australia,2004,-1330.79
3604,Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) for the treatment of severe sepsis in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) compared with best supportive care in a UK cohort of adult intensive-care patients with severe sepsis. METHODS: A systematic review of evidence on the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) was undertaken, and a decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treatment in the United Kingdom. Trial data from the Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) study have been synthesized with other data, including UK data on severe sepsis, to estimate the costs and consequences of treatment over time. RESULTS: For patients with severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction, the estimates of cost per life year and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are pounds 4931 and pounds 8228, respectively. For patients with severe sepsis alone, the cost per life-year and cost per QALY are pouhds 5495 and pounds 9161, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the therapeutic cost for drotrecogin alfa (activated) appears high (at around pounds 5000 per patient) and the potential impact on the provider budget is considerable, drotrecogin alfa (activated) is clinically effective, represents a cost-effective use of resources, and is a significant advance in the treatment of severe sepsis in patients requiring intensive care.",2006-01-02679,16673685,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Colin Green,2006,22 / 1,90-100,No,16673685,"Colin Green; Jacqueline Dinnes; Andrea L Takeda; Brian H Cuthbertson; Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) for the treatment of severe sepsis in the United Kingdom, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2006; 22(1):0266-4623; 90-100",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Drotrecogin alfa (activated) plus conventional care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,9161,United Kingdom,2003,21063.68

3606,Cost-effectiveness of a supplementary class-based exercise program in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a class-based exercise program supplementing a home-based program when compared with a home-based program alone. In addition, we estimated the probability that the supplementary class program is cost-effective over a range of values of a decision maker's willingness to pay for an additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). METHODS: The resource use and effectiveness data were collected as part of the clinical trial detailed elsewhere. Unit costs were estimated from published sources. The net benefit approach to cost-effectiveness analysis is used to estimate the probability of the intervention being cost-effective. RESULTS: The addition of a supplementary class-based group results in an increase in QALYs and lower costs. For all plausible values of a decision maker's willingness to pay for a QALY, the supplementary class group is likely to be cost-effective.

3607,Randomized trial of a brief physiotherapy intervention compared with usual physiotherapy for neck pain patients: cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of brief physiotherapy intervention versus usual physiotherapy management in patients with neck pain of musculoskeletal origin in the community setting. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial. Individuals 18 years of age and older with neck pain of more than 2 weeks were recruited from physiotherapy departments with referrals from general practitioners (GPs) in the East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire regions in the United Kingdom. A total of 139 patients were allocated to the brief intervention, and 129 to the usual physiotherapy. Resource use data were prospectively collected on the number of physiotherapy sessions, hospital stay, specialist, and GP visits. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using EQ-5D data collected at baseline, 3 and 12 months from the start of the treatment. The economic evaluation was conducted from the U.K. National Health System perspective. RESULTS: On average, brief intervention produced lower costs (pounds--68; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], pounds--103 to pounds--35) and marginally lower QALYs (-0.001; 95 percent CI, -0.030 to 0.028) compared with usual physiotherapy, resulting in an incremental cost per QALY of pounds 68,000 for usual physiotherapy. These results are sensitive to patients' treatment preferences.

3608,Cost effectiveness of bisphosphonates in the management of breast cancer patients with bone metastases,"BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are recommended to prevent skeletal related events (SREs) in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM). However, their clinical and economic profiles vary from one agent to the other. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using modeling techniques, we simulated from the perspective of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) the cost and quality adjusted survival (QALY) associated with five commonly-used bisphosphonates or no therapy in this patient population. The simulation followed patients into several health states (i.e. alive or dead, experiencing an SRE or no SRE, and receiving first or second line therapy). Drugs costs, infusion costs, SREs costs, and utility values were estimated from published sources. Utilities were applied to time with and without SREs to capture the impact on quality of life. RESULTS: Compared to no therapy, all bisphosphonates are either cost saving or highly cost-effective (with a cost per QALY < or = 6126 pounds sterlings). Within this evaluation, zoledronic acid was more effective and less expensive than all other options.

3612,Modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis of etanercept in adults with rheumatoid arthritis in Japan: a preliminary analysis,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist etanercept is an antirheumatic agent which was approved by Japanese regulatory authorities in January 2005. In Japan, the cost-effectiveness of this therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not previously been evaluated. This study models the cost-utility of etanercept in comparison with standard therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) among adult Japanese RA patients who have failed a previous course of the DMARD bucillamine. A Markov model with 6-month cycles was constructed to compare two therapeutic strategies: etanercept versus standard therapy. For each cycle, one of three options was possible: a patient could (i) remain on current therapy if American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% clinical improvement (ACR20) were achieved, (ii) switch to another drug in the therapeutic pathway if ACR20 was not achieved or if side effects severe enough to cause treatment discontinuation occurred, or (iii) they could die. The therapeutic pathway for the etanercept strategy was etanercept, methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), combination therapy (MTX + SSZ) and, finally, no DMARD. The pathway for standard therapy was identical except the initial therapy was MTX (etanercept was excluded). Results from clinical trials in U.S. and European patient populations were used to derive model probabilities for disease progression, response to drug therapy, and relationships between ACR20 response and functional improvement as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index. An equation was developed to predict utility from HAQ scores of Japanese patients. Costs for drugs and medical services in Japan were obtained for April 2003. Analysis was conducted from a societal perspective, including lost productivity costs due to RA disability and premature mortality. Costs were discounted at 6% annually, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at 1.5% annually. Model parameters were varied by 20% above and below base-case values in sensitivity analyses. Compared to standard therapy, the etanercept strategy was yen6.39 million more costly per patient but yielded an additional 2.56 QALYs. The incremental cost-utility ratio was yen 2.50 million/QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed that cost-utility was most strongly influenced by the acquisition cost of etanercept and the percentage of etanercept recipients who achieved ACR20. Using commonly applied thresholds for acceptable cost-effectiveness in the United States ($50 000 = yen 5.5 million/QALY) and the United Kingdom (pound 30 000 = yen 5.7 million/QALY), etanercept therapy in Japan can be considered cost-effective. Cost-utility ratios did not exceed these thresholds in any sensitivity analysis.

METHODS: Clinical and economic data were taken from the GOAL study, supplemented with data on health related quality of life, in order to estimate the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) results for each of three strata (previously corticosteroid-free, low- and moderate-dose corticosteroid users). A series of statistical models of trial outcomes was used to construct cost effectiveness estimates across the strata of the multinational GOAL study including adjustment to the UK experience. Uncertainty was handled using the non-parametric bootstrap. Cost-effectiveness was compared with other treatments for chronic conditions. RESULT: Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate improved the proportion of patients achieving totally and well-controlled weeks resulting in a similar QALY gain across the three strata of GOAL. Additional costs of treatment were greatest in stratum 1 and least in stratum 3, with some of the costs offset by reduced health care resource use. Cost-effectiveness by stratum was 7600 pound (95% CI: 4800-10,700 pound) per QALY gained for stratum 3; 11,000 pound (8600-14,600 pound) per QALY gained for stratum 2; and 13,700 pound (11,000-18,300 pound) per QALY gained for stratum 1.

METHODS: Clinical and economic data were taken from the GOAL study, supplemented with data on health related quality of life, in order to estimate the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) results for each of three strata (previously corticosteroid-free, low- and moderate-dose corticosteroid users). A series of statistical models of trial outcomes was used to construct cost effectiveness estimates across the strata of the multinational GOAL study including adjustment to the UK experience.

3617,Prophylactic strategies for hepatitis B patients undergoing liver transplant: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Hepatitis B immunoglobulin with lamivudine prophylaxis (LAM/HBIG) is effective in preventing Hepatitis B (HBV) recurrence posttransplant but is expensive and inconvenient. Lamivudine-resistant HBV, which has limited the usefulness of lamivudine monoprophylaxis in transplant, can now be effectively controlled with adefovir dipivoxil. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis on the strategies of lamivudine prophylaxis with adefovir rescue(LAM/ADV) compared to combination LAM/intravenous fixed high-dose HBIG prophylaxis(LAM/ivHBIG) or LAM/intramuscular HBIG prophylaxis(LAM/imHBIG). Markov modeling was performed with analysis from societal perspective. Probability rates were derived from systematic review of the literature and cost taken from MEDICARE database. Outcome measures were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) and cost to prevent each HBV recurrence and death. Analysis was performed at 5 years posttransplant as well as at end of life expectancy (15 years). Combination LAM/ivHBIG cost an additional USD562,000 at 15 years, while LAM/imHBIG cost an additional USD139,000 per patient compared to LAM/ADV. Although there is an estimated increase in recurrence of 53% with LAM/ADV and 7.6% increased mortality at the end of life expectancy (15 years), the ICER of LAM/ivHBIG over LAM/ADV treatment is USD760,000 per quality-adjusted life-years and for LAM/imHBIG, USD 188,000. Cost-effectiveness is most sensitive to cost of HBIG. Lamivudine prophylaxis with adefovir dipivoxil salvage offers the more cost-effective option for HBV patients undergoing liver transplant but with higher recurrence and death rate using a model that favors LAM/HBIG.

3621,Economic evaluation of controlled-release oxycodone vs oxycodone-acetaminophen for osteoarthritis pain of the hip or knee,"OBJECTIVE: To examine, in routine practice, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oxycodone (OxyContin) compared with standard therapy for osteoarthritis pain. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label active-controlled randomized naturalistic 4-month study of oxycodone vs a combination of oxycodone-acetaminophen (Percocet). METHODS: Outcomes and health resource utilization data were collected by telephone interview. Effectiveness was measured among 485 patients as the proportion having at least 20% improvement from baseline in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated from the Health Utilities Index 3 score. Cost-effectiveness was measured as cost per patient improved and the QALYs gained, using generic oxycodone-acetaminophen in the base case for the healthcare and societal perspectives. Uncertainty was evaluated using multiple 1-way sensitivity analyses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Improvement occurred in 62.2% of patients with oxycodone and in 45.9% of patients with oxycodone-acetaminophen (P < .001). After adjustment for baseline differences, 0.0105 QALYs were gained with oxycodone compared with oxycodone-acetaminophen (P = .17). The mean societal costs per patient during 4 months were 7379 US dollars and 7528 US dollars for oxycodone and oxycodone-acetaminophen, respectively (P = .33). Oxycodone was more effective and less costly than oxycodone-acetaminophen based on the societal perspective (including costs associated with time lost). Based on the healthcare perspective (excluding costs associated with time lost), the cost-effectiveness of oxycodone was 4883 US dollars per patient improved and 75,810 US dollars per QALY gained. The base-case results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: From the societal perspective, oxycodone was more effective and less costly than oxycodone-acetaminophen. From the healthcare perspective, oxycodone (compared with generic oxycodone-acetaminophen) fell within the acceptable range of cost-effectiveness between 50,000 US dollars and 100,000 US dollars per QALY gained.",2006-01-02713,16610922,Am J Manag Care,Deborah A Marshall,2006,12 / 4,205-14,No,16610922,"Deborah A Marshall; Marcie E Strauss; Dan Pericak; Melanie Buitendyk; Christine Codding; George W Torrance; Economic evaluation of controlled-release oxycodone vs oxycodone-acetaminophen for osteoarthritis pain of the hip or knee, Am J Manag Care, 2006-Apr; 12(4):1088-0224; 205-14",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with controlled release Oxycodone (OxyContin),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-14190.48,United States,2005,-18805.18
3622,Cost effectiveness of management of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis with 1% pimecrolimus cream in children and adolescents 2-17 years of age,"INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) has the potential to cause a long-term economic impact on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. OBJECTIVE: To determine if 1% pimecrolimus cream is cost-effective in treating mild-to-moderate AD in patients 2-17 years of age. METHODS: Data on the efficacy of AD management with 1% pimecrolimus cream (Elidel, Novartis Pharma GmbH, Wehr, Germany) were obtained from a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, multinational, controlled clinical trial comparing pimecrolimus and conventional therapy. Markov modeling was used for the economic model, based on: (i) Investigator's Global Assessment scores assessed at each visit during the clinical trial; (ii) estimated costs for medication and physician visits for each level of disease severity; and (iii) utility values for each level of disease severity. The perspective was that of a third-party payer. RESULTS: In 2004 US dollars, the incremental cost-effectiveness of 1% pimecrolimus cream was 38,231 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared with conventional therapy. Sensitivity analyses showed a range of 27,299 US dollarsto 63,457 US dollars per QALY gained.

3623,A cost-utility analysis of losartan versus atenolol in the treatment of hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy,"INTRODUCTION: The LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension) study demonstrated a 13% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke or death) for patients with hypertension and electrocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) treated with losartan compared with atenolol. Losartan recipients also had a 25% relative risk reduction for stroke compared with atenolol recipients. Incorporating the results found in the LIFE study into an economic model, an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing losartan with atenolol in the treatment of 67-year old patients with hypertension and LVH. METHODS: A Markov state transition model, based on published results of the LIFE trial (mean follow-up of 4.8 years), was utilised to extrapolate the outcomes observed in this trial to the patients' lifetime. Utility estimates for the associated health states were obtained from various published sources. Lifetime treatment costs were calculated adopting a societal perspective. Both costs and benefits were discounted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The estimated ICER for losartan versus atenolol was 1337 Canadian dollars per QALY gained (1 Canadian dollar =0.75 US dollars, 2002 values). This ICER was robust to extensive sensitivity analysis, demonstrating a 95% probability that the ICER would be <20,000 Canadian dollars per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: From a Canadian societal perspective, losartan appears to be a cost-effective alternative to atenolol in patients with hypertension and LVH.

3624,Post-exposure influenza prophylaxis with oseltamivir: cost effectiveness and cost utility in families in the UK,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness and cost utility of preventing post-exposure influenza infection using the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir from a healthcare payer's perspective in the UK. METHODS: A simulation model was developed, based on clinical trial results and published data, to predict morbidity and mortality due to influenza and to compare oseltamivir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with no prophylaxis within families with members aged >or=13 years. Two scenarios were tested:1. Comparison of patients receiving PEP versus patients not receiving PEP and not being treated with oseltamivir should they become infected. 2. Comparison of patients receiving PEP versus patients not receiving PEP but being treated with oseltamivir should they become infected. The model was run with an attack rate in household contacts of 8% for the base case, with higher rates (up to 30%, representing pandemic conditions) tested in sensitivity analyses. A societal perspective and other key parameters were tested in sensitivity analysis. The year of costing was 2002. The time span for the model was up to 1 year (including one influenza season), but loss of life was included in the QALY calculation and based on expected life expectancy. RESULTS: PEP with oseltamivir results in reduced morbidity (i.e. fewer influenza cases) and associated reductions in complications, hospitalisations and mortality due to influenza. When comparing oseltamivir PEP with no prophylaxis for contact attack rates of 8%, 12% and 30%, the mean costs per QALY gained for scenario one were estimated at 29,938 pounds, 18,697 pounds and 5403 pounds, respectively; the mean costs per case avoided were 467 pounds, 293 pounds and 84 pounds, respectively. The corresponding results for scenario two were 52,202 pounds, 31,610 pounds and 9688 pounds per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: PEP with oseltamivir is likely to be a cost-effective strategy for family contacts in the UK from a healthcare payer perspective when influenza-like illness contact attack rates are 8% or higher and the only treatment given is 'usual care'.",2006-01-02718,16605283,Pharmacoeconomics,Beate Sander,2006,24 / 4,373-86,Yes,16605283,"Beate Sander; Frederick G Hayden; Marlene Gyldmark; Louis P Garrison; Post-exposure influenza prophylaxis with oseltamivir: cost effectiveness and cost utility in families in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(4):1179-2027; 373-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Post-exposure Influenza prophylaxis with Oseltamivir,Not Stated,Not Stated,13 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,1.50,29938,United Kingdom,2002,64713.75
3625,Clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation for people with end-stage heart failure: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"AIMS: To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular (LV) assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to transplant (BTT) for people with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) through a systematic review and economic evaluation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The systematic review and economic evaluation was conducted according to internationally recognized methods. The search strategy identified systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and observational studies evaluating the effects of LVADs on survival, functional capacity, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness was assessed through a 5-year decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of LVADs compared with usual care. Despite the poor methodological quality of the 18 studies included, LVADs appear beneficial improving survival, functional status, and quality of life. Adverse events are a serious concern. The economic evaluation showed that LVADs had a cost per quality adjusted life year of pound 65,242 (95% confidence interval pound 34,194-364,564). Sensitivity analysis showed that post-heart transplant survival gains, pre-heart transplant patient utility, and one-off costs associated with implantation determine cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Although LVADs appear clinically effective as a BTT for people with ESHF, it is unlikely that they will be cost-effective unless costs decrease or the benefits of their use increase.",2006-01-02721,16603577,Eur Heart J,Andrew J Clegg,2006,27 / 24,2929-38,No,16603577,"Andrew J Clegg; David A Scott; Emma Loveman; Jill L Colquitt; Pam Royle; Jackie Bryant; Clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation for people with end-stage heart failure: a systematic review and economic evaluation, Eur Heart J, 2006-Dec; 27(24):0195-668X; 2929-38",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,6.00,1.50,65242,United Kingdom,2003,150009.44
3626,Anastrozole is cost-effective vs tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer: Canadian perspectives on the ATAC completed-treatment analysis,"GOALS OF WORK: To conduct an economic analysis comparing tamoxifen and anastrozole (Arimidex) in the adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), post-menopausal early breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An economic model examined typical patients (64 years of age, HR+, 64% node negative) from the Arimidex, tamoxifen alone, or in combination (ATAC) trial over a lifetime horizon. Rates of events were derived from ATAC trial results. Post-trial event rates were drawn from the literature for tamoxifen; event rates for anastrozole were modified by the relative risks observed in the ATAC trial. Resource utilization was drawn from Statistics Canada's Population Health Model for breast cancer, supplemented by an expert panel. A public health care system perspective, 2004 Canadian prices and a 5% discount rate were employed. RESULTS: Anastrozole-taking patients incurred additional hormonal treatment costs compared to tamoxifen-taking patients (incremental lifetime cost, 6,974 Canadian dollars per patient), partially offset by reduced downstream recurrences of breast cancer (1,143 Canadian dollars lifetime savings per patient) for a net incremental cost of 5,796 Canadian dollars per patient on anastrozole. The anastrozole-treated patients were projected to experience a 5.6% absolute risk reduction of first breast cancer recurrence and a 2.8% absolute risk reduction in breast cancer death. This corresponded to 30,000 Canadian dollars per life year gained and 28,000 Canadian dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained (95% confidence interval, 17,428 to 54,605 Canadian dollars). The results were affected by the duration and extent of anastrozole benefit under sensitivity analysis but remained cost-effective.

The objective of this study was to compare the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by these four treatment alternatives. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate the healthcare resource utilization and QALYs of the four treatment alternatives for patients presenting with menorrhagia over 5 years. Clinical inputs were estimated from literature, and the cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of healthcare provider in Hong Kong.

3629,"A cost-utility analysis of hysterectomy, endometrial resection and ablation and medical therapy for menorrhagia","BACKGROUND: Four types of treatment [hysterectomy, endometrial resection/ablation, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and oral medical therapy] are available for management of menorrhagia. The objective of this study was to compare the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by these four treatment alternatives. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate the healthcare resource utilization and QALYs of the four treatment alternatives for patients presenting with menorrhagia over 5 years. Clinical inputs were estimated from literature, and the cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of healthcare provider in Hong Kong. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that the hysterectomy group was the most effective (4.725 QALYs) alternative with the highest cost (USD6878, 1USD=7.8HKD). The incremental cost per additional QALY (ICER) gained by hysterectomy was USD23 500. The probability of extra surgery in the endometrial resection/ablation was an influential factor.

3630,The cost-effectiveness of infliximab (Remicade) in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with infliximab (Remicade) in Canada over the long term, with both international and Canadian treatment regimens. METHODS: A previously published disease model based on functional capacity and disease activity was adapted to the Canadian setting. Current resource consumption from a cross-sectional bottom-up burden-of-illness study in 545 patients at different levels of severity of AS in 4 Canadian provinces was incorporated into the model. Cost-effectiveness estimates were based on a 3-month placebo-controlled clinical trial with 2-year open extension as well as a 4-year followup study of clinical practice in Canada. In the cost-effectiveness model, patients with insufficient response to treatment at 12 weeks (> or = 50% reduction in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) discontinue treatment. In view of the long disease duration, simulations over a 30-year timeframe were performed, incorporating disease progression from cohort studies and assumptions about treatment continuation beyond the clinical trial from the trial extension period. Results are presented in Canadian dollars, from the societal and healthcare payer perspectives, with both costs and effects discounted at 5%. RESULTS: Over a 30-year timeframe, with the assumption that patients' disease would remain stable while on treatment, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the societal perspective is $37,491, using the treatment regimen in the clinical trial (5 mg/kg every 6 weeks). Using the dosing regimen of the Canadian study (75% at 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks, 15% at 3 mg/kg every 6 weeks, and 10% at 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) the cost per QALY is dollar 10,264. Assuming that patients on treatment progress at half the rate of untreated patients, the cost-effectiveness ratios are dollar 45,121 and dollar 13,883, respectively, while the most conservative assumption that progression is the same in both arms, the ratios are dollar 54,137 and dollar 18,712, respectively. The results are sensitive to the dosing regimen adopted, the discontinuation rate, and assumptions concerning disease progression while on treatment.

3633,A cost/utility analysis of open reduction and internal fixation versus cast immobilization for acute nondisplaced mid-waist scaphoid fractures,"BACKGROUND: Open reduction and internal fixation and cast immobilization are both acceptable treatment options for nondisplaced waist fractures of the scaphoid. The authors conducted a cost/utility analysis to weigh open reduction and internal fixation against cast immobilization in the treatment of acute nondisplaced mid-waist scaphoid fractures. METHODS: The authors used a decision-analytic model to calculate the outcomes and costs of open reduction and internal fixation and cast immobilization, assuming the societal perspective. Utilities were assessed from 50 randomly selected medical students using the time trade-off method. Outcome probabilities taken from the literature were factored into the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years associated with each treatment. The authors estimated medical costs using Medicare reimbursement rates, and costs of lost productivity were estimated by average wages obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. RESULTS: Open reduction and internal fixation offers greater quality-adjusted life-years compared with casting, with an increase ranging from 0.21 quality-adjusted life-years for the 25- to 34-year age group to 0.04 quality-adjusted life-years for the > or =65-year age group. Open reduction and internal fixation is less costly than casting ($7940 versus $13,851 per patient) because of a longer period of lost productivity with casting. Open reduction and internal fixation is therefore the dominant strategy. When considering only direct costs, the incremental cost/utility ratio for open reduction and internal fixation ranges from $5438 per quality-adjusted life-year for the 25- to 34-year age group to $11,420 for the 55- to 64-year age group, and $29,850 for the > or =65-year age group.

3643,A new methodology for cost-effectiveness studies of domestic radon remediation programmes: quality-adjusted life-years gained within primary care trusts in central England,"Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas, high levels of which are associated with geological formations such as those found in Northamptonshire and North Oxfordshire in the UK. The UK's National Radiological Protection Board have designated both districts as radon Affected Areas. Radiation levels due to radon, therefore, exceed 200 Bq m(-3), the UK's domestic Action Level, in over one percent of domestic properties. Because of radon's radioactivity, exposure to the gas can potentially cause lung cancer, and has been linked to some 2000 deaths a year in the UK. Consequently, when radiation levels exceed the Action Level, remediation against radon's effects is recommended to householders. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of remediation measures in Northamptonshire and North Oxfordshire by estimating cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained in four Primary Care Trusts, organisations that play a key public health policy role in the UK's National Health Service.

3647,Early assessment of the likely cost-effectiveness of a new technology: A Markov model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis of computer-assisted total knee replacement,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to apply a Markov model to compare cost-effectiveness of total knee replacement (TKR) using computer-assisted surgery (CAS) with that of TKR using a conventional manual method in the absence of formal clinical trial evidence. METHODS: A structured search was carried out to identify evidence relating to the clinical outcome, cost, and effectiveness of TKR. Nine Markov states were identified based on the progress of the disease after TKR. Effectiveness was expressed by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The simulation was carried out initially for 120 cycles of a month each, starting with 1,000 TKRs. A discount rate of 3.5 percent was used for both cost and effectiveness in the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. Then, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out using a Monte Carlo approach with 10,000 iterations. RESULTS: Computer-assisted TKR was a long-term cost-effective technology, but the QALYs gained were small. After the first 2 years, the incremental cost per QALY of computer-assisted TKR was dominant because of cheaper and more QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was sensitive to the ""effect of CAS,"" to the CAS extra cost, and to the utility of the state ""Normal health after primary TKR,"" but it was not sensitive to utilities of other Markov states. Both probabilistic and deterministic analyses produced similar cumulative serious or minor complication rates and complex or simple revision rates. They also produced similar ICERs. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional TKR, computer-assisted TKR is a cost-saving technology in the long-term and may offer small additional QALYs. The ""effect of CAS"" is to reduce revision rates and complications through more accurate and precise alignment, and although the conclusions from the model, even when allowing for a full probabilistic analysis of uncertainty, are clear, the ""effect of CAS"" on the rate of revisions awaits long-term clinical evidence.",2006-01-02736,16571195,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Hengjin Dong,2006,22 / 2,191-202,No,16571195,"Hengjin Dong; Martin Buxton; Early assessment of the likely cost-effectiveness of a new technology: A Markov model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis of computer-assisted total knee replacement, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2006; 22(2):0266-4623; 191-202",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Computer-assistant TKR,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-39366.05,United Kingdom,2003,-90513.45
3648,The cost-effectiveness of risedronate in the treatment of osteoporosis: an international perspective,"INTRODUCTION: Risedronate, a bisphosphonate for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, has been shown in several clinical trials to reduce the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The cost-effectiveness of risedronate treatment has previously been evaluated within different country settings using different model and analysis approaches. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of risedronate in postmenopausal women in four European countries -- Sweden, Finland, Spain, and Belgium -- by making use of the same modelling framework and analysis setup. METHODS: A previously developed Markov cohort model for the evaluation of osteoporosis treatments was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of risedronate treatment. For each country, the model was populated with local mortality, fracture incidence, and cost data. Hip fractures, clinical vertebral fractures, and wrist fractures were included in the model. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained from a 5-year intervention with risedronate compared to ""no intervention"" in 70-year-old women at the threshold of osteoporosis [T-score = -2.5 based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III data] and previous vertebral fracture was estimated to be euro 860, euro 19,532, euro 11,782, and euro 32,515 in Sweden, Finland, Belgium, and Spain, respectively. Among 70-year-old women at the threshold of osteoporosis without previous fracture the estimated cost per QALY gained ranged from euro 21,148 (Sweden) to euro 80,100 (Spain). The differences in cost-effectiveness between countries are mainly explained by different costs (fracture and treatment costs), fracture risks, and discount rates. Based on cost per QALY gained threshold values found in the literature, the study results indicated risedronate to be cost effective in the treatment of elderly women with established osteoporosis in all the included countries. CONCLUSIONS: At a hypothetical threshold value of euro 40,000 per QALY gained, the results in this study indicate that risedronate is a cost-effective treatment in elderly women at the threshold of osteoporosis (i.e., a T-score of -2.5) with prevalent vertebral fractures in Sweden, Finland, Belgium, and Spain.",2006-01-02738,16570118,Osteoporos Int,F Borgström,2006,17 / 7,996-1007,No,16570118,"F Borgström; A Carlsson; H Sintonen; S Boonen; P Haentjens; R Burge; O Johnell; B Jönsson; J A Kanis; The cost-effectiveness of risedronate in the treatment of osteoporosis: an international perspective, Osteoporos Int, 2006; 17(7):0937-941X; 996-1007",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,5 years Risedronate treatment,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,860,Euro,2004,1465.57

For each country, the model was populated with local mortality, fracture incidence, and cost data. Hip fractures, clinical vertebral fractures, and wrist fractures were included in the model. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained from a 5-year intervention with risedronate compared to ""no intervention"" in 70-year-old women at the threshold of osteoporosis [T-score = -2.5 based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III data] and previous vertebral fracture was estimated to be euro 860, euro 19,532, euro 11,782, and euro 32,515 in Sweden, Finland, Belgium, and Spain, respectively. Among 70-year-old women at the threshold of osteoporosis without previous fracture the estimated cost per QALY gained ranged from euro 21,148 (Sweden) to euro 80,100 (Spain). The differences in cost-effectiveness between countries are mainly explained by different costs (fracture and treatment costs), fracture risks, and discount rates. Based on cost per QALY gained threshold values found in the literature, the study results indicated risedronate to be cost effective in the treatment of elderly women with established osteoporosis in all the included countries. CONCLUSIONS: At a hypothetical threshold value of euro 40,000 per QALY gained, the results in this study indicate that risedronate is a cost-effective treatment in elderly women at the threshold of osteoporosis (i.e., a T-score of -2.5) with prevalent vertebral fractures in Sweden, Finland, Belgium, and Spain.",2006-01-02738,16570118,Osteoporos Int,F Borgström,2006,17 / 7,996-1007,No,16570118,"F Borgström; A Carlsson; H Sintonen; S Boonen; P Haentjens; R Burge; O Johnell; B Jönsson; J A Kanis; The cost-effectiveness of risedronate in the treatment of osteoporosis: an international perspective, Osteoporos Int, 2006; 17(7):0937-941X; 996-1007",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,5 years Risedronate treatment,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,41294,Euro,2004,70371.06

3656,Cost-utility model of rasagiline in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease in Finland,"BACKGROUND: The economic burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) is high, especially in patients experiencing motor fluctuations. Rasagiline has demonstrated efficacy against symptoms of PD in early and advanced stages of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility of rasagiline and entacapone as adjunctive therapies to levodopa versus standard levodopa care in PD patients with motor fluctuations in Finland. METHODS: A 2 year probabilistic Markov model with 3 health states: ""25% or less off-time/day,"" ""greater than 25% off-time/day,"" and ""dead"" was used. Off-time represents time awake with poor or absent motor function. Model inputs included transition probabilities from randomized clinical trials, utilities from a preference measurement study, and costs and resources from a Finnish cost-of-illness study. Effectiveness measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and number of months spent with 25% or less off-time/day. Uncertainty around parameters was taken into account by Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: Over 2 years from a societal perspective, rasagiline or entacapone as adjunctive therapies to levodopa showed greater effectiveness than levodopa alone at no additional costs. Benefits after 2 years were 0.13 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.17) additional QALYs and 5.2 (3.6 to 6.7) additional months for rasagiline and 0.12 (0.08 to 0.17) QALYs and 5.1 (3.5 to 6.6) months for entacapone, both in adjunct to levodopa compared with levodopa alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the use of rasagiline and entacapone as adjunctive cost-effective alternatives to levodopa alone in PD patients with motor fluctuations in Finland.

3660,Cost-effectiveness of pediatric heart transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Survival after pediatric heart transplantation has continued to improve. Nonetheless, graft survival is generally <15 years and the costs of transplantation and subsequent immunosuppression are substantial. In the present study, we sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of pediatric heart transplantation. METHODS: Data from 95 pediatric subjects undergoing transplantation at our institution from 1997 through 2004 were reviewed to determine the costs of pediatric heart transplantation. Costs included pre-transplant care, organ procurement, initial hospitalization and follow-up care. Life expectancy was derived from the United Network of Organ Sharing data set. Data were reported as cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, which were discounted at 3%. Cost-effectiveness was stratified by primary transplantation vs re-transplantation. RESULTS: The mean cost of initial hospitalization and organ procurement was $221,897 per patient for primary transplant and $285,296 per patient for re-transplant. Annual follow-up costs were estimated to be $18,141 in the first year (excluding the first 90 days post-transplant) and $18,480 per year thereafter. Under base-case assumptions, costs per QALY gained were $49,679 for primary transplantation and $87,883 for re-transplantation. Sensitivity analysis yielded a cost-utility range of $44,943 to $57,628 per QALY gained for primary transplantation and $70,834 to $103,661 per QALY gained for re-transplantation.

3662,Cost effectiveness of biventricular pacemakers in heart failure patients,"BACKGROUND: Biventricular pacemakers have been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in heart failure (HF) patients and are indicated for those with a New York Heart Association functional class of III or IV and a QRS interval of >130 ms. However, these devices currently cost in the region of dollar US 33,500 and require replacement upon battery depletion. Therefore, determination of the cost effectiveness of resynchronization therapy is important, although little data have been published to date on this topic. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-utility analysis from the healthcare perspective was performed using HF patients who received a biventricular pacing device in the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The comparator was a similarly profiled group of patients who did not receive the device but were treated medically. A Markov model was used to investigate the cost effectiveness at 1 and 5 years. Second-order Monte-Carlo simulation was used to determine the variability in results, using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Medical treatment was dominated by biventricular pacemaker treatment at both 1 and 5 years of follow-up.

3663,Cost-effectiveness of enfuvirtide in HIV therapy for treatment-experienced patients in the United States,"Enfuvirtide (ENF) is the first of a new class of antiretrovirals (ARVs) known as the HIV fusion inhibitors. Two phase III studies of ENF, TORO 1 and TORO 2, demonstrated that ENF given in combination with optimized background (OB) therapy significantly improved virological response, increased the time to virological failure, and increased CD4-cell count compared with OB alone among highly treatment-experienced patients. The present study investigated the long-term clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of ENF. Outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness were estimated using a Markov model. Viral suppression and immune reconstitution were determined from the outcomes of the clinical trials. Time to immunological failure, time to AIDS-defining event (ADE), and time to death were estimated based on published mathematical models of disease progression. Costs were based on published estimates of the use and costs of ARVs, cost of managing ADEs, and cost of laboratory and other outpatient services. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost per year of life gained, adjusted for quality of life. The combined effects of an increase in CD4 count and delayed time to virological and immunological failure with ENF + OB were predicted to produce a mean life expectancy of 7.4 years from initiation of therapy, which was 1.8 years (1.5 quality-adjusted lifeyears [QALYs]) greater than the life expectancy associated with OB alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness of ENF + OB was estimated to be Dollars 24,604 per QALY. ENF is projected to increase time to immunological failure, delay onset of new AIDS-defining events, and increase life expectancy by more than 1.5 years among treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients.

DESIGN: The Global Health Outcomes simulation model was used for a male cohort and for a female cohort as a point of departure but was further extended in order to include the following: (1) the indirect effects of smoking cessation on production and consumption in the economy, and (2) morbidity-specific QALYs gained. SETTING: Sweden in 2001.Patients or participants: Model cohort consisting of 612,851 male and 780,970 female smokers, distributed by age, > or = 35 years old, as in the Swedish population of 2001. INTERVENTIONS: Bupropion, as compared to NRT (nicotine patches and nicotine gums), in smoking cessation programs for a follow-up period of 20 years. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: When the indirect effects on production and consumption were taken into account, bupropion was cost saving in comparison to both NRTs. When only the direct costs were included, bupropion was still cost saving in comparison to nicotine gum. The incremental costs per QALY gained were relatively low for bupropion in comparison to nicotine patches, 6,600 Swedish kronas (SEK) (approximately 725 euro) per QALY gained for men and 4,900 SEK (approximately 535 euro) for women, all calculations in 2001 Swedish prices.

DESIGN: The Global Health Outcomes simulation model was used for a male cohort and for a female cohort as a point of departure but was further extended in order to include the following: (1) the indirect effects of smoking cessation on production and consumption in the economy, and (2) morbidity-specific QALYs gained. SETTING: Sweden in 2001.Patients or participants: Model cohort consisting of 612,851 male and 780,970 female smokers, distributed by age, > or = 35 years old, as in the Swedish population of 2001. INTERVENTIONS: Bupropion, as compared to NRT (nicotine patches and nicotine gums), in smoking cessation programs for a follow-up period of 20 years. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: When the indirect effects on production and consumption were taken into account, bupropion was cost saving in comparison to both NRTs. When only the direct costs were included, bupropion was still cost saving in comparison to nicotine gum. The incremental costs per QALY gained were relatively low for bupropion in comparison to nicotine patches, 6,600 Swedish kronas (SEK) (approximately 725 euro) per QALY gained for men and 4,900 SEK (approximately 535 euro) for women, all calculations in 2001 Swedish prices.

3669,"Cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and treatment with hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene, or alendronate","Recent information about osteoporosis treatments and their nonfracture side effects suggests the need for a new cost-effectiveness analysis. The authors estimate the cost effectiveness of screening women for osteoporosis at age 65 and treating those who screen positive with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), raloxifene, or alendronate. A Markov model of osteoporosis disease progression simulates costs and outcomes of women aged 65 years. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios of screen-and-treat strategies are calculated relative to a no-screen, no-treat (NST) strategy. Disease progression parameters are derived from clinical trials; cost and quality-of-life parameters are based on review of cost databases and cost-effectiveness studies. Women are screened using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and women screening positive are treated with HRT, raloxifene, or alendronate. Screening and treatment with HRT increase costs and lower quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; relative to the NST strategy). The only scenario (of several) in the sensitivity analysis in which HRT increases QALYs is when it is assumed that there are no drug-related (nonfracture) health effects. Raloxifene increases costs and QALYs; its cost-effectiveness ratio is $447,559 per QALY.

3672,Toward targeted hypertension screening guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for screening and subsequent treatment of hypertension vary widely between countries. Part of this variation can be attributed to systematic differences between populations, but little is known about the way in which guidelines should be targeted to the population of interest. Optimal guidelines should have high yield and low complexity. The goal is to fit procedures for screening and subsequent treatment of hypertension optimally to a specific population. METHODS: Simulation study on individual cardiovascular risk profiles, with drug treatment altering the 10-year cardiovascular risk. The analysis compares the consequences of various screening and treatment alternatives. The reference scenario consists of the Dutch hypertension guidelines for primary care. A representative sample of the Dutch population aged 20 years and older is taken as the target. Main outcome measures include incidence, quality-adjusted life years won, number needed to screen, and costs (prevention, morbidity, and mortality). The discount rate is 4%. RESULTS: Strict adherence to the current hypertension guidelines saves costs (i.e., the total prevention costs are less than the costs of prevented morbidity and mortality). The following changes increase its cost-effectiveness: use of lower blood pressure levels for screening and treatment, reduction of the number of screens from 5 to 3, and active call-up of high-risk patients. The adherence to guidelines has a large influence on actual cost-effectiveness achieved in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate targeting of hypertension guidelines to a population and critical appraisal of the entire screening procedure can enhance cost-effectiveness.",2006-01-02767,16525168,Med Decis Making,Stef van Buuren,2006,26 / 2,145-53,No,16525168,"Stef van Buuren; Hendriek C Boshuizen; Sijmen A Reijneveld; Toward targeted hypertension screening guidelines, Med Decis Making, 2006 Mar-Apr; 26(2):0272-989X; 145-53",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Guidelines, basic",Not Stated,Not Stated,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,110964,Euro,2000,153964.02
3673,Cost-consequence analysis in a French setting of screening and optimal treatment of nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes,"AIM: Forty percent of hypertensive type 2 diabetes patients develop nephropathy (microalbuminuria/overt nephropathy), indicating end organ damage, increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and death. In France, screening rates and nephropathy treatment are suboptimal. We assessed the health economic impact of nephropathy screening in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes followed by optimal antihypertensive/nephroprotective therapy in those who have nephropathy in France. METHODS: A Markov/Monte Carlo model simulated lifetime impacts of screening for albuminuria (microalbuminuria/overt nephropathy) using semi-quantitative urine dipsticks in a primary care setting, and subsequent addition of irbesartan 300 mg to conventional therapy in hypertensive type 2 diabetes patients identified as having nephropathy. Progression from no renal disease to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was simulated. Probabilities, utilities and costs of CVD events, medications and ESRD treatment came from published sources. Cumulative incidence of ESRD, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct costs were projected. Second-order Monte Carlo simulation accounted for uncertainty in multiple parameters. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: Screening and optimized treatment led to a 42% reduction in the cumulative incidence of ESRD from 10.1 +/- 9.9% without screening to 5.8 +/- 5.7%, improvements in life expectancy of 0.38 +/- 0.59 years, improvements of 0.29 +/- 0.32 QALYs, and decreased costs of Euro 4,812 +/- 7,882/patient over 25 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. Screening was most beneficial when performed in younger patients.

STUDY DESIGN: Using decision analysis, we compared the cost-effectiveness of dilation and evacuation and misoprostol induction of labor for second-trimester termination. Complications for dilation and evacuation and induction of labor included repeat dilation and curettage, cervical laceration repair, hospital admission, laparotomy, hysterectomy, and maternal death. Induction of labor complications also included failed induction of labor. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant variables. RESULTS: Dilation and evacuation was less costly and more effective than misoprostol induction of labor for second-trimester termination with baseline estimates. In 1-way sensitivity analysis, the model was robust to all variation in probabilities and costs. In Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 trials and a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year, dilation and evacuation was the preferred approach in 97.9% of trials.

The addition of a statin to aspirin therapy becomes more cost-effective when the patient's 10-year CHD risk before treatment is higher than 10%.",2006-01-02770,16520473,Ann Intern Med,Michael Pignone,2006,144 / 5,326-36,No,16520473,"Michael Pignone; Stephanie Earnshaw; Jeffrey A Tice; Mark J Pletcher; Aspirin, statins, or both drugs for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease events in men: a cost-utility analysis, Ann Intern Med, 2006-Mar-07; 144(5):1539-3704; 326-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combination statin with aspirin,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,57100,United States,2003,80315.8
3679,Cost effectiveness of extended adjuvant letrozole in postmenopausal women after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy: the UK perspective,"BACKGROUND: MA17 was a randomised placebo-controlled trial of letrozole 2.5 mg/day in 5187 estrogen receptor-positive, 50% node-negative, postmenopausal women (median age 62 years at enrollment) with early breast cancer, post-5 years' adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. The objective of this evaluation was to extrapolate the findings from the MA17 trial to estimate the lifetime cost effectiveness of letrozole in this setting. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental cost per QALY gained with extended adjuvant letrozole versus no therapy. Probabilities of disease progression and death were estimated using data from the MA17 study and other secondary sources. Costs of breast cancer care (letrozole therapy, surveillance, recurrences, terminal care) and treatment of osteoporosis and utilities were derived from literature. A full probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and cost estimates reflect 2004 values. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Extended adjuvant letrozole resulted in a gain of 0.36 QALYs per patient (13.66 vs 13.30 with no therapy). These benefits were obtained at an additional expected lifetime cost of 3732 pounds per patient (10,833 pounds letrozole vs 7101 pounds with no therapy). Cost effectiveness was estimated at 10,338 pounds per QALY gained (95% CI 5276, 43,828). The results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Five years of letrozole therapy appears to be cost effective from the NHS perspective and should be considered in women with early breast cancer, following tamoxifen adjuvant therapy.",2006-01-02773,16519546,Pharmacoeconomics,Jonathan Karnon,2006,24 / 3,237-50,Yes,16519546,"Jonathan Karnon; Thomas Delea; Stephen R D Johnston; Robert Smith; Jane Brandman; Jennifer Sung; Paul E Goss; Cost effectiveness of extended adjuvant letrozole in postmenopausal women after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy: the UK perspective, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(3):1179-2027; 237-50",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Letrozole 2.5mg/day after 5 years of tamoxifen,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,10338,United Kingdom,2004,25962.68
3680,When to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa? A South African cost-effectiveness study,"BACKGROUND: Large-scale programmes increasing access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are being implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. However, cost-effectiveness of initiating treatment at different CD4 count thresholds has not been explored in resource-poor settings. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a public health perspective using primary treatment outcomes, healthcare utilisation and cost data (Jan 2004 local prices; US dollars 1=7.6 Rands) derived from the Cape Town AIDS Cohort. A Markov state-transition model was developed to estimate life-expectancy, lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cost per life-year and QALY gained for initiating HAART at three CD4 cell count thresholds (<200/microl, 200-350/microl and >350/microl), including the no antiretroviral therapy (No-ART) alternative. Each treatment option was compared with the next most effective undominated option. RESULTS: Mean life-expectancy was 6.2, 18.8, 21.0 and 23.3 years; discounted (8%) QALYs were 3.1, 6.2, 6.7 and 7.4; and discounted lifetime costs were US dollars 5,250, US dollars 5,434, US dollars 5,740, US dollars 6,588 for No-ART, and therapy initiation at <200/microl, 200-350/microl and >350/microl scenarios respectively. Clinical benefits increased significantly with early therapy initiation. Initiating therapy at <200/microl had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US dollars 54 per QALY versus No-ART, 200-350/microl had an ICER of US dollars 616 versus therapy initiation at <200/microl, and >350/microl had an ICER of US dollars 1,137 versus therapy initiation at 200-350/microl. ICERs were sensitive to HAART cost. CONCLUSIONS: HAART is reasonably cost-effective for HIV-infected patients in South Africa, and most effective if initiated when CD4 count >200/microl.

3683,Diagnosis and management of pharyngitis in a pediatric population based on cost-effectiveness and projected health outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Pharyngitis is a common childhood complaint. Current management for children and adolescents includes 1 of 6 strategies, ie, (1) observe without testing or treatment, (2) treat all suspected cases with an antibiotic, (3) treat those with positive throat cultures, (4) treat those with positive rapid tests, (5) treat those with positive rapid tests and those with positive throat cultures after negative rapid tests, or (6) use a clinical scoring measure to determine the diagnosis/treatment strategy. The sequelae of untreated group A hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis are rare, whereas antibiotic treatment may result in side effects ranging from rash to death. The cost-utility of these strategies for children has not been reported previously. METHODS: A decision tree analysis incorporating the total cost and health impact of each management strategy was used to determine cost per quality-adjusted life-year ratios. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations assessed the accuracy of the estimates. RESULTS: From a societal perspective with current Medicaid reimbursements for testing, performing a throat culture for all patients had the best cost-utility. For private insurance reimbursements, rapid antigen testing had the best cost-utility. Observing without testing or treatment had the lowest morbidity rate and highest cost from a societal perspective but the lowest cost from a payer perspective. The model was most sensitive to the incidence of acute rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess after untreated GAS pharyngitis.

3691,Cost utility analysis of physical activity counselling in general practice,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic performance of the 'Green Prescription' physical activity counselling program in general practice. METHODS: Cost utility analysis using a Markov model was used to estimate the cost utility of the Green Prescription program over full life expectancy. Program effectiveness was based on published trial data (878 inactive patients presenting to NZ general practice). Costs were based on detailed costing information and were discounted at 5% per anum. The main outcome measure is cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Extensive one-way sensitivity analyses were performed along with probabilistic (stochastic) analysis. RESULTS: Incremental, modelled cost utility of the Green Prescription program compared with 'usual care' was dollar NZ2,053 per QALY gained over full life expectancy (range dollar NZ827 to dollar NZ37,516 per QALY). Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 90% of ICERs fell below dollar NZ7,500 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a plausible and conservative set of assumptions, if decision makers are willing to pay at least dollar NZ2,000 per QALY gained the Green Prescription program is likely to represent better value for money than 'usual care'. IMPLICATIONS: The Green Prescription program performs well, representing a good buy relative to other published cost effectiveness estimates. Policy makers should consider encouraging general practitioners to prescribe physical activity advice in the primary care setting, in association with support from exercise specialists.",2006-01-02784,16502953,Aust N Z J Public Health,Kim Dalziel,2006,30 / 1,57-63,No,16502953,"Kim Dalziel; Leonie Segal; C Raina Elley; Cost utility analysis of physical activity counselling in general practice, Aust N Z J Public Health, 2006-Feb; 30(1):1326-0200; 57-63",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Green prescription program,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,2053,New Zealand,2001,1260.63
3693,Cost-effectiveness of hemofiltration to prevent contrast nephropathy in patients with chronic kidney disease,"OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic hemofiltration has been reported, in one study, to reduce renal complications and death but necessitates additional up-front health care resource deployment in a critical care setting. We sought to explore the potential scope and cost-effectiveness of this strategy. DESIGN: Economic evaluation using decision analysis. SETTING: Tertiary or quaternary care hospital. PATIENTS: Subjects undergoing angiography at risk for developing contrast nephropathy. INTERVENTION: Prophylactic hemofiltration was compared with intravenous saline. Secondary models incorporated sodium bicarbonate and N-acetylcysteine as comparators. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with hemofiltration compared with intravenous saline in high-risk subjects (mean serum creatinine, 265 micromol/L) was 3,900 US dollars. This finding was sensitive to variations in several important variables. For instance, the cost-effectiveness ratio became less attractive (i.e., >50,000 US dollars/QALY) when hemofiltration was used in lower-risk subjects (serum creatinine, <265 micromol/L). The cost-effectiveness remained <50,000 US dollars/QALY provided that the relative risk of hemofiltration compared with saline alone was below 0.65 (reported relative risk, 0.10). Although based on indirect comparison of clinical efficacy, when N-acetylcysteine or sodium bicarbonate was used as the comparator, the cost per QALY gained for hemofiltration became markedly less attractive (50,100 US dollars and >1,000,000 US dollars), although the relative effectiveness of these three strategies strongly influenced the results. CONCLUSIONS: Use of prophylactic hemofiltration in patients at high risk for contrast nephropathy may be potentially cost-effective only if certain conditions are satisfied, and its attractiveness is materially diminished when compared to other strategies. As this invasive therapy would entail certain immediate resource outlay, before considering its implementation it is crucial to confirm the clinical effectiveness and health care resource consequences of hemofiltration relative to current standards of care in future studies.",2006-01-02796,16484907,Crit Care Med,Scott W Klarenbach,2006,34 / 4,1044-51,No,16484907,"Scott W Klarenbach; Neesh Pannu; Marcello A Tonelli; Braden J Manns; Cost-effectiveness of hemofiltration to prevent contrast nephropathy in patients with chronic kidney disease, Crit Care Med, 2006-Apr; 34(4):0090-3493; 1044-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hemofiltration to prevent contrast nephropathy,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,3900,United States,2005,5168.27
3694,Cost-utility analysis of chemotherapy in symptomatic advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer,"When using chemotherapy in patients with a short life expectancy, outcomes such as symptom improvement or clinical benefit receive increasing attention. Outcomes of subjective benefit to the patient can be rated as a utility in order to perform health economic analyses and comparisons with other treatment conditions. A cost-utility analysis has been performed alongside a prospective randomised clinical trial comparing single agent gemcitabine to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in symptomatic advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. Global quality of life as well as resource utilisation data were collected during first-line chemotherapy for both treatment arms. Incremental costs, utilities and cost-utility ratio were calculated. Per patient, an incremental cost of 1,522 was obtained for gemcitabine compared to cisplatin-vindesine, mainly as a consequence of the direct cost of the cytotoxic drugs. When combined with utilities, this resulted in an incremental cost-utility ratio for gemcitabine of 13,836 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In conclusion, although the least expensive strategy is cisplatin-vindesine, the greater clinical benefit of gemcitabine, resulting in an acceptable incremental cost-utility ratio as compared with other healthcare interventions, balances its higher cost. The gains in subjective outcome achieved with palliative chemotherapy are critical from both a clinical and a health economic point of view.",2006-01-02797,16481384,Eur Respir J,C A Dooms,2006,27 / 5,895-901,No,16481384,"C A Dooms; Y N Lievens; J F Vansteenkiste; Cost-utility analysis of chemotherapy in symptomatic advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer, Eur Respir J, 2006-May; 27(5):0903-1936; 895-901",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gemcitabine·,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,13836,Euro,2000,19197.63

3698,Cost-utility of somatropin (rDNA origin) in the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to generate estimates of cost-effectiveness/utility of somatropin (rDNA origin) in the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children. METHODS: A decision-analytic model of the epidemiology and treatment of GHD in children was developed. Treatment of GHD was assessed in two hypothetical cohorts compared to no treatment--treatment with somatropin 0.030 mg/kg/day from ages 5 to 16 years, and treatment from ages 3 to 18 years. Costs (stated in 2005 US$) included those related to drug acquisition, endocrinologist consultations, and primary care office visits. Estimates of patient weight by age and sex were derived from published literature, as was the proportion of patients achieving normal height through somatropin treatment and pre/post-treatment patient utilities. Cost-effectiveness/utility was estimated over patients' expected lifetimes, and was stated alternatively as discounted (3% per annum) US dollars per normal height year (NHY) gained, and cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure robustness of the model. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of treating children from ages 5 to 16 years with somatropin was estimated at approximately $8,900 per NHY gained and $37,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Corresponding ratios pertaining to treatment of children from ages 3 to 18 years were $9,300 per NHY gained and $42,600 per QALY gained. Findings were relatively insensitive to variation in most model parameters.

3700,Cost-effectiveness of inhaled steroids in asthma: impact of effect on bone mineral density,"BACKGROUND: The effects of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) preparations on bone health have been debated. Multiple analyses have been published examining the question, with mixed results. OBJECTIVES: We examined how assumptions about the effect of ICS on bone mineral density (BMD) influence the cost-effectiveness of ICS in asthma. METHODS: We developed a mathematical simulation model to estimate clinical outcomes and costs for a cohort with mild/moderate asthma. The analysis conformed to reference case recommendations of the US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Sensitivity analysis evaluated the stability of our results to uncertainty in treatment duration, age at treatment, and ICS dose. RESULTS: Assuming a dose of 200 microg twice per day of ICS, a literature-based average effect of ICS on BMD and a 10-year time horizon, we observed a minimal increase in the costs attributed to hip fracture and incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $26,000 per quality-adjusted life-year and $14.00 per symptom-free day gained. Over an extended the time horizon (lifetime), the incremental cost effectiveness ratio increased to $42,000/quality-adjusted life-year. Only under a scenario of high-dose ICS, a lifetime horizon, and a large effect of ICS on BMD did the potential impact of ICS on BMD dramatically affect the economic attractiveness of therapy. CONCLUSION: To minimize any potential impact, use of the lowest effective dose of ICS and measures to target and intervene in high-risk individuals are warranted. However, ICS therapy in mild/moderate asthma compares favorably with commonly accepted interventions over a wide range of assumptions regarding this treatment and its effects on BMD.",2006-01-02809,16461137,J Allergy Clin Immunol,Anne L Fuhlbrigge,2006,117 / 2,359-66,No,16461137,"Anne L Fuhlbrigge; Seung Jin Bae; Scott T Weiss; Karen M Kuntz; A David Paltiel; Cost-effectiveness of inhaled steroids in asthma: impact of effect on bone mineral density, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2006-Feb; 117(2):0091-6749; 359-66",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) preparations,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,26000,United States,2003,36571.12
