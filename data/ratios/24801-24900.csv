24801,Endoscopy for Gastric Cancer Screening Is Cost Effective for Asian Americans in the United States,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer is routine in some countries with high incidence and is associated with reduced gastric cancer-related mortality. Immigrants from countries of high incidence to low incidence of gastric cancer retain their elevated risk, but no screening recommendations have been made for these groups in the United States. We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of different endoscopic screening strategies for noncardia gastric cancer, compared with no screening, among Chinese, Filipino, Southeast Asian, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese Americans. METHODS: We generated a decision-analytic Markov model to simulate a cohort of asymptomatic 50-year-old Asian Americans. The cost effectiveness of 2 distinct strategies for endoscopic gastric cancer screening was compared with no screening for each group, stratified by sex. Outcome measures were reported in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with performing no endoscopic gastric cancer screening, performing a 1-time upper endoscopy with biopsies, with continued endoscopic surveillance if gastric intestinal metaplasia was identified, was cost effective, whereas performing ongoing biennial endoscopies, even for patients with normal findings from endoscopy and histopathology, was not. The lowest ICERs were observed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans (all <$73,748/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer with ongoing surveillance of gastric preneoplasia is cost effective for Asian Americans ages 50 years or older in the United States.

24819,Domestic HPV vaccine price and economic returns for cervical cancer prevention in China: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Coinciding with the release of the first Chinese domestic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Cecolin in 2019, and the substantial advancements in cervical cancer screening technology, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the combined strategies of cervical cancer screening programmes and universal vaccination of girls (aged 9-14 years) with Cecolin in China. METHODS: We did a cost-effectiveness analysis in China, in which we developed a Markov model of cervical cancer to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 61 intervention strategies, including a combination of various screening methods at different frequencies with and without vaccination, and also vaccination alone, from a health-care system perspective. We did univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the model''s findings. FINDINGS: Compared with no intervention, various combined screening and vaccination strategies would incur an additional cost of US$6?157?000-22?146?000 and result in 691-970 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained in a designated cohort of 100?000 girls aged 9-14 years over a lifetime. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times the Chinese per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), careHPV screening (a rapid HPV test) once every 5 years with vaccination would be the most cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21?799 per QALY compared with the lower-cost non-dominated strategy on the cost-effectiveness frontier, and the probability of it being cost-effective (44%) outperformed other strategies. Strategies that combined screening and vaccination would be more cost-effective than screening alone strategies when the vaccination cost was less than $50 for two doses, even with a lower willingness-to-pay of one times the per-capita GDP. INTERPRETATION: careHPV screening once every 5 years with vaccination is the most cost-effective strategy for cervical cancer prevention in China. A reduction in the domestic HPV vaccine price is necessary to ascertain a good economic return for the future vaccination programme.

METHODS: We did a cost-effectiveness analysis in China, in which we developed a Markov model of cervical cancer to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 61 intervention strategies, including a combination of various screening methods at different frequencies with and without vaccination, and also vaccination alone, from a health-care system perspective. We did univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the model''s findings. FINDINGS: Compared with no intervention, various combined screening and vaccination strategies would incur an additional cost of US$6?157?000-22?146?000 and result in 691-970 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained in a designated cohort of 100?000 girls aged 9-14 years over a lifetime. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times the Chinese per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), careHPV screening (a rapid HPV test) once every 5 years with vaccination would be the most cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21?799 per QALY compared with the lower-cost non-dominated strategy on the cost-effectiveness frontier, and the probability of it being cost-effective (44%) outperformed other strategies. Strategies that combined screening and vaccination would be more cost-effective than screening alone strategies when the vaccination cost was less than $50 for two doses, even with a lower willingness-to-pay of one times the per-capita GDP. INTERPRETATION: careHPV screening once every 5 years with vaccination is the most cost-effective strategy for cervical cancer prevention in China. A reduction in the domestic HPV vaccine price is necessary to ascertain a good economic return for the future vaccination programme. The findings provide important evidence that informs health policies for cervical cancer prevention in China.

24828,Cost-Effectiveness of Gliclazide-Based Intensive Glucose Control vs. Standard Glucose Control in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. An Economic Analysis of the ADVANCE Trial in Vietnam,"Introduction: ADVANCE was a large, multinational clinical study conducted over 5 years in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In all, 11,140 patients were randomly assigned to receive gliclazide-based intensive glucose control (IGC) or standard glucose control (SGC). IGC was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of major macrovascular and microvascular events (composite endpoint) or major microvascular events compared with SGC, primarily by enhancing renal protection. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of IGC vs. SGC, based on the ADVANCE results, from a Vietnamese healthcare payer perspective. Materials and Methods: A partitioned survival times model across five health states (no complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease [ESRD], and diabetes-related eye-disease) was designed. Time-to-event curves were informed by the cumulative incidence of events and corresponding hazard ratios from the ADVANCE study. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of ESRD avoided and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs (in US $) comprised treatment costs and health state costs. Utility weights and costs were documented from literature reporting Vietnamese estimates. For sensitivity analyses, all parameters were individually varied within their 95% confidence interval bounds (when available) or within a ±30% range. Results: Over a 5-year horizon, IGC avoided 6.5 additional ESRD events per 1,000 patients treated compared with SGC (IGC, 3.5 events vs. SGC, 10.0 events) and provided 0.016 additional QALYs (IGC, 3.570 QALYs vs. SGC, 3.555 QALYs). Total costs were similar for the two strategies (IGC, $3,786 vs. SGC, $3,757). Although the total drug costs were markedly higher for IGC compared with SGC ($1,703 vs. $873), this was largely offset by the savings from better renal protection with IGC (IGC, $577 vs. SGC, $1,508). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGC vs. SGC was $1,878/QALY gained, far below the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (i.e., 1-3 × gross domestic product per inhabitant ˜$7,500 in Vietnam). The ICER of IGC vs. SGC per ESRD event avoided was $4,559/event. The findings were robust to sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: In Vietnam, gliclazide-based IGC was shown to be cost-effective compared with SGC from a healthcare payer perspective, as defined in the ADVANCE study.",2020-01-34776,33194963,Front Public Health,Hai-Yen Nguyen-Thi,2020,8 /,562023,No,33194963,"Hai-Yen Nguyen-Thi; Nga Tq Nguyen; Nguyen Dang Tu Le; Maud Beillat; Olivier Ethgen; Cost-Effectiveness of Gliclazide-Based Intensive Glucose Control vs. Standard Glucose Control in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

24829,Value of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for patients with septic shock: an early health economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND. This study estimates the maximum price at which mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is deemed cost-effective for septic shock patients and identifies parameters that are most important in making treatment decisions. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model according to the sepsis care trajectory to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of septic shock patients receiving either MSC therapy or usual care over their lifetime. We calculated the therapeutic headroom by multiplying the gains attributable to MSCs with willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold and derived the maximum reimbursable price (MRP) from the expected net monetary benefit and savings attributable to MSCs. We performed scenario analyses to assess the impact of changes to assumptions on the study findings. A value of information analysis is performed to identify parameters with greatest impact on the uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness of MSC therapy. RESULTS: At a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the therapeutic headroom and MRP of MSC therapy were $20,941 and $16,748, respectively; these estimates increased with the larger WTP values and the greater impact of MSCs on in-hospital mortality and hospital discharge rates. The parameters with greatest information value were MSC''s impact on in-hospital mortality and the baseline septic shock in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: At a common WTP of $50,000/QALY, MSC therapy is deemed to be economically attractive if its unit cost does not exceed $16,748.

This study estimates the maximum price at which mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is deemed cost-effective for septic shock patients and identifies parameters that are most important in making treatment decisions. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model according to the sepsis care trajectory to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of septic shock patients receiving either MSC therapy or usual care over their lifetime. We calculated the therapeutic headroom by multiplying the gains attributable to MSCs with willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold and derived the maximum reimbursable price (MRP) from the expected net monetary benefit and savings attributable to MSCs. We performed scenario analyses to assess the impact of changes to assumptions on the study findings. A value of information analysis is performed to identify parameters with greatest impact on the uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness of MSC therapy. RESULTS: At a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the therapeutic headroom and MRP of MSC therapy were $20,941 and $16,748, respectively; these estimates increased with the larger WTP values and the greater impact of MSCs on in-hospital mortality and hospital discharge rates.

24841,Rapid cancer diagnosis for patients with vague symptoms: a cost-effectiveness study,"BACKGROUND: A pilot rapid diagnosis centre (RDC) allows GPs within targeted clusters to refer adults with vague and/or non-specific symptoms suspicious of cancer, who do not meet criteria for referral under an urgent suspected cancer (USC) pathway, to a multidisciplinary RDC clinic where they are seen within 1 week. AIM: To explore the cost-effectiveness of the RDC compared with standard clinical practice. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness modelling using routine data from Neath Port Talbot Hospital, Wales. METHOD: Discrete-event simulation modelled a cohort of 1000 patients from referral to radiological diagnosis based on routine RDC and hospital data. Control patients were those referred to a USC pathway but then downgraded. Published sources provided estimates of patient quality of life (QoL) and pre-diagnosis anxiety. The model calculates time to diagnosis, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and estimates the probability of the RDC being a cost-effective strategy. RESULTS: The RDC reduces mean time to diagnosis from 84.2 days in usual care to 5.9 days if a diagnosis is made at clinic, or 40.8 days if further investigations are booked during RDC. RDC provision is the superior strategy (that is, less costly and more effective) compared with standard clinical practice when run near or at full capacity.

One thousand four ninety seven of 3356 (46.2%) enrolled patients with high clinical risk (in accordance with the modified Adjuvant! Online clinical-pathological assessment) had a low-risk 70-gene signature. Using patient-level data from the MINDACT trial, the cost-effectiveness of using the 70-gene signature to guide adjuvant chemotherapy selection for clinical high risk, estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (HER2-) patients was analysed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hybrid decision tree-Markov model simulated treatment strategies in accordance with the 70-gene signature with clinical assessment versus clinical assessment alone, over a 10-year time horizon. Primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), country-specific costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for six countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK and the US. RESULTS: Treatment strategies guided by the 70-gene signature result in more QALYs compared with clinical assessment alone. Costs of the 70-gene signature strategy were lower in five of six countries. This led to dominance of the 70-gene signature in Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands and the US and to a cost-effective situation in the UK (ICER £22,910/QALY).

24849,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the 70-gene signature compared with clinical assessment in breast cancer based on a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of the 70-gene signature (MammaPrint®) to guide chemotherapy use in T1-3N0-1M0 breast cancer was demonstrated in the Microarray in Node-Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy (MINDACT) study. One thousand four ninety seven of 3356 (46.2%) enrolled patients with high clinical risk (in accordance with the modified Adjuvant! Online clinical-pathological assessment) had a low-risk 70-gene signature. Using patient-level data from the MINDACT trial, the cost-effectiveness of using the 70-gene signature to guide adjuvant chemotherapy selection for clinical high risk, estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (HER2-) patients was analysed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hybrid decision tree-Markov model simulated treatment strategies in accordance with the 70-gene signature with clinical assessment versus clinical assessment alone, over a 10-year time horizon. Primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), country-specific costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for six countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK and the US. RESULTS: Treatment strategies guided by the 70-gene signature result in more QALYs compared with clinical assessment alone. Costs of the 70-gene signature strategy were lower in five of six countries. This led to dominance of the 70-gene signature in Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands and the US and to a cost-effective situation in the UK (ICER £22,910/QALY). Annual national cost savings were €4.2M (Belgium), €24.7M (France), €45.1M (Germany), €12.7M (Netherlands) and $244M (US). UK budget increase was £8.4M.

24850,Cetuximab Plus Chemotherapy versus Chemotherapy Alone in Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The EXTREME clinical trial revealed that cetuximab plus chemotherapy improved the overall survival time of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) versus chemotherapy alone. The current study examined the cost-effectiveness of cetuximab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in HNSCC patients from the perspective of China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model was implemented for R/M HNSCC patients. Survival information was derived from the CHANGE-2 trial. The model was designed as a ten-year time horizon, a 3-week cycle, and a 3% discount rate for costs and utilities. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value is less than $30,201/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was considered cost-effective in China. We analyzed the uncertainty by performing one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, we found that the ICER of cetuximab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone is $172,702/QALY. The results of one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic analysis showed that the fluctuations of each variable in its ranges do not cause ICERs to reach acceptable thresholds. CONCLUSION: The current observations suggested that treatment with cetuximab plus chemotherapy is not a cost-effective strategy for R/M HNSCC patients in China at a $30,201 willingness to pay threshold.",2020-01-34793,33204154,Cancer Manag Res,Yitian Lang,2020,12 /,11383-11390,No,33204154,"Yitian Lang; Deshi Dong; Cetuximab Plus Chemotherapy versus Chemotherapy Alone in Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Cancer Manag Res, 2020; 12():1179-1322; 11383-11390",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,cetuximab + chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy (cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil + maintenance therapy),"recurrent, metastatic, squamous cell carcinoma",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,Not Stated,172702,United States,2019,174832.6

We aim to evaluate whether, in the United States, surgery is cost-effective compared to medical management for patients deemed surgical candidates and whether surgical evaluation is cost-effective for patients with DR-TLE in general. METHODS: We use a semi-Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of surgery and surgical evaluation over a lifetime horizon. We use second-order Monte Carlo simulations to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analyses to estimate variation in model output. We adopt both health care and societal perspectives, including direct health care costs (e.g., surgery, antiepileptic drugs) and indirect costs (e.g., lost earnings by patients and care providers.)

24855,Cost-effectiveness of the Adaptive Implementation of Effective Programs Trial (ADEPT): approaches to adopting implementation strategies,"BACKGROUND: Theory-based methods to support the uptake of evidence-based practices (EBPs) are critical to improving mental health outcomes. Implementation strategy costs can be substantial, and few have been rigorously evaluated. The purpose of this study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to identify the most cost-effective approach to deploying implementation strategies to enhance the uptake of Life Goals, a mental health EBP. METHODS: We used data from a previously conducted randomized trial to compare the cost-effectiveness of Replicating Effective Programs (REP) combined with external and/or internal facilitation among sites non-responsive to REP. REP is a low-level strategy that includes EBP packaging, training, and technical assistance. External facilitation (EF) involves external expert support, and internal facilitation (IF) augments EF with protected time for internal staff to support EBP implementation. We developed a decision tree to assess 1-year costs and outcomes for four implementation strategies: (1) REP only, (2) REP+EF, (3) REP+EF add IF if needed, (4) REP+EF/IF. The analysis used a 1-year time horizon and assumed a health payer perspective. Our outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The economic outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: Our results indicate that REP+EF add IF is the most cost-effective option with an ICER of $593/QALY. The REP+EF/IF and REP+EF only conditions are dominated (i.e., more expensive and less effective than comparators). One-way sensitivity analyses indicate that results are sensitive to utilities for REP+EF and REP+EF add IF. The PSA results indicate that REP+EF, add IF is the optimal strategy in 30% of iterations at the threshold of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the most cost-effective implementation support begins with a less intensive, less costly strategy initially and increases as needed to enhance EBP uptake. Using this approach, implementation support resources can be judiciously allocated to those clinics that would most benefit. Our results were not robust to changes in the utility measure. Research is needed that incorporates robust and relevant utilities in implementation studies to determine the most cost-effective strategies. This study advances economic evaluation of implementation by assessing costs and utilities across multiple implementation strategy combinations.

24858,Cost-effectiveness of a national immunization program with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared with the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in South Korea,"INTRODUCTION: Globally, pneumococcal disease represents a significant burden. South Korea implemented the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2003, replaced with the 10-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) vaccine in 2010. In 2014, both vaccines were introduced in the national immunization program (NIP) for infants with 3 primary doses and one booster dose We performed a cost-effectiveness evaluation to elucidate which vaccine may be expected to provide greater impact if included in a NIP. METHODOLOGY: Using an established model, we estimated the impact of introducing either PCV13 or PCV10 into the South Korean NIP in 2015. Vaccine impact was based on historic observed impact of PCV13 from 2010 to 2015 in Korea given high uptake of PCV13, and PCV10 impact was estimated based on experiences in countries using PCV10. Incidence and costs for all ages and including invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media were derived from the literature and Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. RESULTS: In the base-case, over 5-years PCV13 was estimated to avert 550,000 more cases of pneumococcal disease compared to PCV10, driven by broader serotype coverage and less replacement due to serotypes 3 and 19A. This translated to a cost-savings of $47.4 million USD despite PCV13''s higher cost. Sensitivity analysis found incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from cost-saving to $7,300 USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). CONCLUSION: A NIP using PCV13 was estimated to have a more substantial public health impact and be cost-saving compared to a program with PCV10 due to broader serotype coverage.",2020-01-34809,32783576,Int.

24859,Real-world cost-effectiveness associated with infliximab maintenance therapy for moderate to severe Crohn's disease in China,"BACKGROUND: Infliximab was the first approved biologic treatment for moderate to severe Crohn''s disease (MS-CD) in China. However, the cost-effectiveness of infliximab maintenance therapy (IMT) for MS-CD relative to conventional maintenance therapy remained unclarified. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of IMT for MS-CD in Chinese patients from the perspective of Chinese public insurance payer. METHODS: A cohort of MS-CD patients managed in a Chinese tertiary care hospital was created to compare IMT with conventional maintenance therapy (CMT) for clinical outcomes and direct medical costs over a 1-year observation time using conventional regression analyses. A decision-analytic model with the generated evidence was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of IMT relative to CMT using reimbursed medical costs. RESULTS: Based on the included 389 patients, IMT was associated with significantly higher disease remission chance [odds ratio: 4.060, P = 0.003], lower risk of developing new complications (odds ratio: 0.527, P = 0.010), higher utility value for quality of life (coefficient 0.822, P = 0.008), and lower total hospital costs related to disease management (coefficient -0.378, P = 0.008) than CMT. Base-case cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that IMT could cost Chinese health insurance payers ¥55260 to gain one quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

24860,Real-world cost-effectiveness associated with infliximab maintenance therapy for moderate to severe Crohn's disease in China,"BACKGROUND: Infliximab was the first approved biologic treatment for moderate to severe Crohn''s disease (MS-CD) in China. However, the cost-effectiveness of infliximab maintenance therapy (IMT) for MS-CD relative to conventional maintenance therapy remained unclarified. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of IMT for MS-CD in Chinese patients from the perspective of Chinese public insurance payer. METHODS: A cohort of MS-CD patients managed in a Chinese tertiary care hospital was created to compare IMT with conventional maintenance therapy (CMT) for clinical outcomes and direct medical costs over a 1-year observation time using conventional regression analyses. A decision-analytic model with the generated evidence was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of IMT relative to CMT using reimbursed medical costs. RESULTS: Based on the included 389 patients, IMT was associated with significantly higher disease remission chance [odds ratio: 4.060, P = 0.003], lower risk of developing new complications (odds ratio: 0.527, P = 0.010), higher utility value for quality of life (coefficient 0.822, P = 0.008), and lower total hospital costs related to disease management (coefficient -0.378, P = 0.008) than CMT. Base-case cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that IMT could cost Chinese health insurance payers ¥55260 to gain one quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The cost-effectiveness of IMT was mainly driven by the estimate of quality of life, treatment efficacy of maintenance therapy, mortality risk associated with active disease, and unit price of infliximab. The probability that IMT was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times gross domestic product [2018 Chinese gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC)] was 86.4%.

DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a three-armed, individually randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 59 Dutch general practices. PARTICIPANTS: 322 adults, aged 50 years and older with a chronic vestibular syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Stand-alone VR consisted of a 6-week, internet-based intervention with weekly online sessions and daily exercises. In blended VR, this intervention was supplemented with face-to-face physiotherapy support. UC group participants received usual general practice care without restrictions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Societal costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), Vertigo Symptom Scale-Short Form (VSS-SF), clinically relevant response (=3 points VSS-SF improvement). RESULTS: Mean societal costs in both the stand-alone and blended VR groups were statistically non-significantly higher than in the UC group (mean difference (MD) €504, 95%?CI -1082 to 2268; and €916, 95%?CI -663 to 2596). Both stand-alone and blended VR groups reported non-significantly more QALYs than the UC group (MD 0.02, 95%?CI -0.00 to 0.04; and 0.01, 95%?CI -0.01 to 0.03), and significantly better VSS-SF Scores (MD 3.8 points, 95%?CI 1.7 to 6.0; and 3.3 points, 95%?CI 1.3 to 5.2). For stand-alone VR compared with UC, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 0.95 at a willingness-to-pay ratio of €24?161/QALY, €600/point improvement in VSS-SF and €8000/clinically relevant responder in VSS-SF.

24865,Inclisiran as Adjunct Lipid-Lowering Therapy for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Inclisiran inhibits hepatic synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The comparison of inclisiran with statin versus statin alone in the ORION-10 trial demonstrated significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Our study explored whether the use of inclisiran with statin versus statin alone for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is cost effective from the Australian healthcare perspective, based on the price of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors. METHODS: A Markov model was developed based on the ORION-10 trial to model outcomes and costs incurred by patients over a lifetime analysis. The three health states were ''alive with cardiovascular disease (CVD)'', ''alive with recurrent CVD'', and ''dead''. Cost and utilities were estimated from published sources. The cost of inclisiran was estimated from the annual cost of evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor currently available in Australia (AU$6334, based on 2020 data). Outcomes of interest were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost per year of life saved (YoLS). All costs, QALYs and YoLS were discounted at 5% per annum in line with Australian standards. RESULTS: Among 1000 subjects followed-up over a lifetime analysis, inclisiran with statin compared with statin alone prevented 235 non-fatal myocardial infarctions (NFMIs; 151 NFMI and 84 repeat NFMI cases) and 114 coronary revascularisation cases, and increased years of life by 0.549 (discounted) and QALYs by 0.468 (discounted). At an annual price of AU$6334, the net marginal cost was AU$58,965 per person. The above values equated to ICERs of AU$107,402 per YoLS and AU$125,732 per QALY gained. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$50,000, inclisiran would have to be priced 60% lower than other available PCSK9 inhibitors to be considered cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: As an adjunct therapy to statin treatment in those who have persistently elevated LDL-C despite optimal statin therapy, inclisiran is effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic CVD. Inclisiran is not cost effective from the Australian healthcare perspective, assuming acquisition costs of current PCSK9 inhibitors.

24866,Exploratory cost-effectiveness model of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) compared with CT-guided biopsy (TTNA) for diagnosis of malignant indeterminate peripheral pulmonary nodules,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is accountable for 35?000 deaths annually, and prognosis is improved when the cancer is diagnosed early. CT-guided biopsy (transthoracic needle aspiration, TTNA) and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) can be used to investigate indeterminate pulmonary nodules if the patient is unfit for surgery. However, there is a paucity of clinical and health economic evidence that directly compares ENB with TTNA in this population group. This cost-effectiveness study aimed to explore potential scenarios whereby ENB may be considered cost-effective when compared with TTNA. METHODS: A cohort decision analytic model was developed using a UK National Health Service perspective. ENB was assumed to have equal sensitivity to TTNA at 82%. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain were calculated to estimate the net monetary benefit at a £20?000 per QALY threshold. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore scenarios where ENB could be considered a cost-effective intervention. RESULTS: Under the assumption that ENB has equal efficacy to TTNA, ENB was found to be dominant (less costly and more effective) when compared with TTNA, due to having a reduced risk and cost of adverse events. This conclusion was most sensitive to changes in the cost of intervention, estimates of effectiveness and adverse event rates. DISCUSSION: ENB is expected to be cost-effective when the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis is equal to (or better than) TTNA, which may occur in certain subgroups of patients in whom TTNA is unlikely to accurately diagnose malignancy or when an experienced practitioner achieves a high accuracy with ENB.",2020-01-34851,32796019,BMJ Open Respir Res,William Rickets,2020,7 / 1,,No,32796019,"William Rickets; Kelvin Kar Wing Lau; Vicki Pollit; Stuart Mealing; Catherine Leonard; Philip Mallender; Nilanjan Chaudhuri; Pallav L Shah; Umamamaheswar Babu Naidu; Exploratory cost-effectiveness model of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) compared with CT-guided biopsy (TTNA) for diagnosis of malignant indeterminate peripheral pulmonary nodules, BMJ Open Respir Res, 2020 Aug; 7(1):2052-4439",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Procedure",electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy vs. Standard/Usual Care- CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration,"at risk of lung cancer, not suitable for invasive biopsy due to poor lung function",70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-33460.08,United Kingdom,2018,-46082.84
24867,The Cost Effectiveness of Mental Health Treatment in the Lifetime of Older Adults with HIV in New York City: A Markov Approach,"BACKGROUND: There are noticeable gaps in knowledge regarding the cost and effectiveness of integrated medical and behavioral services for older adults with HIV. Their lifespan is close to the population''s level but their quality of life has sharply declined due to depression and substance use. Mental health disorders are widespread among an aging population with HIV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to build a decision analytic model to evaluate medical interventions with and without mental health treatment using primary data of 139 older adults with HIV and health outcomes from the literature. METHODS: We tracked the progression of depression and cumulative deaths among older adults with HIV using a Markov model with 50 annual cycles through three health states. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty in estimating the parameters and around the model''s assumptions. RESULTS: An integrated medical and behavioral care system is cost effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY compared with medical care only.

So it becomes obligatory to assess the costs and benefits of a new technology, before defining its clinical value. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as compared to 2-dimensional radiotherapy (2-DRT) and 3-dimensional radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for treating head and neck cancers (HNC) in India. The cost-effectiveness of 3-DCRT as compared to 2-DRT was also estimated. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was designed. Using a disaggregated societal perspective, lifetime study horizon and 3 percent discount rate, future costs and health outcomes were compared for a cohort of 1000 patients treated with any of the three radiation techniques. Data on health system cost, out of pocket expenditure, and quality of life was assessed through primary data collected from a large tertiary care public sector hospital in India. Data on xerostomia rates following each of the radiation techniques was extracted from the existing randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: IMRT incurs an incremental cost of $7,072 (2,932-13,258) and $5,164 (463-10,954) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to 2-DRT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Further, 3D-CRT as compared to 2-DRT requires an incremental cost of $8,946 (1,996-19,313) per QALY gained.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of genomic test-directed olaparib on MCRPC from the US payer perspective. Methods: A partitioned survival model was adopted to project the disease course of MCRPC had at least one gene alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM (Scenario A) and has alterations in any of all 15 prespecified genes (Scenario B) after next-generation sequencing test. The efficacy and toxicity data were gathered from the PROfound trial. Clinical probabilities related to survival were estimated from the reported survival probabilities in each PROfound group. Cost and health preference data were derived from the literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed for exploring the model uncertainties. Results: Olaparib yielded an additional 0.063 and 0.068 of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with the augmented cost of $7,382 and saved the cost of $ 1,980 compared to standard care in scenario A and B, respectively, which yielded an ICER of $116,903/QALY and a cost-saving option. The lower weekly cost related to olaparib treatment led to the dominant findings in scenario B. The varied results between scenario A and B could be partly explained by different the number need to screen for identifying eligible patients who could be administered with olaparib, which sharply augmented the costs of the olaparib arm in scenario A.

This study determined the impact of EVT treatment delay on cost effectiveness of EVT in the Singapore healthcare setting. DESIGN: A short-term decision tree and long-term Markov health state transition model was constructed. For each time window of symptom onset to EVT, the probability of receiving EVT or non-EVT treatment was varied, thereby varying clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale scores), short-term costs and long-term modelled (lifetime) costs; all of which were used in calculating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EVT vs non-EVT treatment. Clinical outcomes and cost data were derived from clinical trials, literature, expert opinion, electronic medical records and community-based surveys from Singapore. Deterministic one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of the model. The willingness to pay for per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was set to Singapore $50?000 (US$36 500). SETTING: Singapore healthcare perspective. PARTICIPANTS: The model included patients with AIS in Singapore. INTERVENTIONS: EVT performed within 6?hours of stroke onset. OUTCOME MEASURES: The model estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMB) for EVT versus non-EVT treatment, varied by time from symptom onset to time of treatment. RESULTS: EVT performed between 61 min and 120?min after the stroke onset was most cost-effective time window to perform EVT in the Singapore population, with an ICER of Singapore $7197 per QALY (US$5254) for performing EVT at 61-120?min versus 121-180?min. The resulting incremental NMB associated with receipt of EVT at the earlier time point is Singapore $39?827 (US$29 074) per patient at the willingness-to-pay threshold of Singapore $50?000. Each hour delay in EVT resulted in an average loss of 0.54 QALYs and 195.35 healthy days, with an average net monetary loss of Singapore $26?255 (US$19 166). CONCLUSIONS: From the Singapore healthcare perspective, although EVT is more expensive than alternative treatments in the short term, the lifetime ICER is below the willingness-to-pay threshold.

24880,Cost-Effectiveness of Switching Patients With Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction to Sacubitril/Valsartan: The Australian Perspective,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness, from the Australian health care perspective, of switching patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) stable on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) to the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) sacubitril/valsartan is unclear. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril in patients with HFREF in the contemporary Australian setting. METHODS: We developed a Markov model with two health states (''Alive'' and ''Dead'') to assess the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril in patients with HFREF. Model subjects were 63 years of age at entry and had simulated follow-up over 20 years. Transition probabilities were derived from the Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) study. Costs and utility data were derived from published sources. All costs and effects were discounted at an annual rate of 5% and are presented in Australian dollars. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test variability in key data inputs. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, sacubitril/valsartan was found to reduce non-fatal heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths, with numbers-needed-to-treat over a 20-year period of 40 and 27, respectively. The use of sacubitril/valsartan led to an additional 6 months of life gained per patient, translating to A$27,954 per years of life saved (YoLS) and A$40,513 per quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) gained.

24881,Cost-effectiveness analysis of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound ablation for palliation of refractory painful bone metastases,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is cost-effective compared with medication, for refractory pain from bone metastases in the United States. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state transition model using TreeAge Pro software (TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA) to model costs, outcomes, and the cost-effectiveness of a treatment strategy using MRgFUS for palliative treatment of painful bone metastases compared with a Medication Only strategy (Figure 1). Model transition state probabilities, costs (in 2018 US$), and effectiveness data (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) were derived from available literature, local expert opinion, and reimbursement patterns at two U.S. tertiary academic medical centers actively performing MRgFUS. Costs and QALYs, discounted at three percent per year, were accumulated each month over a 24-month time horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the MRgFUS treatment strategy costs an additional $11,863 over the 2-year time horizon to accumulate additional 0.22 QALYs, equal to a $54,160/QALY ICER, thus making MRgFUS the preferred strategy. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrate that for the base-case analysis, the crossover point at which Medication Only would instead become the preferred strategy is $23,341 per treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrate that 67 percent of model iterations supported the conclusion of the base case.

24882,Incorporating Optical Coherence Tomography Macula Scans Enhances Cost-effectiveness of Fundus Photography-Based Screening for Diabetic Macular Edema,"OBJECTIVE: To compare four screening strategies for diabetic macular edema (DME). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients attending diabetic retinopathy screening were recruited and received macular optical coherence tomography (OCT), in addition to visual acuity (VA) and fundus photography (FP) assessments, as part of the standard protocol. Two retina specialists provided the reference grading by independently assessing each subject''s screened data for DME. The current standard protocol (strategy A) was compared for sensitivity, specificity, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with three alternative candidate protocols using a simulation model with the same subjects. In strategy B, macular hemorrhage or microaneurysm on FP were removed as surrogate markers for possible DME. Strategy C used best-corrected instead of habitual/pinhole VA and added central subfield thickness (CST) >290 µm on OCT in suspected cases as a confirmation marker for possible DME. Strategy D used CST >290 µm OCT in all subjects as a surrogate marker for suspected DME. RESULTS: We recruited 2,277 subjects (mean age 62.80 ± 11.75 years, 43.7% male).

Lifestyle interventions decrease dementia risk and extend life expectancy, leading to competing effects on health care costs. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of including dementia in a public health cost-effectiveness analysis and quantify the overall impacts accounting for these competing effects. METHODS: The School for Public Health Research (SPHR) diabetes prevention model describes individuals'' risk of type 2 diabetes, microvascular outcomes, CVD, congestive heart failure, cancer, osteoarthritis, depression, and mortality in England.

24888,Analysis of the Cost-Effectiveness of Liquid Biopsy to Determine Treatment Change in Patients with Her2-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer in Colombia,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is highly prevalent worldwide and leads to high health-care costs. HER2-positive subtype represents 30% of all breast cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients treated with anti-HER2 therapies frequently develop resistance and require pharmacological treatment change. Liquid biopsy is a minimally invasive and an easily accessible technique, with high sensitivity and specificity, to detect molecular treatment resistance even before the onset of clinical manifestations and can thus be used to reduce unnecessary anti-HER2 treatment costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using liquid biopsy (ctDNA detection) to determine treatment change in women with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer in Colombia. METHODOLOGY: We performed an economic evaluation using decision tree modeling and deterministic analyses based on literature search for first and second lines of treatment (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, docetaxel, and TDM1); resistance; outcomes; and sensitivity and specificity of tests detecting molecular resistance. The effectiveness was measured using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) score, and costs were obtained from databases with national validity, suppliers, the Colombian Drug Price Information System (SISMED), and local studies. RESULTS: The use of liquid biopsy (ctDNA detection) with conventional treatment was more expensive and less effective than conventional treatment without liquid biopsy (US $177,985.35 and 0.533889206 QALY, respectively). The incremental cost with liquid biopsy was US $7,333.17 and the incremental effectiveness was 0.00042256 QALY relative to the conventional method. CONCLUSION: Including liquid biopsy in the treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer was considered currently inapplicable in Colombia because it was not cost effective. Our results open a window of opportunity to improve the development and implementation of ctDNA testing in Colombia, potentially reducing current costs.

24889,Cost-Effectiveness of Tofacitinib for Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis in China,"BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis have a heavy financial burden. The cost-effectiveness of introducing tofacitinib to the current treatment sequence for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis who have inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs-IR) in China remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing tofacitinib into the current treatment sequence in China for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis who have csDMARDs-IR. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system to compare treatment sequences with and without first-line tofacitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with csDMARDs-IR. The treatment sequence without tofacitinib included adalimumab, etanercept, recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor-Fc fusion protein, infliximab, and tocilizumab. Costs were derived from publicly available sources. Clinical trials, network meta-analysis, and real-world data were used to generate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), transition probabilities, and the incidence of adverse events. Mortality probabilities were estimated from rheumatoid arthritis-based, Chinese all-cause mortality data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of the model. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of adding tofacitinib as second- and third-line treatment options was evaluated in our analyses. Costs and effects were discounted at 5% per anum. RESULTS: Compared to the current treatment sequence, adding tofacitinib as first-line treatment led to a cost-saving of $US880.11 (2018 values) and incremental QALYs of 1.34. Sensitivity analyses showed the results to be robust. Adding tofacitinib at second-line therapy was also a cost-saving option with a cost saving of $US653.65 and incremental QALYs of 1.34, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding tofacitinib at third-line therapy was $US5588.14 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Using the WHO-recommended ICER acceptability threshold of = 1-time per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), our analysis suggests that the introduction of tofacitinib into the current treatment sequence for moderate-to-severe RA patients with csDMARDs-IR in China was a cost saving option as first- and second-line treatment, and cost-effective as a third-line treatment option. Of note, use of tofacitinib as first- and second-line treatment post-csDMARDs-IR appeared to be cost saving.",2020-01-34883,32929677,Pharmacoeconomics,Lei Tian,2020,38 / 12,1345-1358,Yes,32929677,"Lei Tian; Xiaomo Xiong; Qiang Guo; Yixi Chen; Luying Wang; Peng Dong; Aixia Ma; Cost-Effectiveness of Tofacitinib for Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis in China, Pharmacoeconomics, 2020 Dec; 38(12):1179-2027; 1345-1358",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,tofacitinib vs. TNFi bDMARDs --> non-TNFi bDMARDs (tocilizumab) --> palliative care,"moderate, severe rheumatoid arthritis, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs intolerance",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-656.8,United States,2018,-676.95

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EVT compared with medical management in patients with acute stroke presenting with M2 occlusion using a decision-analytic model. METHODS: A decision-analytic study was performed with Markov modeling to estimate the lifetime quality-adjusted life years and associated costs of EVT-treated patients compared with no-EVT/medical management. The study was performed over a lifetime horizon with a societal perspective in the Unites States setting. Base case, one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: EVT was the long-term cost-effective strategy in 93.37% of the iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and resulted in difference in health benefit of 1.66 QALYs in the 65-year-old age groups, equivalent to 606 days in perfect health. Varying the outcomes after both strategies shows that EVT was more cost-effective when the probability of good outcome after EVT was only 4-6% higher relative to medical management in clinically likely scenarios. EVT remained cost-effective even when its cost exceeded US$200?000 (threshold was US$209 111). EVT was even more cost-effective for 55-year-olds than for 65-year-old patients.

24892,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Oral Direct-Acting Antivirals for Chinese Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: All oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have shown excellent efficacy and safety in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, the cost of DAAs used to be expensive; therefore, large numbers of patients had no access to DAAs in China. Recently, prices have been greatly reduced. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) in Chinese CHC patients stratified by hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT), cirrhosis status, and treatment history. METHODS: On the basis of a Chinese healthcare perspective, a Markov model was constructed to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes of patients treated with different DAA regimens. Chinese-specific clinical, cost, and utility inputs were obtained or calculated from published sources and expert opinions. Costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported as primary outcomes. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted. RESULTS: At a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$30,081/QALY (calculated by three times the GDP per capita in China), SOF/VEL was cost-effective in patients with HCV GT 1, 3, and 6 infections, and the probabilities that SOF/VEL was cost-effective were 9.7-75.7%, 39.1-63.9%, and 35.6-88.0%, respectively. For GT2 patients, noncirrhotic patients, treatment-naïve patients, and treatment-experienced patients, LDV/SOF was the most cost-effective regimen, and the probabilities of cost-effectiveness for each of these groups was 92.1-99.8%, 89.9-99.0%, 61.6-91.2%, and 99.3-100.0%, respectively below the WTP threshold. The GLE/PIB regimen (12-week duration) was the most cost-effective in cirrhotic patients, whereas the probability of its cost-effectiveness varied with that of EBR/GZR (4.1-93.8% versus 6.2-93.3%) below the WTP threshold.
