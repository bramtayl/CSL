20101,Cost-Effectiveness of Buprenorphine-Naloxone Versus Extended-Release Naltrexone to Prevent Opioid Relapse,"Background: Not enough evidence exists to compare buprenorphine-naloxone with extended-release naltrexone for treating opioid use disorder. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a previously reported randomized clinical trial of 570 adults in 8 U.S. inpatient or residential treatment programs. Data Sources: Study instruments. Target Population: Adults with opioid use disorder. Time Horizon: 24-week intervention with an additional 12 weeks of observation. Perspective: Health care sector and societal. Interventions: Buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release naltrexone. Outcome Measures: Incremental costs combined with incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental time abstinent from opioids. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Use of the health care sector perspective and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY showed buprenorphine-naloxone to be preferable to extended-release naltrexone in 97% of bootstrap replications at 24 weeks and in 85% at 36 weeks. Similar results were obtained with incremental time abstinent from opioids as an outcome and with use of the societal perspective. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: The base-case results were sensitive to the cost of the 2 treatments and the success of randomized treatment initiation. Limitation: Relatively short follow-up for a chronic condition, substantial missing data, no information on patient out-of-pocket and social service costs. Conclusion: Buprenorphine-naloxone is preferred to extended-release naltrexone as first-line treatment when both options are clinically appropriate and patients require detoxification before initiating extended-release naltrexone.

20105,Cost-effectiveness of an adherence-enhancing intervention for gout based on real-world data,"AIM: Medication non-adherence influences outcomes of therapies for chronic diseases. Allopurinol is a cornerstone therapy for patients with gout; however, non-adherence to allopurinol is prevalent in Singapore and limits its effectiveness. Between 2008-2010, an adherence-enhancing program was implemented at the rheumatology division of a public tertiary hospital. The cost-effectiveness of this program has not been fully evaluated. With healthcare resources being finite, the value of investing in adherence-enhancing interventions should be ascertained. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this adherence-enhancing program to inform optimal resource allocation toward better gout management. METHOD: Adopting a real-world data approach, we utilized patient clinical and financial records generated in their course of routine care. Intervention and control groups were identified in a standing database and matched on nine risk factors through propensity score matching. Cost and effect data were followed through 1-2 years. A decision tree was developed in TreeAge using a societal perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: At an assumed willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 USD ($70 000 SGD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), the intervention had an 85% probability of being cost-effective compared to routine care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $12 866 USD per QALY for the base case and ranged from $4 139 to $21 593 USD per QALY in sensitivity analyses.

20106,Cost-Effectiveness of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy in Pediatric Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Background: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a promising new class of cancer therapy but has a high up-front cost. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T therapy among pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Methods: We built a microsimulation model for pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL receiving either CAR-T therapy or standard of care. Outcomes included costs, quality of life (health utility), complications, and survival. We measured cost-effectiveness with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs under $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) considered cost effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to test model uncertainty. Results: Compared to standard of care, CAR-T therapy increased overall cost by $528 200 and improved effectiveness by 8.18 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $64 600/QALY. The model was sensitive to assumptions about long-term CAR-T survival, the complete remission rate of CAR-T patients, and the health utility of long-term survivors. The base model assumed a 76.0% one-year survival with CAR-T, although if this decreased to 57.8%, then CAR-T was no longer cost effective. If the complete remission rate of CAR-T recipients decreased from 81% to 56.2%, or if the health utility of disease-free survivors decreased from 0.94 to 0.66, then CAR-T was no longer cost effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that CAR-T was cost effective in 94.8% of iterations at a willingness to pay of $100 000/QALY.

20108,Cost-effectiveness and Budgetary Consequence Analysis of Durvalumab Consolidation Therapy vs No Consolidation Therapy After Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Context of the US Health Care System,"Importance: In early 2018, durvalumab became the first immunotherapy to be approved for adjuvant treatment of patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose cancer has not progressed after definitive chemoradiotherapy. However, the cost-effectiveness and potential economic implications of using this high-priced therapy in this indication are unknown to date. Objective: To explore the cost-effectiveness and potential budgetary consequences of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC in the context of the US health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: A decision analytic microsimulation model was developed in an academic medical setting to compare the following 2 postchemoradiotherapy strategies: all patients receive no consolidation therapy until progression vs all patients receive durvalumab consolidation therapy until progression or for a maximum of 1 year. The potential budgetary consequence was calculated by applying the proportion of patients with NSCLC who were diagnosed in stage III and received chemoradiotherapy to the projected number of annual new cases for 2018 to 2022 to find total eligible patients and then multiplied by the mean difference in annual cost between the strategies over this 5-year period. Simulated conditions were matched to those of the PACIFIC phase 3 randomized clinical trial and reasonable treatment strategies for metastatic NSCLC. All simulated patients begin disease free after having received radical treatment with chemoradiotherapy and are followed up as they progress to metastatic disease first-line treatment, metastatic disease second-line treatment, end-stage progressive disease, and death. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome of this study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation therapy, given as aggregate cost of treatment per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results: Among 2 million simulated patients, durvalumab consolidation therapy was cost-effective compared with no consolidation therapy at a $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year willingness-to-pay threshold, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $67421 per quality-adjusted life-year, and would contribute an additional $768 million to national cancer spending in year 1. The annual budgetary consequence would then decrease to $241 million in year 5. Conclusions and Relevance: Durvalumab consolidation therapy represents an indication where expensive immunotherapies can be cost-effective. Treating with immunotherapy earlier in the course of cancer progression can provide significant value, despite having a substantial budgetary consequence.",2018-01-28251,30543349,Int Health,Steven D Criss,2018,/,,No,30543349,"Steven D Criss; Meghan J Mooradian; Deirdre F Sheehan; Leyre Zubiri; Melissa A Lumish; Justin F Gainor; Kerry L Reynolds; Chung Yin Kong; Cost-effectiveness and Budgetary Consequence Analysis of Durvalumab Consolidation Therapy vs No Consolidation Therapy After Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Context of the US Health Care System, Int Health, 2018 Jul 5; ():1876-3405",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Durvalumab Consolidation Thereapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- No Consolidation Therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,67421,United States,2018,69489.49
20109,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a loyalty scheme for physical activity behaviour change maintenance: results from a cluster randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a loyalty scheme based intervention involving rewards for increasing physical activity in public sector employees. METHODS: A cluster randomised wait-list controlled trial in public sector organisations in Northern Ireland. We randomly assigned clusters (1:1) using a computer generated random sequence. Researchers were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Employees aged 18-65 years with no self-reported medical contraindications to physical activity were included. The Physical Activity Loyalty Scheme (PAL) intervention was based on high-street loyalty cards where participants earned points for minutes of activity that could be redeemed for rewards, complemented by evidence-based behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome was objectively measured mean steps/day at 6 months using a validated pedometer (Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701) over 7 days, assessed with intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included health, mental wellbeing, quality of life, work absenteeism and presenteeism, and use of healthcare resources. Cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and mediation analyses were conducted. Trial registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN17975376. RESULTS: Between September 2014 and October 2015, we recruited and randomly assigned 37 clusters (from nine organisations; mean clusters per organisation = four) and 853 participants to the intervention (n = 19 with 457 participants) or control group (n = 18 with 396 participants). Primary outcome data were available for 249 (54.4%) intervention and 236 (59.6%) control participants. Mean steps/day were significantly lower in the intervention vs control group (adjusted mean difference = - 336, 95% CI: -612 to - 60, p = 0.02) at 6 months. Participants redeemed only 39% (SD 43%) of their earned points. Using the Quality Adjusted Life Year outcome, the intervention was not cost effective from an NHS/PSS perspective. A net cost analysis from an employer perspective demonstrated the intervention group was associated with a mean of 2.97 h less absenteeism over a 4 week period (p = 0.62), which could result in net savings ranging from pound66 to pound735 depending on the wage rate employed. At 4-weeks post-baseline there were significant increases in identified regulation, integrated regulation, intrinsic motivation, social norms and intentions in intervention compared to control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our mixed results pose challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials. Although the intervention successfully altered several hypothesised mediating constructs it did not translate into long-term behaviour change. Our incentive level may have been too low to incentivise change, despite being designed a priori by a Contingent Valuation Survey. There were also major re-structuring of several organisations which presented significant implementation challenges, and technical limitations.

20110,The cost-effectiveness analysis of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme in China,"OBJECTIVE: The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) is a universal healthcare coverage plan now covering over 98% of rural residents in China, first implemented in 2003. Rising costs in the face of modest gains in health and financial protections have raised questions about the cost-effectiveness of the NCMS. METHODS: Using the most recent estimates of the NCMS''s health and economic consequences from a comprehensive review of the literature, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model for a hypothetical cohort between ages 20 and 100. We then did one-way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations to explore whether the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) falls below 37,059 international dollars [Int$], the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of three times per capita GDP of China in 2013. FINDINGS: The ICER of the NCMS over the lifetime of an average 20-year-old rural resident in China was about Int$71,480 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (95% confidence interval: cost-saving, Int$845,659/QALY). There was less than a 33% chance that the system was cost-saving or met the WTP threshold. However, the NCMS did fall under the threshold when changes in the program costs, the risk of mortality and hypertension, and the likelihood of labor force participation were tested in one-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The NCMS appears to be economically inefficient in its current form. Further cost-effectiveness analyses are warranted in designing insurance benefit packages to ensure that the NCMS fund goes toward health care that has a good value in improving survival and quality of life.",2018-01-28281,30532135,PLoS One,Jinjing Wu,2018,13 / 12,e0208297,No,30532135,"Jinjing Wu; Shelby Deaton; Boshen Jiao; Zohn Rosen; Peter A Muennig; The cost-effectiveness analysis of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme in China, PLoS One , 2018; 13(12):1932-6203; e0208297",QALY,China,Not Stated,Care Delivery,The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme vs. Standard/Usual Care- No New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,82600,International,2013,91767.1
20111,Cost-effectiveness of nivolumab in the treatment of head and neck cancer,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, no second-line treatment for recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (r/mHNSCC) was able to improve overall survival (OS). Nivolumab has become a promising treatment for r/mHNSCC. The CheckMate-141 trial showed that nivolumab improves OS compared to investigator''s choice (IC) (cetuximab, methotrexate, docetaxel). Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is however expensive. The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab as second-line treatment for r/mHNSCC in Switzerland. METHODS: Based on the CheckMate-141 trial, we constructed a Markov model comparing nivolumab to IC, including follow-up data up to 24months. We assessed costs for treatments from the perspective of the Swiss health system with a 60months'' time horizon. PD-L1 and p16 testing were considered in scenarios. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were compared to an informal willingness-to-pay of CHF (Swiss Francs) 100,000 per QALY gained. RESULTS: For the base case we estimated an incremental effectiveness of 0.35 QALYs and incremental costs of CHF 35,562 with nivolumab, resulting in an ICER of CHF 102,957 per QALY gained. Most influential drivers for the ICER were the price of nivolumab and the progressive disease state utility weights. In 45.5% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis simulations nivolumab was estimated below 100,000 CHF/QALY.

20112,"The cost-effectiveness of the Manchester 'lung health checks', a community-based lung cancer low-dose CT screening pilot","BACKGROUND: Previous evaluations of low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening programmes have taken very different approaches in the design of the informative trials and the methods applied to determine cost-effectiveness. Therefore, it has not been possible to determine if differences in cost-effectiveness are due to different screening approaches or the evaluation methodology. This study reports the findings of an evaluation of the first round of a community-based, LDCT screening pilot Manchester, applying previously published methodology to ensure consistency. METHODS: Using the economic evaluation method reported in the UKLS trial, applying Manchester specific evidence where possible, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT for lung cancer. Estimates of the total costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated. RESULTS: The Manchester programme cost pound663,076, diagnosed 42 patients with lung cancer resulting in a gain in population health of 88.13 discounted life years, equivalent to 65.85 QALYs. This implied an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound10,069/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: We found the Manchester programme to be a cost-effective use of limited NHS resources. The findings suggest that further research is now needed not as to whether LDCT screening is cost-effective but under what conditions can it improve patient health by the most while remaining cost-effective.",2018-01-28293,30527175,Lung Cancer,Sebastian Hinde,2018,126 /,119-124,No,30527175,"Sebastian Hinde; Tessa Crilly; Haval Balata; Rachel Bartlett; John Crilly; Phil Barber; Anthony Threlfall; Janet Tonge; Richard Booton; Phil A Crosbie; The cost-effectiveness of the Manchester 'lung health checks', a community-based lung cancer low-dose CT screening pilot, Lung Cancer, 2018 Dec; 126():0169-5002; 119-124",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Screening,Low-dose CT lung cancer screening program vs. Symptomatic presentation,Ever-smokers,74 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,10069,United Kingdom,2016,14718.05
20113,Cost-effectiveness of low-dose rivaroxaban and aspirin versus aspirin alone in people with peripheral or carotid artery disease: An Australian healthcare perspective,"AIMS: Peripheral artery disease affects 1.2% of the population globally and is associated with an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events, major adverse limb events and mortality. The Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anti-coagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial demonstrated positive results of rivaroxaban plus aspirin therapy compared to aspirin therapy alone in those with peripheral artery disease or carotid artery disease. We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness from the Australian healthcare system perspective. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the experiences of a hypothetical population of 1000 individuals with peripheral artery disease or carotid artery disease, profiled on the COMPASS trial, treated with rivaroxaban plus aspirin therapy versus aspirin therapy alone. With each annual cycle, individuals were at risk of having non-fatal cardiovascular disease events, major adverse limb events, or dying. Individuals were also at risk of non-fatal major bleeding. The model had a lifetime time horizon. Costs and utilities were sourced from the literature and discounted at 5.0% annually. Rivaroxaban plus aspirin therapy prevented 143 non-fatal cardiovascular disease events, 118 major adverse limb events and 10 deaths compared to aspirin therapy alone. Conversely, 156 additional major non-fatal bleeds were accrued. With an additional 256 quality-adjusted life years gained, at an additional cost of AUD$6,858,103, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was AUD$26,769 (discounted) per quality-adjusted life year gained, which is below Australia''s arbitrary willingness to pay threshold of AUD$50,000.

National decision-makers soon need to decide whether to introduce HZ/su or to prefer HZ/su above ZVL. METHODS: Using a Markov model with a decision tree, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination with HZ/su (two doses within 2 months) or zoster vaccine live (ZVL) (single dose, or single dose with a booster after 10 years) for cohorts of 50-, 60-, 70- or 80-year-olds in the Netherlands. The model was parameterized using vaccine efficacy data from randomized clinical trials and up-to-date incidence, costs and health-related quality of life data from national datasets. We used a time horizon of 15 years, and the analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. RESULTS: At a coverage of 50%, vaccination with two doses of HZ/su was estimated to prevent 4335 to 10,896 HZ cases, depending on the cohort age. In comparison, this reduction was estimated at 400-4877 for ZVL and 427-6466 for ZVL with a booster. The maximum vaccine cost per series of HZ/su to remain cost-effective to a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained ranged from euro109.09 for 70-year-olds to euro63.68 for 50-year-olds. The cost-effectiveness of ZVL changed considerably by age, with corresponding maximum vaccine cost per dose ranging from euro51.37 for 60-year-olds to euro0.73 for 80-year-olds. Adding a ZVL booster after 10 years would require a substantial reduction of the maximum cost per dose to remain cost-effective as compared to ZVL single dose. Sensitivity analyses on the vaccine cost demonstrated that there were scenarios in which vaccination with either HZ/su (two doses), ZVL single dose or ZVL + booster could be the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy with two doses of HZ/su was superior in reducing the burden of HZ as compared to a single dose or single dose + booster of ZVL. Both vaccines could potentially be cost-effective to a conventional Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold for preventive interventions.

The cost-effectiveness of ZVL changed considerably by age, with corresponding maximum vaccine cost per dose ranging from euro51.37 for 60-year-olds to euro0.73 for 80-year-olds. Adding a ZVL booster after 10 years would require a substantial reduction of the maximum cost per dose to remain cost-effective as compared to ZVL single dose. Sensitivity analyses on the vaccine cost demonstrated that there were scenarios in which vaccination with either HZ/su (two doses), ZVL single dose or ZVL + booster could be the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy with two doses of HZ/su was superior in reducing the burden of HZ as compared to a single dose or single dose + booster of ZVL.

The goal of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding omalizumab to standard treatment for asthma in Chinese pediatric patients. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to project the health and economic outcomes in pediatric patients with severe allergic asthma. Model inputs were obtained from the literature. Cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were measured over a five-year time horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, the addition of omalizumab to standard therapy yielded an incremental cost of $49,047 for 0.232 incremental QALY, led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $211,217/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were robust for these results.

Apixaban was shown to be safer than warfarin, with superior reduction in the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, mortality, and major bleeding irrespective of kidney function. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at different levels of kidney function. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at three levels of kidney function: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 80 ml/min, 50 to 80 ml/min, and 50 ml/min or less. Event rates and associated utilities were obtained from previous literature. The model adopted the US health care system perspective, with hospitalization costs extracted from the Healthcare and Utilization Project. Treatment costs were obtained from official price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of results. RESULTS: Apixaban was a dominant treatment strategy compared with warfarin in AF patients with eGFR levels of 50 ml/min or less and 50 to 80 ml/min. In patients with an eGFR of more than 80 ml/min, apixaban was cost-effective compared with warfarin, costing $6307 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results were consistent assuming anticoagulant discontinuation after major bleeding events. Compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, apixaban was the only cost-effective anticoagulant strategy relative to warfarin in both mild and moderate renal impairment settings.

20130,Dynamic transmission model of routine mumps vaccination in Japan,"The mumps vaccine is not included in the national immunisation programme (NIP) of approximately 80 countries including Japan. To investigate the vaccine''s cost-effectiveness, we developed a dynamic transmission model for routine one- and two-dose mumps vaccination programs in Japan. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with a current programme over a projected 50-year period. We created a Japanese population model and performed dynamic simulation to estimate the number of patients enrolled in the current programme, the routine one-dose programme, and the routine two-dose programme over the next 50 years using the Berkeley Madonna program. We estimated the medical and social costs of natural mumps infections and vaccinations to analyse cost-effectiveness. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis with parameters including vaccine cost, vaccine efficacy, medical costs per case, social costs per case, incidence of adverse events and discount rate. Base case analysis showed that both the one-dose and two-dose programmes predominated and that quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were saved, compared with the current programme. The medical costs, total cost and QALYs saved during the study period in the two-dose programme compared with the current programme were 217 billion JPY, 860 billion JPY and 184 779, respectively.

20132,Cost-effectiveness of umeclidinium as add-on to ICS/LABA therapy in COPD: A UK perspective,"INTRODUCTION: The cost-effectiveness of long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) 62.5mug as add-on therapy to other maintenance COPD treatments is unknown. METHODS: This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of the following in COPD: UMEC + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mug (FF/VI); UMEC + fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mug (FP/SAL); and UMEC + several alternative choices of inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS/LABA). The model was informed with direct and indirect data from previously published studies, with a UK perspective and a lifetime horizon. Sensitivity analyses were also performed.

20135,Cost-utility analysis of the screening program for early oral cancer detection in Thailand,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility of an oral precancer screening program compared to a no-screening program in Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov models were performed to simulate costs and Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) of both the screening and no-screening programs in the Thai population aged over 40 years. There are four steps to the screening program in Thailand: 1) mouth self-examination (MSE); 2) visual examination by trained dental nurses (VETDN); 3) visual examination by trained dentists (VETD); and 4) visual examination by oral surgeons (VEOS). The societal perspective and lifetime horizon were applied. Variables used were derived from the pilot study of the oral precancer screening program in Roi Et province as well as through patient interviews and local and international literature reviews. Results were presented in terms of Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICER). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess parameters uncertainty. RESULTS: The screening program yielded higher costs (1,362 Baht) and QALYs (0.0044 years) than the no screening program, producing an ICER of 311,030 Baht per QALY gained. This indicates that the screening program is cost-ineffective in the Thai context, where the cost-effectiveness threshold is THB 160,000 per QALY gained. However, the programs will be cost-effective if the screening program are improved in one of three ways; 1) the sensitivity and specificity of MSE are more than 60%, 2) the sensitivity and specificity of VETDN are greater than 90%, or 3) the low accuracy steps like MSE or VETDN are removed from the screening program. CONCLUSION: The screening program is found to be cost-ineffective for oral precancer detection in Thailand. However, this study suggests 3 alternative policy options to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the program.",2018-01-28374,30496214,PLoS One,Chutima Kumdee,2018,13 / 11,e0207442,No,30496214,"Chutima Kumdee; Wantanee Kulpeng; Yot Teerawattananon; Cost-utility analysis of the screening program for early oral cancer detection in Thailand, PLoS One , 2018; 13(11):1932-6203; e0207442",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Screening,Oral precancer screening program vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,311030,Thailand,2016,9511.23
20136,Cost-effectiveness of Maintenance Capecitabine and Bevacizumab for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"Importance: Unregulated drug prices increase cancer therapy costs. After induction chemotherapy, patients with metastatic colon cancer can receive maintenance capecitabine and bevacizumab therapy based on improved progression-free survival, but whether this treatment''s cost justifies its benefits has not been evaluated in the United States. Objective: This study sought to determine the influence of capecitabine and bevacizumab drug prices on cost-effectiveness from a Medicare payer''s perspective. Design, Setting, and Participants: The incremental cost-effectiveness of capecitabine and bevacizumab maintenance therapy was determined with a Markov model using a quality-of-life penalty based on outcomes data from the CAIRO phase 3 randomized clinical trial (RCT), which included 558 adults in the Netherlands with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who had stable disease or better following induction chemotherapy. The outcomes were modeled using Markov chains to account for patients who had treatment complications or cancer progression. Transition probabilities between patient states were determined, and each state''s costs were determined using US Medicare data on payments for capecitabine and bevacizumab treatment. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses identified factors affecting cost-effectiveness. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life-years gained were adjusted using CAIRO3 RCT quality-of-life data to determine quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The primary end point was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, representing incremental costs per QALY gained using a capecitabine and bevacizumab maintenance regimen compared with observation alone. Results: Markov model estimated survival and complication outcomes closely matched those reported in the CAIRO3 RCT, which included 558 adults (n = 197 women, n = 361 men; median age, 64 and 63 years for patients in the observation and maintenance therapy groups, respectively) in the Netherlands with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who had stable disease or better following induction chemotherapy. Incremental costs for a 3-week maintenance chemotherapy cycle were $6601 per patient. After 29 model iterations corresponding to 60 months of follow-up, mean per-patient costs were $105239 for maintenance therapy and $21.10 for observation. Mean QALYs accrued were 1.34 for maintenance therapy and 1.20 for observation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio favored maintenance treatment, at an incremental cost of $725601 per QALY. The unadjusted ratio was $438394 per life-year. Sensitivity analyses revealed that cost-effectiveness varied with changes in drug costs. To achieve an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $59039 (median US household income) per unadjusted life-year would require capecitabine and bevacizumab drug costs to be reduced from $6173 (current cost) to $452 per 3-week chemotherapy cycle. Conclusions and Relevance: Antineoplastic therapy is expensive for payers and society. The price of capecitabine and bevacizumab maintenance therapy would need to be reduced by 93% to make it cost-effective, a finding useful for policy decision making and payment negotiations.",2018-01-28377,30489611,Int Health,Scott K Sherman,2018,/,,No,30489611,"Scott K Sherman; Joel J Lange; Fadi S Dahdaleh; Rahul Rajeev; T Clark Gamblin; Blase N Polite; Kiran K Turaga; Cost-effectiveness of Maintenance Capecitabine and Bevacizumab for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, Int Health, 2018 Jul 5; ():1876-3405",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Capecitabine and bevacizumab maintenance therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard metastatic colorectal cancer treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,60 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,725601,United States,2018,747862.55
20137,A mathematical model of biomedical interventions for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in China,"BACKGROUND: The new HIV treatment guidelines in China recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people living with HIV, but significant gaps in implementation still exist. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can effectively reduce the risk of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study assessed the epidemiological impact and cost effectiveness of PrEP, enhanced biomedical interventions and their combination among MSM in China. METHODS: A deterministic mathematical model was developed and projected over 20 years to assess the impact of the PrEP, biomedical interventions and their combinations. Incidence and prevalence of HIV were measured, and cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost (international dollars, Int.$) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: A total of 0.78 million new HIV infections were estimated to occur over the next 20 years if no additional interventions are implemented among MSM. The PrEP-only strategy covering 25-75% of HIV-negative high-risk MSM can prevent 0.09-0.20 million (12.1-25.7%) new infections, at a cost of 17,277-18,452 Int.$/QALY. The optimal cost-effectiveness path is from test-and-treat to the combination strategy of test-and-treat and PrEP. Some strategies could almost eliminate new HIV infections over the next 20 years.

20145,A mathematical model of biomedical interventions for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in China,"BACKGROUND: The new HIV treatment guidelines in China recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people living with HIV, but significant gaps in implementation still exist. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can effectively reduce the risk of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study assessed the epidemiological impact and cost effectiveness of PrEP, enhanced biomedical interventions and their combination among MSM in China. METHODS: A deterministic mathematical model was developed and projected over 20 years to assess the impact of the PrEP, biomedical interventions and their combinations. Incidence and prevalence of HIV were measured, and cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost (international dollars, Int.$) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: A total of 0.78 million new HIV infections were estimated to occur over the next 20 years if no additional interventions are implemented among MSM. The PrEP-only strategy covering 25-75% of HIV-negative high-risk MSM can prevent 0.09-0.20 million (12.1-25.7%) new infections, at a cost of 17,277-18,452 Int.$/QALY.

20147,Healthcare value of implementing hepatitis C screening in the adult general population in Spain,"BACKGROUND: Elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection requires high diagnostic rates and universal access to treatment. Around 40% of infected individuals are unaware of their infection, which indicates that effective screening strategies are needed. We analyzed the efficiency (incremental cost-utility ratio, ICUR) of 3 HCV screening strategies: a) general population of adults, b) high-risk groups, and c) population with the highest anti-HCV prevalence plus high-risk groups. METHODS: An analytical decision model, projecting progression of the disease over a lifetime, was used to establish the candidate population for HCV screening. HCV data were obtained from the literature: anti-HCV prevalence (0.56%-1.54%), viremic patients (31.5%), and percentage of undiagnosed persons among those with viremia (35%). It was assumed that most patients would be treated and have HCV therapy response (98% SVR); transition probabilities, utilities, and disease management annual costs were obtained from the literature. Efficiency over the life of patients under the National Health System perspective was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and total cost (screening, diagnosis, pharmacological and disease management). A discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and outcomes. RESULTS: Screening of the adult population would identify a larger number of additional chronic hepatitis C cases (N = 52,694) than screening the highest anti-HCV prevalence population plus high-risk groups (N = 42,027) or screening high-risk groups (N = 26,128). ICUR for the general population vs. high-risk groups was euro8914/QALY gained per patient (euro18,157 incremental cost and 2.037 QALY). ICUR for the general population vs. population with highest anti-HCV prevalence plus high-risk groups was euro7,448/QALY gained per patient (euro7,733 incremental cost and 1.038 QALY).

20149,Health Care Costs and Cost-effectiveness in Laryngotracheal Stenosis,"OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) is resource-intensive disease. The cost-effectiveness of LTS treatments has not been adequately explored. We aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing open reconstruction (cricotracheal/tracheal resection [CTR/TR]) with endoscopic dilation in the treatment of LTS. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Tertiary referral center (2013-2017). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four LTS patients were recruited. Annual costs were derived from the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins University. Cost-effectiveness analysis compared CTR/TR versus endoscopic dilation at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over 5- and 10-year time horizons. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated with deterministic analysis and tested for sensitivity with univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Mean LTS costs were $4080.09 (SE, $569.29) annually for related health care visits. The major risk factor for increased cost was etiology of stenosis. As compared with idiopathic patients, patients with intubation-related stenosis had significantly higher annual costs ($5286.56 vs $2873.62, P = .03). The cost of CTR/TR was $8583.91 (SE, $2263.22). Over a 5-year time horizon, CTR/TR gained $896 per QALY over serial dilations and was cost-effective. Over a 10-year time horizon, CTR/TR dominated dilations with a lower cost and higher QALY. CONCLUSION: The cost of treatment for LTS is significant. Patients with intubation-related stenosis have significantly higher annual costs than do idiopathic patients.

20151,Cost-Effectiveness of Targeted Pharmacotherapy for Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"BACKGROUND: Newer classes of targeted drugs for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis are more effective and more expensive than older classes, posing a difficult and potentially costly decision about whether to use them as initial targeted treatments. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of initial targeted treatment for the following drugs: adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab (TNFalpha inhibitors); apremilast (PDE4 inhibitor); ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor); and ixekizumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab (IL-17 inhibitors). METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate patient outcomes as measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health care costs over a 10-year period. We assumed that patients who fail initial targeted treatment either proceed to subsequent therapy or discontinue targeted treatment. Effectiveness estimates for initial treatment were defined as improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline and derived from a 2018 network meta-analysis. Wholesale acquisition drug costs were discounted by a class-specific, empirically derived rebate percentage off of 2016 costs. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty in results. RESULTS: The incremental benefits compared with no targeted treatment were, in descending order: ixekizumab 1.68 QALYs (95% credible range [CR] = 1.11-2.02), brodalumab 1.64 QALYs (95% CR = 1.08-1.98), secukinumab 1.51 QALYs (95% CR = 1.00-1.83), ustekinumab 1.43 QALYs (95% CR=0.94-1.74), infliximab 1.27 QALYs (95% CR = 0.89-1.55), adalimumab 1.15 QALYs (95% CR = 0.76-1.44), etanercept 0.97 QALYs (95% CR = 0.61-1.25), and apremilast 0.87 QALYs (95% CR = 0.52-1.17). Costs of care without targeted treatment totaled $66,451, and costs of targeted treatment ranged from $137,080 (apremilast) to $255,422 (ustekinumab). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results indicated that infliximab and apremilast are likely to be the most cost-effective initial treatments at willingness-to-pay thresholds around $100,000 per QALY, while IL-17 drugs are more likely to be cost-effective at thresholds approaching $150,000 per QALY. Acquisition cost of the initial targeted drug and utility of clinical response were the most influential parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that initial targeted treatment with IL-17 inhibitors is the most effective treatment strategy for plaque psoriasis patients who have failed methotrexate and phototherapy. Apremilast, brodalumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab are cost-effective at different willingness-to-pay thresholds.

20154,Cost-Effectiveness of Targeted Pharmacotherapy for Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"BACKGROUND: Newer classes of targeted drugs for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis are more effective and more expensive than older classes, posing a difficult and potentially costly decision about whether to use them as initial targeted treatments. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of initial targeted treatment for the following drugs: adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab (TNFalpha inhibitors); apremilast (PDE4 inhibitor); ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor); and ixekizumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab (IL-17 inhibitors). METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate patient outcomes as measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health care costs over a 10-year period. We assumed that patients who fail initial targeted treatment either proceed to subsequent therapy or discontinue targeted treatment. Effectiveness estimates for initial treatment were defined as improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline and derived from a 2018 network meta-analysis. Wholesale acquisition drug costs were discounted by a class-specific, empirically derived rebate percentage off of 2016 costs. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty in results. RESULTS: The incremental benefits compared with no targeted treatment were, in descending order: ixekizumab 1.68 QALYs (95% credible range [CR] = 1.11-2.02), brodalumab 1.64 QALYs (95% CR = 1.08-1.98), secukinumab 1.51 QALYs (95% CR = 1.00-1.83), ustekinumab 1.43 QALYs (95% CR=0.94-1.74), infliximab 1.27 QALYs (95% CR = 0.89-1.55), adalimumab 1.15 QALYs (95% CR = 0.76-1.44), etanercept 0.97 QALYs (95% CR = 0.61-1.25), and apremilast 0.87 QALYs (95% CR = 0.52-1.17). Costs of care without targeted treatment totaled $66,451, and costs of targeted treatment ranged from $137,080 (apremilast) to $255,422 (ustekinumab). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results indicated that infliximab and apremilast are likely to be the most cost-effective initial treatments at willingness-to-pay thresholds around $100,000 per QALY, while IL-17 drugs are more likely to be cost-effective at thresholds approaching $150,000 per QALY. Acquisition cost of the initial targeted drug and utility of clinical response were the most influential parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that initial targeted treatment with IL-17 inhibitors is the most effective treatment strategy for plaque psoriasis patients who have failed methotrexate and phototherapy. Apremilast, brodalumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab are cost-effective at different willingness-to-pay thresholds.

20159,A cost-effectiveness analysis of endoscopic eradication therapy for management of dysplasia arising in patients with Barrett's oesophagus in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) is the first line approach for treating Barrett''s Esophagus (BE) related neoplasia globally. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommend EET with combined endoscopic resection (ER) for visible dysplasia followed by endoscopic ablation in patients with both low and high grade dysplasia (LGD and HGD). The aim of this study is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis for EET for treatment of all grades of dysplasia in BE patients. METHODS: A Markov cohort model with a lifetime time horizon was used to undertake a cost effectiveness analysis. A hypothetical cohort of United Kingdom (UK) patients diagnosed with BE entered the model. Patients in the treatment arm with LGD and HGD received EET and patients with non-dysplastic BE (NDBE) received endoscopic surveillance only. In the comparator arm, patients with LGD, HGD and NDBE received endoscopic surveillance only. A UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective was adopted and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on key input parameters. RESULTS: EET for patients with LGD and HGD arising in BE is cost-effective compared to endoscopic surveillance alone (lifetime ICER pound3,006 per QALY gained). The results show that as the time horizon increases, the treatment becomes more cost-effective. The five year financial impact to the UK NHS of introducing EET is pound7.1m. CONCLUSIONS: EET for patients with low and high grade BE dysplasia, following updated guidelines from the BSG has been shown to be cost-effective for patients with BE in the UK.",2018-01-28412,30479169,Curr Med Res Opin,V Pollit,2018,/,1-29,No,30479169,"V Pollit; D Graham; C Leonard; A Filby; J McMaster; S J Mealing; L B Lovat; R J Haidry; A cost-effectiveness analysis of endoscopic eradication therapy for management of dysplasia arising in patients with Barrett's oesophagus in the United Kingdom, Curr Med Res Opin, 2018 Jan 25; ():0300-7995; 1-29",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,Endoscopic eradication therapy vs. Endoscopic surveillance,Low-grade or high-grade dysplasia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,3006,United Kingdom,2017,4091.24
20160,Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin for the Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome After a 12-Month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis From China Payer's Perspective,"PURPOSE: Monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended for long-term use after discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The present study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel versus aspirin after 12-month DAPT for patients with ACS who underwent PCI in China. METHODS: A 2-part model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel compared with aspirin. The short-term part was a decision tree that included health states such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, MI and stroke, cardiovascular death, and death from other causes with a treatment horizon of 1 year (base case), 2 years or 3 years after 12-month DAPT. Major bleeding was included. The long-term (lifetime) part was a Markov model that included different health states such as MI, after MI, stroke, after stroke, and death. Drug acquisition cost and other direct medical costs were based on pricing records, literature, and expert panels. Clinical outcomes and utilities were based on literature. The model output included incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs per patient. Both 1-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted. FINDINGS: In the base-case scenario, the total costs of the treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin were yen12,590 ($1849/euro1590) and yen10,642 ($1563/euro1344), respectively; the total QALYs of the 2 patient populations were 9.7341 and 9.6894, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of yen43,593 ($6402/euro5515) per QALY gained was lower than 3 times of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China ( yen161,940, $23,786/euro20,449). Both 1-way sensitivity analysis and PSA confirmed the robustness of the results. PSA results indicated that clopidogrel was cost effective versus aspirin in 80.5% of the simulations, considering >3 times the GDP per capita as the threshold. Results in other scenarios (clopidogrel or aspirin for 2 or 3 years after 12-month DAPT) also indicated that clopidogrel was more cost effective than aspirin for patients with ACS after 12-month DAPT. IMPLICATIONS: Compared with aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel monotherapy for 1 year after 12-month DAPT was cost effective for patients with ACS who underwent PCI in China. Furthermore, when the duration of clopidogrel the monotherapy extended up to 3 years, clopidogrel was still cost effective compared with aspirin. The study was limited by lack of high-quality efficacy data among the Chinese population.",2018-01-28436,30470579,Clin Ther,Lei Zhang,2018,40 / 12,2125-2137,Yes,30470579,"Lei Zhang; Ziyi Lin; Hongjun Yin; Jing Liu; Jianwei Xuan; Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin for the Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome After a 12-Month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis From China Payer's Perspective, Clin Ther, 2018 Dec; 40(12):1879-114X; 2125-2137",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,43593,China,2017,6811.98

20164,Cost-effectiveness analysis of umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg versus tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 mcg in symptomatic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a Spanish National Healthcare System perspective,"BACKGROUND: A head-to-head study demonstrated the superiority of once-daily umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) 62.5/25 mcg on trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) versus once-daily tiotropium/olodaterol (TIO/OLO) 5/5 mcg in symptomatic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of UMEC/VI versus TIO/OLO from a Spanish National Healthcare System perspective, using data from this study and Spanish literature. METHODS: This analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Spanish National Healthcare System with a 3-year horizon as base case. A disease progression model using a linked risk equation approach was used to estimate disease progression and associated healthcare costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) study was used to develop the statistical risk equations for clinical endpoints, and costs were calculated using a health state approach (by dyspnea severity). Utilities for QALY calculation were estimated using patient baseline characteristics within a regression fit to Spanish observational data. Treatment effect, expressed as change from baseline in FEV1 was obtained from the head-to-head study and used in the model (UMEC/VI minus TIO/OLO difference: + 52 mL [95% confidence interval: 28, 77]). Baseline patient characteristics were sourced from Spanish literature or the head-to-head study if unavailable. A scenario analysis using only the intent-to-treat (ITT) population from the head-to-head study, and sensitivity analyses (including probabilistic sensitivity analyses), were conducted. Direct healthcare costs (2017 Euro) were obtained from Spanish sources and costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: UMEC/VI was associated with small improvements in QALYs (+ 0.029) over a 3-year time horizon, compared with TIO/OLO, alongside cost savings of euro393/patient. The ITT scenario analysis and sensitivity analyses had similar results. All probabilistic simulations resulted in UMEC/VI being less costly and more effective than TIO/OLO. CONCLUSION: UMEC/VI dominated TIO/OLO (more effective and less expensive).

20168,Economic analysis of osimertinib in previously untreated EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer in Canada,"INTRODUCTION: Osimertinib improves progression-free survival in previously untreated EGFR-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, with marked intracranial response rates. However, its cost-effectiveness in a publically funded health care system has not been established. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of first-line osimertinib from the public payer perspective in the Canadian health care system. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project the outcomes and direct medical costs of initial treatment with osimertinib or current standard-of-care (SoC) EGFR TKIs, gefinitib or afatinib, in patients with previously untreated EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC. Clinical and cost input estimates were informed from the available literature. Model outcomes included costs (in 2018 Canadian dollars), life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the cost utility of osimertinib compared to SoC EGFR TKI, or incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Initial treatment with osimertinib was associated with a gain of 0.79 QALY [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74 to 0.83] at an incremental cost of $176,394 CAD (95% CI, 176,383 to 176,405) vs. SoC EGFR TKI (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: $223,133/QALY gained; 95%CI, 198,144 to 252,805). Osimertinib had a 0% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of osimertinib had the largest impact on ICER results. CONCLUSION: At the current marketed price, first-line osimertinib therapy in patients with advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma is not cost-effective in Canada. Reduction of osimertinib cost, for example by 25%, can significantly improve the cost-effectiveness profile.",2018-01-28496,30429004,Lung Cancer,Doreen A Ezeife,2018,125 /,1-7,No,30429004,"Doreen A Ezeife; Veronica Kirk; Derek S Chew; Nancy A Nixon; Roy Lee; Lisa W Le; Kelvin K-W Chan; Natasha B Leighl; Economic analysis of osimertinib in previously untreated EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer in Canada, Lung Cancer, 2018 Nov; 125():0169-5002; 1-7",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,First Line Osimertinib vs. Standard/Usual Care- Gefitinib/Afatinib [Tyrosine kinase inhibitors],EGRF-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,1.50,1.50,223133,Canada,2018,177497.6
20169,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Active Surveillance Strategies for Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) has become the recommended management strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the optimal follow-up schedule in terms of the tests to perform and their frequency. OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and benefits of different AS follow-up strategies compared to watchful waiting (WW) or immediate treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A state-transition Markov model was developed to simulate the natural history (ie, no testing or intervention) of prostate cancer for a hypothetical cohort of 50-yr-old men newly diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer. Following diagnosis, men were hypothetically managed with immediate treatment, watchful waiting, or one of several AS strategies. AS follow-up was performed either with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was scheduled annually, biennially, every 3yrs, according to the PRIAS protocol (yrs 1, 4, 7, and 10, and then every 5yr) or every 5yr. Diagnosis of higher-grade or -stage disease while on AS resulted in curative treatment. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We measured discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted lifetime medical costs (2017 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Compared to WW, MRI-based surveillance performed every 5yr improved quality-adjusted survival by 4.47 quality-adjusted months and represented high-value health care at the Medicare reimbursement rate using standard cost-effectiveness metrics. Biopsy-based strategies were less effective and less costly than the corresponding MRI-based strategies for each testing interval. MRI-based surveillance at more frequent intervals had ICERs greater than $800000 per QALY and would not be considered cost-effective according to standard metrics. Our results were sensitive to the diagnostic accuracy and costs of both biopsy modes in detecting clinically significant cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of MRI into surveillance protocols at Medicare reimbursement rates and decreasing the intensity of repeat testing may be cost-effective options for men opting for conservative management of low-risk prostate cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: Our study modeled outcomes for men with low-risk prostate cancer undergoing watchful waiting, immediate treatment, or active surveillance with different follow-up schedules.

AS follow-up was performed either with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was scheduled annually, biennially, every 3yrs, according to the PRIAS protocol (yrs 1, 4, 7, and 10, and then every 5yr) or every 5yr. Diagnosis of higher-grade or -stage disease while on AS resulted in curative treatment. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We measured discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted lifetime medical costs (2017 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Compared to WW, MRI-based surveillance performed every 5yr improved quality-adjusted survival by 4.47 quality-adjusted months and represented high-value health care at the Medicare reimbursement rate using standard cost-effectiveness metrics. Biopsy-based strategies were less effective and less costly than the corresponding MRI-based strategies for each testing interval. MRI-based surveillance at more frequent intervals had ICERs greater than $800000 per QALY and would not be considered cost-effective according to standard metrics. Our results were sensitive to the diagnostic accuracy and costs of both biopsy modes in detecting clinically significant cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of MRI into surveillance protocols at Medicare reimbursement rates and decreasing the intensity of repeat testing may be cost-effective options for men opting for conservative management of low-risk prostate cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: Our study modeled outcomes for men with low-risk prostate cancer undergoing watchful waiting, immediate treatment, or active surveillance with different follow-up schedules. We found that conservative management of low-risk disease optimizes health outcomes and costs. Furthermore, we showed that decreasing the intensity of active surveillance follow-up and incorporating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into surveillance protocols can be cost-effective, depending on the MRI costs.",2018-01-28508,30425010,Eur Urol,Niranjan J Sathianathen,2018,/,,No,30425010,"Niranjan J Sathianathen; Badrinath R Konety; Fernando Alarid-Escudero; Nathan Lawrentschuk; Damien M Bolton; Karen M Kuntz; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Active Surveillance Strategies for Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer, Eur Urol, 2018 Nov 10; ():0302-2838",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Procedure",Biopsy Every 3 years vs. PRAIS biopsy schedule,Low-Risk,50 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2017,Not Stated

20180,Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin testing to guide antibiotic treatment duration in critically ill patients: results from a randomised controlled multicentre trial in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT) testing can help in safely reducing antibiotic treatment duration in intensive care patients with sepsis. However, the cost-effectiveness of such PCT guidance is not yet known. METHODS: A trial-based analysis was performed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCT guidance compared with standard of care (without PCT guidance). Patient-level data were used from the SAPS trial in which 1546 patients were randomised. This trial was performed in the Netherlands, which is a country with, on average, low antibiotic use and a short duration of hospital stay. As quality of life among sepsis survivors was not measured during the SAPS, this was derived from a Dutch follow-up study. Outcome measures were (1) incremental direct hospital cost and (2) incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a healthcare perspective over a one-year time horizon. Uncertainty in outcomes was assessed with bootstrapping. RESULTS: Mean in-hospital costs were euro46,081/patient in the PCT group compared with euro46,146/patient with standard of care (i.e. - euro65 (95% CI - euro6314 to euro6107); - 0.1%). The duration of the first course of antibiotic treatment was lower in the PCT group with 6.9 vs. 8.2 days (i.e. - 1.2 days (95% CI - 1.9 to - 0.4), - 14.8%). This was accompanied by lower in-hospital mortality of 21.8% vs. 29.8% (absolute decrease 7.9% (95% CI - 13.9% to - 1.8%), relative decrease 26.6%), resulting in an increase in mean QALYs/patient from 0.47 to 0.52 (i.e. + 0.05 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.10); + 10.1%). However, owing to high costs among sepsis survivors, healthcare costs over a one-year time horizon were euro73,665/patient in the PCT group compared with euro70,961/patient with standard of care (i.e. + euro2704 (95% CI - euro4495 to euro10,005), + 3.8%), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro57,402/QALY gained. Within this time frame, the probability of PCT guidance being cost-effective was 64% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro80,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although the impact of PCT guidance on total healthcare-related costs during the initial hospitalisation episode is likely negligible, the lower in-hospital mortality may lead to a non-significant increase in costs over a one-year time horizon.

This health-economic study evaluated if a dedicated form of cognitive behaviour therapy for social activation (CBTsa) would reduce negative symptoms and improve QOL in an economically sustainable way. METHODS: A health-economic evaluation was conducted alongside a single-blind randomised controlled trial in two parallel groups: guideline congruent treatment as usual (TAU; n = 50) versus TAU augmented with adjunct CBTsa (n = 49). Outcomes were PANSS negative symptom severity and EQ-5D quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The health-economic evaluation was conducted both from the societal and the health sector perspective. RESULTS: Both conditions showed improvement in the respective outcomes over the follow-up period of six months, but QALY gains were significantly higher in the CBTsa condition compared to the TAU condition. Treatment response rate (i.e. >/= 5-point decrease on the PANSS) was not significantly different. However, the add-on CBT intervention was associated with higher costs. This did not support the idea that CBTsa is a cost-effective adjunct. Various sensitivity analyses attested to the robustness of these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In the Dutch context where TAU for psychosis is guideline congruent and well implemented there appears no added value for adjunct CBTsa. In other settings where the treatment for the schizophrenia spectrum disorders solely relies on antipsychotics, add-on CBTsa may lead to clinically superior outcomes, but it should still be evaluated if adjunct CBTsa therapy is a cost-effective alternative.

20182,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of the 45-49 year old health check versus usual care in Australian general practice: A modelling study,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential cost-effectiveness of the 45-49 year old health check versus usual care in Australian general practice using secondary data sources. METHOD: Risk factor profiles were generated for a hypothetical Australian cohort using data from the National Health Survey. Intervention effects were modelled based on a meta-analysis on risk factor changes in the 5 years after a health check. The Framingham Risk Equation was applied to estimate the 5-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in the health check and usual care group respectively. A Markov model was then constructed to extrapolate long-term CVD outcomes, health care costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in both groups. Health check-related costs, applied to the health check group, were estimated from clinical guideline and experts'' opinion. Lifetime costs, applied to both groups, included costs of hospitalization for CVD events and associated post-event health service use. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was calculated for male and female patients respectively. RESULTS: Compared to usual care, the health check reduced CVD incidence for both males (RR = 0.87) and females (RR = 0.91) over a 5-year time. In a lifetime projection, health check led to an average 0.008 and 0.003 QALYs gained per male and female participants respectively. The estimates ICERs were AU $42,355 and AU $133,504 per QALY gained for males and females, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a probability of cost-effectiveness of 17.5% and 0% for male and female attendees, assuming a willingness to pay threshold of AU $28,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The 45-49 year old health check is associated with a small expected QALY gain per participant, though the persons avoiding CVD events experience large health gains.

20184,How does the Cox maze procedure compare? Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative treatments of atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVES: Data related to the cost effectiveness of surgical interventions and catheter ablation are sparse. This model-based analysis assessed the clinical and economic trade-offs involved in using catheter ablation or the Cox maze procedure in treating patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: A deterministic model was developed to project one-year and lifetime health-related outcomes, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost effectiveness of each treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation. Using previously unpublished Inova Heart and Vascular Institute (IHVI) data for patients undergoing either procedure, one-year cost and clinical efficacy inputs were estimated. These data were supplemented with published literature and used to estimate costs, utilities, mortality, and likelihood of patient improvement. Results were reported as cost-effectiveness ratios in $/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness of results. RESULTS: Patients initially treated with a Cox maze procedure were estimated to have higher costs than those treated with catheter ablation, both after one year and over the lifetime. However, patients undergoing the Cox maze procedure also had lower rates of one-year mortality than catheter ablation patients (3.5% vs. 8.5%) and the highest rate of improvement following treatment, resulting in the higher QALYs (12.4 vs. 10.2). Compared to catheter ablation, the lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the Cox maze surgical procedure was $12,794 per QALY gained. Without quality adjustment, the ratio was $11,315. Results were most sensitive to the likelihood of improvement following each intervention and the cost of the initial procedure.

20194,Cost-effectiveness of novel regimens for Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis C,"OBJECTIVE: Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been approved for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in China. However, they are substantially more expensive. The current analysis will investigate the cost-effectiveness of novel regimens compared with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR) therapies for informing Chinese decision makers. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to measure economic and health outcomes of novel regimens for genotype 1b, 2, 3 and 6 HCV infections compared with PR treatment. Clinical, cost and utility inputs were gathered from published sources. Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are shown. The uncertainty was facilitated by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For genotype 1b HCV infection, the combination of paritaprevir, ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir was cost-saving compared with four competing alternatives. The ICERs of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for genotypes 2 and 3 were lower than the threshold ($18,234/QALY).

20196,Regorafenib treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who progressed on sorafenib-A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths. Patients with advanced HCC are treated with sorafenib. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated a survival benefit for regorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC who had progressed on sorafenib. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this approach. METHODS: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of regorafenib, we used a Markov model that incorporates health outcomes, measured by life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on 2017 discounted prices. Model robustness was validated by probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: The use of regorafenib results in a gain of 19.76 weeks of life (0.38 Life Years) as compared to placebo. When adjusted for quality of life, using regorafenib produced a gain of 0.25 quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for regorafenib compared with best supportive care was between $201,797 and $268,506 per QALY.

20199,Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic hepatitis B and C among migrant populations in a low endemic country,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. In a low endemic country as the Netherlands, migrants are a key risk group and could benefit from early diagnosis and antiviral treatment. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening foreign-born migrants for chronic HBV and/or HCV using a societal perspective. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model. Estimates on prevalence, screening programme costs, participation and treatment uptake, transition probabilities, healthcare costs, productivity losses and utilities were derived from the literature. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was estimated and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For most migrant groups with an expected high number of chronically infected cases in the Netherlands combined screening is cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from euro4,962/QALY gained for migrants originating from the Former Soviet Union and Vietnam to euro9,375/QALY gained for Polish migrants. HBV and HCV screening proved to be cost-effective for migrants from countries with chronic HBV or HCV prevalence of >/=0.41% and >/=0.22%, with ICERs below the Dutch cost-effectiveness reference value of euro20,000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that treatment costs influenced the ICER for both infections.
