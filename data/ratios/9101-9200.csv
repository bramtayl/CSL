9101,Certolizumab pegol compared to natalizumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease: results of a decision analysis,"A significant proportion of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) lose response to antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor a (TNF). Prior TNF-antagonist failure is associated with lower rates of response to subsequent TNF-antagonist therapy. In patients failing two anti-TNF agents, a choice exists between using a third-anti-TNF therapy or natalizumab (NAT), an a-4 integrin inhibitor. A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing these competing strategies has not been performed.A decision analytic model was constructed to compare the performance of certolizumab pegol (CZP) versus NAT in patients with moderate to severe CD. Previously published estimates of efficacy of third-line anti-TNF therapy and NAT were used to inform the model. Costs were expressed in 2010 US dollars. A 1-year time frame was used for the analysis.In the base case estimate, use of NAT was only marginally more effective [0.71 vs. 0.70 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs)] than CZP but was expensive with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $381,678 per QALY gained. For CZP 2?months response rate of at least 24%, NAT had an ICER above the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. The model was sensitive to the costs of both therapies; for all CZP costs below $2,300 per dose, NAT had higher ICER than the WTP threshold. Substituting adalimumab for CZP resulted in similar ICER estimates and thresholds for NAT use.In patients with moderate to severe CD failing two TNF-antagonists, using a third TNF-antagonist therapy appears to be a cost-effective strategy without significantly compromising treatment efficacy.",2012-01-08104,21909990,Dig Dis Sci,Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan,2012,57 /,472-80,No,21909990,"Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan; Chin Hur; Joshua R Korzenik; Certolizumab pegol compared to natalizumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease: results of a decision analysis, Dig Dis Sci, ; 57 ():0163-2116; 472-80",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Certolizumab pegol (400 mg subcutaneously and continued on monthly maintenance therapy) vs. Natalizumab (300 mg intravenously every month),Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,552800,United States,2010,656119.17
9102,Should pharmacogenetics be incorporated in major depression treatment? Economic evaluation in high- and middle-income European countries,"The serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR polymorphism moderates response to SSRIs and side-effect burden. The aim of this study is to quantify the cost-utility of incorporating 5-HTTLPR genotyping in drug treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We previously reported a theoretical model to simulate antidepressant treatment with citalopram or bupropion for 12 weeks. The drugs were alternatively selected according to an 'as usual' algorithm or based on response and tolerability predicted by 5-HTTLPR profile. Here we apply this model to conduct a cost-utility analysis in three European regions with high GDP (Euro A), middle GDP (Euro B) and middle-high GDP (Euro C). In addition we test a verification scenario in which citalopram+bupropion augmentation is administered to individuals with the least favorable 5-HTTLPR genotype. Treatment outcomes are remission and Quality Adjusted-Life Weeks (QALW). Cost data (international $, year 2009) are retrieved from the World Health Organization (WHO) and national official sources. In base-case scenario incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values are $1147 (Euro A), $1185 (Euro B) and $1178 (Euro C). From cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), the probability of having an ICER value below WHO recommended cost-utility threshold (3 GDP per capita=$1926) is >90% in high-income countries (Euro A). In middle- income regions, these probabilities are <30% (Euro B) and <55% (Euro C) respectively. All estimates are robust against variations in treatment parameters, but if genetic test cost decreases to $100, pharmacogenetic approach becomes cost-effective in middle-income countries (Euro B). This simulation using data from 27 European states suggests that choosing antidepressant treatment from the results of 5-HTTLPR might be a cost-effective solution in high income countries.

9120,Synthetic vascular hemodialysis access versus native arteriovenous fistula: a cost-utility analysis,"To determine the cost-effectiveness of 2 different vascular access strategies among incident dialysis patients.Vascular access is a principal cause of morbidity and cost in hemodialysis patients. Recent guidelines and initiatives are intended to increase the proportion of patients with a fistula. However, there is growing awareness of the high prevalence of fistula failures and attendant complications.A decision analysis using a Markov model was implemented to compare 2 different vascular access strategies among incident dialysis patients: (1) placing an arteriovenous fistula (AVF1st) as the initial access followed by a synthetic vascular access if the AVF did not mature compared to (2) placing a synthetic vascular access (SVA1st) as the initial access device. The cost-utility was evaluated across a range of the risk of complications from temporary catheters and SVA.Under base case assumptions, the AVF1st strategy yielded 2.19 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with 2.06 QALYs from the SVA1st strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness was $9389 per QALY for AVF1st compared to SVA1st and was less than $50,000 per QALY as long as the probability of maturation is 36% or greater. AVF1st was the dominant strategy when the AVF maturation rate was 69% or greater.The high risk of complications of temporary catheters and the overall low AVF maturation rate explain why a universal policy of AVF1st for all incident dialysis patients may not optimize clinical outcomes. Strong consideration should be given to a more patient-centered approach taking into account the likelihood of AVF maturation.",2012-01-08127,21918428,Ann Surg,Sylvia E Rosas,2012,255 /,181-6,No,21918428,"Sylvia E Rosas; Harold I Feldman; Synthetic vascular hemodialysis access versus native arteriovenous fistula: a cost-utility analysis, Ann Surg, ; 255 ():0003-4932; 181-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF1st) as initial access followed by synthetic vascular access vs. Synthetic vascular access (SVA1st) as the initial access device,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,9389,United States,2004,12863.82

Little has been published on whether the benefits of combination therapy are worth the additional expense of a second prescription. This manuscript adds to the literature by exploring the cost effectiveness of the combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin compared to alpha blocker and 5ARI monotherapy. OBJECTIVE: ? To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) compared with alpha-blocker (AB), 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) monotherapy or watchful waiting (WW) in male patients enrolled in the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (CombAT) trial using a Norwegian economic model. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ? A decision analytic model was constructed to evaluate the BPH treatment regimens using point estimate base-case analyses, one-way sensitivity testing and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. ? Symptom severity and acute urinary retention/transurethral resection of the prostate (AUR/TURP) event data came from the 4-year evaluation of the CombAT trial with additional data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial. The model makes use of Norwegian practice pattern data and unit cost and utility estimates were taken from the published literature. ? The model calculates treatment costs and utility outcomes at two time horizons: 4 years and lifetime. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using WW as the basis of comparison. Costs and health state utilities were discounted after the first year. RESULTS: ? At 4 years, ICER results for combination therapy are higher than AB monotherapy as a result of the higher drug cost, but the overall cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) differences are small. ? At the lifetime evaluation, the ICER results decrease from those at the 4-year horizon, although AB monotherapy remains less expensive than combination therapy. However, the incremental QALYs gained for combination therapy are twice those of AB monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: ? The model is sensitive to variability in estimates of health state utility assigned on the basis of symptom severity, indicating that both monotherapy and combination therapy have an advantage in maintaining patients in less severe symptom states. ?

At 4 years, ICER results for combination therapy are higher than AB monotherapy as a result of the higher drug cost, but the overall cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) differences are small. ? At the lifetime evaluation, the ICER results decrease from those at the 4-year horizon, although AB monotherapy remains less expensive than combination therapy. However, the incremental QALYs gained for combination therapy are twice those of AB monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: ? The model is sensitive to variability in estimates of health state utility assigned on the basis of symptom severity, indicating that both monotherapy and combination therapy have an advantage in maintaining patients in less severe symptom states. ? Overall, combination therapy for BPH is expected to provide the greatest net monetary benefit at willingness-to-pay thresholds at or above ??6000 (?5400).",2012-01-08140,21933326,BJU Int,Truls E Bjerklund Johansen,2011,/,,No,21933326,"Truls E Bjerklund Johansen; Timothy M Baker; Libby K Black; Cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a model based on the findings of the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin trial, BJU Int, ; ():1464-4096",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Monotherapy (5-ARI:dutasteride) vs. Watchful waiting (WW),Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,7274,Euro,2009,12228.57
9127,Cost-effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment for HIV-positive drug users in Vietnam,"Abstract Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is efficacious in reducing drug use that may improve HIV/AIDS care and treatment outcomes. This study evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness of MMT for HIV-positive drug users from the perspective of health service providers. A sample of 370 HIV-positive drug users (age: mean?SD: 29.5?5.9 years; 95.7% male) taking MMT in multi-sites was assessed at baseline, three, six and nine months. Costs of MMT services were analyzed and converted to the year 2009. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were modeled from changes in health-related quality of life of patients using the modified World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Inverse probability-of-treatment weights, constructed using propensity score of non-responses, were applied to adjust for potential confounding. Over nine months, MMT substantially improved QALYs of HIV/AIDS patients (0.076 QALY [0.066-0.084]). The increments in QALY were large and stabilized in those patients taking antiretroviral treatment and abstinent to drug use. For one QALY gained, the MMT program would cost US$3745.3, approximately 3.2 times Vietnam GDP per capita in 2009. The cost-effectiveness of MMT intervention was robust against HIV advanced status or co-morbidity, e.g., TB treatment, but it might not be cost-effective for those patients who continued to use drug. Findings of this study indicate that providing MMT for HIV-positive drug users is a cost-effective intervention in Vietnam. Integrating MMT to HIV/AIDS care and treatment services would be beneficial in injection-driven HIV epidemics.",2012-01-08146,21936718,AIDS Care,Bach Xuan Tran,2012,/,,No,21936718,"Bach Xuan Tran; Arto Ohinmaa; Anh Thuy Duong; Nhan Thi Do; Long Thanh Nguyen; Steve Mills; Stan Houston; Philip Jacobs; Cost-effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment for HIV-positive drug users in Vietnam, AIDS Care, ; ():0954-0121",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Daily methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,9 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2454.55,United States,2009,2961.09

9136,"Hemiarthroplasty compared to internal fixation with percutaneous cannulated screws as treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly: cost-utility analysis performed alongside a randomized, controlled trial","We estimated the cost-effectiveness of hemiarthroplasty compared to internal fixation for elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures. Over 2?years, patients treated with hemiarthroplasty gained more quality-adjusted life years than patients treated with internal fixation. In addition, costs for hemiarthroplasty were lower. Hemiarthroplasty was thus cost effective. INTRODUCTION: Estimating the cost utility of hemiarthroplasty compared to internal fixation in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was conducted alongside a clinical randomized controlled trial at a university hospital in Norway; 166 patients, 124 (75%) women with a mean age of 82?years were randomized to either internal fixation (n?=?86) or hemiarthroplasty (n?=?80). Patients were followed up at 4, 12, and 24?months. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D, and in combination with time used to calculate patients' quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Resource use was identified, quantified, and valued for direct and indirect hospital costs and for societal costs. Results were expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Over the 2-year period, patients treated with hemiarthroplasty gained 0.15-0.20 more QALYs than patients treated with internal fixation. For the hemiarthroplasty group, the direct hospital costs, total hospital costs, and total costs were non-significantly less costly compared with the internal fixation group, with an incremental cost of <euro>2,731 (p?=?0.81), <euro>2,474 (p?=?0.80), and <euro>14,160 (p?=?0.07), respectively. Thus, hemiarthroplasty was the dominant treatment. Sensitivity analyses by bootstrapping supported these findings. CONCLUSION: Hemiarthroplasty was a cost-effective treatment.

9137,Cost-effectiveness of saxagliptin (Onglyza(?)) in type 2 diabetes in Sweden,"AIM: The objective of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of saxagliptin (Onglyza(?)), a DPP-4 inhibitor, plus metformin compared with a sulphonylurea (SU) (Glipizide) plus metformin in Swedish patients not well controlled on metformin alone. METHODS: Data from a 52-week clinical trial comparing saxagliptin and glipizide in combination with metformin was used in a simulation model to estimate long term complications in a cohort of type 2 diabetes patients. The model estimates the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications, diabetes-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and ultimately, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the investigated treatment strategies. Costs and QALYs were estimated for a lifetime time horizon. RESULTS: Compared with SU+metformin, the cost per QALY gained with saxagliptin+metformin is approximately SEK 91,000. Patients on saxagliptin+metformin gain 0.10 QALYs on average, at an incremental cost of around SEK 9500. The cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, over a patient's lifetime, the addition of saxagliptin to metformin is associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life years compared with SU in patients with type 2 diabetes. Saxagliptin treatment is a cost-effective treatment alternative for type 2 diabetes in patients not well-controlled on metformin alone.",2012-01-08185,22001114,Prim Care Diabetes,Ola Granstr?m,2012,6 / 2,,No,22001114,"Ola Granstr?m; Klas Bergenheim; Phil McEwan; Karin Sennf?lt; Martin Henriksson; Cost-effectiveness of saxagliptin (Onglyza(?)) in type 2 diabetes in Sweden, Prim Care Diabetes , ; 6(2):1751-9918",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Saxagliptin (Onglyza® ) + Metformin (MET) vs. Sulphonylurea (SU) (Glipizide) + Metformin (MET),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,91260,Sweden,2008,16854.54

The study assessed changes in weight, blood pressure, and physical activity from baseline to 6, 12, and 15-18 months. (Study retention was 31% at 12 months.) Average and incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-offset analyses were conducted.Participants experienced significant weight loss (-4.0%, -4.0%, and -5.3%, respectively, in each RCT group after 12 months and -3.5%, -3.8%, and -5.1%, respectively, after 15 to 18 months), increased physical activity, and decreased blood pressure. Cost-effectiveness ratios were $900 to $1100/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for RCT1 and RCT2 and $1900/QALY for RCT3.

(2011) The cost-effectiveness of substituting physicians with diabetes nurse specialists: a randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up. Journal of Advanced Nursing00(0), 000-000. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05797.x ABSTRACT: Aims. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an intervention substituting physicians with nurse specialists. Background. Increasing populations of people with diabetes in most Western countries require creative solutions that give high-quality chronic care while controlling costs. Instigating nurse specialists as a substitute for physicians yields positive results in this area. Research about such interventions in a hospital-based setting is limited. Methods. This paper is a report of a study of a randomized, non-blinded clinical trial including people with diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2. In the intervention group nurse specialists were the central carers, providing care that conformed to a preset protocol. Patients were included between 2004 and 2007. Costs, quality of life and adverse events were measured, cost-effect ratios and incremental cost-effect ratios were calculated based on health-resource utilization rates, corresponding market prices and national tariffs from 2007. Results. Health related quality of life scores did not differ significantly between the control and the intervention group. In the intervention group, fewer patients were hospitalized and fewer side effects from drugs were reported compared to controls. Nurse specialists as central care givers generated a modest reduction in costs per quality adjusted life year gained compared to usual care. Conclusion. Nurse specialists give diabetes care that is similar to care provided by physicians in terms of quality of life and economic value. Instigating a nurse specialist as central carer yields opportunities to generate cost savings. Developing interventions which also focus on prevention of complications is recommended when aiming for long-term organisational cost savings.",2012-01-08189,22004474,J Adv Nurs,Elke E A Arts,2012,68 / 6,,No,22004474,"Elke E A Arts; Sabine A N T Landewe-Cleuren; Nicolaas C Schaper; Hubertus J M Vrijhoef; The cost-effectiveness of substituting physicians with diabetes nurse specialists: a randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up, J Adv Nurs, ; 68(6):0309-2402",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Care provided by nurse specialists confirming to preset protocol vs. Usual care provided by physicians,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,3642,Euro,2010,5720.82
9143,A cost-utility study of the use of pregabalin in treatment-refractory neuropathic pain,"Abstract Objectives: A small but significant proportion of patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (NeP) are refractory to the typical treatments applied in clinical practice, including amitriptyline and gabapentin. Thus, they continue to suffer the debilitating effects of NeP. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin in comparison to usual care, in patients with refractory NeP, from a third party payer's perspective (NHS). Methods: A stochastic simulation model was constructed, using clinical data from four non-randomized studies, to generate pain pathways of patients receiving usual care and pregabalin. Treatment effect (pain reduction) was converted to quality-of-life (QoL) data, using a regression analysis based on new utility data, collected from a survey of refractory NeP patients presenting to pain clinics in Cardiff, Wales. All relevant direct costs were estimated using resource use from the survey data (where available) and unit costs from the British National Formulary (BNF). The analysis was run over a 5-year time horizon, with costs and benefits discounted at 3.5%. Study limitations: The use of non-randomized (observational) data to characterize the effectiveness of treatments for NeP. Exclusion of productivity costs and consequences from the analysis. Results: In the base case analysis, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ?10,803 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was attained. This result was found to be reasonably insensitive to variations in the key input parameters, with ICERs ranging from ?8505 to ?22,845 per QALY gained. Conclusions: The analysis shows that pregabalin is a cost-effective alternative to usual care in patients with refractory NeP, with an ICER well below the threshold typically adopted by UK health technology assessment groups, such as NICE.",2012-01-08202,22017236,J Med Econ,Jason Gordon,2012,/,,Yes,22017236,"Jason Gordon; Steven Lister; Matthew Prettyjohns; Phil McEwan; Anthony Tetlow; Zahava Gabriel; A cost-utility study of the use of pregabalin in treatment-refractory neuropathic pain, J Med Econ, ; ():1369-6998",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Pregabalin (150-600mg/day) and usual treatment vs. Usual treatment (one or more weak opioids, strong opioids, NSAIDS, or analgesics)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,10803,United Kingdom,2010,19794.57
9144,Comparative and cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based regimens compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone among US elderly stage IV colon cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown a statistically significant disease-free survival benefit of oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination regimens for stage IV colon cancer. Less is known regarding the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these agents among elderly patients. Whether the benefits of these agents justify the additional costs for elderly Medicare recipients is particularly policy relevant after US health care reform. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination therapy versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone in elderly stage IV colon cancer patients was performed from a US Medicare perspective. Survival and direct medical costs were estimated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data sets for patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2005 with follow-up through 2007. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as costs per life-year gained, with sensitivity analysis estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Median improved overall survival with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, or irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based combination therapy was 0.99, 1.07, and 1.47 life-years, respectively. Costs per life-year gained for oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination regimens compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone were $78,181 and $267,938, respectively. ICERs comparing oxaliplatin-based to irinotecan-based regimens were $40,230 per life-year gained or $160,920 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination therapy improves overall survival but also substantially increases direct medical costs compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone when used in elderly US patients with stage IV colon cancer.

9150,Cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin 20?mg for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality: a Swedish economic evaluation of the JUPITER trial,"Abstract Objective: This study estimated the long-term health outcomes, healthcare costs, and cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin 20?mg therapy in primary prevention of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a Swedish population. Methods: Based on data from the JUPITER trial, long-term CVD outcomes with rosuvastatin vs no active treatment were estimated for patients with an elevated baseline CVD risk (Framingham CVD score >20%, sub-population of JUPITER population) and for a population similar to the total JUPITER population. Using a decision-analytic model, trial CVD event rates were combined with epidemiological and cost data specific for Sweden. First and subsequent CVD events and death were estimated over a lifetime perspective. The observed relative risk reduction was extrapolated beyond the trial duration. Incremental effectiveness was measured as life-years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Results: Treating 100,000 patients with rosuvastatin 20?mg was estimated to avoid 14,692 CVD events over the lifetime (8021 non-fatal MIs, 3228 non-fatal strokes, and 4924 CVD deaths) compared to placebo. This translated into an estimated gain of 42,122 QALYs and 36,865 total life years (LYG). Rosuvastatin was both more effective and less costly over a lifetime perspective, and rosuvastatin is subsequently a dominant alternative compared to no treatment in the assessed population. Using the overall JUPITER population, rosuvastatin was dominant for the lifetime horizon. In the sensitivity analysis, rosuvastatin was the dominant treatment strategy over a 20-year time horizon, and cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per QALY) of SEK 1783 over a 10-year time horizon. Limitations: Some model inputs were derived from literature or other data sources, but uncertainty was controlled by sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Results indicate that rosuvastatin 20?mg treatment is a cost-effective option vs no-treatment in patients with Framingham CVD risk >20% in Sweden and might even be cost saving if taking a long-term perspective.",2012-01-08238,22050473,J Med Econ,Robert L Ohsfeldt,2012,15 /,125-33,Yes,22050473,"Robert L Ohsfeldt; Anders G Olsson; Marie M Jensen; Sanjay K Gandhi; Thomas Paulsson; Cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin 20?mg for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality: a Swedish economic evaluation of the JUPITER trial, J Med Econ, ; 15 ():1369-6998; 125-33",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rosuvastatin (20mg) for primary prevention of major cardiovascular disease vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-526.77,Sweden,2008,-97.29
9151,Resuscitation of likely nonviable infants: a cost-utility analysis after the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of universal vs selective resuscitation on maternal utilities, perinatal costs, and outcomes of preterm delivery and termination of pregnancy at 20-23 weeks 6 days' gestation.We used studies on medical practices, prematurity outcomes, costs, and maternal utilities to construct decision-analytic models for a cohort of annual US deliveries after preterm delivery or induced termination. Outcome measures were (1) the numbers of infants who survived intact or with mild, moderate, or severe sequelae; (2) maternal quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and (3) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Universal resuscitation of spontaneously delivered infants between 20-23 weeks 6 days' gestation increases costs by $313.1 million and decreases QALYs by 329.3 QALYs; after a termination, universal resuscitation increases costs by $15.6 million and decreases QALYs by 19.2 QALYs. With universal resuscitation, 153 more infants survive: 44 infants are intact or mildly affected; 36 infants are moderately impaired, and 73 infants are severely disabled.Selective intervention constitutes the highest utility and least costly treatment for infants at the margin of viability.",2012-01-08243,22051817,Am J Obstet Gynecol,John Colin Partridge,2012,206 /,49.e1-49.e10,No,22051817,"John Colin Partridge; Mya D Sendowski; Alma M Martinez; Aaron B Caughey; Resuscitation of likely nonviable infants: a cost-utility analysis after the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act, Am J Obstet Gynecol, ; 206 ():0002-9378; 49.e1-49.e10",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal resuscitation of all live born premature infants vs. Current selective non-intervention practice,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-944420.81,United States,2010,-1120934.51
9152,Cost-effectiveness of a shared computerized decision support system for diabetes linked to electronic medical records,"BackgroundComputerized decision support systems (CDSSs) are believed to enhance patient care and reduce healthcare costs; however the current evidence is limited and the cost-effectiveness remains unknown.ObjectiveTo estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of a CDSS linked to evidence-based treatment recommendations for type 2 diabetes.MethodsUsing the Ontario Diabetes Economic Model, changes in factors (eg, HbA1c) from a randomized controlled trial were used to estimate cost-effectiveness. The cost of implementation, development, and maintenance of the core dataset, and projected diabetes-related complications were included. The base case assumed a 1-year treatment effect, 5% discount rate, and 40-year time horizon. Univariate, one-way sensitivity analyses were carried out by altering different parameter values. The perspective was the Ontario Ministry of Health and costs were in 2010 Canadian dollars.ResultsThe cost of implementing the intervention was $483?699. The one-year intervention reduced HbA1c by 0.2 and systolic blood pressure by 3.95 mm Hg, but increased body mass index by 0.02 kg/m(2), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 14% in the occurrence of amputation. The model estimated that the intervention resulted in an additional 0.0117 quality-adjusted life year; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $160?845 per quality-adjusted life-year.ConclusionThe web-based prototype decision support system slightly improved short-term risk factors. The model predicted moderate improvements in long-term health outcomes.

9153,Cost-effectiveness analysis of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy,"Background- Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become the dominant devices for mechanical circulatory support, but their cost-effectiveness is undetermined. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow devices for destination therapy versus optimal medical management in advanced heart failure and compared the results with previous estimates for pulsatile devices. Methods and Results- A Markov model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness. Survival, hospitalization rates, quality of life, and cost data were obtained for advanced heart failure patients treated medically or with a continuous-flow LVAD. Rates of clinical outcomes for all patients were obtained from clinical trial databases. Medicare prospective payments were used to estimate the cost of heart failure admissions. The cost of LVAD implantation was obtained prospectively from hospital claims within a clinical trial. Compared with medically managed patients, continuous-flow LVAD patients had higher 5-year costs ($360 407 versus $62 856), quality-adjusted life years (1.87 versus 0.37), and life years (2.42 versus 0.64). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the continuous-flow device was $198 184 per quality-adjusted life year and $167 208 per life year. This equates to a 75% reduction in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with the $802 700 per quality-adjusted life year for the pulsatile-flow device. The results were most sensitive to the cost of device implantation, long-term survival, cost per rehospitalization, and utility associated with patients' functional status. Conclusions- The cost-effectiveness associated with continuous-flow LVADs for destination therapy has improved significantly relative to the pulsatile flow devices.

9154,Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of laminectomy and extension of instrumented fusion for adjacent-segment disease: defining the value of surgical intervention,"Object Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of spinal fusions performed in the US and a corresponding increase in the incidence of adjacent-segment disease (ASD). Surgical management of symptomatic ASD consists of decompression of neural elements and extension of fusion. It has been shown to have favorable long-term outcomes, but the cost-effectiveness remains unclear. In this study, the authors set out to assess the cost-effectiveness of revision surgery in the treatment of ASD over a 2-year period. Methods Fifty patients undergoing neural decompression and extension of fusion construct for ASD-associated back and leg pain were included in the study. Two-year total back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and health state values (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], calculated from the EQ-5D with US valuation) were assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost), and patient and caregiver workday losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). Mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after revision surgery was assessed. Results The mean (? SD) interval between prior fusion and revision surgery for ASD was 3.07 ? 2.02 years. A mean cumulative 2-year gain of 0.76 QALYs was observed after revision surgery. The mean total 2-year cost of extension of fusion constructs was $47,846 ? $32,712 (surgery cost: $24,063 ? $300; outpatient resource utilization cost: $4175 ? $3368; indirect cost: $19,607 ? $32,187). Revision decompression and extension of fusion was associated with a mean 2-year cost per QALY gained of $62,955. Conclusions In the authors' practice, revision decompression and extension of fusion provided a significant gain in health state utility for patients with symptomatic ASD, with a 2-year cost per QALY gained of $62,995. When indicated, revision surgery for ASD is a valuable treatment option for patients experiencing back and leg pain secondary to ASD.

9155,Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of revision neural decompression and instrumented fusion for same-level recurrent lumbar stenosis: defining the value of surgical intervention,"Object Despite advances in technology and understanding in spinal physiology, reoperation for symptomatic same-level recurrent stenosis continues to occur. Although revision lumbar surgery is effective, attention has turned to the question of the utility and value of revision decompression and fusion procedures. To date, an analysis of cost and heath state gain associated with revision lumbar surgery for recurrent same-level lumbar stenosis has yet to be described. The authors set out to assess the 2-year comprehensive cost of revision surgery and determine its value in the treatment of same-level recurrent stenosis. Methods Forty-two patients undergoing revision decompression and instrumented fusion for same-level recurrent stenosis-associated leg and back pain were included in this study. Two-year total back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and health state values (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], calculated from the EQ-5D with US valuation) were assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost), and patient and caregiver workday losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). Mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after revision surgery was assessed. Results The mean (? SD) interval between prior and revision surgery was 4.16 ? 4.64 years. Bone morphogenetic protein was used in 7 cases of revision arthrodesis (16.7%). A mean cumulative 2-year gain of 0.84 QALY was observed after revision surgery. The mean total 2-year cost of revision fusion was $49,431 ? $7583 (surgery cost $21,060 ? $4459; outpatient resource utilization cost $9748 ? $5292; indirect cost $18,623 ? $9098). Revision decompression and extension of fusion was associated with a mean 2-year cost per QALY gained of $58,846. Conclusions In the authors' practice, revision decompression and fusion provided a significant gain in health state utility for patients with symptomatic same-level recurrent stenosis, with a 2-year cost per QALY gained of $58,846. When indicated, revision surgery for same-level recurrent stenosis is a valuable treatment option for patients experiencing back and leg pain secondary to this disease.

9156,The Cost-Effectiveness of Birth-Cohort Screening for Hepatitis C Antibody in U.S. Primary Care Settings,"Background: In the United States, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is most prevalent among adults born from 1945 through 1965, and approximately 50% to 75% of infected adults are unaware of their infections. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of birth-cohort screening. Design: Cost-effectiveness simulation. Data Sources: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, U.S. Census, Medicare reimbursement schedule, published sources. Target Population: Adults born from 1945 through 1965 with 1 or more visits to a primary care provider annually. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal, health care. Interventions: One-time antibody test of 1945-1965 birth cohort. Outcome Measures: Numbers of cases that were identified and treated and that achieved a sustained viral response; liver disease and death from HCV; medical and productivity costs; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results of Base-Case Analysis: Compared with the status quo, birth-cohort screening identified 808?580 additional cases of chronic HCV infection at a screening cost of $2874 per case identified. Assuming that birth-cohort screening was followed by pegylated interferon (pegIFN+R) and ribavirin for treated patients, screening increased QALYs by 348?800 and costs by $5.5 billion, for an ICER of $15?700 per QALY gained. Assuming that birth-cohort screening was followed by a direct-acting antiviral, pegIFN+R treatment for treated patients, screening increased QALYs by 532?200 and costs by $19.0 billion, for an ICER of $35?700 per QALY saved. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: The ICER of birth-cohort screening was most sensitive to sustained viral response rate of antiviral therapy, the cost of therapy, the discount rate and the QALY losses assigned to disease states.

9159,Histologic Examinations of Arthroplasty Specimens are not Cost-effective: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"BACKGROUND: Many hospitals require all operative specimens be sent to pathologists for routine examination. Although previous studies indicate this practice increases medical cost, it remains unclear whether it alters patient management and whether it is cost-effective. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore (1) determined the rate of discordance between clinical and histologic examinations of routine operative specimens during elective primary arthroplasties, (2) determined the cost of routine histologic screening, and (3) estimated its cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, as compared with gross examination or no examination. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 1247 patients who underwent 1363 routine elective primary total joint arthroplasties between January 18, 2006 and March 15, 2010. We compared preoperative, postoperative, and histologic diagnoses for each patient and categorized them into three classes: concordant (clinical and histologic diagnoses agreed), discrepant (diagnoses differed but with no resultant change in treatment), and discordant (diagnoses differed with resultant change in treatment). Medicare reimbursements were determined through the pathology department's administrative office. RESULTS: In 1363 cases, 1335 (97.9%) clinical and histologic diagnoses were concordant, 28 (2.1%) were discrepant, and none were discordant. Total reimbursement for routine pathological examination was $139,532, or $102.37 per specimen. The average cost to identify each discrepant case was $4983.29. Routine histologic examination did not alter patient management, and there was no direct gain in quality-adjusted life years.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the costs and clinical outcome of systemic chemotherapy followed by cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy compared to systemic chemotherapy only in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer.Ten patients were scheduled for systemic chemotherapy followed by loco-regional treatment. A reference group of 10 matched control patients treated with systemic chemotherapy only were used and both groups were evaluated with respect to clinical outcome and cost.The mean overall cost in the loco-regional group was $145,700 (range $49,900-$487,800) and $59,300 (range $23,000-$94,800) for the control group. The mean overall survival for the loco-regional group was 17.4 months (range 6.0-34.3), and 11.1 months (range 0.1-24.2) for the systemic chemotherapy only group. The gain in life-years was 0.52 and in quality-adjusted life-years 0.49, leading to incremental cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-years gained of $166,716 and $175,164, for loco-regional group compared to systemic chemotherapy.Treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer is costly irrespective of treatment modality.

9164,Oral nutritional support in malnourished elderly decreases functional limitations with no extra costs,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Older people are vulnerable to malnutrition which leads to increased health care costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nutritional supplementation from a societal perspective. DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial included hospital admitted malnourished elderly (=60?y) patients. Patients in the intervention group received nutritional supplementation (energy and protein enriched diet, oral nutritional support, calcium-vitamin D supplement, telephone counselling by a dietician) until three months after discharge from hospital. Patients in the control group received usual care (control). Primary outcomes were Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), physical activities and functional limitations. Measurements were performed at hospital admission and three months after discharge. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle and multiple imputation was used to impute missing data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated and bootstrapping was applied to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness was expressed by cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: 210 patients were included, 105 in each group. After three months, no statistically significant differences in quality of life and physical activities were observed between groups. Functional limitations decreased significantly more in the intervention group (mean difference -0.72, 95% CI-1.15; -0.28). There were no differences in costs between groups. Cost-effectiveness for QALYs and physical activities could not be demonstrated. For functional limitations we found a 0.95 probability that the intervention is cost-effective in comparison with usual care for ceiling ratios >?6500. CONCLUSIONS: A multi-component nutritional intervention to malnourished elderly patients for three months after hospital discharge leads to significant improvement in functional limitations and is neutral in costs.

9172,Adding Specialized Clinics for Remote-Dwellers with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"Background and objectives This study aimed to determine whether opening a new clinic in a remote region would be a cost-effective means of improving care for remote-dwellers with CKD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This study is a cost-utility analysis from a public payer's perspective over a lifetime horizon, using administrative data from a large cohort of adults with stage 3b-4 CKD in Alberta, Canada. The association between the distance from each simulated patient's residence and the practice location of the closest nephrologist and clinical outcomes (quality of care, hospitalization, dialysis, and death) were examined. A Markov 6-month cycle economic decision model was analyzed; estimates of the effect of a new clinic were based on the association between residence location, resource use, and outcomes. Costs are reported in 2009 Canadian dollars. Results The costs for equipping and operating a clinic for 321 remote-dwelling patients were estimated at $25,000 and $250,000/yr, respectively. The incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) ranged from $4000 to $8000/quality-adjusted life-year under most scenarios. However, if reducing distance to nephrologist care does not alter mortality or hospitalization among remote-dwellers, the cost-effectiveness becomes less attractive. All other one-way sensitivity analyses had negligible effects on the ICUR. Conclusions Given the low costs of equipping and operating new clinics, and the very attractive ICUR relative to other currently funded interventions, establishing new clinics for remote-dwellers could play an important role in efficiently improving outcomes for patients with CKD.

9173,Intra-operative vs pre-operative endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with gallbladder and common bile duct stones: cost-utility and value-of-information analysis,"Patients with gallbladder and common bile duct stones are generally treated by pre-operative endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (POES). Recently, a meta-analysis has shown that intra-operative ES during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (IOES) results in fewer complications than POES, with similar efficacy. The cost effectiveness of IOES versus POES is unknown.The objective of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of IOES versus POES from the UK NHS perspective.A decision-tree model estimating and comparing costs to the UK NHS and QALYs gained following a policy of either IOES or POES was developed with a time horizon of 3 years. Uncertainty was investigated with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and partial information (EVPPI) were also calculated.IOES was less costly than POES (approximately -?623 per patient [year 2008 values]) and resulted in similar quality of life (+0.008 QALYs per patient) as POES. Given a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?20?000 per QALY gained, there was a 92.9% probability that IOES is cost effective compared with POES. Full implementation of IOES could save the NHS ?2.8 million per annum.

The Beckman Coulter prostate health index (phi) was developed as a combination of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), free PSA and a PSA precursor form [-2]proPSA to calculate the probability of prostate cancer and was used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic conditions for men with PSA test 2-10 ng/mL and non-suspicious digital rectal examination. Phi has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy in prostate cancer detection compared with total and free PSA. An earlier 1-year budget impact analysis revealed it to be a complementary approach to current prostate cancer screening strategies. The current study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of early prostate cancer detection with phi in combination with a PSA test compared with a PSA test alone from the US societal perspective. The model with over 25 annual screening cycles for men aged 50-75 years indicated that PSA plus phi dominated the PSA test alone in prostate cancer detection and consequent treatment. PSA plus phi may be an important strategy for prostate cancer detection. OBJECTIVE: ? To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of early prostate cancer detection with the Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index (phi) (not currently available in the USA) adding to the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test compared with the PSA test alone from the US societal perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ? Phi was developed as a combination of PSA, free PSA, and a PSA precursor form [-2]proPSA to calculate the probability of prostate cancer and was used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic conditions for men with a borderline PSA test (e.g. PSA 2-10 ng/mL or 4-10 ng/mL) and non-suspicious digital rectal examination. ? We constructed a Markov model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate expected costs and utilities of prostate cancer detection and consequent treatment for the annual prostate cancer screening in the male population aged 50-75 years old. ? The transition probabilities, health state utilities and prostate cancer treatment costs were derived from the published literature. The diagnostic performance of phi was obtained from a multi-centre study. Diagnostic related costs were obtained from the 2009 Medicare Fee Schedule. ? Cost-effectiveness was compared between the strategies of PSA test alone and PSA plus phi under two PSA thresholds (=2 ng/mL and =4 ng/mL) to recommend a prostate biopsy. RESULTS: ? Over 25 annual screening cycles, the strategy of PSA plus phi dominated the PSA-only strategy using both thresholds of PSA =2 ng/mL and PSA =4 ng/mL, and was estimated to save $1199 or $443, with an expected gain of 0.08 or 0.03 quality adjusted life years, respectively. ?

Research design and methods: The analysis was conducted using a 3-month decision model, which compares duloxetine 60?mg once daily (DUL), pregabalin 150?mg twice daily (PGB), and gabapentin 600?mg three-times daily (GBP) for PDPN patients with moderate-to-severe pain. A systematic review was performed and placebo-adjusted risk ratios for achieving good pain relief (GPR), adverse events (AE), and withdrawal owing to intolerable AE were calculated. Direct medical costs included drug acquisition and additional visits due to lack of efficacy (poor pain relief) or intolerable AE. Unit costs were taken from local sources. Adherence rates were used to estimate the expected drug costs. All costs are expressed in 2010 Mexican Pesos (MXN). Utility values drawn from published literature were applied to health states. The proportion of patients with GPR and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were assessed. Results: Branded-GBP was dominated by all the other options. PGB was more costly and less effective than DUL. Compared with branded-GBP and PGB, DUL led to savings of 1.01 and 1.74 million MXN (per 1000 patients). The incremental cost per QALY gained with DUL used instead of generic-GBP was $102 433 MXN.

9183,Economic evaluation of duloxetine as a first-line treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Mexico,"Abstract Objective: To perform an economic evaluation of duloxetine, pregabalin, and both branded and generic gabapentin for managing pain in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) in Mexico. Research design and methods: The analysis was conducted using a 3-month decision model, which compares duloxetine 60?mg once daily (DUL), pregabalin 150?mg twice daily (PGB), and gabapentin 600?mg three-times daily (GBP) for PDPN patients with moderate-to-severe pain. A systematic review was performed and placebo-adjusted risk ratios for achieving good pain relief (GPR), adverse events (AE), and withdrawal owing to intolerable AE were calculated.

9186,Cost-effectiveness analysis of valsartan versus losartan and the effect of switching,"Abstract Objectives: Losartan will shortly become generic, and this may encourage switching to the generic drug. However, valsartan was shown in a meta-analysis to be statistically superior in lowering blood pressure (BP) to losartan. This paper examines the costs of treatment with these two drugs and the potential consequences of switching established valsartan patients to generic losartan. Methods: A US payer cost-effectiveness model was developed incorporating the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) control comparing valsartan to continual losartan and switching from valsartan to generic losartan. The model, based upon a meta-analysis by Nixon et al. and Framingham equations, included first CVD event costs calculated from US administrative data sets and utility values from published sources. The modeled outcomes were number of CVD events, costs and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY). Results: Fewer patients had fatal and non-fatal CVD events with valsartan therapy compared with continual losartan and with patients switched from valsartan to generic losartan. The base-case model results indicated that continued treatment with valsartan had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,268 and $25,460 per life year gained, and $32,313 and $30,170 per QALY gained, relative to continual losartan and switching treatments, respectively. Sensitivity analyses found that patient discontinuation post-switching was a sensitive parameter. Including efficacy offsets with lowered adherence or discontinuation resulted in more favorable ratios for valsartan compared to switching therapy. Limitations: The model does not evaluate post-primary CVD events and considers change in SBP from baseline level as the sole predictor of CVD risk. Conclusions: Valsartan appears to be cost-effective compared to switching to generic losartan and switching to the generic drug does not support a cost offset argument over the longer term.

9188,"A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing 3 anterior cruciate ligament graft types: bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, hamstring autograft, and allograft","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, despite being one of the most common surgical interventions, is also one of the least agreed upon surgeries when it comes to optimum graft choice. Three graft choices stand among the most widely used in this procedure: (1) bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BPTB), (2) quadruple hamstring tendon autograft (HS), and (3) allograft. Hypothesis: Bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction is the most cost-effective method of ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A simplified decision tree model was created with theoretical patients assigned equally to 1 of 3 ACL reconstruction cohorts based on graft type. These treatment arms were further divided into outcome arms based on probabilities from the literature. The terminal outcomes were assigned a health state/utility score and a societal cost. Utilities were calculated from real clinic patients via the time trade-off questionnaire. Costs were literature based. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $50 000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used as the threshold for cost-effectiveness. Results: Hamstring tendon autograft was the least costly ($5375/surgery) and most effective (0.912) graft choice, dominating both BPTB and allograft reconstructions. Allograft was both the most costly and least effective strategy for the average patient undergoing ACL reconstruction. However, if baseline costs of BPTB could be reduced (by $500) or the effectiveness increased (anterior knee pain <15% or postoperative instability <7%), then BPTB became an incrementally cost-effective choice. In addition, if the effectiveness of HS could be reduced (instability >29% or revision rates >7%), then BPTB also became incrementally cost-effective. Conclusions: This model suggests that hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction is the most cost-effective method of surgery for the average patient with ACL deficiency.

Anticholinergic drugs are a common treatment alternative in urinary incontinence, which results in large costs for caregivers. So far, most cost-effectiveness analyses of anticholinergic drugs have focused on small putative differences between the newer anticholinergics. This study takes a novel approach by treating the clinical effects of the newer alternatives as similar and evaluating them as a group in relation to no treatment and oxybutynin (immediate release). It also uses registry data to account for persistence. OBJECTIVE: ? To analyse the cost-effectiveness of newer anticholinergic drugs in relation to oxybutynin immediate release (IR) and no treatment for patients with urgency urinary incontinence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ? A decision analytic model was constructed. ? Results were collected from randomized trials and combined with registry data on persistence of medicine use and estimated number of severe adverse events. ? The setting corresponds to Swedish clinical practice. ? The costs and effects of the treatment options were analysed over a period of 1 year. Costs included drug costs, treatment costs and costs for pad use. Patients' utilities were based on treatment effect and the lack or presence of adverse events. RESULTS: ? No treatment was the least costly treatment but also resulted in the fewest number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). ? Treatment with newer anticholinergic drug medications is the most costly option but also the most efficient treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust. ? Treatment with newer anticholinergics resulted in a cost per QALY gained of ?21 045 compared with no treatment and no effect and ?65 435 compared with no treatment and placebo effect. Compared with oxybutynin IR, the cost per QALY gained was ?37 119. These calculations are based on relatively low pad costs, resulting in higher costs per QALY for the original drugs. CONCLUSIONS: ? The newer anticholinergic medications are likely to be cost effective in relation to oxybutynin IR. ? The cost-effectiveness of the newer anticholinergics compared with no treatment depends on assumptions of the effect of no treatment, the severity of the treated condition and the treated individual's risk of adverse events. ?

Costs included drug costs, treatment costs and costs for pad use. Patients' utilities were based on treatment effect and the lack or presence of adverse events. RESULTS: ? No treatment was the least costly treatment but also resulted in the fewest number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). ? Treatment with newer anticholinergic drug medications is the most costly option but also the most efficient treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust. ? Treatment with newer anticholinergics resulted in a cost per QALY gained of ?21 045 compared with no treatment and no effect and ?65 435 compared with no treatment and placebo effect. Compared with oxybutynin IR, the cost per QALY gained was ?37 119. These calculations are based on relatively low pad costs, resulting in higher costs per QALY for the original drugs. CONCLUSIONS: ? The newer anticholinergic medications are likely to be cost effective in relation to oxybutynin IR. ? The cost-effectiveness of the newer anticholinergics compared with no treatment depends on assumptions of the effect of no treatment, the severity of the treated condition and the treated individual's risk of adverse events. ?

We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of Internet-based asthma self-management compared with usual care.Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial, with 12 months follow-up. Patients were aged 18 to 50 year and had physician diagnosed asthma. The Internet-based self-management program involved weekly on-line monitoring of asthma control with self-treatment advice, remote Web communications, and Internet-based information. We determined quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as measured by the EuroQol-5D and costs for health care use and absenteeism. We performed a detailed cost price analysis for the primary intervention. QALYs did not statistically significantly differ between the Internet group and usual care: difference 0.024 (95% CI, -0.016 to 0.065). Costs of the Internet-based intervention were $254 (95% CI, $243 to $265) during the period of 1 year. From a societal perspective, the cost difference was $641 (95% CI, $-1957 to $3240).

9200,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation versus extended release tolterodine for overactive bladder,"We assessed the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation vs extended release tolterodine for the treatment of overactive bladder.A 1-year time frame cost-effectiveness model from a societal perspective was developed by comparing medical costs and quality of life determined by improved continence and therapy side effects of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation and tolterodine ER. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation therapy consisted of 12 sessions for 3 months followed by maintenance therapy. Significant side effects of both strategies can result in reduced quality of life or therapy termination. Parameter estimates included utilities of improved urinary incontinence (0.92) and continued urinary incontinence (0.73), reduction in quality of life from side effects (5%), cost of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation per session ($203) and cost of tolterodine ER per month ($150). Our primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the marginal cost per quality adjusted life-years gained. Less than $50,000 per quality adjusted life-year gained was considered cost-effective. The uncertainty of input parameters was addressed by 1-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the robustness of the model.Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation added significant cost to the management of overactive bladder with modest improvement in quality of life. For every 100 patients treated with percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation the costs increased by $303,480 and resulted in an additional 4.3 quality adjusted life-years gained compared to tolterodine ER. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $70,754 per quality adjusted life-year gained. In the Monte Carlo analysis percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation was cost-effective only 21% of the time.Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation was not cost-effective for treating overactive bladder vs tolterodine ER under a wide range of clinical circumstances.",2012-01-08318,22100006,J Urol,Heidi W Chen,2012,187 /,178-84,No,22100006,"Heidi W Chen; Richard S Bercik; Erika F Werner; Stephen F Thung; Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation versus extended release tolterodine for overactive bladder, J Urol, ; 187 ():0022-5347; 178-84",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) vs. Extended release tolterodine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,70754,United States,2010,83978.03
