13808,Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data,"BACKGROUND: The results of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial showed a statistically significant 29% prostate cancer mortality reduction for the men screened in the intervention arm and a 23% negative impact on the life-years gained because of quality of life. However, alternative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies for the population may exist, optimizing the effects on mortality reduction, quality of life, overdiagnosis, and costs. METHODS: Based on data of the ERSPC trial, we predicted the numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed, prostate cancer deaths averted, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, and cost-effectiveness of 68 screening strategies starting at age 55 years, with a PSA threshold of 3, using microsimulation modeling. The screening strategies varied by age to stop screening and screening interval (one to 14 years or once in a lifetime screens), and therefore number of tests. RESULTS: Screening at short intervals of three years or less was more cost-effective than using longer intervals. Screening at ages 55 to 59 years with two-year intervals had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $73000 per QALY gained and was considered optimal. With this strategy, lifetime prostate cancer mortality reduction was predicted as 13%, and 33% of the screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed. When better quality of life for the post-treatment period could be achieved, an older age of 65 to 72 years for ending screening was obtained. CONCLUSION: Prostate cancer screening can be cost-effective when it is limited to two or three screens between ages 55 to 59 years. Screening above age 63 years is less cost-effective because of loss of QALYs because of overdiagnosis.",2015-01-15340,25505238,J Natl Cancer Inst,E A M Heijnsdijk,2015,107 / 1,366,No,25505238,"E A M Heijnsdijk; T M de Carvalho; A Auvinen; M Zappa; V Nelen; M Kwiatkowski; A Villers; A Paez; S M Moss; T L J Tammela; F Recker; L Denis; S V Carlsson; E M Wever; C H Bangma; F H Schroder; M J Roobol; J Hugosson; H J De Koning; Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data, J Natl Cancer Inst, ; 107(1):0027-8874; 366",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screen 55 year olds for prostate cancer vs. None,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,31467,United States,2008,37825.79

13813,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the diagnosis of meniscus tears,"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic imaging represents the fastest growing segment of costs in the US health system. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of alternative diagnostic approaches to meniscus tears of the knee, a highly prevalent disease that traditionally relies on MRI as part of the diagnostic strategy. PURPOSE: To identify the most efficient strategy for the diagnosis of meniscus tears. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A simple-decision model run as a cost-utility analysis was constructed to assess the value added by MRI in various combinations with patient history and physical examination (H&P). The model examined traumatic and degenerative tears in 2 distinct settings: primary care and orthopaedic sports medicine clinic. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In both practice settings, H&P alone was widely preferred for degenerative meniscus tears. Performing MRI to confirm a positive H&P was preferred for traumatic tears in both practice settings, with a willingness to pay of less than US$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Performing an MRI for all patients was not preferred in any reasonable clinical scenario. The prevalence of a meniscus tear in a clinician's patient population was influential. For traumatic tears, MRI to confirm a positive H&P was preferred when prevalence was less than 46.7%, with H&P preferred above that. For degenerative tears, H&P was preferred until the prevalence reaches 74.2%, and then MRI to confirm a negative was the preferred strategy. In both settings, MRI to confirm positive physical examination led to more than a 10-fold lower rate of unnecessary surgeries than did any other strategy, while MRI to confirm negative physical examination led to a 2.08 and 2.26 higher rate than H&P alone in primary care and orthopaedic clinics, respectively. CONCLUSION: For all practitioners, H&P is the preferred strategy for the suspected degenerative meniscus tear. An MRI to confirm a positive H&P is preferred for traumatic tears for all practitioners. Consideration should be given to implementing alternative diagnostic strategies as well as enhancing provider education in physical examination skills to improve the reliability of H&P as a diagnostic test.

13816,Cost-effectiveness analysis in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and costs associated with first-line medical treatments for chronic heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in Spain. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) with the estradiol valerate/dienogest multiphase oral contraceptive (E2V/DNG), combined oral contraceptives (COC) and progestins (PROG). Study patients were fertile women diagnosed with HMB who initially wished to remain fertile. A Markov model based on reported clinical data and the opinion of a panel of experts was used. The time horizon of the analysis was 5 years. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS), discounting both costs (euro 2013) and future effects at an annual rate of 3%. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In the analysis at 5 years, the LNG-IUS was associated with a gain of 0.67, 2.22, and 3.53 symptoms free months (SFM) compared with E2V/DNG, COC and PROG, respectively.

13819,Cost-effectiveness of population screening for BRCA mutations in Ashkenazi jewish women compared with family history-based testing,"BACKGROUND: Population-based testing for BRCA1/2 mutations detects the high proportion of carriers not identified by cancer family history (FH)-based testing. We compared the cost-effectiveness of population-based BRCA testing with the standard FH-based approach in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) women. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare lifetime costs and effects amongst AJ women in the UK of BRCA founder-mutation testing amongst: 1) all women in the population age 30 years or older and 2) just those with a strong FH (>/=10% mutation risk). The model assumes that BRCA carriers are offered risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy and annual MRI/mammography screening or risk-reducing mastectomy. Model probabilities utilize the Genetic Cancer Prediction through Population Screening trial/published literature to estimate total costs, effects in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cancer incidence, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and population impact. Costs are reported at 2010 prices. Costs/outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. We used deterministic/probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared with FH-based testing, population-screening saved 0.090 more life-years and 0.101 more QALYs resulting in 33 days' gain in life expectancy. Population screening was found to be cost saving with a baseline-discounted ICER of - pound2079/QALY. Population-based screening lowered ovarian and breast cancer incidence by 0.34% and 0.62%. Assuming 71% testing uptake, this leads to 276 fewer ovarian and 508 fewer breast cancer cases. Overall, reduction in treatment costs led to a discounted cost savings of pound3.7 million. Deterministic sensitivity analysis and 94% of simulations on PSA (threshold pound20000) indicated that population screening is cost-effective, compared with current NHS policy. CONCLUSION: Population-based screening for BRCA mutations is highly cost-effective compared with an FH-based approach in AJ women age 30 years and older.",2015-01-15494,25435542,J Natl Cancer Inst,Ranjit Manchanda,2015,107 / 1,380,No,25435542,"Ranjit Manchanda; Rosa Legood; Matthew Burnell; Alistair McGuire; Maria Raikou; Kelly Loggenberg; Jane Wardle; Saskia Sanderson; Sue Gessler; Lucy Side; Nyala Balogun; Rakshit Desai; Ajith Kumar; Huw Dorkins; Yvonne Wallis; Cyril Chapman; Rohan Taylor; Chris Jacobs; Ian Tomlinson; Uziel Beller; Usha Menon; Ian Jacobs; Cost-effectiveness of population screening for BRCA mutations in Ashkenazi jewish women compared with family history-based testing, J Natl Cancer Inst, ; 107(1):0027-8874; 380",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Population-based BRCA testing vs. Standard/Usual Care- Family history-based BRCA testing,Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) women,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-2078.55,United Kingdom,2010,-3808.57
13820,Cost-effectiveness analysis of 3D image-guided brachytherapy compared with 2D brachytherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer,"PURPOSE: Three-dimensional image-guided brachytherapy (IGBT) is a significant advance in locally advanced cervical cancer treatment. However, its cost-effectiveness (C/E) is unknown. We performed a C/E analysis of IGBT compared with conventional (two-dimensional [2D]) brachytherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to model locally advanced cervical cancer treated with five fractions of high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The model captured clinical parameters, quality of life utility, and treatment costs through the literature review. Costs were 2013 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). To account for uncertainty, one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Strategies were evaluated from a payer's perspective with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. RESULTS: Treatment costs for five fractions of IGBT and 2D brachytherapy were $21,374 and $17,931, respectively. In the base-case analysis, the IGBT strategy costs $3003 more than 2D brachytherapy while gaining 0.16 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $18,634 per QALY gained. In one-way sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to variation of treatment costs, but the ICER remained <$50,000/QALY gained for all cost ranges. Variation of survival, local control, and complication rates was less influential. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that IGBT was favored in 63% of model iterations at a $50,000/QALY gained threshold. CONCLUSION: IGBT for locally advanced cervical cancer is a C/E option compared with 2D brachytherapy. These findings were robust to variation of parameter values supporting the routine use of IGBT in locally advanced cervical cancer.",2015-01-15512,25443528,Brachytherapy,Hayeon Kim,2015,14 / 1,29-36,No,25443528,"Hayeon Kim; Malolan S Rajagopalan; Sushil Beriwal; M Saiful Huq; Kenneth J Smith; Cost-effectiveness analysis of 3D image-guided brachytherapy compared with 2D brachytherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, Brachytherapy, ; 14(1):1538-4721; 29-36",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Three-dimensional image-guided brachytherapy, MRI vs. Standard/Usual Care- 2D conventional brachytherapy",Treated with five fractions of high-dose-rate brachytherapy,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,27774,United States,2013,30856.41
13821,"Bevacizumab in recurrent, persistent, or advanced stage carcinoma of the cervix: is it cost-effective?","OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of incorporating bevacizumab into the treatment regimen for recurrent, persistent, or advanced stage carcinoma of the cervix following publication of a recent phase III trial that demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit with the addition of bevacizumab. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness decision model was constructed using recently published results from a Gynecologic Oncology Group phase III study, comparing a standard chemotherapy regimen (Chemo) to the experimental regimen (Chemo + Bev) consisting of the standard regimen+bevacizumab. Costs and adverse events were incorporated and sensitivity analyses assessed model uncertainties. RESULTS: The cost of Chemo + Bev was $53,784 compared to $5,688 for the Chemo arm. The 3.7 month OS advantage with Chemo+Bev came at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $155K per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Chemo + Bev becomes cost-effective with an ICER </= $100K in sensitivity analysis when the cost of bevacizumab is discounted >37.5% or the dose is reduced from 15 to 7.5 mg/kg, an effective dose in ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: With an ICER of $155K/QALY, the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy approaches common cost-effectiveness standards.

13823,Economics of dialysis dependence following renal replacement therapy for critically ill acute kidney injury patients,"BACKGROUND: The obective of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing intermittent with continuous renal replacement therapy (IRRT versus CRRT) as initial therapy for acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Assuming some patients would potentially be eligible for either modality, we modeled life year gained, the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs for a cohort of 1000 IRRT patients and a cohort of 1000 CRRT patients. We used a 1-year, 5-year and a lifetime horizon. A Markov model with two health states for AKI survivors was designed: dialysis dependence and dialysis independence. We applied Weibull regression from published estimates to fit survival curves for CRRT and IRRT patients and to fit the proportion of dialysis dependence among CRRT and IRRT survivors. We then applied a risk ratio reported in a large retrospective cohort study to the fitted CRRT estimates in order to determine the proportion of dialysis dependence for IRRT survivors. We conducted sensitivity analyses based on a range of differences for daily implementation cost between CRRT and IRRT (base case: CRRT day $632 more expensive than IRRT day; range from $200 to $1000) and a range of risk ratios for dialysis dependence for CRRT as compared with IRRT (from 0.65 to 0.95; base case: 0.80). RESULTS: Continuous renal replacement therapy was associated with a marginally greater gain in QALY as compared with IRRT (1.093 versus 1.078). Despite higher upfront costs for CRRT in the ICU ($4046 for CRRT versus $1423 for IRRT in average), the 5-year total cost including the cost of dialysis dependence was lower for CRRT ($37 780 for CRRT versus $39 448 for IRRT on average). The base case incremental cost-effectiveness analysis showed that CRRT dominated IRRT. This dominance was confirmed by extensive sensitivity analysis.

13824,The cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency catheter ablation as first-line treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: results from a MANTRA-PAF substudy,"AIM: The aim of this prospective substudy was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) with radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) compared with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as first-line treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision-analytic Markov model, based on MANTRA-PAF (Medical Antiarrhythmic Treatment or Radiofrequency Ablation in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation) study data, was developed to study long-term effects and costs of RFA compared with AADs as first-line treatment. Positive clinical effects were found in the overall population, a gain of an average 0.06 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to an incremental cost of euro3033, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro50 570/QALY.

13827,Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine in a basal-bolus regimen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec (IDeg) vs insulin glargine (IGlar) as part of a basal-bolus treatment regimen in adults with T1DM, using a short-term economic model. METHODS: Data from two phase III clinical studies were used to populate a simple and transparent short-term model. The costs and effects of treatment with IDeg vs IGlar were calculated over a 12-month period. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. The main outcome measure, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), was the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option vs IGlar in patients with T1DM on a basal-bolus regimen. The base case ICER was estimated at pound16,895/QALY, which is below commonly accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness in the UK. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was stable to variations in the majority of input parameters. The parameters that exerted the most influence on the ICER were hypoglycemia event rates, daily insulin dose, and disutility associated with non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemic events. However, even under extreme assumptions in the majority of analyses the ICERs remained below the commonly accepted threshold of pound20,000- pound30,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: This short-term modeling approach accommodates the treat-to-target trial design required by regulatory bodies, and focuses on the impact of important aspects of insulin therapy such as hypoglycemia and dosing. For patients with T1DM who are treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen, IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option compared with IGlar.

The co-occurrence of headache may impact choice of antidepressants, healthcare utilisation, and outcomes in patients with depression. The current study aims to examine the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different antidepressants for treating patients with depression and comorbid headache disorders. METHODS: Adult patients prescribed with antidepressants for depression (n=96,501) were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis was conducted comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and by the presence of comorbid headache disorders and other pain conditions. RESULTS: In this study, SSRIs dominated SNRIs in both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. As revealed in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, TCAs were likely to have a cost-utility advantage compared to SSRIs and SNRIs in improving quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients with comorbid headache; SSRIs remained as the most cost-effective option for patients with other pain conditions. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the use of proxy definition of remission as effectiveness measure and the adoption of utility values from previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Given a pre-determined willingness-to-pay level, TCAs can be considered as a cost-effective option to improve QALYs for depressed patients with headache disorders.

13831,"Long-term cost-effectiveness of medical, endoscopic and surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease","BACKGROUND: The long-term cost effectiveness of medical, endoscopic, and operative treatments for adults with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains unclear. We sought to estimate the cost effectiveness of medical, endoscopic, and operative treatments for adults with GERD who require daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. METHODS: A Markov model was generated from the payer's perspective using a 6-month cycle and 30-year time horizon. The base-case patient was a 45-year-old man with symptomatic GERD taking 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily. Four treatment strategies were analyzed: PPI therapy, transoral incisionless fundoplication (EsophyX), radiofrequency energy application to the lower esophageal sphincter (Stretta) and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The model parameters were selected using the published literature and institutional billing data. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained) for each therapy. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, which assumed a PPI cost of $234 over 6 months ($39 per month), Stretta and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication were the most cost-effective options over a 30-year time period ($2,470.66 and $5,579.28 per QALY gained, respectively). If the cost of PPI therapy exceeded $90.63 per month over 30 years, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication became the dominant treatment option. EsophyX was dominated by laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication at all points in time.

13832,"Long-term cost-effectiveness of medical, endoscopic and surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease","BACKGROUND: The long-term cost effectiveness of medical, endoscopic, and operative treatments for adults with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains unclear. We sought to estimate the cost effectiveness of medical, endoscopic, and operative treatments for adults with GERD who require daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. METHODS: A Markov model was generated from the payer's perspective using a 6-month cycle and 30-year time horizon. The base-case patient was a 45-year-old man with symptomatic GERD taking 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily. Four treatment strategies were analyzed: PPI therapy, transoral incisionless fundoplication (EsophyX), radiofrequency energy application to the lower esophageal sphincter (Stretta) and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The model parameters were selected using the published literature and institutional billing data. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained) for each therapy. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, which assumed a PPI cost of $234 over 6 months ($39 per month), Stretta and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication were the most cost-effective options over a 30-year time period ($2,470.66 and $5,579.28 per QALY gained, respectively). If the cost of PPI therapy exceeded $90.63 per month over 30 years, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication became the dominant treatment option.

METHODS: A previously developed cost effectiveness model was used to estimate long-term costs and outcomes for patients scheduled for non-invasive management. Healthcare costs, event rates and health-related quality of life under treatment with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel over 12 months were estimated from the PLATO study. Long-term costs and health outcomes were estimated based on data from PLATO and published literature sources. To investigate the importance of different healthcare cost structures and life expectancy for the results, the analysis was carried out from the perspectives of the Swedish, UK, German and Brazilian public healthcare systems. RESULTS: Ticagrelor was associated with lifetime quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains of 0.17 in Sweden, 0.16 in the UK, 0.17 in Germany and 0.13 in Brazil compared with generic clopidogrel, with increased healthcare costs of euro467, euro551, euro739 and euro574, respectively.

13838,Economic evaluation of endoscopic sinus surgery versus continued medical therapy for refractory chronic rhinosinusitis,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) compared to continued medical therapy for patients with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort-style Markov decision-tree economic evaluation. METHODS: The economic perspective was the U.S. third-party payer with a 30-year time horizon. The two comparative treatment strategies were: 1) ESS, followed by appropriate postoperative medical therapy; and 2) continued medical therapy alone. Primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs were discounted at a rate of 3.5% in the reference case. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed, including differing time-horizons, discounting scenarios, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: The reference case demonstrated that the ESS strategy cost a total of $48,838.38 and produced a total of 20.50 QALYs. The medical therapy alone strategy cost a total of $28,948.98 and produced a total of 17.13 QALYs. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for ESS versus medical therapy alone is $5,901.90 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve from the PSA demonstrated that there is a 74% certainty that the ESS strategy is the most cost-effective decision for any willingness to pay a threshold greater than $25,000. The time-horizon analysis suggests that ESS becomes the cost-effective intervention within the third year after surgery. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that employing an ESS treatment strategy is the most cost-effective intervention compared to continued medical therapy alone for the long-term management of patients with refractory CRS.",2015-01-15947,25186499,Laryngoscope,Luke Rudmik,2015,125 / 1,25-32,No,25186499,"Luke Rudmik; Zachary M Soler; Jess C Mace; Rodney J Schlosser; Timothy L Smith; Economic evaluation of endoscopic sinus surgery versus continued medical therapy for refractory chronic rhinosinusitis, Laryngoscope, ; 125(1):0023-852X; 25-32",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Endoscopic sinus surgery, followed by postoperative medical therapy vs. Medical therapy alone",Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Not Stated,Full,30 Years,3.50,Not Stated,5902,United States,2013,6557.01

This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) is cost-effective in patients undergoing curative resection with or without neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). METHODS: Decision tree modelling compared routine DL with exploratory laparotomy (ExLap) at the time of curative resection in resectable cancer treated with surgery first, (SF) and borderline resectable cancer treated with NAT. Costs (US$) from the payer's perspective, quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Base case estimates and multi-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Willingness to pay (WtP) was US$4166/QALM (or US$50,000/quality-adjusted life year). RESULTS: Base case costs were US$34,921 for ExLap and US$33,442 for DL in SF patients, and US$39,633 for ExLap and US$39,713 for DL in NAT patients. Routine DL is the dominant (preferred) strategy in both treatment types: it allows for cost reductions of US$10,695/QALM in SF and US$4158/QALM in NAT patients.

13841,Cost-effectiveness of total pancreatectomy and islet cell autotransplantation for the treatment of minimal change chronic pancreatitis,"INTRODUCTION: The current standard of care for the management of minimal change chronic pancreatitis (MCCP) is medical management. Controversy exists, however, regarding the use of surgical intervention for MCCP. We hypothesized that total pancreatectomy and islet cell autotransplantation (TPIAT) decreases long-term resource utilization and improves quality of life, justifying initial costs and risks. METHODS: Detailed perioperative outcomes from 46 patients with MCCP populated a Markov model comparing medical management to TPIAT. Mortality, complications, readmission rates, insulin and narcotic use, imaging, and endoscopy were included in the model. Outcomes reported were survival, measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs, in 2013 US dollars. RESULTS: In medical patients, annual mean hospital admissions were 1.6 (range = 0-11), endoscopy 1.4 (0-6), and imaging (CT/MRI) 1.5 (0-4). In surgical patients, there were no perioperative deaths, with complication and 30-day readmission rates of 47 and 37%. One year after TPIAT, annual mean admissions, endoscopy, and imaging had decreased to 0.9 (0-4), 0.4 (0-2), and 0.9 (0-5); monthly narcotic use decreased from 138 to 37 morphine equivalents (p = 0.012). Cost and survival for TPIAT versus medical management were $153,575/14.9 QALYs and $196,042/11.5 QALYs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MCCP, TPIAT is associated with decreased cost and increased quality-adjusted survival. Providers and insurers should more enthusiastically embrace TPIAT use as a more effective cost-saving strategy.",2015-01-16152,25095749,J Gastrointest Surg,Gregory C Wilson,2015,19 / 1,46-55,No,25095749,"Gregory C Wilson; Syed A Ahmad; Daniel P Schauer; Mark H Eckman; Daniel E Abbott; Cost-effectiveness of total pancreatectomy and islet cell autotransplantation for the treatment of minimal change chronic pancreatitis, J Gastrointest Surg, ; 19(1):1091-255X; 46-55",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Total pancreatectomy and islet cell autotransplantation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Medical management,Not Stated,61 Years,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-12490.29,United States,2013,-13876.49
13842,Too late to vaccinate? The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of a delayed catch-up program using the 4-valent human papillomavirus vaccine in Norway,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are ideally administered before HPV exposure; therefore, catch-up programs for girls past adolescence have not been readily funded. We evaluated the benefits and cost-effectiveness of a delayed, 1-year female catch-up vaccination program in Norway. METHODS: We calibrated a dynamic HPV transmission model to Norwegian data and projected the costs and benefits associated with 8 HPV-related conditions while varying the upper vaccination age limit to 20, 22, 24, or 26 years. We explored the impact of vaccine protection in women with prior vaccine-targeted HPV infections, vaccine cost, coverage, and natural- and vaccine-induced immunity. RESULTS: The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness decreased as the upper age limit for catch-up increased. Assuming a vaccine cost of $150/dose, vaccination up to age 20 years remained below Norway's willingness-to-pay threshold (approximately $83 000/quality-adjusted life year gained); extension to age 22 years was cost-effective at a lower cost per dose ($50-$75). At high levels of vaccine protection in women with prior HPV exposure, vaccinating up to age 26 years was cost-effective. Results were stable with lower coverage. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination catch-up programs, 5 years after routine implementation, may be warranted; however, even at low vaccine cost per dose, the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating beyond age 22 years remains uncertain.",2015-01-16190,25057044,J Infect Dis,Emily A Burger,2015,211 / 2,206-15,No,25057044,"Emily A Burger; Stephen Sy; Mari Nygard; Ivar S Kristiansen; Jane J Kim; Too late to vaccinate?

METHODS: We calibrated a dynamic HPV transmission model to Norwegian data and projected the costs and benefits associated with 8 HPV-related conditions while varying the upper vaccination age limit to 20, 22, 24, or 26 years. We explored the impact of vaccine protection in women with prior vaccine-targeted HPV infections, vaccine cost, coverage, and natural- and vaccine-induced immunity. RESULTS: The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness decreased as the upper age limit for catch-up increased. Assuming a vaccine cost of $150/dose, vaccination up to age 20 years remained below Norway's willingness-to-pay threshold (approximately $83 000/quality-adjusted life year gained); extension to age 22 years was cost-effective at a lower cost per dose ($50-$75). At high levels of vaccine protection in women with prior HPV exposure, vaccinating up to age 26 years was cost-effective. Results were stable with lower coverage. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination catch-up programs, 5 years after routine implementation, may be warranted; however, even at low vaccine cost per dose, the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating beyond age 22 years remains uncertain.",2015-01-16190,25057044,J Infect Dis,Emily A Burger,2015,211 / 2,206-15,No,25057044,"Emily A Burger; Stephen Sy; Mari Nygard; Ivar S Kristiansen; Jane J Kim; Too late to vaccinate?

13850,Cost-effectiveness of the endoscopic versus microscopic approach for pituitary adenoma resection,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an endoscopic versus microscopic approach to pituitary adenoma resection. STUDY DESIGN: Markov decision tree economic evaluation. METHODS: An economic evaluation using a Markov decision tree model was performed. The economic perspective was that of the healthcare third-party payer. Effectiveness and probability data were obtained from a single meta-analysis of 38 studies. Costs were obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database and wholesale pharmaceutical pricing. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed including a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Comparative treatment groups were: 1) endoscopic approach and 2) microscopic approach to pituitary adenoma resection. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The time horizon was 25 years, and costs were discounted at a rate of 3.5%. RESULTS: The endoscopic approach cost a total of $17,244.63 and produced a total of 24.30 QALYs. The microscopic approach cost a total of $23,756.60 and produced a total of 24.20 QALYs. In the reference case, the endoscopic approach was a dominant intervention (both less costly and more effective); therefore, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not calculated. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated 79% certainty that the endoscopic approach is the cost-effective decision, at a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY.

13855,Resuscitation of neonates at 23 weeks' gestational age: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Resuscitation of infants at 23 weeks'' gestation remains controversial; clinical practices vary. We sought to investigate the cost effectiveness of resuscitation of infants born 23 0/7-23 6/7 weeks'' gestation. DESIGN: Decision-analytic modeling comparing universal and selective resuscitation to non-resuscitation for 5176 live births at 23 weeks in a theoretic U.S. cohort. Estimates of death (77%) and disability (64-86%) were taken from the literature. Maternal and combined maternal-neonatal utilities were applied to discounted life expectancy to generate QALYs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, discounting costs and QALYs. Main outcomes included number of survivors, their outcome status and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the three strategies. A cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000/QALY was utilized. RESULTS: Universal resuscitation would save 1059 infants: 138 severely disabled, 413 moderately impaired and 508 without significant sequelae. Selective resuscitation would save 717 infants: 93 severely disabled, 279 moderately impaired and 343 without significant sequelae. For mothers, non-resuscitation is less expensive ($19.9 million) and more effective (127 844 mQALYs) than universal resuscitation ($1.2 billion; 126 574 mQALYs) or selective resuscitation ($845 million; 125 966 mQALYs). For neonates, both universal and selective resuscitation were cost-effective, resulting in 22 256 and 15 134 nQALYS, respectively, versus 247 nQALYs for non-resuscitation.

13859,Cost-effectiveness analysis of liver resection versus transplantation for early hepatocellular carcinoma within the Milan criteria,"Both liver resection (LR) and cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT) are potentially curative treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria and with adequate liver function. Adopting either as a first-line therapy carries major cost and resource implications. The objective of this study was to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of LR against CLT for patients with HCC within the Milan criteria using a decision analytic model. A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients aged 55 years with HCC within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis, undergoing LR or CLT, and followed up over their remaining life expectancy. Analysis was performed in different geographical cost settings: the USA, Switzerland and Singapore. Transition probabilities were obtained from systematic literature reviews, supplemented by databases from Singapore and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (USA). Utility and cost data were obtained from open sources. LR produced 3.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) while CLT had an additional 1.4 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CLT versus LR ranged from $111,821/QALY in Singapore to $156,300/QALY in Switzerland, and was above thresholds for cost-effectiveness in all three countries. Sensitivity analysis revealed that CLT-related 5-year cumulative survival, one-time cost of CLT, and post-LR 5-year cumulative recurrence rates were the most sensitive parameters in all cost scenarios. ICERs were reduced below threshold when CLT-related 5-year cumulative survival exceeded 84.9% and 87.6% in Singapore and the USA, respectively.

13862,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Minimally Invasive versus Open Surgery Techniques for Lumbar Spinal Fusion in Italy and the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) compared with open surgery (OS) techniques for one- or two-level lumbar spinal fusion in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal conditions in the United Kingdom and Italy. METHODS: A health economic model was developed on the basis of results from a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness of MIS compared with OS for lumbar spinal fusion. The analysis was conducted from a health care payer perspective. Parameters included in the model were surgery, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, postoperative complications, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Cost-effectiveness was determined by the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: MIS was the dominant strategy compared with OS (i.e., yielding both cost savings and improved HRQOL). Cost savings were driven mainly by shorter length of hospital stay, reduced blood loss, and fewer complications such as surgical site infection. The total cost saving per procedure was euro973 for Italy and euro1666 for the United Kingdom, with an improvement of 0.04 quality-adjusted life-year over 2 years in HRQOL. One-way sensitivity analyses and predefined scenario(s) analyses confirmed the robustness of the model.

Which initial treatment, secondary therapy, and whether antivirals should be given alone or in combination are questions of considerable uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this model was to undertake a comprehensive economic evaluation of all antiviral treatments for CHB to recommend the most cost-effective therapeutic sequence. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of all clinically relevant antiviral treatment sequences for nucleos(t)ide-naive adults with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive or HBeAg-negative CHB. Relative rates of HBeAg seroconversion and viral suppression were obtained from a network meta-analysis. Data on mortality, antiviral drug resistance, durability of response, adverse events, and costs were obtained from published literature. Results are reported in terms of lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and expected net benefit. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, pegylated interferon alpha-2a (peg-IFN alpha-2a) followed by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was most effective and cost-effective in HBeAg-positive patients, with a cost of pound7488 per QALY gained compared with no treatment. In HBeAg-negative patients, peg-IFN alpha-2a followed by entecavir was most effective and cost-effective, with a cost of pound6981 per QALY gained. The model was robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Peg-IFN alpha-2a followed by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir is the most effective antiviral treatment strategy for people with both variants of CHB.

In HBeAg-negative patients, peg-IFN alpha-2a followed by entecavir was most effective and cost-effective, with a cost of pound6981 per QALY gained. The model was robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Peg-IFN alpha-2a followed by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir is the most effective antiviral treatment strategy for people with both variants of CHB. At a cost of less than pound10,000 per QALY gained, these sequences are considered cost-effective in England and Wales.

13867,Cost-Effectiveness of Mirabegron Compared with Antimuscarinic Agents for the Treatment of Adults with Overactive Bladder in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Mirabegron, a first-in-class selective oral beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, has similar efficacy to most antimuscarinic agents and a lower incidence of dry mouth in patients with overactive bladder (OAB). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron 50 mg compared with oral antimuscarinic agents in adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A Markov model including health states for symptom severity, treatment status, and adverse events was developed. Cycle length was 1 month, and the time horizon was 5 years. Antimuscarinic comparators were tolterodine extended release, solifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin extended release and immediate release (IR), darifenacin, and trospium chloride modified release. Transition probabilities for symptom severity levels and adverse events were estimated from a mirabegron trial and a mixed treatment comparison. Estimates for other inputs were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total health care costs, including costs of drug acquisition, physician visits, incontinence pad use, and botox injections, were modeled. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from pound367 (vs. solifenacin 10 mg) to pound15,593 (vs. oxybutynin IR 10 mg) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/QALY gained, the probability of mirabegron 50 mg being cost-effective ranged from 70.2% versus oxybutynin IR 10 mg to 97.8% versus darifenacin 15 mg. A limitation of our analysis is the uncertainty due to the lack of direct comparisons of mirabegron with other agents; a mixed treatment comparison using rigorous methodology provided the data for the analysis, but the studies involved showed heterogeneity.

13877,"Cost-Effectiveness and Value of Information of Erlotinib, Afatinib, and Cisplatin-Pemetrexed for First-Line Treatment of Advanced EGFR Mutation-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in the United States","OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib or afatinib, or chemotherapy cisplatin-pemetrexed, for first-line treatment of advanced epithelial growth factor receptor mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer in the United States. We also assessed the expected benefit of further research to reduce uncertainty regarding which treatment is optimal. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib, afatinib, and cisplatin-pemetrexed. Model transition and adverse-effect probabilities were from two published phase III trials: EURTAC (Erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer) and LUX-Lung (Afatinib versus cisplatin-based chemotherapy for EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma) 3. EURTAC survival estimates were corrected for patients entering the trial with more severe disease, compared with LUX-Lung 3. Health utilities and costs were from national estimates or the published literature. Inputs were modeled as distributions for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis to estimate the expected benefit of reducing uncertainty regarding the decision of optimal treatment. RESULTS: In the base case, both tyrosine kinase inhibitors were more cost-effective than cisplatin-pemetrexed. Erlotinib had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $61,809/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with afatinib. The acceptability curve showed that erlotinib was the optimal treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY (10-year population EVPI = $85.9 million). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY to $70,000/QALY (EVPI = $211.5 million-$261.8 million), however, there was considerable uncertainty whether erlotinib or afatinib was the optimal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that erlotinib is the preferred first-line treatment for advanced epithelial growth factor receptor mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Further research comparing erlotinib and afatinib is potentially justified, although accurate data are needed on the required cost and sample size of the trial.",2015-01-17160,26409604,Value Health,Jie Ting,2015,18 / 6,774-782,Yes,26409604,"Jie Ting; PharmD Tien Ho; Pin Xiang; Amanda Sugay; Maher Abdel-Sattar; Leslie Wilson; Cost-Effectiveness and Value of Information of Erlotinib, Afatinib, and Cisplatin-Pemetrexed for First-Line Treatment of Advanced EGFR Mutation-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in the United States, Value Health, 2015 Sep; 18(6):1098-3015; 774-782",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Erlotinib vs. Afatinib,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,61809,United States,2013,68668.68
13878,Cost-effectiveness of a bivalent human papillomavirus vaccination program in Japan,"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and their widespread adoption have the potential to relieve a large part of the burden of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality, particularly in countries that have low screening rates or, like Japan, lack a cohesive universal screening program. An economic evaluation was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing a bivalent HPV vaccination program in Japan from a healthcare perspective. Methods: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection that incorporates both vaccination and screening was developed for Japan. The modelled intervention, a bivalent HPV vaccine with a 100% lifetime vaccine efficacy and 80% vaccine coverage, given to a cohort of 12-year-old Japanese girls in conjunction with the current screening program, was compared with screening alone in terms of costs and effectiveness. A discount rate of 5% was applied to both costs and utilities where relevant. Results: Vaccination alongside screening compared with screening alone is associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$20 315 per quality-adjusted-life-year gained if 80% coverage is assumed. The ICER at 5% coverage with the vaccine plus screening, compared with screening alone, is US$1158.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to simulate life-long medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of three antiplatelet strategies in a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old patients with acute coronary syndrome after a percutaneous coronary intervention: (a) universal clopidogrel (75 mg daily), (b) universal alternative antiplatelet therapy (prasugrel or ticagrelor), and (c) all PG-PRT patients were genotyped. Noncarriers of the CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) allele received clopidogrel 75 mg daily. CYP2C19 LOF allele(s) carriers who were poor metabolizers received prasugrel or ticagrelor. CYP2C19 LOF allele(s) carriers who were intermediate metabolizers (IM) received high-dose clopidogrel (225 mg daily) and were tested for high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR). IM patients with HTPR were switched to prasugrel or ticagrelor. Model inputs were derived from the literature. RESULTS: In base-case analysis, PG-PRT was the least costly (USD 71 887) strategy with highest QALYs gained (7.886 QALYs). Sensitivity analyses found universal clopidogrel to be the preferred strategy if the prevalence of the CYP2C19 LOF allele was less than 2.6% or the incidence of HTPR in IM patients was greater than 82.8%. In 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations, PG-PRT was less costly than universal clopidogrel by USD 91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 83-99; P=0.0499], with higher QALYs by 0.0257 (95% CI: 0.0256-0.0258; P<0.001). Compared with universal alternative antiplatelet therapy, PG-PRT was less costly by USD 2208 (95% CI: 2195-2221; P<0.001) and gained 0.0085 QALYs (95% CI: 0.0083-0.0087; P=0.0260).

13881,Cost-Effectiveness of Cetuximab as First-line Treatment for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in the United States,"PURPOSE: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating recent phase III clinical trial (FIRE-3) data to evaluate clinical and economic tradeoffs associated with first-line treatments of KRAS wild-type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using FIRE-3 data to project survival and lifetime costs of FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab. Hypothetical KRAS-WT mCRC patients initiated first-line treatment and could experience adverse events, disease progression warranting second-line treatment, or clinical response and hepatic metastasectomy. Model inputs were derived from FIRE-3 and published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported as US$ per life year (LY) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Scenario analyses considered patients with extended RAS mutations and CALGB/SWOG 80405 data; 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with bevacizumab, KRAS-WT patients receiving first-line cetuximab gained 5.7 months of life at a cost of $46,266, for an ICER of $97,223/LY ($122,610/QALY). For extended RAS-WT patients, the ICER was $77,339/LY ($99,584/QALY). Cetuximab treatment was cost-effective 80.3% of the time, given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/LY. Results were sensitive to changes in survival, treatment duration, and product costs. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of FIRE-3 data suggests that first-line treatment with cetuximab and FOLFIRI in KRAS (and extended RAS) WT mCRC patients may improve health outcomes and use financial resources more efficiently than bevacizumab and FOLFIRI. This information, in combination with other studies investigating comparative effectiveness of first-line options, can be useful to clinicians, payers, and policymakers in making treatment and resource allocation decisions for mCRC patients.",2015-01-17178,26398184,Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,Veena Shankaran,2015,/,,No,26398184,"Veena Shankaran; Jesse D Ortendahl; Anna G Purdum; Bjorn Bolinder; Ayanna M Anene; Gordon H Sun; Tanya G K Bentley; Cost-Effectiveness of Cetuximab as First-line Treatment for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in the United States, Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis, 2015 Sep 22; ():1178-2005",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cetuximab plus FOLFIRI vs. Bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,107630,United States,2013,119574.98

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require routine monitoring and dose adjustment, thus potentially provide an alternative treatment option. METHODS AND RESULTS: Because of the lack of head-to-head clinical studies, an indirect comparison was conducted of dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban based on the respective phase III clinical trial. The derived relative safety and efficacy estimates were used to evaluate the cost-utility of dabigatran compared with rivaroxaban in the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE. The results of the indirect comparison showed no significant difference between dabigatran and rivaroxaban in avoiding recurrent VTE following index PE, index DVT, or DVT/PE combined, in treatment and extended anticoagulation. Dabigatran has significantly less major or clinically relevant bleeds (MCRBE) compared to rivaroxaban in treatment after index DVT and treatment after DVT or PE combined, but was not significantly different from rivaroxaban after index PE or in extended anticoagulation.

13888,Indirect comparison and cost-utility of dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban in the treatment and extended anticoagulation of venous thromboembolism in a UK setting,"BACKGROUND: Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is traditionally managed with a short course of parenteral anticoagulation followed by 3-6 months of a vitamin-K antagonist. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require routine monitoring and dose adjustment, thus potentially provide an alternative treatment option. METHODS AND RESULTS: Because of the lack of head-to-head clinical studies, an indirect comparison was conducted of dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban based on the respective phase III clinical trial. The derived relative safety and efficacy estimates were used to evaluate the cost-utility of dabigatran compared with rivaroxaban in the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE. The results of the indirect comparison showed no significant difference between dabigatran and rivaroxaban in avoiding recurrent VTE following index PE, index DVT, or DVT/PE combined, in treatment and extended anticoagulation. Dabigatran has significantly less major or clinically relevant bleeds (MCRBE) compared to rivaroxaban in treatment after index DVT and treatment after DVT or PE combined, but was not significantly different from rivaroxaban after index PE or in extended anticoagulation. In cost-utility deterministic analyses, dabigatran was projected dominant in all analyzed settings, given its marginally lower total cost and marginally higher QALYs gained compared to rivaroxaban.

The objective of this analysis was to assess the cost effectiveness of apixaban against other NOACs for the prevention of stroke in patients with NVAF in Greece. METHODS: A Markov model that evaluated clinical events, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and costs for patients treated with apixaban or other NOACs formed the basis of the analysis. Clinical events were modeled for a lifetime horizon, based on clinical efficacy data from an indirect comparison, using the ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, and RE-LY clinical trials. Resource use associated with patient monitoring was elicited via a panel of experts (cardiologists and internists). Cost calculations reflect the local clinical setting and followed a third-party payer perspective (Euros, discounted at 3 %). RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to reduce the occurrence of clinical events and increase quality-adjusted life expectancy and incremental costs of treatment compared with other NOACs.

13892,Cost effectiveness of bronchial thermoplasty in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma,"RATIONALE: Based on its clinical effectiveness, bronchial thermoplasty (BT) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010 for the treatment of severe persistent asthma in patients 18 years and older whose asthma is not well-controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonist medicines. OBJECTIVE: Assess the 10 year cost-effectiveness of BT for individuals with severe uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: Using a Markov decision analytic model, the cost-effectiveness of BT was estimated. The patient population involved a hypothetical cohort of 41-year-old patients comparing BT to usual care over a 10-year time frame. The main outcome measure was cost in 2013 dollars per additional quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Treatment with BT resulted in 6.40 QALYs and $7512 in cost compared to 6.21 QALYs and $2054 for usual care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for BT at 10 years was $29 821/QALY. At a willingness to pay per QALY of $50 000, BT continues to be cost effective unless the probability of severe asthma exacerbation drops below 0.63 exacerbation per year or the cost of BT rises above $10 384 total for all three bronchoscopic procedures needed to perform thermoplasty and to cover the entire bronchial tree (baseline = $6690). CONCLUSIONS: BT is a cost-effective treatment for asthmatics at high risk of exacerbations.

13897,Cost-effectiveness analysis of neurocognitive-sparing treatments for brain metastases,"BACKGROUND: Decisions regarding how to treat patients who have 1 to 3 brain metastases require important tradeoffs between controlling recurrences, side effects, and costs. In this analysis, the authors compared novel treatments versus usual care to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from a payer's (Medicare) perspective. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a microsimulation of a Markov model for 60 one-month cycles. The model used 4 simulated cohorts of patients aged 65 years with 1 to 3 brain metastases. The 4 cohorts had a median survival of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to test the sensitivity of the model to different prognoses. The treatment alternatives evaluated included stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with 3 variants of salvage after recurrence (whole-brain radiotherapy [WBRT], hippocampal avoidance WBRT [HA-WBRT], SRS plus WBRT, and SRS plus HA-WBRT). The findings were tested for robustness using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Traditional radiation therapies remained cost-effective for patients in the 3-month and 6-month cohorts. In the cohorts with longer median survival, HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT became cost-effective relative to traditional treatments. When the treatments that involved HA-WBRT were excluded, either SRS alone or SRS plus WBRT was cost-effective relative to WBRT alone.

13900,Cost-effectiveness analysis of neurocognitive-sparing treatments for brain metastases,"BACKGROUND: Decisions regarding how to treat patients who have 1 to 3 brain metastases require important tradeoffs between controlling recurrences, side effects, and costs. In this analysis, the authors compared novel treatments versus usual care to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from a payer's (Medicare) perspective. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a microsimulation of a Markov model for 60 one-month cycles. The model used 4 simulated cohorts of patients aged 65 years with 1 to 3 brain metastases. The 4 cohorts had a median survival of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to test the sensitivity of the model to different prognoses. The treatment alternatives evaluated included stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with 3 variants of salvage after recurrence (whole-brain radiotherapy [WBRT], hippocampal avoidance WBRT [HA-WBRT], SRS plus WBRT, and SRS plus HA-WBRT). The findings were tested for robustness using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Traditional radiation therapies remained cost-effective for patients in the 3-month and 6-month cohorts. In the cohorts with longer median survival, HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT became cost-effective relative to traditional treatments. When the treatments that involved HA-WBRT were excluded, either SRS alone or SRS plus WBRT was cost-effective relative to WBRT alone. The deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results. CONCLUSIONS: HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT were cost-effective for 2 of the 4 cohorts, demonstrating the value of controlling late brain toxicity with this novel therapy. Cost-effectiveness depended on patient life expectancy. SRS was cost-effective in the cohorts with short prognoses (3 and 6 months), whereas HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT were cost-effective in the cohorts with longer prognoses (12 and 24 months).
