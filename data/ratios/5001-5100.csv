5001,Comparative clinical and economic outcomes of treatments for refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"BACKGROUND: Various drug therapies are available for treatment of refractory stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their comparative economic value is unclear. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of erlotinib, docetaxel, or pemetrexed in a cohort of refractory advanced stage NSCLC patients 60 years of age from a US payer perspective. Mean progression-free and overall survival were assumed equal for the three treatments based on published clinical trials, from which adverse event rates were also derived. Costs and utilities were obtained from publicly available sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: Treatment with erlotinib, docetaxel, and pemetrexed yielded 0.42, 0.41, and 0.41 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), respectively. The slightly increased QALYs for erlotinib compared to docetaxel and pemetrexed resulted from less severe treatment complications and oral vs. IV administration. Total costs were US$ 37,000, US$ 39,100 and US$ 43,800 for erlotinib, docetaxel and pemetrexed, respectively. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, erlotinib was cost-saving in 65 and 87% of the simulations compared to docetaxel and pemetrexed, respectively, and had improved QALYs and decreased costs or was cost-effective in 42 and 55% of simulations. Estimates of treatment duration were among the most influential parameters in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our analysis suggest treatment of refractory NSCLC with erlotinib is less costly compared with alternative treatments, and suggested improvements in QALYs should be confirmed in controlled clinical trials.",2008-01-03979,18295368,Lung Cancer,Josh J Carlson,2008,61 / 3,405-15,No,18295368,"Josh J Carlson; Carolina Reyes; Nina Oestreicher; Deborah Lubeck; Scott D Ramsey; David L Veenstra; Carolina Reyes; Nina Oestreicher; Deborah Lubeck; Scott D Ramsey; David L Veenstra; Comparative clinical and economic outcomes of treatments for refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Lung Cancer, 2008-Sep; 61(3):0169-5002; 405-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Erlotinib vs. Pemetrexed,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-678200,United States,2007,-846551.21

5006,Cost-utility of an 8-month aquatic training for women with fibromyalgia: a randomized controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: Physical therapy in warm water has been effective and highly recommended for persons with fibromyalgia, but its efficiency remains largely unknown. Should patients or health care managers invest in this therapy? The aim of the current study was to assess the cost-utility of adding an aquatic exercise programme to the usual care of women with fibromyalgia. METHODS: Costs to the health care system and to society were considered in this study that included 33 participants, randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 17) or a control group (n = 16). The intervention in the experimental group consisted of a 1-h, supervised, water-based exercise sessions, three times per week for 8 months. The main outcome measures were the health care costs and the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using the time trade-off elicitation technique from the EuroQol EQ-5D instrument. Sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in staff salary, number of women attending sessions and time spent going to the pool. The cost effectiveness acceptability curves were created using a non-parametric bootstrap technique. RESULTS: The mean incremental treatment costs exceeded those for usual care per patient by euro 517 for health care costs and euro 1,032 for societal costs. The mean incremental QALY associated with the intervention was 0.131 (95% CI: 0.011 to 0.290). Each QALY gained in association with the exercise programme cost an additional euro 3,947/QALY (95% CI: 1,782 to 47,000) for a health care perspective and euro 7,878/QALY (3,559 to 93,818) from a societal perspective. The curves showed a 95% probability that the addition of the water-based programme is a cost-effective strategy if the ceiling of inversion is euro 14,200/QALY from a health care perspective and euro 28,300/QALY from a societal perspective. CONCLUSION: The addition of an aquatic exercise programme to the usual care regime for fibromyalgia in women is cost effective in terms of both health care costs and societal costs. However, the characteristics of facilities (distance from the patients' homes and number of patients that can be accommodated per session) are major determinants to consider before investing in such a programme.

5007,Cost-effective osteoporosis treatment thresholds: the United States perspective,"SUMMARY: A United States-specific cost-effectiveness analysis, which incorporated the cost and health consequences of clinical fractures of the hip, spine, forearm, shoulder, rib, pelvis and lower leg, was undertaken to identify the 10-year hip fracture probability required for osteoporosis treatment to be cost-effective for cohorts defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. A 3% 10-year risk of hip fracture was generally required for osteoporosis treatment to cost less than $60,000 per QALY gained. INTRODUCTION: Rapid growth of the elderly United States population will result in so many at risk of osteoporosis that economically efficient approaches to osteoporosis care warrant consideration. METHODS: A Markov-cohort model of annual United States age-specific incidence of clinical hip, spine, forearm, shoulder, rib, pelvis and lower leg fractures, costs (2005 US dollars), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment ($600/yr drug cost for 5 years with 35% fracture reduction) by gender and race/ethnicity groups. To determine the 10-year hip fracture probability at which treatment became cost-effective, average annual age-specific probabilities for all fractures were multiplied by a relative risk (RR) that was systematically varied from 0 to 10 until a cost of $60,000 per QALY gained was observed for treatment relative to no intervention. RESULTS: Osteoporosis treatment was cost-effective when the 10-year hip fracture probability reached approximately 3%. Although the RR at which treatment became cost-effective varied markedly between genders and by race/ethnicity, the absolute 10-year hip fracture probability at which intervention became cost-effective was similar across race/ethnicity groups, but tended to be slightly higher for men than for women.

5013,Cost-effective osteoporosis treatment thresholds: the United States perspective,"SUMMARY: A United States-specific cost-effectiveness analysis, which incorporated the cost and health consequences of clinical fractures of the hip, spine, forearm, shoulder, rib, pelvis and lower leg, was undertaken to identify the 10-year hip fracture probability required for osteoporosis treatment to be cost-effective for cohorts defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. A 3% 10-year risk of hip fracture was generally required for osteoporosis treatment to cost less than $60,000 per QALY gained. INTRODUCTION: Rapid growth of the elderly United States population will result in so many at risk of osteoporosis that economically efficient approaches to osteoporosis care warrant consideration. METHODS: A Markov-cohort model of annual United States age-specific incidence of clinical hip, spine, forearm, shoulder, rib, pelvis and lower leg fractures, costs (2005 US dollars), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment ($600/yr drug cost for 5 years with 35% fracture reduction) by gender and race/ethnicity groups. To determine the 10-year hip fracture probability at which treatment became cost-effective, average annual age-specific probabilities for all fractures were multiplied by a relative risk (RR) that was systematically varied from 0 to 10 until a cost of $60,000 per QALY gained was observed for treatment relative to no intervention. RESULTS: Osteoporosis treatment was cost-effective when the 10-year hip fracture probability reached approximately 3%.

5017,Cost-effectiveness of providing full drug coverage to increase medication adherence in post-myocardial infarction Medicare beneficiaries,"BACKGROUND: Effective therapies for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease-related events are significantly underused, and attempts to improve adherence have often yielded disappointing results. Elimination of patient out-of-pocket costs may be an effective strategy to enhance medication use. We sought to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing full coverage for aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins (combination pharmacotherapy) to individuals enrolled in the Medicare drug benefit program after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We created a Markov cost-effectiveness model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing Medicare beneficiaries with full coverage for combination pharmacotherapy compared with current coverage under the Medicare Part D program. Our analysis was conducted from the societal perspective and considered a lifetime time horizon. In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our analysis from the perspective of Medicare. In the model, post-myocardial infarction Medicare beneficiaries who received usual prescription drug coverage under the Part D program lived an average of 8.21 quality-adjusted life-years after their initial event, incurring coronary heart disease-related medical costs of $114,000. Those who received prescription drug coverage without deductibles or copayments lived an average of 8.56 quality-adjusted life-years and incurred $111,600 in coronary heart disease-related costs. Compared with current prescription drug coverage, full coverage for post-myocardial infarction secondary prevention therapies would result in greater functional life expectancy (0.35 quality-adjusted life-year) and less resource use ($2500). From the perspective of Medicare, full drug coverage was highly cost-effective ($7182/quality-adjusted life-year) but not cost saving.

5019,The cost-utility of maintenance treatment with venlafaxine in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder,"AIMS: The Prevention of Recurrent Episodes of Depression with venlafaxine XR for Two Years trial has reported advantages with maintenance treatment for patients with recurrent depressive disorder. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of maintenance treatment with venlafaxine in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder, based on a recent clinical trial. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed to assess the cost-utility of maintenance treatment for 2 years in recurrently depressed patients in Sweden. Risk of relapse and recurrence was based on a recent randomised clinical trial assessing the efficacy and tolerability of maintenance treatment with venlafaxine over 2 years. Costs and quality of life estimations were retrieved from a naturalistic longitudinal observational study conducted in Sweden. Health effects were quantified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted on key parameters employed in the model. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the cost per QALY gained of venlafaxine compared with no treatment was estimated at $18,500 over 2 years. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we found that maintenance treatment with venlafaxine is cost-effective with 90% probability at a willingness to pay per QALY of $67,000 or less. Our long-term analyses also indicate that even under conservative assumptions about future risks of recurrences, maintenance treatment is cost-effective.

METHODS: A standard health economic Markov model estimated the cost and outcome for node-positive early breast cancer patients, from initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy to death. Patient-level data were used from the Breast Cancer International Research Group (BCIRG) 001 trial for estimates of the effect of chemotherapy on toxicity and outcome, and an observational data set collected from a UK university hospital provided estimates of resource use and outcome for patients with relapsed disease. RESULTS: Over a 10-year analysis timeframe, the incremental cost per life-year saved associated with the use of TAC rather than FAC was estimated as pound 15,418 (95% CI, pound 13,734 to pound 17,997) and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (IC/QALY) was pound 18,188 (95% CI, pound 14,161 to pound 32,422). The addition of primary G-CSF (lenograstim or filgrastim) to the TAC regimen resulted in an IC/QALY of pound 20,432. The results were most sensitive to the quality-of-life (QOL) score for patients in remission postchemotherapy. However, even if QOL was assumed to be as poor as for patients with metastatic disease, the IC/QALY estimate rose only to pound 32,430. CONCLUSION: The use of adjuvant TAC rather than FAC for node-positive early breast cancer patients is cost effective, despite the increased drug and toxicity treatment costs, and when primary G-CSF prophylaxis is given to all patients.",2008-01-04002,18281666,J Clin Oncol,Sorrel E Wolowacz,2008,26 / 6,925-33,No,18281666,"Sorrel E Wolowacz; David A Cameron; Helen C Tate; Adrian Bagust; Docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as adjuvant treatment for early node-positive breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis, J Clin Oncol, 2008-Feb-20; 26(6):0732-183X; 925-33",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide(TAC) vs. Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide(FAC)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,18188,United Kingdom,2005,43875.87
5022,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) with Interstim for fecal incontinence patients in Spain,"INTRODUCTION: Fecal incontinence (FI) is a condition with a high impact on the psychological and social life of healthy people. Interstim, the sacral neuromodulation (SNM) therapy, has shown higher effectiveness and safety rates than surgical procedures like dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter in patients with intact anal sphincter (IAS) and after sphincteroplasty in patients with structurally deficient anal sphincter (SDAS). OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of FI management in two scenarios - with and without SNM - and to estimate the potential budget impact of its progressive introduction in the Spanish setting. METHODS: Two decision analytical models were developed (IAS and SDAS patients) representing the possible clinical paths for each of the scenarios (with and without SNM), as well as its clinical and economic consequences in the mid-to long term with a Markov model. Clinical and resource use data were retrieved from the literature and validated by a clinician expert panel. Effectiveness was measured with both QALYs and symptom-free years (SFY). A 3% discount rate was used for future costs and benefits (time horizon = 5 years). Prevalence figures were combined with Interstim sales forecasts to estimate the total number of patients to receive therapy over the next 5 years and the associated budget impact. RESULTS: The introduction of Interstim in the therapeutic management of FI has an associated cost-effectiveness of euro16 181 (IAS patients) and euro22 195 (SDAS patients) per QALY gained. The progressive introduction of Interstim in 75 to 100 patients/year will have an estimated budget impact of 0.1% of incremental costs in patients with FI.

5024,Adding a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine to the UK cervical cancer screening programme: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding a quadrivalent (6/11/16/18) human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to the current screening programme in the UK compared to screening alone. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection incorporating screening and vaccination was developed. A vaccine that prevents 98% of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18-associated disease, with a lifetime duration and 85% coverage, in conjunction with current screening was considered. RESULTS: Vaccination with screening, compared to screening alone, was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound21,059 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and pound34,687 per life year saved (LYS).

5025,Economic evaluation of an intensive group training protocol compared with usual care physiotherapy in patients with chronic low back pain,"STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation from a societal perspective conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of 52 weeks.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of an intensive group training protocol compared with usual care physiotherapy in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain. The intensive group training protocol combines exercise therapy, back school, and behavioral principles.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Two studies found a significant reduction in absenteeism for a graded activity program in occupational health care. This program has not yet been evaluated in a primary care physiotherapy setting.METHODS: Participating physical therapists in primary care recruited 114 patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain. Eligible patients were randomized to either the protocol group or the guideline group. Outcome measures included functional status (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), pain intensity (11-point numerical rating scale), general perceived effect and quality of life (EuroQol-5D). Cost data were measured with cost diaries and included direct and indirect costs related to low back pain.RESULTS: After 52 weeks, the direct health care costs were significantly higher for patients in the protocol group, largely due to the costs of the intervention. The mean difference in total costs amounted to [Euro sign] 233 (95% confidence interval: [Euro sign] -2.185; [Euro sign] 2.764). The cost-effectiveness planes indicated no significant differences in cost effectiveness between the 2 groups.CONCLUSION: The results of this economic evaluation showed no difference in total costs between the protocol group and the guideline group. The differences in effects were small and not statistically significant.

PATIENTS: One thousand 55-year-old men with Barrett's oesophagus. INTERVENTION: Surveillance programme: endoscopy and biopsy at 3 yearly intervals for non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus; low-grade dysplasia yearly; high grade-dysplasia 3 monthly. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expected value of perfect information. RESULTS: Non-surveillance dominated surveillance (i.e. cost less and conferred more benefit), but there was substantial uncertainty around many of the model inputs. Probabilistic analyses showed that non-surveillance cost less and conferred more benefit in 75% of model runs. Surveillance was cost-effective at usual levels of willingness to pay in 11% of runs. For people with Barrett's oesophagus in England and Wales, a value of pound6.5 million is placed on acquiring perfect information about surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus.

5030,Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopy versus laparotomy for initial surgical evaluation and treatment of potentially resectable hepatic colorectal metastases: a decision analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Approximately 10-40% of colorectal cancer patients with potentially resectable hepatic metastases are incorrectly deemed resectable on standard pre-operative evaluation, including contrast-enhanced CT. Laparoscopy can identify unresectability in a majority of patients at highest risk of being incorrectly deemed resectable, sparing them an unnecessary laparotomy. However, laparoscopy requires an added investment by surgeons, patients, and payers. This analysis seeks to ascertain whether that investment is cost-effective. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to evaluate the societal cost-effectiveness of laparoscopy versus laparotomy in colorectal cancer patients with hepatic metastases deemed resectable on standard pre-operative evaluation. This comparison involved the cost, the effectiveness, and the incremental cost-effectiveness (the cost in dollars for each quality-adjusted life-year saved) of each option. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the model's validity under a variety of assumptions. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of performing laparoscopy prior to laparotomy for resection of colorectal hepatic metastases depends primarily upon the probability of resectability determined at laparoscopy, and on the sensitivity of diagnostic laparoscopy. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy for initial evaluation of resectability of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer is most likely to benefit patients and save costs when performed after pre-operative risk stratification in patients at high risk of radiographically occult unresectable disease.",2008-01-04017,18270972,J Surg Oncol,Shelly Tanner Karuna,2008,97 / 5,396-403,No,18270972,"Shelly Tanner Karuna; Richard Thirlby; Thomas Biehl; David Veenstra; Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopy versus laparotomy for initial surgical evaluation and treatment of potentially resectable hepatic colorectal metastases: a decision analysis, J Surg Oncol, 2008-Apr-01; 97(5):0022-4790; 396-403",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diagnostic laparascopy to determine if liver metastases resectable; laparotomy if liver metastases determined resectable vs. Laparotomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,3.00,-25000,United States,2006,-32094.62
5031,Cost-effectiveness of telephonic disease management in heart failure,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a telephonic disease management (DM) intervention in heart failure (HF). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of telephonic DM among 1069 community-dwelling patients with systolic HF (SHF) and diastolic HF performed between 1999 and 2003. The enrollment period was 18 months per subject. METHODS: Bootstrap-resampled incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed and compared across groups. Direct medical costs were obtained from a medical record review that collected records from 92% of patients; 66% of records requested were obtained. RESULTS: Disease management produced statistically significant survival advantages among all patients (17.4 days, P = .04), among patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms (47.7 days, P = .02), and among patients with SHF (24.2 days, P = .01). Analyses of direct medical and intervention costs showed no cost savings associated with the intervention. For all patients and considering all-cause medical care, the ICER was $146 870 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, while for patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms and patients with SHF, the ICERs were $67 784 and $95 721 per QALY gained, respectively. Costs per QALY gained were $101 120 for all patients, $72 501 for patients with SHF, and $41 348 for patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was effective but costly to implement and did not reduce utilization. It may not be cost-effective in other broadly representative samples of patients.

5035,Economic and health consequences of managing bradycardia with dual-chamber compared to single-chamber ventricular pacemakers in Italy,"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to estimate the economic implications of managing bradycardia due to sinoatrial node disease or atrioventricular block with dual compared to single-chamber ventricular pacemakers from an Italian government perspective. Dual-chamber pacemakers lower the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and pacemaker syndrome. METHODS: A discrete event simulation of a patient's course for 5 years following pacemaker implantation. Each patient may experience the following: complications, pacemaker syndrome, atrial fibrillation, stroke, or death. Risk functions were based on published data from the Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing and Mode Selection Trial in Sinus-Node Dysfunction. Identical patients were simulated after receiving a single or dual-chamber pacemaker. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and direct medical costs were estimated (2004 Euros). Benefits and costs were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: The model predicts that implanting the dual-chamber device in 1000 patients will prevent 36 patients from developing atrial fibrillation, 168 from developing severe pacemaker syndrome, but will lead to 13 additional hospitalizations with complications over 5 years. Health benefits are achieved at an incremental cost of 23 euros per patient, and 0.09 QALY, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 260 euros/QALY. Sensitivity analysis shows that device replacement rates due to pacemaker syndrome have the biggest impact on the final results. CONCLUSIONS: In the long term, higher initial costs of the dual-chamber device may be offset by a reduction in costs associated with reoperations and atrial fibrillation.",2008-01-04022,18268418,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),Huseyin Baris Deniz,2008,9 / 1,43-50,No,18268418,"Huseyin Baris Deniz; J Jaime Caro; Alexandra Ward; Jorgen Moller; Farzana Malik; Economic and health consequences of managing bradycardia with dual-chamber compared to single-chamber ventricular pacemakers in Italy, J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown), 2008-Jan; 9(1):1558-2027; 43-50",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dual chamber ventricular pacemakers vs. Single-chamber ventricular pacemakers,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,260,Euro,2004,443.08
5036,Identifying research priorities: the value of information associated with repeat screening for age-related macular degeneration,"The authors report an analysis that was developed as part of a pilot study examining the use of decision analysis and value-of-information methods to inform research prioritization decisions for the UK health care system. This analysis was conducted to inform decision makers whether additional research on screening for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) would be worthwhile and to demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of using such analytic methods to inform policy decision within the time-lines demanded by existing procedures. A probabilistic decision model was developed to establish the cost-effectiveness of a policy of repeat screening for AMD using the Amsler grid followed by treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT) compared with 2 alternatives: PDT without screening (self-referral) and no screening or treatment. Screening for AMD appears to be cost-effective on the basis of existing evidence; however, the decision to implement a policy of screening is somewhat uncertain, with a probability that screening is cost-effective of 0.87 and 0.72 for the 20/40 and 20/80 models, respectively, at a threshold of 30,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) associated with this decision is substantial (6.9 million pounds for the 20/40 model and 14.5 million pounds for the 20/80 model), with a sizeable EVPI associated with the effect of PDT on quality of life.

The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) associated with this decision is substantial (6.9 million pounds for the 20/40 model and 14.5 million pounds for the 20/80 model), with a sizeable EVPI associated with the effect of PDT on quality of life.

5039,Identifying research priorities: the value of information associated with repeat screening for age-related macular degeneration,"The authors report an analysis that was developed as part of a pilot study examining the use of decision analysis and value-of-information methods to inform research prioritization decisions for the UK health care system. This analysis was conducted to inform decision makers whether additional research on screening for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) would be worthwhile and to demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of using such analytic methods to inform policy decision within the time-lines demanded by existing procedures.

5040,Cost-effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation vs. electroconvulsive therapy for severe depression: a multi-centre randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has a long history of use in treating depression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been introduced more recently to the treatment spectrum. Its cost-effectiveness has not been explored. METHOD: Forty-six right-handed people with severe depressive episodes referred for ECT were randomised to receive either ECT twice weekly or rTMS on consecutive weekdays. Health and other service use were recorded for retrospective periods of 3 months prior to initiation of treatment and during the 6 months following the end of allocated treatment. Costs were calculated for the treatment period and the subsequent 6 months, and comparisons made between groups after adjustment for any baseline differences. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted with incremental change on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) as the primary outcome measure, and quality-adjusted life years (based on SF6D-generated utility scores with societal weights) as secondary outcome, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves plotted. RESULTS: Based on the HRSD scores and other outcome measures, rTMS was not as effective as ECT. The cost of a single session of rTMS was lower than the cost of a session of ECT, but overall there were no treatment cost differences. In the treatment and 6-month follow-up periods combined, health and other service costs were not significantly different between the two groups. Informal care costs were higher for the rTMS group. Total treatment, service and informal care costs were also higher for the rTMS group. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated a very small probability that decision-makers would view rTMS as more cost-effective than ECT. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, some sample attrition and a relatively short follow-up period of 6 months for a chronic illness. Productivity losses could not be calculated.

5051,Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men: a Canadian perspective using Monte Carlo-based estimates,"OBJECTIVE: Recently generated randomized screening trial data have provided good evidence in favour of routine screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) to reduce AAA-related deaths in men aged 65 years and older. We developed an economic model that assessed the incremental cost-utility of AAA screening to help decision makers judge the relevance of a national screening program in Canada. METHODS: We constructed a 14 health state Markov model comparing 2 cohorts of 65-year-old men, where the first cohort was invited to attend screening for AAA using ultrasonography (US) and the second cohort followed the current practice of opportunistic detection. Lifetime outcomes included the life-years gained, AAA rupture avoided, AAA-related mortality, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. Transition probabilities were derived from a systematic review of the literature, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out to examine the effect of joint uncertainty in the variables of our analysis. The perspective adopted was that of the health care provider. RESULTS: Invitations to attend screening produced an undiscounted gain in life expectancy of 0.049 years and a gain in discounted QALY of 0.019 for an estimated incremental lifetime cost of CAN$118. The estimated incremental cost-utility ratio was CAN$6194 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval [CI] 1892-10 837). The numbers needed to invite to attend screening, and the numbers needed to screen to prevent 1 AAA-related death were 187 (95% CI 130-292) and 137 (95% CI 85-213), respectively. The acceptability curve showed a greater than 95% probability of the program's being cost-effective, and the model was robust to changes in the values of key parameters within plausible ranges. CONCLUSION: Our results support the economic viability of a national screening program for men reaching 65 years of age in Canada. More clinical studies are needed to define the role of screening in subgroups at high risk, especially in the female population.",2008-01-04041,18248702,Can J Surg,Bernard Montreuil,2008,51 / 1,23-34,No,18248702,"Bernard Montreuil; James Brophy; Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men: a Canadian perspective using Monte Carlo-based estimates, Can J Surg, 2008-Feb; 51(1):1488-2310; 23-34",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with ultrasonography vs. Current practice,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,6194,Canada,2005,6779.64
5052,Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of entecavir versus lamivudine in hepatitis BeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients,"BACKGROUND: As new treatment options for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) become available, evaluations of cost-effectiveness become important. Entecavir is a deoxyguanine nucleoside analogue approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2005 for HBV infection in adults with evidence of active viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase) or histologically active disease. Entecavir has demonstrated greater suppression of viral replication compared with lamivudine, but also has a relatively higher drug acquisition cost in the United States.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term health and economic impact of treating HBV with entecavir versus lamivudine in patients who are positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) based on the efficacy and safety results of the Phase 3, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, Benefits of Entecavir for Hepatitis B Liver Disease (BEHoLD).METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of entecavir compared with lamuvidine in suppressing HBV DNA to an undetectable level. Risks for compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were derived from the published Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis B Virus (REVEAL-HBV, 2006) study, a longitudinal (mean follow-up: 11.4 years) cohort study of community residents who were seropositive for the hepatitis B surface antigen; 85% of REVEAL-HBV participants were HBeAg-negative. To estimate future risks of CC, DC, and HCC, the REVEAL-HBV study's multivariate-adjusted relative risks of CC, DC, and HCC for 5 HBV DNA (viral load level) categories were applied to posttreatment HBV DNA levels obtained from the BEHoLD trial of 709 HBeAg-positive HBV patients treated with entecavir (n = 354) or lamivudine (n = 355). Entecavir and lamivudine were assigned annual costs of $7,365 and $2,604, respectively, based on the wholesale acquisition cost. Life expectancy for DC and HCC was estimated by the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy method. Other model parameter values, such as utilities and event medical costs, were derived from published sources. The joint uncertainty of projected event time distribution and treatment failure rates beyond the trial period were considered using probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) with 1,000 replicates. The analytic perspective was that of a U.S. third-party payer responsible for all direct health care expenditures.RESULTS: In the BEHoLD clinical trial (AI463022), subjects were predominantly male (75%), Asian (57%), or white (40%) with a mean age of 35 years. Entecavir was superior to lamivudine in the proportion of subjects who achieved undetectable HBV DNA (< 300 copies per mL) by polymerase- chain reaction assay at week 48 (69.1% vs. 39.8%, respectively) (P < 0.001). In the REVEAL-HBV study after statistical adjustment for age, gender, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption, rates of CC, DC, and HCC were associated with higher HBV DNA levels (e.g., compared with the reference category [< 300 copies per mL], adjusted hazard ratios for HCC were 1.2, 2.9, 9.5, and 15.2 for serum HBV DNA levels of 300-9,999, 10,000-99,999, 100,000-999,999, and e > or = 1 million copies per mL, respectively). In the reference case, for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 HBV patients aged 35 years, 52 weeks of entecavir treatment compared with lamivudine treatment avoided 71 cases of CC, 8 DC cases, and 42 HCC cases within 10 years, resulting in a 0.728 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain at an incremental cost of $2,350, with a 3% annual discount. The incremental cost of using entecavir was $3,230 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval [CI], $2,312-$4,528), with 99.3% of PSA-derived estimates below $5,000 per QALY. Results were robust and most sensitive to efficacy, drug cost, and treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that (1) the efficacy of entecavir after 1 year is sustainable and (2) liver disease risk levels from the REVEAL-HBV study population (a primarily HBeAg-negative group) adequately represent risk for a treated HBeAg-positive patient group, entecavir given for up to 10 years would be highly cost-effective in HBeAg-positive patients.",2008-01-04048,18240879,J Manag Care Pharm,Yong Yuan,2008,14 / 1,21-33,No,18240879,"Yong Yuan; Uchenna H Iloeje; Joel Hay; Sammy Saab; Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of entecavir versus lamivudine in hepatitis BeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients, J Manag Care Pharm, 2008 Jan-Feb; 14(1):1083-4087; 21-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Entecavir, 0.5 mg daily for 52 weeks vs. Lamivudine 100mg daily for 52 weeks",Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,3230,United States,2006,4146.62
5053,Cost-effectiveness of intensive exercise therapy directly following hospital discharge in patients with arthritis: results of a randomized controlled clinical trial,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of a 3-week intensive exercise training (IET) program directly following hospital discharge in patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Patients with arthritis who were admitted to the hospital because of a disease activity flare or for elective hip or knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to either the IET group or usual care (UC) group. Followup lasted 1 year. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived from Short Form 6D scores and a visual analog scale (VAS) rating personal health. Function-related outcome was measured using the Health Assessment Questionnaire, the McMaster Toronto Arthritis (MACTAR) Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire, and the Escola Paulista de Medicina Range of Motion scale (EPMROM). Costs were reported from a societal perspective. Differences in costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. RESULTS: Data from 85 patients (50 IET and 35 UC) could be used for health-economic analysis. VAS personal health-based QALYs were in favor of IET. Function-related outcome showed statistically significant improvements in favor of IET over the first 6 months, according to the MACTAR (P < 0.05) and the EPMROM (P < 0.01). At 1-year followup, IET was euro718 less per patient. The ICER showed a reduction in mean total costs per QALY. In 70% of cases the intervention was cost-saving. CONCLUSION: IET results in better quality of life at lower costs after 1 year. Thus, IET is the dominant strategy compared with UC. This highlights the need for implementation of IET after hospital discharge in patients with arthritis.",2008-01-04050,18240191,Arthritis Rheum,Yvette Bulthuis,2008,59 / 2,247-54,No,18240191,"Yvette Bulthuis; Sabrina Mohammad; Louise M A Braakman-Jansen; K Wiepke Drossaers-Bakker; Martin A F J van de Laar; Cost-effectiveness of intensive exercise therapy directly following hospital discharge in patients with arthritis: results of a randomized controlled clinical trial, Arthritis Rheum, 2008-Feb-15; 59(2):0004-3591; 247-54",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,3-week intensive exercise program directly following discharge vs. Standard usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,20100,Euro,2003,32005.85
5054,Economic evaluation of folic acid food fortification in The Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Folic acid intake before and during pregnancy reduces neural tube defects (NTD). Therefore, several countries have enriched bulk food with folic acid resulting in a 26-48% decrease in the prevalence of NTDs. In 2000, the Dutch Health Council advised against folic acid enrichment based on literature research; yet formal cost-effectiveness information was absent. We designed our study to estimate cost-effectiveness of folic acid food fortification in the Netherlands. METHOD: Prevalence of NTD at birth, life-time costs of care, and folic acid fortification costs were estimated using Dutch registrations, Dutch guidelines for costing, (inter)national literature and expert opinions. Both net cost per discounted life year gained and net cost per discounted quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were estimated for the base case and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base case and most sensitivity analyses, folic acid enrichment was estimated to be cost-saving. Bulk food fortification with folic acid remains cost-effective as long as enrichment costs do not exceed euro5.5 million (threshold at euro20 000 per QALY). CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that folic acid fortification of bulk food to prevent cases of NTD in newborns might be a cost-saving intervention in the Netherlands. Additionally, besides the evidence that folic acid reduces the number of NTDs, there are indications that folic acid is associated with the prevention of other birth defects, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

5055,Are N-of-1 trials an economically viable option to improve access to selected high cost medications? The Australian experience,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the economic viability of N-of-1 trials for improving access to selected high cost medications in Australia. METHODS: Cost and effectiveness estimates were derived from two N-of-1 trials conducted by The University of Queensland from 2003 to 2005-celecoxib versus sustained-release paracetamol for osteoarthritis in a general practice setting and gabapentin versus placebo for chronic neuropathic pain in a hospital setting. Effectiveness was determined by the proportion of responders to each medication. The costs of trials were offset against the savings generated by subsequent changes in prescribing. Decision analysis models with semi-Markov processes were used to compare different scenarios of N-of-1 trials versus usual care. RESULTS: The fixed cost of performing N-of-1 trials was approximately AUS$23,000 for each trial and the variable cost was approximately AUS$1300 per participant. Clinical outcomes favored celecoxib over paracetamol in 17% of participants and gabapentin over placebo in 24% of participants. Modeling these results showed that the cost-offsets from efficient use of medications were less than the cost of running a trial; however, the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were AUS$6,896 and AUS$29,550 for the gabapentin/placebo and celecoxib/paracetamol trials, respectively, over a 5-year horizon. Key factors affecting the viability were the time horizon modeled, the variable cost per participant, the probability of response to the intervention medication, and rates of use in nonresponders and the usual care alternative.

The cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed/cisplatin versus alternative treatments was also examined. METHODS: Two cost-effectiveness analyses were designed to model best survival outcome over time for a number of patient cohorts. First, trial-based patient-level data were utilized and resource use was costed for the study arm and comparator. A second cost-effectiveness analysis then compared the mean costs and outcomes associated with pemetrexed/cisplatin with the most commonly used (unlicensed) regimens in the United Kingdom-mitomycin-C, vinblastine, and cisplatin (MVP); vinorelbine; and active symptom control-using trial-based data and data extrapolated from a review of the literature. RESULTS: The total pemetrexed/cisplatin cost per patient varied between pound8779 and pound9020 for all cohorts studied in model 1. Average life-years gained per patient were between 0.20 and 0.28. Quality-adjusted life-years, based on mean and median survival, ranged from 0.13 to 0.31.

5061,Economic evaluation of major knee surgery with recombinant activated factor VII in hemophilia patients with high titer inhibitors and advanced knee arthropathy: exploratory results via literature-based modeling,"OBJECTIVES: People with severe hemophilia suffer from frequent intra-articular hemorrhages, leading to pain, swelling, reduced flexion, and arthropathy. Elective orthopedic surgery using factor VIII (FVIII) replacement to prevent uncontrolled bleeding has been endorsed as an effective treatment option for patients with severe or advanced hemophilic arthropathy. These surgeries reduce pain, restore mobility and function, and reduce the frequency of recurrent joint bleeds. Unfortunately, some patients with hemophilia develop inhibitors to FVIII, which neutralize FVIII activity and render the use of even massive amounts of FVIII replacement ineffective and surgery very risky. For this reason, elective surgical procedures in high-titer inhibitor patients had largely been abandoned until the introduction of new agents, such as recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark). rFVIIa has been shown effective for prophylaxis during elective surgery and has therefore improved the feasibility of orthopedic surgery in hemophilia patients with high-titer inhibitors. The present research explored, from a modified US payer perspective, the direct economic and quality of life benefits of four different elective knee surgeries (total knee replacement [TKR], knee arthrodesis [KA], proximal tibial osteotomy, and distal femoral osteotomy) with rFVIIa coverage in hemophilia patients with high-titer inhibitors. METHODS: An exploratory literature-based life-table model was developed to compare the direct medical costs and quality of life of two hypothetical cohorts of high-titer inhibitor patients with frequent bleeding episodes: one undergoing and the other not undergoing elective knee surgery. Knee surgery costs included perioperative rFVIIa costs, inpatient and rehabilitation care, and repeat procedures due to surgery failure, prosthesis loosening or deep infection. Based on efficacy studies, knee surgery was assumed to reduce mean annual bleeding episodes at the affected joint from 9.13 to 1.64. The cost of managing each bleeding episode was estimated at $15 298. Thus, by reducing bleeding episodes, surgery was expected to result in related cost offsets. All costs were expressed in 2006 US dollars. Surgery was also assumed to result in gains in quality of life by reducing pain and reducing bleeding episodes. The impact of pain reduction on quality of life and utility was estimated by simulating EQ-5D scores for a typical patient with and without knee surgery. RESULTS: Based on the model, average knee surgery costs are predicted to range from a low of $694 000 (for KA) to a high of $855 000 (for TKR). However, knee surgery is also expected to reduce the subsequent number of bleeding episodes and resultant costs, leading to long-term costs savings. Due to improvement in pain levels, surgical patients are expected to experience improvements in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Thus, surgery appears to be the preferred strategy (i.e., saves costs and increases QALYs). Based on the assumptions used in the model, the initial cost of knee surgery was offset during the 8th and 10th years for KA and TKR, respectively, with intermediate break-even time for the other surgeries. As expected, cost savings and gains in QALYs increased over time, as well as the cost effective ness of knee surgery. Specifically, the cost per QALY with KA and TKR fell under $50 000/QALY during the 6th and 8th years, respectively, with intermediate time for the other surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: The present exploratory analysis is based on the long-term extrapolation of data from a small number of patients without inhibitors and short-term studies. It suggests that major knee surgery utilizing rFVIIa in hemophilia patients with inhibitors may be cost-effective on average, with expected cost savings apparent within a decade of knee surgery.

The present research explored, from a modified US payer perspective, the direct economic and quality of life benefits of four different elective knee surgeries (total knee replacement [TKR], knee arthrodesis [KA], proximal tibial osteotomy, and distal femoral osteotomy) with rFVIIa coverage in hemophilia patients with high-titer inhibitors. METHODS: An exploratory literature-based life-table model was developed to compare the direct medical costs and quality of life of two hypothetical cohorts of high-titer inhibitor patients with frequent bleeding episodes: one undergoing and the other not undergoing elective knee surgery. Knee surgery costs included perioperative rFVIIa costs, inpatient and rehabilitation care, and repeat procedures due to surgery failure, prosthesis loosening or deep infection. Based on efficacy studies, knee surgery was assumed to reduce mean annual bleeding episodes at the affected joint from 9.13 to 1.64. The cost of managing each bleeding episode was estimated at $15 298. Thus, by reducing bleeding episodes, surgery was expected to result in related cost offsets. All costs were expressed in 2006 US dollars. Surgery was also assumed to result in gains in quality of life by reducing pain and reducing bleeding episodes. The impact of pain reduction on quality of life and utility was estimated by simulating EQ-5D scores for a typical patient with and without knee surgery. RESULTS: Based on the model, average knee surgery costs are predicted to range from a low of $694 000 (for KA) to a high of $855 000 (for TKR). However, knee surgery is also expected to reduce the subsequent number of bleeding episodes and resultant costs, leading to long-term costs savings. Due to improvement in pain levels, surgical patients are expected to experience improvements in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Thus, surgery appears to be the preferred strategy (i.e., saves costs and increases QALYs). Based on the assumptions used in the model, the initial cost of knee surgery was offset during the 8th and 10th years for KA and TKR, respectively, with intermediate break-even time for the other surgeries. As expected, cost savings and gains in QALYs increased over time, as well as the cost effective ness of knee surgery. Specifically, the cost per QALY with KA and TKR fell under $50 000/QALY during the 6th and 8th years, respectively, with intermediate time for the other surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: The present exploratory analysis is based on the long-term extrapolation of data from a small number of patients without inhibitors and short-term studies. It suggests that major knee surgery utilizing rFVIIa in hemophilia patients with inhibitors may be cost-effective on average, with expected cost savings apparent within a decade of knee surgery.

5064,Economic evaluation of major knee surgery with recombinant activated factor VII in hemophilia patients with high titer inhibitors and advanced knee arthropathy: exploratory results via literature-based modeling,"OBJECTIVES: People with severe hemophilia suffer from frequent intra-articular hemorrhages, leading to pain, swelling, reduced flexion, and arthropathy. Elective orthopedic surgery using factor VIII (FVIII) replacement to prevent uncontrolled bleeding has been endorsed as an effective treatment option for patients with severe or advanced hemophilic arthropathy. These surgeries reduce pain, restore mobility and function, and reduce the frequency of recurrent joint bleeds. Unfortunately, some patients with hemophilia develop inhibitors to FVIII, which neutralize FVIII activity and render the use of even massive amounts of FVIII replacement ineffective and surgery very risky. For this reason, elective surgical procedures in high-titer inhibitor patients had largely been abandoned until the introduction of new agents, such as recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark). rFVIIa has been shown effective for prophylaxis during elective surgery and has therefore improved the feasibility of orthopedic surgery in hemophilia patients with high-titer inhibitors.

A US societal cost-effectiveness of R-CVP versus CVP is estimated for a representative 50-year-old patient. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival are based on a randomized Phase III trial. Costs are estimated using Medicare reimbursement rates and published drug price data, and include drug and administration costs, adverse events, treatment of relapses, and end-of-life care. Utility estimates are derived from the literature and a 3% discount rate is employed. Mean overall survival is projected to be 1.51 years longer for patients assigned to R-CVP versus CVP. The cost per quality-adjusted year of life gained is $28,565. The utility associated with stable or progressive disease and the unit drug cost of rituximab most influence the findings.

5066,"Cost-effectiveness of chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril as first-step treatment for patients with hypertension: an analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT)","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatments for hypertension. BACKGROUND: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that first-line treatment with lisinopril or amlodipine was not significantly superior to chlorthalidone in terms of the primary endpoint, so differences in costs may be critical for optimizing decision-making. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using bootstrap resampling to evaluate uncertainty. RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, chlorthalidone was always least expensive (mean $4,802 less than amlodipine, $3,700 less than lisinopril). Amlodipine provided more life-years (LYs) than chlorthalidone in 84% of bootstrap samples (mean 37 days) at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $48,400 per LY gained. Lisinopril provided fewer LYs than chlorthalidone in 55% of bootstrap samples (mean 7-day loss) despite a higher cost. At a threshold of $50,000 per LY gained, amlodipine was preferred in 50%, chlorthalidone in 40%, and lisinopril in 10% of bootstrap samples, but these findings were highly sensitive to the cost of amlodipine and the cost-effectiveness threshold chosen. Incorporating quality of life did not appreciably alter the results. Overall, no reasonable combination of assumptions led to 1 treatment being preferred in over 90% of bootstrap samples. CONCLUSIONS: Initial treatment with chlorthalidone is less expensive than lisinopril or amlodipine, but amlodipine provided a nonsignificantly greater survival benefit and may be a cost-effective alternative.

5068,Value of information analysis used to determine the necessity of additional research: MR imaging in acute knee trauma as an example,"PURPOSE: To help guide future outcomes research regarding the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with acute knee trauma in an emergency department setting, with use of prospective data from a randomized clinical trial and value of information analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 189 patients (123 male, 66 female; mean age, 33.4 years) were randomly assigned to undergo radiography alone (n = 93) or radiography and MR imaging (n = 96). Institutional review board approval and informed consent (parental consent for minors) were obtained. During 6 months of follow-up, data on quality of life and 39 cost parameters were collected. Value-of-information analysis was used to estimate the expected benefit of future research to eliminate the decision uncertainty that remained after trial completion. In addition, the parameters that were responsible for most of the decision uncertainty were identified, the expected benefits of various study designs were evaluated, and the optimal sample size was estimated. RESULTS: Only three parameters were responsible for most of the decision uncertainty: number of quality-adjusted life-years, cost of an overnight hospital stay, and friction costs. A study in which data on these three parameters are gathered would have an optimal sample size of 3500 patients per arm and would be expected to result in a societal benefit of euro 5.6 million or 70 quality-adjusted life-years.

5080,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Helicobacter pylori screening in prevention of gastric cancer in Chinese,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the costs and effectiveness associated with no screening, Helicobacter pylori serology screening, and the 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for gastric cancer in the Chinese population. METHODS: A Markov model simulation was carried out in Singaporean Chinese at 40 years of age (n = 478,500) from the perspective of public healthcare providers. The main outcome measures were costs, number of gastric cancer cases prevented, life-years saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from the screening age to death, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), which were compared among the three strategies. The uncertainty surrounding ICERs was addressed by scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: The ICER of serology screening versus no screening was $25,881 per QALY gained (95 percent confidence interval (95 percent CI), $5,700 to $120,000). The ICER of UBT versus no screening was $53,602 per QALY gained (95 percent CI, $16,000 to $230,000). ICER of UBT versus serology screening was $470,000 per QALY gained, for which almost all random samples of the ICERs distributed above $50,000 per QALY.

5082,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in France,"OBJECTIVES: A vaccine to prevent diseases due to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 is now available in France. The objective of this study was to assess the health and economic impact in France of implementing a quadrivalent HPV vaccine alongside existing screening practices versus screening alone. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection incorporating screening and vaccination, was adapted to the French context. A vaccine that would prevent 100 percent of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18-associated diseases, with lifetime duration and 80 percent coverage, given to girls at age 14 in conjunction with current screening was compared with screening alone. Results were analyzed from both a direct healthcare cost perspective (DCP) and a third-party payer perspective (TPP). Indirect costs such as productivity loss were not taken into account in this analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost per life-year gained from vaccination was euro12,429 (TPP) and euro20,455 (DCP). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for the introduction of HPV vaccination alongside the French cervical cancer screening program was euro8,408 (TPP) and euro13,809 (DCP). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that cost-effectiveness was stable, but was most sensitive to the discount rate used for costs and benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the commonly accepted threshold of euro50,000 per QALY, these analyses support the fact that adding a quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the current screening program in France is a cost-effective strategy for reducing the burden of cervical cancer, precancerous lesions, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.",2008-01-04079,18218164,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Christine Bergeron,2008,24 / 1,10-9,No,18218164,"Christine Bergeron; Nathalie Largeron; Ruth McAllister; Patrice Mathevet; Vanessa Remy; Cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in France, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2008; 24(1):0266-4623; 10-9",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Quadrivalent HPV vaccine, plus cervical cancer screening vs. Cervical cancer screening only",Not Stated,14 Years,14 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,1.50,13809,Euro,2005,22780.7

5084,An economic evaluation of sevelamer in patients new to dialysis,"OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of this study was to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with treatment with sevelamer for hyperphosphataemia compared with calcium-based binders. METHODS: Using published data on mortality and hospitalisation rates, a Markov model was developed to predict health outcomes and associated costs for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia using either sevelamer or calcium binders in chronic kidney disease patients who had recently started haemodialysis. Patient outcomes were modelled for 5 years, and incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs) were calculated for sevelamer relative to calcium carbonate and calcium acetate binders. The perspective adopted was that of the UK National Health Service. RESULTS: The total 5-year discounted treatment cost for patients treated with sevelamer is pound 24,216, while for the calcium carbonate group total cost was pound 17,695. This is an incremental cost of pound 6521 per sevelamer-treated patient over 5 years. Patients receiving sevelamer can be expected to experience 2.70 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to 2.46 for those treated with calcium carbonate (i.e. an incremental gain of 0.24 QALYs). This results in an incremental cost per QALY of pound 27,120 and an incremental cost per life year gained of pound 15,508. Results were similar with calcium acetate.

5085,Primary care intervention to reduce alcohol misuse ranking its health impact and cost effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening and behavioral counseling interventions in primary care to reduce alcohol misuse. This study was designed to develop a standardized rating for the clinically preventable burden and cost effectiveness of complying with that recommendation that would allow comparisons across many recommended services. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from 1992 through 2004 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and cost-effectiveness studies was completed in 2005. Clinically preventable burden (CPB) was calculated as the product of effectiveness times the alcohol-attributable fraction of both mortality and morbidity (measured in quality-adjusted life years or QALYs), for all relevant conditions. Cost effectiveness from both the societal perspective and the health-system perspective was estimated. These analyses were completed in 2006. RESULTS: The calculated CPB was 176,000 QALYs saved over the lifetime of a birth cohort of 4,000,000, with a range in sensitivity analysis from -43% to +94% (primarily due to variation in estimates of effectiveness). Screening and brief counseling was cost-saving from the societal perspective and had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $1755/QALY saved from the health-system perspective. Sensitivity analysis indicates that from both perspectives the service is very cost effective and may be cost saving.

5092,Long-acting methylphenidate-OROS in youths with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder suboptimally controlled with immediate-release methylphenidate: a study of cost effectiveness in The Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common mental health disorder in youths. Stimulants are the drugs of first choice in the treatment of ADHD. It has been suggested that full costs associated with the treatment of ADHD may be reduced by once-daily administration regimens of stimulants. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of treatment with long-acting methylphenidate osmotic release oral system (OROS) [Concerta] for youths with ADHD for whom treatment with immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate is suboptimal. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a Markov model to obtain an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The analysis covered 10 years, with a Markov cycle of 1 day. Costs (in 2005 euros ) included medication, consultations and treatment interventions, and additional costs for attending special education. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used as the effectiveness measure. Outcome probabilities were taken from the medical literature and an expert panel of five child psychiatrists and paediatricians. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the base-case estimate. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to estimate a worst- and best-case ICER. RESULTS: The ICER of methylphenidate-OROS treatment in youths with ADHD for whom treatment with IR methylphenidate is suboptimal was euro 2004 per QALY. Total costs after 10 years were euro 15,739 for the IR methylphenidate pathway and euro 16,015 for the methylphenidate-OROS pathway. In the univariate sensitivity analysis, the ICER was sensitive to changes in resource use and the probability of stopping stimulant treatment in favour of IR methylphenidate. An ICER of 0 was reached with a 6.2% price reduction of methylphenidate-OROS. CONCLUSION: Methylphenidate-OROS is a cost-effective treatment for youths with ADHD for whom treatment with IR methylphenidate is suboptimal. Higher medication costs of methylphenidate-OROS were compensated for by savings on resource use, yielding similar 10-year costs compared with treatment with IR methylphenidate. Our analysis is sensitive to both clinical parameters and (differences in) resource utilization and costs between the groups modelled, warranting further research within clinical trials and observational databases, and into the full scope of costs.",2008-01-04108,18193926,CNS Drugs,Adrianne Faber,2008,22 / 2,157-70,No,18193926,"Adrianne Faber; Michel van Agthoven; Luuk J Kalverdijk; Hilde Tobi; Lolkje T W de Jong-van den Berg; Lieven Annemans; Maarten J Postma; Long-acting methylphenidate-OROS in youths with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder suboptimally controlled with immediate-release methylphenidate: a study of cost effectiveness in The Netherlands, CNS Drugs, 2008; 22(2):1172-7047; 157-70",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Long-acting methylphenidate osmotic release oral system (36mg daily) vs. Immediate release methylphenidate,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,2004,Euro,2005,3306
5093,Cost effectiveness of the determination of autoantibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide in the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (aCCP) in the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A Markov model was used to model 10-year progression of RA in patients first diagnosed with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) and to estimate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of using aCCP additionally to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. The impact of later diagnosis and treatment due to non-use of aCCP was modelled as increased Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression. Utilities were assigned to HAQ states for calculating QALYs. Uncertainty was analysed using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (Monte Carlo simulation). RESULTS: Baseline ICER was euro 930/QALY. Univariate sensitivity analyses identified the impact of later diagnosis on HAQ progression as a major source of uncertainty, resulting in an ICER range from ""dominance"" to euro 153 092/QALY, compared with a maximum ICER of euro4870/QALY for other variables. Monte Carlo simulation resulted in a 95% uncertainty interval from euro 3537/QALY (dominance) to euro 5429/QALY; when indirect costs were considered, Monte Carlo simulation resulted in a 95% uncertainty interval from euro 78 115/QALY (dominance) to -euro 23 444/QALY (dominance). CONCLUSIONS: Using aCCP in the diagnosis of RA in patients with UA is likely to be cost effective compared with using ACR criteria alone.

Comparison of clinical trial and clinical practice data,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with infliximab (Remicade) in Spain for up to 40 years. METHODS: A previously published disease model was adapted to the Spanish setting using resource consumption from a cross-sectional burden of an illness study in 601 patients in Spain. Cost-effectiveness estimates were based on a placebo-controlled clinical trial as well as an open clinical study in Spain. In the model, patients with insufficient response to treatment at 12 weeks [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) <4 or > or =50% reduction] discontinue treatment. The results are presented in 2005 euros, from societal and health-care payer perspectives. RESULTS: In the societal perspective, infliximab treatment dominates standard treatment in both analyses. In the perspective of the health-care system, with the assumption that, over the long term, functional ability of patients on treatment would decline at half the natural rate, the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated at EUR 22 519 (double-blind trial) and EUR 8866 (open study). Assuming that patients' function on treatment remains stable, the cost-effectiveness ratios are EUR 15 157 and EUR 5307, respectively. Under the most conservative assumption (no effect of treatment on progression), the ratios are EUR 31 721 and EUR 13 659, respectively. In addition, the results are sensitive to the time horizon and discontinuation rates.

METHODS: A previously published disease model was adapted to the Spanish setting using resource consumption from a cross-sectional burden of an illness study in 601 patients in Spain. Cost-effectiveness estimates were based on a placebo-controlled clinical trial as well as an open clinical study in Spain. In the model, patients with insufficient response to treatment at 12 weeks [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) <4 or > or =50% reduction] discontinue treatment. The results are presented in 2005 euros, from societal and health-care payer perspectives. RESULTS: In the societal perspective, infliximab treatment dominates standard treatment in both analyses. In the perspective of the health-care system, with the assumption that, over the long term, functional ability of patients on treatment would decline at half the natural rate, the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated at EUR 22 519 (double-blind trial) and EUR 8866 (open study). Assuming that patients' function on treatment remains stable, the cost-effectiveness ratios are EUR 15 157 and EUR 5307, respectively. Under the most conservative assumption (no effect of treatment on progression), the ratios are EUR 31 721 and EUR 13 659, respectively. In addition, the results are sensitive to the time horizon and discontinuation rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that infliximab therapy for patients with active AS should be cost-effective both in the societal perspective (dominating) and in the perspective of the health-care system (ranges from EUR 5300 to EUR 32 000 per QALY) in Spain.",2008-01-04115,18189197,Scand J Rheumatol,G Kobelt,2008,37 / 1,62-71,No,18189197,"G Kobelt; P Sobocki; J Mulero; J Gratacos; E Collantes-Estevez; J Braun; The cost-effectiveness of infliximab in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in Spain.
