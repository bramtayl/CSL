12601,"Economic implications of using bendamustine, alemtuzumab, or chlorambucil as a first-line therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the US: a cost-effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND: The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using bendamustine versus alemtuzumab or bendamustine versus chlorambucil as a first-line therapy in patients with Binet stage B or C chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the US. METHODS: A discrete event simulation of the disease course of CLL was developed to evaluate the economic implications of single-agent treatment with bendamustine, alemtuzumab, or chlorambucil, which are indicated for a treatment-naive patient population with Binet stage B or C CLL. Data from clinical trials were used to create a simulated patient population, risk equations for progression-free survival and survival post disease progression, response rates, and rates of adverse events. Costs from a US health care payer perspective in 2012 US dollars, survival (life years), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated over a patient's lifetime; all were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Compared with alemtuzumab, bendamustine was considered to be a dominant treatment providing greater benefit (6.10 versus 5.37 life years and 4.02 versus 3.45 QALYs) at lower cost ($78,776 versus $121,441). Compared with chlorambucil, bendamustine was associated with higher costs ($78,776 versus $42,337) but with improved health outcomes (6.10 versus 5.21 life years and 4.02 versus 3.30 QALYs), resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $40,971 per life year gained and $50,619 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Bendamustine is expected to provide cost savings and greater health benefit than alemtuzumab in treatment-naive patients with CLL.

12603,Cost-effectiveness analysis of HLA-B*5801 testing in preventing allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN in Thai population,"BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), caused by allopurinol therapy, are strongly associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), HLA-B*5801. Identification of HLA-B*5801 genotype before prescribing allopurinol offers the possibility of avoiding allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN. As there is a paucity of evidence about economic value of such testing, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of HLA-B*5801 testing compared with usual care (no genetic testing) before allopurinol administration in Thailand. METHODS AND FINDING: A decision analytical and Markov model was used to estimate life time costs and outcomes represented as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The model was populated with relevant information of the association between gene and allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN, test characteristics, costs, and epidemiologic data for Thailand from a societal perspective. Input data were obtained from the literature and a retrospective database analysis. The results were expressed as incremental cost per QALY gained. A base-case analysis was performed for patients at age 30. A series of sensitivity analyses including scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were constructed to explore the robustness of the findings. Based on a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients, the incremental total cost was 923,919 THB (USD 29,804) and incremental QALY was 5.89 with an ICER of 156,937.04 THB (USD 5,062) per QALY gained. The cost of gout management, incidence of SJS/TEN, case fatality rate of SJS/TEN, and cost of genetic testing are considered very influential parameters on the cost-effectiveness value of HLA-B*5801 testing. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic testing for HLA-B*5801 before allopurinol administration is considered a highly potential cost-effective intervention in Thailand. The findings are sensitive to a number of factors. In addition to cost-effectiveness findings, consideration of other factors including ethical, legal, and social implications is needed for an informed policy decision making.",2014-01-15187,24732692,PLoS One,Surasak Saokaew,2014,9 / 4,e94294,No,24732692,"Surasak Saokaew; Wichittra Tassaneeyakul; Ratree Maenthaisong; Nathorn Chaiyakunapruk; Cost-effectiveness analysis of HLA-B*5801 testing in preventing allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN in Thai population, PLoS One , ; 9(4):1932-6203; e94294",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,HLA-B*5801 test vs. Standard/Usual Care,Simulated population with base case age of 30 years old.,30 Years,30 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,156937,Thailand,2013,5686.42
12604,Evaluation of the clinical and cost effectiveness of intermediate care clinics for diabetes (ICCD): a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Configuring high quality care for the rapidly increasing number of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major challenge worldwide for both providers and commissioners. In the UK, about two thirds of people with T2D are managed entirely in primary care, with wide variation in management strategies and achievement of targets. Pay for performance, introduced in 2004, initially resulted in improvements but disparities exist in ethnic minorities and the improvements are levelling off. Community based, intermediate care clinics for diabetes (ICCDs) were considered one solution and are functioning across the UK. However, there is no randomised trial evidence for the effectiveness of such clinics. TRIAL DESIGN, METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a cluster-randomised trial, involving 3 primary care trusts, with 49 general practices randomised to usual care (n=25) or intervention (ICCDs; n=24). All eligible adult patients with T2D were invited; 1997 were recruited and 1280 followed-up after 18-months intervention. PRIMARY OUTCOME: achievement of all three of the NICE targets [(HbA1c </= 7.0%/53 mmol/mol; Blood Pressure <140/80 mmHg; cholesterol <154 mg/dl (4 mmol/l)]. PRIMARY OUTCOME was achieved in 14.3% in the intervention arm vs. 9.3% in the control arm (p=0.059 after adjustment for covariates). The odds ratio (95% CI) for achieving primary outcome in the intervention group was 1.56 (0.98, 2.49). Primary care and community clinic costs were significantly higher in the intervention group, but there were no significant differences in hospital costs or overall healthcare costs. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of + pound7,778 per QALY gained, indicated ICCD was marginally more expensive at producing health gain. CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate care clinics can contribute to improving target achievement in patients with diabetes. Further work is needed to investigate the optimal scale and organisational structure of ICCD services and whether, over time, their role may change as skill levels in primary care increase.

12605,Economic evaluation of aclidinium bromide in the management of moderate to severe COPD: an analysis over 5 years,"PURPOSE: Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting muscarinic antagonistic used in maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A model-based health economic study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of aclidinium 400 mug bid as an alternative to tiotropium 18 mug od for this indication in the US. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS IN THIS MODEL REFLECT THOSE IN THE ACLIDINIUM CLINICAL STUDIES: age >40 years, stable moderate-to-severe COPD, current or ex-smokers (>10 pack-years), post-salbutamol forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) >/=30% and <80% of predicted normal value, and FEV1/forced vital capacity <70%. The model consists of five main health states indicating severity of COPD and the level of utility, resource use, and costs. Treatment efficacy over 5 years was modeled using FEV1% predicted; a network meta-analysis comparing aclidinium and tiotropium was used to estimate disease progression during the first 24 weeks, and results from the UPLIFT trial were used for time points after 24 weeks. Quality of life was assessed using utility scores in US patients from the UPLIFT trial. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Over 5 years, QALYs were 3.50 for aclidinium versus 3.49 for tiotropium; life years accumulated were 4.52 for both. In this economic model, aclidinium versus tiotropium showed marginally fewer exacerbations (3.364 versus 3.390, respectively) and mean total health care costs (US$126,274 versus US$128,591, respectively). In all scenario analyses performed (discount factors of 0% and 6% for benefits and costs; time horizon of 1 year; mapping St George's Respiratory Questionnaire to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions; excluding pharmacy costs, COPD-related cost only; cost of exacerbations; including ACCORD II trial in the network meta-analysis), aclidinium was associated with lower costs and marginally greater QALYs versus tiotropium.

12606,The cost-effectiveness of wound-edge protection devices compared to standard care in reducing surgical site infection after laparotomy: an economic evaluation alongside the ROSSINI trial,"BACKGROUND: Wound-edge protection devices (WEPDs) have been used in surgery for more than 40 years to reduce surgical site infection (SSI). No economic evaluation of WEPDs against any comparator has ever been conducted. The aim of the paper was to assess whether WEPDs are cost-effective in reducing SSI compared to standard care alone in the United Kingdom. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside the ROSSINI trial. The study perspective was that of the UK National Health Service and the time horizon was 30 days post-operatively. The study was conducted in 21 UK hospitals. 760 patients undergoing laparotomy were randomised to either WEPD or standard care and 735 were included in the primary analysis. The main economic outcome was cost-effectiveness based on incremental cost ( pound) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Patients in the WEPD arm accessed health care worth pound5,420 on average and gained 0.02131 QALYs, compared to pound5,130 and 0.02133 QALYs gained in the standard care arm. The WEPD strategy was more costly and equally effective compared to standard care, but there was significant uncertainty around incremental costs and QALYs. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to suggest that WEPDs can be considered a cost effective device to reduce SSI. Their continued use is a waste of limited health care resources.",2014-01-15190,24748154,PLoS One,Adrian Gheorghe,2014,9 / 4,e95595,No,24748154,"Adrian Gheorghe; Tracy E Roberts; Thomas D Pinkney; David C Bartlett; Dion Morton; Melanie Calvert; West Midlands Research Collabora; The cost-effectiveness of wound-edge protection devices compared to standard care in reducing surgical site infection after laparotomy: an economic evaluation alongside the ROSSINI trial, PLoS One , ; 9(4):1932-6203; e95595",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Wound-edge protection devices vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,1 Month,Not Stated,Not Stated,-14500000,United Kingdom,2011,-26765298.91
12607,"Expanded HIV testing in low-prevalence, high-income countries: a cost-effectiveness analysis for the United Kingdom","OBJECTIVE: In many high-income countries with low HIV prevalence, significant numbers of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) remain undiagnosed. Identification of PLHIV via HIV testing offers timely access to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and decreases HIV transmission. We estimated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HIV testing in the United Kingdom (UK), where 25% of PLHIV are estimated to be undiagnosed. DESIGN: We developed a dynamic compartmental model to analyze strategies to expand HIV testing and treatment in the UK, with particular focus on men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), and individuals from HIV-endemic countries. METHODS: We estimated HIV prevalence, incidence, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health care costs over 10 years, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Annual HIV testing of all adults could avert 5% of new infections, even with no behavior change following HIV diagnosis because of earlier ART initiation, or up to 18% if risky behavior is halved. This strategy costs pound67,000- pound106,000/QALY gained. Providing annual testing only to MSM, PWID, and people from HIV-endemic countries, and one-time testing for all other adults, prevents 4-15% of infections, requires one-fourth as many tests to diagnose each PLHIV, and costs pound17,500/QALY gained. Augmenting this program with increased ART access could add 145,000 QALYs to the population over 10 years, at pound26,800/QALY gained.

METHODS: We estimated HIV prevalence, incidence, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health care costs over 10 years, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Annual HIV testing of all adults could avert 5% of new infections, even with no behavior change following HIV diagnosis because of earlier ART initiation, or up to 18% if risky behavior is halved. This strategy costs pound67,000- pound106,000/QALY gained. Providing annual testing only to MSM, PWID, and people from HIV-endemic countries, and one-time testing for all other adults, prevents 4-15% of infections, requires one-fourth as many tests to diagnose each PLHIV, and costs pound17,500/QALY gained. Augmenting this program with increased ART access could add 145,000 QALYs to the population over 10 years, at pound26,800/QALY gained.

12614,Economic evaluation of SQ-standardized grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (Grazax((R))) in children,"BACKGROUND: Grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis is a common allergic respiratory disorder affecting over 20% of the UK population in terms of quality of life and sleep, work, and school patterns. The SQ-standardized grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (AIT) has been demonstrated as a disease-modifying treatment which gives a sustained effect even after completion of a treatment course. The objective of this study was to provide an economic assessment of whether treatment with the SQ-standardized grass AIT, Grazax((R)) (Phleum pratense) in combination with symptomatic medications is preferable to the standard of care using symptomatic medications only. The analysis was performed for children with grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis, with or without concomitant asthma, in the UK. METHODS: The model evaluated the two treatment regimens in a cohort of 1,000 children from a payer's perspective. Treatment was modeled in terms of management of symptoms, impact on resource use, and development of allergic asthma. The analysis modeled the use of SQ-standardized grass AIT and the sustained effects of treatment over a 9-year time horizon (ie, 3 years of treatment, with modeled long-term benefits). Data inputs were drawn from a recent clinical trial, published studies, and databases. RESULTS: SQ-standardized grass AIT improves patient outcomes, generating an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of pound12,168. This is below commonly accepted thresholds in the UK. CONCLUSION: The resulting incremental cost per QALY falls below commonly accepted willingness to pay thresholds. Therefore, the SQ-standardized grass AIT is a cost-effective option for the treatment of grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis in the UK pediatric population.",2014-01-15203,24812522,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Sarah Ronaldson,2014,6 /,187-96,No,24812522,"Sarah Ronaldson; Matthew Taylor; Peter G Bech; Ruth Shenton; Albrecht Bufe; Economic evaluation of SQ-standardized grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (Grazax((R))) in children, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 6():1178-6981; 187-96",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Treatment with the SQ-standardized grass AIT, Grazax® in combination with symptomatic medications vs. Symptomatic medications only",Not Stated,10 Years,10 Years,Not Stated,Full,9 Years,3.50,3.50,12168,United Kingdom,2012,21745.01
12615,The cost-utility of CT angiography and conventional angiography for people presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal imaging strategy for ICH incorporating CTA or DSA with and without a NCCT risk stratification algorithm. METHODS: A Markov model included costs, outcomes, prevalence of a vascular lesion, and the sensitivity and specificity of a risk stratification algorithm from the literature. The four imaging strategies were: (a) CTA screening of the entire cohort; (b) CTA only in those where NCCT suggested a high or indeterminate likelihood of a lesion; (c) DSA screening of the entire cohort and (d) DSA only for those with a high or indeterminate suspicion of a lesion following NCCT. Branch d was the comparator. RESULTS: Age of the cohort and the probability of an underlying lesion influenced the choice of optimal imaging strategy. With a low suspicion for a lesion (<12%), branch (a) was the optimal strategy for a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. Branch (a) remained the optimal strategy in younger people (<35 years) with a risk below 15%. If the probability of a lesion was >15%, branch (b) became preferred strategy. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that branch (b) was the optimal choice 70-72% of the time over varying willingness-to-pay values.

12618,The hepatitis C cascade of care: identifying priorities to improve clinical outcomes,"BACKGROUND: As highly effective hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies emerge, data are needed to inform the development of interventions to improve HCV treatment rates. We used simulation modeling to estimate the impact of loss to follow-up on HCV treatment outcomes and to identify intervention strategies likely to provide good value for the resources invested in them. METHODS: We used a Monte Carlo state-transition model to simulate a hypothetical cohort of chronically HCV-infected individuals recently screened positive for serum HCV antibody. We simulated four hypothetical intervention strategies (linkage to care; treatment initiation; integrated case management; peer navigator) to improve HCV treatment rates, varying efficacies and costs, and identified strategies that would most likely result in the best value for the resources required for implementation. MAIN MEASURES: Sustained virologic responses (SVRs), life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), costs from health system and program implementation perspectives, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: We estimate that imperfect follow-up reduces the real-world effectiveness of HCV therapies by approximately 75%. In the base case, a modestly effective hypothetical peer navigator program maximized the number of SVRs and QALE, with an ICER compared to the next best intervention of $48,700/quality-adjusted life year. Hypothetical interventions that simultaneously addressed multiple points along the cascade provided better outcomes and more value for money than less costly interventions targeting single steps. The 5-year program cost of the hypothetical peer navigator intervention was $14.5 million per 10,000 newly diagnosed individuals.

12622,Economic evaluation of prostate cancer screening test as a national cancer screening program in South Korea,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is rapidly increasing in Korea and professional societies have requested adding prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing to the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP), but this started a controversy in Korea and neutral evidence on this issue is required more than ever. The purpose of this study was to provide economic evidence to the decision makers of the NCSP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed on the adoption of PSA screening program among men aged 50-74-years in Korea from the healthcare system perspective. Several data sources were used for the cost-utility analysis, including general health screening data, the Korea Central Cancer Registry, national insurance claims data, and cause of mortality from the National Statistical Office. To solicit the utility index of prostate cancer, a face-to-face interview for typical men aged 40 to 69 was conducted using a Time-Trade Off method. RESULTS: As a result, the increase of effectiveness was estimated to be very low, when adopting PSA screening, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was analyzed as about 94 million KRW. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the incidence rate, screening rate, cancer stage distribution, utility index, and treatment costs but the results were consistent with the base analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Under Korean circumstances with a relatively low incidence rate of prostate cancer, PSA screening is not cost-effective. Therefore, we conclude that adopting national prostate cancer screening would not be beneficial until further evidence is provided in the future.",2014-01-15220,24870726,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Sangjin Shin,2014,15 / 8,3383-9,No,24870726,"Sangjin Shin; Youn Hee Kim; Jin Sub Hwang; Yoon Jae Lee; Sang Moo Lee; Jeonghoon Ahn; Economic evaluation of prostate cancer screening test as a national cancer screening program in South Korea, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, ; 15(8):1513-7368; 3383-9",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prostate Cancer Screening vs. Standard/Usual Care- Current private screening,Not Stated,74 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,94035213,South Korea,2010,96655.4
12623,The UPBEAT nurse-delivered personalized care intervention for people with coronary heart disease who report current chest pain and depression: a randomised controlled pilot study,"BACKGROUND: Depression is common in people with coronary heart disease (CHD) and associated with worse outcome. This study explored the acceptability and feasibility of procedures for a trial and for an intervention, including its potential costs, to inform a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a nurse-led personalised care intervention for primary care CHD patients with current chest pain and probable depression. METHODS: Multi-centre, outcome assessor-blinded, randomized parallel group study. CHD patients reporting chest pain and scoring 8 or more on the HADS were randomized to personalized care (PC) or treatment as usual (TAU) for 6 months and followed for 1 year. Primary outcome was acceptability and feasibility of procedures; secondary outcomes included mood, chest pain, functional status, well being and psychological process variables. RESULT: 1001 people from 17 General Practice CHD registers in South London consented to be contacted; out of 126 who were potentially eligible, 81 (35% female, mean age = 65 SD11 years) were randomized. PC participants (n = 41) identified wide ranging problems to work on with nurse-case managers. Good acceptability and feasibility was indicated by low attrition (9%), high engagement and minimal nurse time used (mean/SD = 78/19 mins assessment, 125/91 mins telephone follow up). Both groups improved on all outcomes. The largest between group difference was in the proportion no longer reporting chest pain (PC 37% vs TAU 18%; mixed effects model OR 2.21 95% CI 0.69, 7.03). Some evidence was seen that self efficacy (mean scale increase of 2.5 vs 0.9) and illness perceptions (mean scale increase of 7.8 vs 2.5) had improved in PC vs TAU participants at 1 year. PC appeared to be more cost effective up to a QALY threshold of approximately pound3,000. CONCLUSIONS: Trial and intervention procedures appeared to be feasible and acceptable. PC allowed patients to work on unaddressed problems and appears cheaper than TAU.

12624,The potential cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent versus trivalent influenza vaccine in elderly people and clinical risk groups in the UK: a lifetime multi-cohort model,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine compared with trivalent influenza vaccine in the UK. METHODS: A lifetime, multi-cohort, static Markov model was constructed, with nine age groups each divided into healthy and at-risk categories. Influenza A and B were accounted for separately. The model was run in one-year cycles for a lifetime (maximum age: 100 years). The analysis was from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. 2010 UK vaccination policy (vaccination of people at risk and those aged >/=65 years) was applied. Herd effect was not included. Inputs were derived from national databases and published sources where possible. The quadrivalent influenza vaccine price was not available when the study was conducted. It was estimated at pound6.72,15% above the trivalent vaccine price of pound5.85. Sensitivity analyses used an incremental price of up to 50%. RESULTS: Compared with trivalent influenza vaccine, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine would be expected to reduce the numbers of influenza cases by 1,393,720, medical visits by 439,852 complications by 167,357, hospitalisations for complications by 26,424 and influenza deaths by 16,471. The estimated base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound5,299/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to changes in circulation of influenza virus subtypes and vaccine mismatch; all other parameters had little effect. In 96% of simulations the ICER was < pound20,000/QALY. Since this analysis was completed, quadrivalent influenza vaccine has become available in the UK at a list price of pound9.94.

12625,The cost-effectiveness analysis of video capsule endoscopy compared to other strategies to manage acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the ED,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common presentation in hospital-based emergency departments (EDs). A novel diagnostic approach is to use video capsule endoscopy to directly visualize the upper GI tract and identify bleeding. Our objective was to evaluate and compare the relative costs and benefits of video capsule endoscopy compared to other strategies in low- to moderate-risk ED patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage. METHODS: We constructed a model using standard decision analysis software to examine the cost-effectiveness of 4 available strategies for a base-case patient who presents to the ED with either mild- or moderate-risk scenarios (by Glasgow-Blatchford Score) for requiring invasive hemostatic intervention (ie, endoscopic, surgical, etc) The 4 available diagnostic strategies were (1) direct imaging with video capsule endoscopy performed in the ED; (2) risk stratification using the Glasgow-Blatchford score; (3) nasogastric tube placement; and, finally, (4) an admit-all strategy. RESULTS: In the low-risk scenario, video capsule endoscopy was the preferred strategy (cost $5691, 14.69 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and was more cost-effective than the remaining strategies including nasogastric tube strategy (cost $8159, 14.69 QALYs), risk stratification strategy (cost $10,695, 14.69 QALYs), and admit-all strategy (cost $22,766, 14.68 QALYs).

12630,Total thyroidectomy versus hemithyroidectomy for patients with follicular neoplasm. A cost-utility analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Thyroid nodules are a common condition. Overall, 20% of the nodules assessed with FNAB correspond to the follicular pattern. A partial thyroidectomy is the minimal procedure that should be performed to determine the nature of these nodules. Some authors have suggested performing a total thyroidectomy based on the elimination of reoperation and ultrasound follow-up. The aim of this study was to evaluate the most cost-useful surgical strategy in a patient with an undetermined nodule, assessing complications, reoperation, recurrence and costs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cost-utility study was designed to compare hemithyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy. The outcomes were complications (definitive RLN palsy, permanent hypoparathyroidism, reoperation for cancer, and recurrence of the disease), direct costs and utility. We used the payer perspective at 5 years. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was completed. RESULTS: In a deterministic analysis, the cost, utility and cost-utility ratio was COP $12.981.801, 44.5 and COP $291.310 for total thyroidectomy and COP $14.309.889, 42.0 and $340.044 for partial thyroidectomy, respectively. The incremental cost-utility ratio was -$535.302 favoring total thyroidectomy. Partial thyroidectomy was more cost-effective when the risks of RLN injury and definitive hypoparathyroidism were greater than 8% and 9% in total thyroidectomy, respectively. In total, 46.8% of the simulations for partial thyroidectomy were located in the quadrant of more costly and less effective. CONCLUSION: Under a common range of complications, and considering the patient's preference and costs, total thyroidectomy should be selected as the most cost-effective treatment for patients with thyroid nodules and follicular patterns.",2014-01-15253,25017947,Int J Surg,C Corso,2014,12 / 8,837-42,No,25017947,"C Corso; X Gomez; A Sanabria; V Vega; L C Dominguez; C Osorio; Total thyroidectomy versus hemithyroidectomy for patients with follicular neoplasm.

12631,Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma in the United kingdom,"In the phase III PALETTE trial, pazopanib improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients with advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (mSTS) who had received prior chemotherapy. We used a multistate model to estimate expected PFS, overall survival (OS), lifetime STS treatment costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for patients receiving pazopanib, placebo, trabectedin, ifosfamide, or gemcitabine plus docetaxel as second-line mSTS therapies. The cost-effectiveness of pazopanib was expressed as the incremental costs per QALY gained. Estimates of PFS/OS, adverse events, and utilities for pazopanib and placebo were from the PALETTE trial. Estimates of relative effectiveness of the other comparators were from an unadjusted indirect comparison versus pazopanib. Costs were from published sources. Pazopanib is estimated to increase QALYs by 0.128 and costs by pound7,976 versus placebo; cost per QALY gained with pazopanib versus placebo is estimated to be pound62,000. Compared with the other chemotherapies, pazopanib provides similar QALYs at a lower cost. Pazopanib may not be cost-effective versus placebo but may be cost-effective versus the most commonly used active treatments, although this conclusion is uncertain. Given the unmet need for effective treatments for mSTS, pazopanib may be an appropriate alternative to some currently used medications in the United Kingdom.",2014-01-15254,25024640,Sarcoma,Jordan Amdahl,2014,2014 /,481071,No,25024640,"Jordan Amdahl; Stephanie C Manson; Robert Isbell; Ayman Chit; Jose Diaz; Lily Lewis; Thomas E Delea; Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma in the United kingdom, Sarcoma, ; 2014():1357-714X; 481071",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pazopanib vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,62162,United Kingdom,2011,114743.76

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expense of an early detection and treatment program for gastric cancer in patients found by screening, and also costs of traditional treatment in a hospital of Zhuanghe were assessed. Three major techniques of medical economics, namely cost-effective analysis (CEA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA), were used to assess the screening program. RESULTS: RESULTS from CEA showed that investing every 25, 235 Yuan on screening program in Zhuanghe area, one gastric cancer patient could be saved. Data from CUA showed that it was cost 1, 370 Yuan per QALY saved. RESULTS from CBA showed that: the total cost was 1,945,206 Yuan with a benefit as 8,669,709 Yuan and an CBR of 4.46.

12633,Changes in costs and effects after the implementation of disease management programs in the Netherlands: variability and determinants,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the changes in costs and outcomes after the implementation of various disease management programs (DMPs), to identify their potential determinants, and to compare the costs and outcomes of different DMPs. METHODS: We investigated the 1-year changes in costs and effects of 1,322 patients in 16 DMPs for cardiovascular risk (CVR), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus (DMII) in the Netherlands. We also explored the within-DMP predictors of these changes. Finally, a cost-utility analysis was performed from the healthcare and societal perspective comparing the most and the least effective DMP within each disease category. RESULTS: This study showed wide variation in development and implementation costs between DMPs (range:euro16;euro1,709) and highlighted the importance of economies of scale. Changes in health care utilization costs were not statistically significant. DMPs were associated with improvements in integration of CVR care (0.10 PACIC units), physical activity (+0.34 week-days) and smoking cessation (8% less smokers) in all diseases. Since an increase in physical activity and in self-efficacy were predictive of an improvement in quality-of-life, DMPs that aim to improve these are more likely to be effective. When comparing the most with the least effective DMP in a disease category, the vast majority of bootstrap replications (range:73%;97) pointed to cost savings, except for COPD (21%). QALY gains were small (range:0.003;+0.013) and surrounded by great uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: After one year we have found indications of improvements in level of integrated care for CVR patients and lifestyle indicators for all diseases, but in none of the diseases we have found indications of cost savings due to DMPs.

12637,Changes in costs and effects after the implementation of disease management programs in the Netherlands: variability and determinants,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the changes in costs and outcomes after the implementation of various disease management programs (DMPs), to identify their potential determinants, and to compare the costs and outcomes of different DMPs. METHODS: We investigated the 1-year changes in costs and effects of 1,322 patients in 16 DMPs for cardiovascular risk (CVR), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus (DMII) in the Netherlands. We also explored the within-DMP predictors of these changes. Finally, a cost-utility analysis was performed from the healthcare and societal perspective comparing the most and the least effective DMP within each disease category. RESULTS: This study showed wide variation in development and implementation costs between DMPs (range:euro16;euro1,709) and highlighted the importance of economies of scale. Changes in health care utilization costs were not statistically significant. DMPs were associated with improvements in integration of CVR care (0.10 PACIC units), physical activity (+0.34 week-days) and smoking cessation (8% less smokers) in all diseases. Since an increase in physical activity and in self-efficacy were predictive of an improvement in quality-of-life, DMPs that aim to improve these are more likely to be effective. When comparing the most with the least effective DMP in a disease category, the vast majority of bootstrap replications (range:73%;97) pointed to cost savings, except for COPD (21%).

12638,Economic evaluation of apixaban for the prevention of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Stroke prevention is the main goal of treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs) present an effective treatment in stroke prevention, however, the risk of bleeding and the requirement for regular coagulation monitoring are limiting their use. Apixaban is a novel oral anticoagulant associated with significantly lower hazard rates for stroke, major bleedings and treatment discontinuations, compared to VKAs. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared to VKAs in non-valvular AF patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: Previously published lifetime Markov model using efficacy data from the ARISTOTLE and the AVERROES trial was modified to reflect the use of oral anticoagulants in the Netherlands. Dutch specific costs, baseline population stroke risk and coagulation monitoring levels were incorporated. Univariate, probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses on the impact of different coagulation monitoring levels were performed on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Treatment with apixaban compared to VKAs resulted in an ICER of euro10,576 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Those findings correspond with lower number of strokes and bleedings associated with the use of apixaban compared to VKAs. Univariate sensitivity analyses revealed model sensitivity to the absolute stroke risk with apixaban and treatment discontinuations risks with apixaban and VKAs. The probability that apixaban is cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY was 68%. Results of the scenario analyses on the impact of different coagulation monitoring levels were quite robust.

12639,Cost-effectiveness of collaborative care for depression in UK primary care: economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial (CADET),"BACKGROUND: Collaborative care is an effective treatment for the management of depression but evidence on its cost-effectiveness in the UK is lacking. AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of collaborative care in a UK primary care setting. METHODS: An economic evaluation alongside a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial comparing collaborative care with usual primary care for adults with depression (n = 581). Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated over a 12-month follow-up, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services (i.e. Third Party Payer). Sensitivity analyses are reported, and uncertainty is presented using the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) and the cost-effectiveness plane. RESULTS: The collaborative care intervention had a mean cost of pound272.50 per participant. Health and social care service use, excluding collaborative care, indicated a similar profile of resource use between collaborative care and usual care participants. Collaborative care offered a mean incremental gain of 0.02 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.06) quality-adjusted life-years over 12 months, at a mean incremental cost of pound270.72 (95% CI: -202.98, 886.04), and resulted in an estimated mean cost per QALY of pound14,248. Where costs associated with informal care are considered in sensitivity analyses collaborative care is expected to be less costly and more effective, thereby dominating treatment as usual. CONCLUSION: Collaborative care offers health gains at a relatively low cost, and is cost-effective compared with usual care against a decision-maker willingness to pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained.

12640,Economic evaluation of ticagrelor for secondary prevention following acute coronary syndromes,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of ticagrelor in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation), including patients treated medically and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: A short-term decision tree and a long-term Markov model were used to simulate the evolution of patients' life-cycles. Clinical effectiveness data were collected from the PLATO trial and resource use data were obtained from the Hospital de Santa Marta database, disease-related group legislation and the literature. RESULTS: Ticagrelor provides increases of 0.1276 life years and 0.1106 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient. From a societal perspective these clinical gains entail an increase in expenditure of euro610. Thus the incremental cost per life year saved is euro4780 and the incremental cost per QALY is euro5517. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results show that ticagrelor reduces events compared to clopidogrel. The costs of ticagrelor are partially offset by lower costs arising from events prevented.

12643,"Cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, versus methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using real-world data from the IORRA observational cohort study","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a real-world setting in Japan. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was determined using a Markov model-based probabilistic simulation. Data from RA patients registered in the Institute of Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis (IORRA) cohort study between April 2007 and April 2011 were extracted using a pair-matching method: tocilizumab group (n = 104), patients who used at least 1 disease-modifying anti- rheumatic drug and in whom tocilizumab treatment was initiated; methotrexate group (n = 104), patients in whom methotrexate treatment was initiated for the first time or after an interruption of 6 or more months. Assuming a 6-month cycle length, health benefits and costs were measured over a lifetime and discounted at an annual rate of 3%. RESULTS: Compared with methotrexate treatment, lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for tocilizumab treatment were approximately 1.5- and 1.3-times higher, respectively. Incremental cost per QALY gained with tocilizumab was $49,359, which was below the assumed cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The probability of tocilizumab being cost- effective was 62.2%.

12644,Cost-effectiveness analysis of colon cancer treatments from MOSIAC and No. 16968 trials,"AIM: To compare XELOX and FOLFOX4 as colon cancer adjuvant chemotherapy based on MOSAIC and No. 16968 trails from Chinese cost-effectiveness perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to compare the FOLFOX4 and XELOX regimens based MOSAIC and No. 16968 trial. Five states were included in our Markov model: well (state 1), minor toxicity (state 2), major toxicity (state 3), quitting adjuvant chemotherapy (state 4), and death due to adjuvant chemotherapy (state 5). Transitions among the 5 states were assumed to be Markovian. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the Chinese health-care payer. The utility data were taken from published studies. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty factors in this cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Total direct costs of FOLFOX4 and XELOX per patient were $19884.96 +/- 4280.30 and $18113.25 +/- 3122.20, respectively. The total fees related to adverse events per patient during the entire treatment were $204.75 +/- 16.80 for the XELOX group, and $873.72 +/- 27.60 for the FOLFOX4 group, and the costs for travel and absenteeism per patient were $18495.00 for the XELOX group and $21,352.68 for the FOLFOX4 group. The base-case analysis showed that FOLFOX4 was estimated to produce an additional 0.06 in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at an additional cost of $3950.47 when compared to the XELOX regimen over the model time horizon. The cost per QALY gained was $8047.30 in the XELOX group, which was $900.98 less than in the FOLFOX4 group ($8948.28). The one way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the utility for the well state and minor toxicity state greatly influenced the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of FOLFOX4.

Delays in TB diagnosis and treatment among healthcare workers (HCWs) result in costly large-scale TB contact screening among patients and other HCWs. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of TB screening for HCWs using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) compared with tuberculin skin test (TST) and chest x ray (CXR). METHODS: Markov models were constructed using a hospital payer perspective. The target populations were a hypothetical cohort of 30-year-old HCWs at the time of employment, and a hypothetical cohort of HCWs working on a high-risk ward until 60 years of age. Six strategies were modelled: TST, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT), T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT), TST followed by QFT, TST followed by T-SPOT, and CXR.

12649,Cost-effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay for systematic tuberculosis screening of healthcare workers in low-incidence countries,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the important occupationally acquired infectious diseases in low-incidence countries. Delays in TB diagnosis and treatment among healthcare workers (HCWs) result in costly large-scale TB contact screening among patients and other HCWs. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of TB screening for HCWs using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) compared with tuberculin skin test (TST) and chest x ray (CXR). METHODS: Markov models were constructed using a hospital payer perspective. The target populations were a hypothetical cohort of 30-year-old HCWs at the time of employment, and a hypothetical cohort of HCWs working on a high-risk ward until 60 years of age. Six strategies were modelled: TST, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT), T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT), TST followed by QFT, TST followed by T-SPOT, and CXR. The main outcome measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs gained per person screened were calculated. FINDINGS: QFT was the most cost-effective strategy at the 'willingness to pay' level of US$ 50,000/QALYs gained (at the time of employment: US$ 334.91, 21.071 QALYs; on a high-risk ward: US$ 1050.32, 20.968 QALYs; values for 2012). Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to latent TB infection (LTBI) rate and bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination rate. TST followed by QFT was more cost-effective than QFT when the LTBI rate was <0.026 at the time of employment and <0.08 on a high-risk ward.

12650,Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative screening and treatment strategies for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in the United States,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder that leads to premature heart disease or stroke if untreated. Statins are effective for individuals with FH but less than 20% of actual cases are diagnosed in the US and many people are not adherent to treatment. Using new knowledge regarding mutations responsible for FH, some European countries have developed genetic FH screening strategies, many of which have been shown to be cost-effective. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of genetic screening and lipid-based screening with statin adherence measures compared to lipid-based screening alone in the US. METHODS: A decision tree was used to estimate disease detection with the three screening strategies, while a Markov model was used to model disease progression until death, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs from a US societal perspective. RESULTS: The results showed that Genetic Screening cost $15,594 for 18.29 QALYs per person and Lipid Screening with adherence measures cost $16,385 for 18.77 QALYs compared with $10,396 for 18.28 QALYs for Lipid Screening alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Genetic Screening versus Lipid Screening was $519,813/QALY and that of Lipid Screening with adherence measures versus Lipid Screening alone was $12,223/QALY. At a US willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY Genetic Screening is not cost-effective compared with Lipid Screening.

METHODS: Patients were prospectively recruited in 6 Spanish hospitals and followed up over one year. We estimated adjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (Euros per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) using a net-benefit approach and assessed the determinants of incremental net-benefit of TAVR vs SAVR. RESULTS: We analyzed data on 207 patients: 58, 87 and 62 in the Edwards SAPIEN (ES) TAVR, Medtronic-CoreValve (MC) TAVR and SAVR groups respectively. Average cost per patient of ES-TAVR was euro8800 higher than SAVR and the gain in QALY was 0.036. The ICER was euro148,525/QALY. The cost of MC-TAVR was euro9729 higher than SAVR and the QALY difference was -0.011 (dominated).

RESULTS: We analyzed data on 207 patients: 58, 87 and 62 in the Edwards SAPIEN (ES) TAVR, Medtronic-CoreValve (MC) TAVR and SAVR groups respectively. Average cost per patient of ES-TAVR was euro8800 higher than SAVR and the gain in QALY was 0.036. The ICER was euro148,525/QALY. The cost of MC-TAVR was euro9729 higher than SAVR and the QALY difference was -0.011 (dominated). Results substantially changed in the following conditions: 1) in patients with high preoperative serum creatinine the ICERs were euro18,302/QALY and euro179,618/QALY for ES and MC-TAVR respectively; 2) a 30% reduction in the cost of TAVR devices decreased the ICER for ES-TAVR to euro32,955/QALY; and 3) imputing hospitalization costs from other European countries leads to TAVR being dominant. CONCLUSIONS: In countries with relatively low health care costs TAVR is not likely to be cost-effective compared to SAVR in patients with intermediate risk for surgery, mainly because of the high cost of the valve compared to the cost of hospitalization.

12663,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rotavirus vaccination among Libyan children using a simple economic model,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus infection is a major cause of childhood diarrhea in Libya. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in that country. METHODS: We used a published decision tree model that has been adapted to the Libyan situation to analyze a birth cohort of 160,000 children. The evaluation of diarrhea events in three public hospitals helped to estimate the rotavirus burden. The economic analysis was done from two perspectives: health care provider and societal. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty in some values of the variables selected. RESULTS: The three hospitals received 545 diarrhea patients aged</=5 with 311 (57%) rotavirus positive test results during a 9-month period. The societal cost for treatment of a case of rotavirus diarrhea was estimated at US$ 661/event. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a vaccine price of US$ 27 per course was US$ 8,972 per quality-adjusted life year gained from the health care perspective. From a societal perspective, the analysis shows cost savings of around US$ 16 per child.

12664,Stroke and systemic embolism prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in Belgium: comparative cost effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants and warfarin,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Management of non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) focuses on the use of anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of stroke. Until recently, vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment was considered the standard of care, with the emergence of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) shifting treatment practice. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the use of warfarin and the NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF from the perspective of a Belgian healthcare payer using a cost-effectiveness analysis and the efficiency frontier approach. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted to the Belgian healthcare setting. Clinical events modelled include ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, intracranial haemorrhage, other major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular hospitalisation and treatment discontinuations. Efficacy and bleeding data for warfarin and apixaban 5 mg twice daily were obtained from the ARISTOTLE trial, whilst those for other NOACs (rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily) were from published indirect comparisons. Acute medical costs were obtained from reimbursement payments made to Belgian hospitals, whilst long-term medical costs and utility data were derived from the literature. The efficiency frontier was calculated using total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as outcomes. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Warfarin and apixaban were the two optimal treatment choices, as the other three treatment alternatives including dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg switching to dabigatran 110 mg at the age of 80 years and rivaroxaban were extendedly or strictly dominated on the efficiency frontier. Apixaban was a cost-effective alternative vs warfarin at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <euro>7,212/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst NOACs, apixaban may be the most economically efficient alternative to warfarin in NVAF patients who are suitable for VKA treatment and eligible for stroke prevention in Belgium.",2014-01-15344,25511639,Clin Drug Investig,Thitima Kongnakorn,2015,35 / 2,,Yes,25511639,"Thitima Kongnakorn; Tereza Lanitis; Lieven Annemans; Vincent Thijs; Marnix Goethals; Sophie Marbaix; Jean-Claude Wautrecht; Stroke and systemic embolism prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in Belgium: comparative cost effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants and warfarin, Clin Drug Investig, 2015 Feb; 35(2):1173-2563",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Dose-adjusted warfarin,Suitable for vitamin K antagonist treatment,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,7212,Euro,2013,10641.59

This analysis was undertaken to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of these strategies for the global population and pre-specified subgroups. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis evaluated the ICER of gemcitabine or erlotinib maintenance therapy vs. observation, from randomization until the end of follow-up. Direct medical costs (including drugs, hospitalization, follow-up examinations, second-line treatments and palliative care) were prospectively collected per patient during the trial, until death, from the primary health-insurance provider's perspective.

12667,Cost effectiveness of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation depending on the quality of warfarin anticoagulation control,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are standard treatments for stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation. Patient outcomes depend on quality of warfarin management, which includes regular monitoring and dose adjustments. Recently, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) that do not require regular monitoring offer an alternative to warfarin. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cost effectiveness of NOACs for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation depends on the quality of warfarin control. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model to simulate warfarin treatment outcomes in relation to the quality of anticoagulation control, expressed as percentage of time in the therapeutic range (TTR). Standard treatment with adjusted-dose warfarin and improved anticoagulation control by genotype-guided dosing were compared with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. The analysis was performed from the Slovenian healthcare payer perspective using 2014 costs. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban was below the threshold of euro25,000 per quality-adjusted life-years compared with adjusted-dose warfarin with a TTR of 60%. The probability that warfarin was a cost-effective option was around 1%. This percentage rises as the quality of anticoagulation control improves. At a TTR of 70%, warfarin was the preferred treatment in half the iterations. CONCLUSION: The cost effectiveness of NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at increased risk for stroke is highly sensitive to warfarin anticoagulation control.

12672,Cost-effectiveness of a community-integrated home-based depression intervention in older African Americans,"OBJECTIVES: To test the cost-effectiveness of a home-based depression program: Beat the Blues (BTB). DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis as part of a previously reported randomized controlled trial that compared BTB with a wait-list control group. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: English-speaking, cognitively intact (Mini-Mental State Examination score >/=24), African Americans aged 55 and older with depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire score >/=5) (N = 129). INTERVENTION: Participants randomly assigned to BTB received up to 10 home visits over 4 months from licensed social workers who provided care management, referral and linkage, stress reduction, depression education, and behavioral activation to help participants achieve self-identified goals. MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of BTB versus wait-list controls during the 4-month study period. The primary ICER was defined as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using the Euro Quality of Life 5D (EQ-5D) and secondarily using the Health Utilities Index-3 (HUI-3). Additional ICERs were calculated using clinical measures (cost per depression improvement, cost per depression remission). Costs included BTB intervention, depression-related healthcare visits and medications, caregiver time, and social services. RESULTS: BTB cost per participant per month was $146.

12673,A cost-utility analysis of the use of preoperative computed tomographic angiography in abdomen-based perforator flap breast reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomographic angiography is a diagnostic tool increasingly used for preoperative vascular mapping in abdomen-based perforator flap breast reconstruction. This study compared the use of computed tomographic angiography and the conventional practice of Doppler ultrasonography only in postmastectomy reconstruction using a cost-utility model. METHODS: Following a comprehensive literature review, a decision analytic model was created using the three most clinically relevant health outcomes in free autologous breast reconstruction with computed tomographic angiography versus Doppler ultrasonography only. Cost and utility estimates for each health outcome were used to derive the quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-utility ratio. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to scrutinize the robustness of the authors' results. RESULTS: Six studies and 782 patients were identified. Cost-utility analysis revealed a baseline cost savings of $3179, a gain in quality-adjusted life-years of 0.25. This yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio of -$12,716, implying a dominant choice favoring preoperative computed tomographic angiography. Sensitivity analysis revealed that computed tomographic angiography was costlier when the operative time difference between the two techniques was less than 21.3 minutes. However, the clinical advantage of computed tomographic angiography over Doppler ultrasonography only showed that computed tomographic angiography would still remain the cost-effective option even if it offered no additional operating time advantage. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results show that computed tomographic angiography is a cost-effective technology for identifying lower abdominal perforators for autologous breast reconstruction.

12674,Economic modelling of a public health programme for fall prevention,"BACKGROUND: despite evidence on what works in falls prevention, falls in older people remain an important public health problem. AIMS: the purpose of this study was to model the impact and cost-effectiveness of a public health falls prevention programme, from the perspective of the health funder. METHODS: a decision analytic Markov model compared the health benefits in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of treatment and residential aged care with and without a population heath falls prevention programme. Different intervention costs, uptake levels and programme effectiveness were modelled in sensitivity analyses. Uncertainty was explored using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: widespread rollout of a public health fall prevention programme could result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $A28,931 per QALY gained, assuming a programme cost of $700 per person and at a fall prevention risk ratio of 0.75. This ICER would be considered cost-effective at a threshold value of $A50,000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses for programme cost and effectiveness indicated that the public health programme produced greater health outcomes and was less costly than no programme when programme costs were $A500 or lower and risk ratio for falls was 0.70 or lower. At a cost of $A2,500, the public health falls prevention programme ceases to be a cost-effective option. CONCLUSION: serious consideration should be given to implementation of a public health programme of falls prevention as a cost-effective option that enables population-wide access to the intervention strategies.",2014-01-15365,25523025,Age Ageing,Inez Farag,2015,44 / 3,,No,25523025,"Inez Farag; Kirsten Howard; Manuela L Ferreira; Catherine Sherrington; Economic modelling of a public health programme for fall prevention, Age Ageing, 2015 May; 44(3):0002-0729",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Public health falls prevention program vs. None,"No prior history of falls, living independently in the community",65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,28931,Australia,2011,34394.1
12675,Cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant chemotherapies in patients presenting with gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy,"BACKGROUND: To analyze and compare the economic outcomes of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (referred to as the XELOX strategy) and of S-1 (the S-1 strategy) for gastric cancer patients after D2 gastrectomy. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime disease course associated with stage II or III gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy. The lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), associated costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. The clinical data were derived from the results of pilot studies. Direct costs were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, and the utility data were measured from end-point observations of Chinese patients. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty on the model's outcomes. RESULTS: The combined adjuvant chemotherapy strategy with XELOX yielded the greatest increase in QALYs over the course of the disease (8.1 QALYs compared with 7.8 QALYs for the S-1 strategy and 6.2 for surgery alone). The incremental cost per QALY gained using the XELOX strategy was significantly lower than that for the S-1 strategy ($3,502 vs. $6,837, respectively). The results were sensitive to the costs of oxaliplatin and the hazard ratio of relapse-free survival.

12677,Biological therapies for the treatment of severe psoriasis in patients with previous exposure to biological therapy: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Biologic therapies have revolutionised the care of patients with psoriasis, although they come at significant extra cost. Guidance on their use in the UK National Health Service (NHS) has so far focused on patients who are ""biologic naive"", yet a minority of patients have poor response and require further treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential cost effectiveness of sequential biologic therapies in patients with psoriasis who have been exposed to previous biologic therapy. METHODS: A two-part model with a 10-year time horizon was built to model an initial 13.5-week ""trial"" phase and a longer-term ""treatment"" period with annual Markov cycles. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response rates from subgroup analyses of three randomised placebo-controlled trials evaluating biologic agents were considered. A meta-analysis of these data provided probabilities of achieving PASI response (50/75/90) in the short term, and published evidence and assumptions were used to predict outcomes over the longer term. Benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs (2013-14) to the UK NHS included drugs, administration, monitoring, and hospitalisation. Costs and benefits were discounted 3.5 % per annum. Cost effectiveness of sequential biologic therapy was measured using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to best supportive care (BSC). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of alternative assumptions on the results. RESULTS: Results indicate that over 10 years, switching to a second biologic following intolerance to or failure of a first is likely to generate more QALYs than BSC, but at a higher cost. Base case results suggest the ICER of the second biologic compared to BSC is pound17,681 per QALY; however, sensitivity analyses indicate that changes in the efficacy of BSC, drug costs, dropout rates, and rates of hospitalisation have a significant impact, causing the ICER to range from less than pound10,000 to over pound50,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Further biologic therapy for patients with psoriasis who have previously been treated with biologic therapy may be cost effective, although there is considerable uncertainty in the results. Future studies should be designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of biologic therapies in this subgroup with particular attention given to short-term and longer-term responses.",2014-01-15375,25526841,Pharmacoeconomics,Laura M Sawyer,2015,33 / 2,,Yes,25526841,"Laura M Sawyer; David Wonderling; Karina Jackson; Ruth Murphy; Eleanor J Samarasekera; Catherine H Smith; Biological therapies for the treatment of severe psoriasis in patients with previous exposure to biological therapy: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2015 Feb; 33(2):1179-2027",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biological Therapy vs. Best supportive care,Previous Exposure to Biological Therapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,17681,United Kingdom,2014,31863.77
12678,Cost-effectiveness analysis of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX((R))) for the management of urinary incontinence in adults with neurogenic detrusor overactivity: a UK perspective,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX((R)), 200 units [200 U]) for the management of urinary incontinence (UI) in adults with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) due to subcervical spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis that is not adequately managed with anticholinergic drugs (ACHDs). PERSPECTIVE: UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed, which compared onabotulinumtoxinA + best supportive care (BSC) with BSC alone (comprising behavioural therapy and pads, alone or in combination with clean intermittent catheterization and possibly with ACHDs). Non-responders were eligible for invasive procedures. Health states were defined according to the reduction in UI episodes. Efficacy data and estimates of resource utilization were pooled from 468 patients on onabotulinumtoxinA in two phase III clinical trials. Drug costs (2013) and administration costs (NHS Reference Costs 2011-2012) were obtained from published sources. The time horizon of the model was 5 years, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Scenario, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were conducted to explore uncertainties around the assumptions. RESULTS: In the base case, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC over 5 years was associated with an increase in costs of pound1,689 and an increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.4, compared with BSC alone, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound3,850 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that utility values had the greatest influence on model results. PSA suggests that onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC had a 100 % probability of being cost effective at a willingness to pay of < pound20,000.

12679,Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of the 10-Valent Pneumococcal Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae Protein D Conjugate Vaccine and 13-Valent Pneumococcal Vaccine in Japanese Children,"INTRODUCTION: Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae represent a major public health problem. The purpose of this study was to compare, in the Japanese context, the projected health benefits, costs and cost-effectiveness of the latest generation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines which may provide important insight into the potential public health impact of interventions in the context of local disease-specific epidemiology. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare two vaccination strategies which involve routine infant immunization with either the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13; Prevenar 13, Pfizer, Pearl River, NY, USA) or the 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV; Synflorix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA, Rixensart, Belgium) over a time horizon of 5 years from the healthcare provider and societal perspectives. Estimates for key model parameters were obtained from locally available databases and published literature. Incremental benefits in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life-year and cost-effectiveness were assessed. RESULTS: A 3 + 1 vaccination schedule for infants with PHiD-CV is expected to have a similar impact on invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia and a larger impact on acute otitis media-related outcomes compared with PCV-13. Assuming price parity for these vaccines, the model projected that vaccination with PHiD-CV would result in cost savings of 1.9 and 3.9 billion Japanese yen from the provider and societal perspectives, respectively. This was largely due to a reduction in highly prevalent acute otitis media. Vaccination with PHiD-CV was expected to generate a gain of 433 quality-adjusted life-years compared to PCV-13 translating into dominance over PCV-13. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of model outcome to changes in key model parameters and substantiated that the model outcome was consistently driven by the incremental benefit of PHiD-CV in averting acute otitis media. CONCLUSION: In comparison to PCV-13, vaccination with PHiD-CV is projected to be cost saving for Japan from both the healthcare provider and societal perspectives.",2014-01-15378,25527448,Infect Dis Ther,Makoto Shiragami,2014,/,,No,25527448,"Makoto Shiragami; Akiko Mizukami; Oscar Leeuwenkamp; Tomas Mrkvan; Emmanuelle Delgleize; Yuichi Kurono; Satoshi Iwata; Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of the 10-Valent Pneumococcal Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae Protein D Conjugate Vaccine and 13-Valent Pneumococcal Vaccine in Japanese Children, Infect Dis Ther, ; ():2193-8229",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine vs. 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-9047689.04,Japan,2013,-103157.79
12680,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of a hepatitis B vaccination catch-up program among children in Shandong Province, China","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate long-term costeffectiveness of a hepatitis B vaccination catch-up program among children born between 1994 and 2001 (when they were 815 y old) in Shandong province, China, to provide information for nationwide evaluation and future policy making. METHODS: We determined the cost-effectiveness of the catch-up program compared with the status quo (no catch-up program). We combined a Decision Tree model and a Markov model to simulate vaccination and clinical progression after hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Parameters in the models were from the literature, a field survey, program files, and the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS). The incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to compare the 2 alternative strategies. One-way sensitivity analysis, 2-way sensitivity analysis, and probability sensitivity analysis were used to assess parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The catch-up program was dominant compared with the status quo. Using a total of 5.53 million doses of vaccines, the catch-up program could prevent 21,865 cases of symptomatic acute hepatitis B, 3,088 carrier states with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and 812 deaths due to HBV infection. The catch-up program could add 28,888 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and save $192.01 million in the targeted population in the future. The models were robust, considering parameter uncertainties. CONCLUSION: The catch-up program in Shandong province among children born between 1994 and 2001 was 'very cost-saving.'

12681,Potential impact of vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis on Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States: results from a decision-analysis model,"Components in 4CMenB vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B have shown to potentially cross-react with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We modeled the theoretical impact of a US 4CMenB vaccination program on gonorrhea outcomes. A decision-analysis model was populated using published healthcare utilization and cost data. A two-dose adolescent vaccination campaign was assumed, with protective immunity starting at age 15 years and a base-case efficacy against gonorrhea of 20%. The 20%-efficacy level is an assumption since no clinical data have yet quantified the efficacy of 4CMenB against Neisseria gonorrhoea. Key outcome measures were reductions in gonorrhea and HIV infections, reduction in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost, and the economically justifiable price assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $75,000 per QALY gained. Adolescent vaccination with 4CMenB would prevent 83,167 (95% credible interval [CrI], 44,600-134,600) gonorrhea infections and decrease the number of HIV infections by 55 (95% CrI, 2-129) per vaccinated birth cohort in the USA. Excluding vaccination costs, direct medical costs for gonorrhea would reduce by $28.7 million (95% CrI, $6.8-$70.0 million), and income and productivity losses would reduce by $40.0 million (95% CrI, $8.2-$91.7 million). Approximately 83% of the reduction in lost productivity is generated by avoiding HIV infections. At a cost of $75,000 per QALY gained, and incremental to the vaccine's effect on meningococcal disease, a price of $26.10 (95% CrI, $9.10-$57.20) per dose, incremental to the price of the meningococcal vaccine, would be justified from the societal perspective. At this price, the net cost per infection averted would be $1,677 (95% CrI, $404-$2,564). Even if the cross-immunity of 4CMenB vaccine and gonorrhea is only 20%, the reduction in gonorrhea infections and associated costs would be substantial.",2014-01-15396,25483706,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Stephane A Regnier,2014,10 / 12,0,No,25483706,"Stephane A Regnier; Jasper Huels; Potential impact of vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis on Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States: results from a decision-analysis model, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2014; 10(12):2164-554X; 0",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Two-dose 4CMenB vaccination vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,15 Years,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,75000,United States,2012,84544.13

METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate disease progression in a cohort of people with baseline characteristics taken from a published meta-analysis. Direct and indirect costs for 2010-2011 were calculated from a societal payer perspective, with cost-effectiveness calculated over the patient's lifetime. Discount rates of 3% per annum were applied to the costs and the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Use of the sensor-augmented pump was associated with an increase in mean discounted, quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.76 quality-adjusted life years compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (13.05 +/- 0.12 quality-adjusted life years vs 12.29 +/- 0.12 quality-adjusted life years, respectively). Undiscounted life expectancy increased by 1.03 years for the sensor-augmented pump compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. In addition, the onset of complications was delayed (by a mean of 1.15 years) with use of the sensor-augmented pump. This analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 367,571 SEK per quality-adjusted life year gained with the sensor-augmented pump. The additional treatment costs related to the use of the sensor-augmented pump were partially offset by the savings attributable to the reduction in diabetes-related complications and the lower frequency of self-monitoring of plasma glucose. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis using the CORE Diabetes Model showed that improvements in glycaemic control associated with sensor-augmented pump use led to a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications and a longer life expectancy.

The most readily available supplemental screening method is ultrasonography, but little is known about its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts. DESIGN: Comparative modeling with 3 validated simulation models. DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium; and medical literature. TARGET POPULATION: Contemporary cohort of women eligible for routine screening. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Payer. INTERVENTION: Supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts after a negative screening mammography result. OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, biopsies recommended after a false-positive ultrasonography result, and costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Supplemental ultrasonography screening after a negative mammography result for women aged 50 to 74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts averted 0.36 additional breast cancer deaths (range across models, 0.14 to 0.75), gained 1.7 QALYs (range, 0.9 to 4.7), and resulted in 354 biopsy recommendations after a false-positive ultrasonography result (range, 345 to 421) per 1000 women with dense breasts compared with biennial screening by mammography alone. The cost-effectiveness ratio was $325,000 per QALY gained (range, $112,000 to $766,000).

OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, biopsies recommended after a false-positive ultrasonography result, and costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Supplemental ultrasonography screening after a negative mammography result for women aged 50 to 74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts averted 0.36 additional breast cancer deaths (range across models, 0.14 to 0.75), gained 1.7 QALYs (range, 0.9 to 4.7), and resulted in 354 biopsy recommendations after a false-positive ultrasonography result (range, 345 to 421) per 1000 women with dense breasts compared with biennial screening by mammography alone. The cost-effectiveness ratio was $325,000 per QALY gained (range, $112,000 to $766,000). Supplemental ultrasonography screening for only women with extremely dense breasts cost $246,000 per QALY gained (range, $74,000 to $535,000). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The conclusions were not sensitive to ultrasonography performance characteristics, screening frequency, or starting age. LIMITATION: Provider costs for coordinating supplemental ultrasonography were not considered. CONCLUSION: Supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts would substantially increase costs while producing relatively small benefits.

12687,Cost-effectiveness of transoral robotic surgery versus (chemo)radiotherapy for early T classification oropharyngeal carcinoma: A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: The present study is an economic evaluation comparing transoral robotic surgery (TORS) to (chemo)radiotherapy for the management of early T-classification oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS: A societal perspective was adopted. Treatment for TORS and (chemo)radiotherapy were modeled using decision analysis and recurrences were modeled over a 10 year horizon with a Markov model. Model parameters were derived from systematic review. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to test model robustness. RESULTS: TORS demonstrated a cost savings of $1366 and an increase of 0.25 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per case in comparison to (chemo)radiotherapy. TORS was sensitive to variations in adjuvant therapy, costs, utilities, complications, and recurrence rates in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In two-way sensitivity analysis, with increasing adjuvant therapy for TORS and decreasing concurrent chemotherapy for radiotherapy, TORS is decreasingly cost-effective. CONCLUSION: TORS is cost-effective for treatment of early oropharyngeal cancer. Case selection to minimize adjuvant therapy ensures cost-effective treatment. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

12688,Cost effectiveness of dabrafenib as a first-line treatment in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and vemurafenib as first-line treatments in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma from a Canadian healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A partitioned-survival analysis model with three mutually exclusive health states (pre-progression, post-progression, and dead) was used. The proportion of patients in each state was calculated using survival distributions for progression-free and overall survival derived from pivotal trials of dabrafenib and vemurafenib. For each treatment, expected progression-free, post-progression, overall, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were calculated. Costs were based on list prices, a clinician survey, and published sources. A 5-year time horizon was used in the base case. Costs (in 2012 Canadian dollars [CA$]) and QALYs were discounted at 5% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Dabrafenib was estimated to yield 0.2055 more QALYs at higher cost than dacarbazine. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CA$363,136/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, at a threshold of CA$200,000/QALY, there was an 8.2% probability that dabrafenib is cost effective versus dacarbazine. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, cost effectiveness was sensitive to survival distributions, utilities, and time horizon, with the hazard ratio for overall survival for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine being the most sensitive parameter. Assuming a class effect for efficacy of BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib was dominant versus vemurafenib (less costly, equally effective), reflecting its assumed lower daily cost. Assuming no class effect, dabrafenib yielded 0.0486 more QALYs than vemurafenib. CONCLUSIONS: At a threshold of CA$200,000/QALY, dabrafenib is unlikely to be cost effective compared with dacarbazine.

12690,Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma in Canada,"BACKGROUND: In the phase iii palette trial of pazopanib compared with placebo in patients with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (sts) who had received prior chemotherapy, pazopanib treatment was associated with improved progression-free survival (pfs). We used an economic model and data from palette and other sources to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pazopanib in patients with advanced sts who had already received chemotherapy. METHODS: We developed a multistate model to estimate expected pfs, overall survival (os), lifetime sts treatment costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) for patients receiving pazopanib or placebo as second-line therapy for advanced sts. Cost-effectiveness was calculated alternatively from the health care system and societal perspectives for the province of Quebec. Estimated pfs, os, incidence of adverse events, and utilities values for pazopanib and placebo were derived from the palette trial. Costs were obtained from published sources. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, pazopanib is estimated to increase qalys by 0.128. The incremental cost of pazopanib compared with placebo is CA$20,840 from the health care system perspective and CA$15,821 from the societal perspective. The cost per qaly gained with pazopanib in that comparison is CA$163,336 from the health care system perspective and CA$124,001 from the societal perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, pazopanib might be cost-effective from the Canadian health care system and societal perspectives depending on the threshold value used by reimbursement authorities to assess novel cancer therapies.

12691,Increasing the use of second-line therapy is a cost-effective approach to prevent the spread of drug-resistant HIV: a mathematical modelling study,"INTRODUCTION: Earlier antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation reduces HIV-1 incidence. This benefit may be offset by increased transmitted drug resistance (TDR), which could limit future HIV treatment options. We analyze the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce TDR. METHODS: We develop a deterministic mathematical model representing Kampala, Uganda, to predict the prevalence of TDR over a 10-year period. We then compare the impact on TDR and cost-effectiveness of: (1) introduction of pre-therapy genotyping; (2) doubling use of second-line treatment to 80% (50-90%) of patients with confirmed virological failure on first-line ART; and (3) increasing viral load monitoring from yearly to twice yearly. An intervention can be considered cost-effective if it costs less than three times the gross domestic product per capita per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, or less than $3420 in Uganda. RESULTS: The prevalence of TDR is predicted to rise from 6.7% (interquartile range [IQR] 6.2-7.2%) in 2014, to 6.8% (IQR 6.1-7.6%), 10.0% (IQR 8.9-11.5%) and 11.1% (IQR 9.7-13.0%) in 2024 if treatment is initiated at a CD4 <350, <500, or immediately, respectively. The absolute number of TDR cases is predicted to decrease 4.4-8.1% when treating earlier compared to treating at CD4 <350 due to the preventative effects of earlier treatment. Most cases of TDR can be averted by increasing second-line treatment (additional 7.1-10.2% reduction), followed by increased viral load monitoring (<2.7%) and pre-therapy genotyping (<1.0%). Only increasing second-line treatment is cost-effective, ranging from $1612 to $2234 (IQR $450-dominated) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: While earlier treatment initiation will result in a predicted increase in the proportion of patients infected with drug-resistant HIV, the absolute numbers of patients infected with drug-resistant HIV is predicted to decrease.

12694,Cost effectiveness of mirabegron compared with tolterodine extended release for the treatment of adults with overactive bladder in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) is highly prevalent and is associated with considerable morbidity and reduced health-related quality of life. beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) stimulation is a novel alternative to antimuscarinic therapy for OAB. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to assess the cost effectiveness of the beta3-AR agonist mirabegron relative to tolterodine extended release (ER) in patients with OAB from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the management, course of disease, and effect of complications in OAB patients over a period of 5 years. Transition probabilities for symptom severity levels and probabilities of adverse events were estimated from the results of the randomised, double-blind SCORPIO trial in 1,987 patients with OAB. Other model inputs were derived from the literature and on assumptions based on clinical experience. RESULTS: Total 5-year costs per patient were pound1,645.62 for mirabegron 50 mg/day and pound1,607.75 for tolterodine ER 4 mg/day. Mirabegron was associated with a gain of 0.009 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with an additional cost of pound37.88. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound4,386/QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity analyses in the general OAB population and several subgroups, ICERs remained below the generally accepted willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of pound20,000/QALY gained. The probability of mirabegron 50 mg being cost effective relative to tolterodine ER 4 mg was 89.4 % at the same WTP threshold.

12695,Cost-effectiveness of patient navigation to increase adherence with screening colonoscopy among minority individuals,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is underused by minority populations, and patient navigation increases adherence with screening colonoscopy. In this study, the authors estimated the cost-effectiveness of navigation for screening colonoscopy from the perspective of a payer seeking to improve population health. METHODS: A validated model of CRC screening was informed with inputs from navigation studies in New York City (population: 43% African American, 49% Hispanic, 4% white, 4% other; base-case screening: 40% without navigation, 65% with navigation; navigation costs: $29 per colonoscopy completer, $21 per noncompleter, $3 per non-navigated individual). Two analyses compared: 1) navigation versus no navigation for 1-time screening colonoscopy in unscreened individuals aged >/= 50 years; and 2) programs of colonoscopy with versus without navigation versus fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for individuals ages 50 to 80 years. RESULTS: In the base case: 1) 1-time navigation gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and decreased costs; 2) longitudinal navigation cost $9800 per QALY gained versus no navigation, and, assuming comparable uptake rates, it cost $118,700 per QALY gained versus FOBT but was less effective and more costly than FIT. The results were most dependent on screening participation rates and navigation costs: 1) assuming a 5% increase in screening uptake with navigation, and a navigation cost of $150 per completer, 1-time navigation cost $26,400 per QALY gained; and 2) longitudinal navigation with 75% colonoscopy uptake cost <$25,000 per QALY gained versus FIT when FIT uptake was <50%. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses did not alter the conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Navigation for screening colonoscopy appears to be cost-effective, and 1-time navigation may be cost-saving.

12697,Cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-fluorouracil 0.5%/salicylic acid 10% in the treatment of actinic keratosis in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-fluorouracil 0.5%/salicylic acid 10% (5-FU/SA) in the treatment of isolated hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis lesions in Spain. METHODS: An analytical decision-making model was constructed to compare whether 5-FU/SA was a cost-effective option compared with cryotherapy from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System with a time horizon of 6 months. Costs were expressed in 2014 euros. RESULTS: The cost of patients with hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis treated with 5-FU/SA or cryotherapy was euro266 and euro285, respectively. 5-FU/SA was associated with higher rates of treatment success and, consequently, more quality-adjusted life years, than cryotherapy. Therefore, 5-FU/SA was the dominant treatment, as it was associated with a lower treatment cost and greater effectiveness than cryotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Economically, 5-FU/SA was a dominant option compared with cryotherapy in the treatment of isolated hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis lesions in Spain.",2014-01-15422,25495775,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,Diana Nieves,2015,15 / 3,1-5,No,25495775,"Diana Nieves; Ruth Puig-Peiro; Carlos Ferrandiz; Maria Josep Plazas; Max Brosa; Cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-fluorouracil 0.5%/salicylic acid 10% in the treatment of actinic keratosis in Spain, Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res, 2015 Jun; 15(3):1744-8379; 1-5",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,5-fluorouracil 0.5% / salicylic acid 10% vs. Cryotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-7076.92,Euro,2014,-10287.43
12698,Economic evaluation of ivabradine in the treatment of chronic heart failure in Greece,"BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ivabradine plus standard care (SoC) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with sinus rhythm and a baseline heart rate >/= 75 b.p.m. in Greece, in comparison with current SoC alone. METHODS: An existing cost-effectiveness model consisting of two health states, was adapted to the Greek health care setting. All clinical inputs of the model (i.e. mortality rates, hospitalization rates, NYHA class distribution and utility values) were estimated from SHIFT trial data. All costing data used in the model reflects the year 2013 (in euro). An incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. The horizon of analysis was over patient life time and both cost and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per year. The analysis was conducted from a Greek third party-payer perspective. RESULTS: The Markov analysis revealed that the discounted quality-adjusted survival was 4.27 and 3.99 QALYs in the ivabradine plus SoC and SoC alone treatment arms, respectively. The cumulative lifetime total cost per patient was euro8,665 and euro5,873, for ivabradine plus SoC and SoC alone, respectively. The ICER for ivabradine plus SoC versus SoC alone was estimated as euro9,986 per QALY gained. The PSA showed that the likelihood of ivabradine plus SoC being cost-effective at a threshold of euro36,000/QALY was found to be 95%.

12699,Cost-effectiveness of kidney transplantation from DCD in Italy,"INTRODUCTION: Kidney transplantation represents the best therapeutic option for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), providing the best outcomes for survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. To increase kidney donations, in 2007, the Italian IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation in Pavia designed and conducted Programma Alba, a protocol for organ donation after cardiac death (DCD). This study evaluated the costs and health outcomes of DCD transplantation and in all types of transplants compared with current clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov-based model was used to assess costs and health outcomes for new ESRD patients for 2008 to 2013. A health care founder perspective was used. Data sources were the Italian National Institute of Statistics and the Lombardy Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation. A microcosting analysis was performed to calculate costs related to clinical pathways for DCD. We assessed costs, survival, quality-adjusted survival, and cost-effectiveness. FINDINGS: Changing the actual practice pattern for new patients with ESRD and increasing the availability of kidneys from DCD to 10 extra transplants per year will induce an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of euro4255. Increases in transplantation to reach an extra 10% by transplant type would result in reduced costs and increased patient survival and quality of life compared with the current scenario. INTERPRETATION: Our data show that increasing DCD transplants would result in a cost-effective policy to expand the kidney donor pool compared with current ESRD treatment patterns.
