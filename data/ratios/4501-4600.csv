4501,Economic evaluation of palliative management versus peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease: evidence for coverage decisions in Thailand,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the value for money of including peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) into the universal health insurance scheme of Thailand. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model applied to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients aged 20 to 70 years was developed to examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of palliative care versus 1) providing PD as an initial treatment followed by HD if complications/switching occur; and 2) providing HD followed by PD if complications/switching occur. Input parameters were extracted from a national cohort, the Thailand Renal Replacement Therapy Registry, and systematic reviews, where possible. The study explored the effects of uncertainty around input parameters, presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, as well as the value of obtaining further information on chosen parameters, i.e., partial expected value of perfect information. RESULTS: Using a societal perspective, the average ICER of initial treatment with PD and the average ICER of initial treatment with HD were 672,000 and 806,000 Baht per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (52,000 and 63,000 purchasing power parity [PPP] US$/QALY) compared with palliative care. Providing treatments for younger ESRD patients resulted in a significant improvement of survival and gain of QALYs compared with the older aged group. The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios of both options for the older age group were relatively similar. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that offering PD as initial treatment was a better choice than offering HD, but it would only be considered a cost-effective strategy if the social willingness-to-pay threshold was at or higher than 700,000 Baht per QALY (54,000 PPP US$/QALY) for the age 20 group and 750,000 Baht per QALY (58,000 PPP US$/QALY) for age 70 years.",2007-01-03502,17261117,Value Health,Yot Teerawattananon,2007,10 / 1,61-72,Yes,17261117,"Yot Teerawattananon; Miranda Mugford; Viroj Tangcharoensathien; Economic evaluation of palliative management versus peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease: evidence for coverage decisions in Thailand, Value Health, 2007 Jan-Feb; 10(1):1098-3015; 61-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Peritoneal dialysis vs. Palliative Management,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,677000,Thailand,2001,22226.88

4505,The cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate (LC) as a second-line therapy for hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients not achieving target phosphorus levels. METHODS: A cohort of ESRD patients not adequately maintained on calcium carbonate (CC) and three subgroups of patients with baseline phosphorus levels of 5.6 to 6.5 mg/dl, 6.6 to 7.8 mg/dl, and more than 7.9 mg/dl were modeled. The following policy options were considered: continued CC (Policy 1); LC trial-if successful continue LC, if unsuccessful switch to CC (Policy 2). The survival benefit of using second-line LC to improve phosphorus control has been extrapolated from the relationship between hyperphosphatemia and mortality. Lifetime UK National Health Service drug and monitoring costs, expected survival, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were examined (discounting at 3.5% per annum). RESULTS: Policy 2 had a cost-effectiveness ratio (cost/QALY) of pound25,033 relative to Policy 1. The results show it is particularly cost-effective to treat patients with phosphorus levels above 6.6 mg/dl. The outcomes did not vary significantly during the one-way sensitivity analysis carried out on important model parameters and assumptions except when the utility value for ESRD was decreased by more than 30%. CONCLUSIONS: Applying a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound30,000 per QALY, the model shows it is cost-effective to follow current treatment guidelines and treat all patients who are not adequately maintained on CC (serum phosphorus above 5.6 mg/dl) with second-line LC. This is particularly the case for patients with serum phosphorus above 6.6 mg/dl. Our estimates are probably conservative as the possible compliance difference in favor of LC and the reduced number of hypercalcemic events with LC relative to CC was not considered.",2007-01-03504,17261114,Value Health,Alan Brennan,2007,10 / 1,32-41,Yes,17261114,"Alan Brennan; Ron Akehurst; Sarah Davis; Hana Sakai; Victoria Abbott; The cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease, Value Health, 2007 Jan-Feb; 10(1):1098-3015; 32-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,8-week lanthanum carbonate (LC) trial period; if unsuccessful switch back to maintenance on calcium carbonate (CC) vs. Continued treatment with calcium carbonate (CC),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,25033,United Kingdom,2005,60388.42
4506,Cost-effectiveness of aprepitant for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy,"OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a significant problem for cancer patients. Aprepitant, a novel NK-1 receptor antagonist, is approved for use with 5-HT3 antagonists and corticosteroids to prevent CINV associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the cost-effectiveness of standard aprepitant use has not been established. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare three strategies for CINV: conventional treatment with a 5-HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid, conventional treatment plus aprepitant, and conventional treatment with aprepitant added after the onset of CINV. Data from published clinical trials provided probabilities and utilities for the model. Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Federal Supply Scale provided costs for medical resources and medications utilized. Resource use data were based on a randomized clinical trial and routine clinical practice. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each aprepitant strategy was calculated in US$ per healthy day equivalent (HDE) and converted to dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: Adding aprepitant after CINV occurred cost $264 per HDE ($96,333/QALY). The three-drug strategy cost $267/HDE with a 95% confidence range of $248-$305/HDE ($97,429/QALY; $90,396-$111,239/QALY). In univariate analyses, the most influential factors on the ICER were: the cost of aprepitant, the likelihood of delayed CINV without aprepitant, the likelihood of acute CINV with/without aprepitant, and the increase in HDE from avoiding CINV. CONCLUSIONS: Aprepitant provides modest incremental benefits compared with conventional management of CINV.

4509,Cost-effectiveness of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy in long-term use: economic evaluation based on a 9-year study in Finland,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (ccHRT) (Indivina) in postmenopausal women in Finland treated for up to nine consecutive years in the course of a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: In-study event data were accrued for cardiac and vascular events, cancers and fractures. These event incidence data were applied to first-year direct medical costs for these events, derived from published sources. Reference event incidence data were derived from hospital discharge records and relevant national registries for age-matched women (aged 50-70 years) in Finland with an assumed HRT usage rate of 40%. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as additional cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for women on ccHRT compared with the general population. All input data were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: The additional cost per QALY gained for ccHRT was less than 5000 euro throughout the nine calendar years examined and remained well below the threshold of acceptability of 50,000 euro in a range of sensitivity analyses. The lowest dose-combination of ccHRT examined improved quality of life at no greater cost than no treatment.

4510,Home-based medication review in older people: is it cost effective?,"BACKGROUND: Medication review by pharmacists is increasingly being implemented in the primary care setting and has been incorporated into the new pharmacy contract in the UK. This study aims to determine the cost effectiveness of home-based medication review in older people. METHODS: This economic evaluation was based on a randomised controlled trial (the HOMER [HOME-based medication Review] trial). Patients aged >80 years (n = 872) were recruited if admitted as an emergency to an acute or community hospital in Norfolk or Suffolk (any cause), returning to their own home or warden-controlled accommodation, and taking two or more drugs daily on discharge. Patients randomised to the intervention group received two home visits by a pharmacist within 2 and 8 weeks of discharge to educate patients and carers about their drugs, remove out-of-date drugs, inform GPs of drug reactions or interactions and inform the local pharmacist if an adherence aid was needed. The control arm received usual care. Economic evaluation was performed from the UK NHS perspective, with follow-up for 6 months and cost data from 2000. Resource use data were collected from hospital episode statistics and from a sample of GP records of trial participants. Intervention, hospital, ambulance and general practice costs were considered to determine average costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Use of the EQ-5D questionnaire permitted outcomes to be expressed as QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to calculate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Mortality and admission data were available for 829 of 855 patients included in the study (415 intervention and 414 control patients). Of those patients randomised to the intervention group, 358 had a medication review at a total intervention cost of 51,622 pound (or 124 pound per randomised patient). The intervention did not reduce hospital admissions. The average cost per intervention group patient was 1695 pound compared with 1424 pound for control patients. The incremental cost per life year gained through the intervention was 33,541 pound. The incremental cost per QALY gained in the intervention was 54,454 pound. Sensitivity analysis suggested a 25% probability that home-based medication review is cost effective using a threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY. CONCLUSION: The current policy imperative for implementing medicines review needs to be reconsidered in the light of the findings of this study: a small, non significant gain in quality of life, no reduction in hospital admissions and a low probability of cost effectiveness.",2007-01-03509,17249858,Pharmacoeconomics,Margaret Pacini,2007,25 / 2,171-80,Yes,17249858,"Margaret Pacini; Richard D Smith; Edward C F Wilson; Richard Holland; Home-based medication review in older people: is it cost effective?, Pharmacoeconomics, 2007; 25(2):1179-2027; 171-80",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,2 home educational visits by a pharmacist within 2 and 8 weeks of discharge vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,81 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,54454,United Kingdom,2000,124038.2
4511,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of anastrozole versus tamoxifen as primary adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: a US healthcare system perspective. The 5-year completed treatment analysis of the ATAC ('Arimidex', Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial","BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of anastrozole versus generic tamoxifen for primary adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer (EBC), from a US healthcare perspective. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was developed using the 5-year completed treatment analysis of the ATAC ('Arimidex', Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial (ISRCTN 18233230) to project outcomes for anastrozole and tamoxifen to 25 years. Resource utilization data were obtained primarily from published literature and a physician survey (including expert opinion from ATAC Steering Committee members). Drug costs were taken from published wholesale acquisition costs (anastrozole $6.56/day, generic tamoxifen $1.33/day). Other unit costs ($US 2003-4) were from standard sources. Utility estimates of relevant health states, used to compute quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), were collected using the standard gamble technique in a cross-sectional sample of 44 patients. Costs and benefits were discounted 3% annually. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1000 postmenopausal women with HR+ EBC, the model showed anastrozole treatment (versus tamoxifen) would lead to 257 QALYs gained (0.26 QALYs gained per patient), at an additional cost of $5.21 million over 25 years ($5,212 per patient). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen was $20,246 per QALY gained ($23,541 per life-year gained). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated a >90% probability that the cost per QALY gained with anastrozole would be <$50,000. Results were robust in a sensitivity analysis.

4512,Cost-effectiveness of genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing in HIV-infected patients with treatment failure,"BACKGROUND: Genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing (GRT) in HIV infection with drug resistant virus is recommended to optimize antiretroviral therapy, in particular in patients with virological failure. We estimated the clinical effect, cost and cost-effectiveness of using GRT as compared to expert opinion in patients with antiretroviral treatment failure. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of HIV disease to describe disease progression in HIV-infected patients with treatment failure and compared the incremental impact of GRT versus expert opinion to guide antiretroviral therapy. The analysis was conducted from the health care (discount rate 4%) and societal (discount rate 2%) perspective. Outcome measures included life-expectancy, quality-adjusted life-expectancy, health care costs, productivity costs and cost-effectiveness in US Dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Clinical and economic data were extracted from the large Swiss HIV Cohort Study and clinical trials. RESULTS: Patients whose treatment was optimized with GRT versus expert opinion had an increase in discounted life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy of three and two weeks, respectively.

4513,Cost-effectiveness of genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing in HIV-infected patients with treatment failure,"BACKGROUND: Genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing (GRT) in HIV infection with drug resistant virus is recommended to optimize antiretroviral therapy, in particular in patients with virological failure. We estimated the clinical effect, cost and cost-effectiveness of using GRT as compared to expert opinion in patients with antiretroviral treatment failure. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of HIV disease to describe disease progression in HIV-infected patients with treatment failure and compared the incremental impact of GRT versus expert opinion to guide antiretroviral therapy. The analysis was conducted from the health care (discount rate 4%) and societal (discount rate 2%) perspective. Outcome measures included life-expectancy, quality-adjusted life-expectancy, health care costs, productivity costs and cost-effectiveness in US Dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Clinical and economic data were extracted from the large Swiss HIV Cohort Study and clinical trials. RESULTS: Patients whose treatment was optimized with GRT versus expert opinion had an increase in discounted life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy of three and two weeks, respectively.

4532,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cetuximab/irinotecan vs active/best supportive care for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have failed previous chemotherapy treatment,"The treatment of colorectal cancer is rapidly becoming a significant financial burden to health-care systems within economically developed nations. A current challenge for oncologists and health-care payers is to integrate new, often high-cost, biologic therapies into clinical practice. Inherent to this process is the consideration of cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of cetuximab plus irinotecan with an appropriate comparator from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective. This economic evaluation is a trial-based study of cetuximab vs active/best supportive care. Effectiveness estimates for the treatment groups were modelled from key clinical trials. Cunningham et al (2004) compared cetuximab/irinotecan with cetuximab monotherapy; Cunningham et al (1998) compared irinotecan monotherapy in a second-line setting with supportive care. Modelling was necessary owing to an absence of head-to-head clinical trial data of cetuximab/irinotecan vs current standard care. Costs were calculated for the study drugs received, associated administration, palliative chemotherapy for patients in the standard care arm and other nonchemotherapy resources. The discounted life-expectancy of patients treated with cetuximab/irinotecan was 0.91 life-years, and 0.47 discounted life-years for patients receiving active/best supportive care. Patients treated with cetuximab/irinotecan accumulated mean additional costs of 18 901 pounds per patient relative to the comparator arm, with 11 802 pounds attributable to cetuximab. The incremental cost per life-year gained with cetuximab/irinotecan therapy compared with active/best supportive care was 42 975 pounds . The incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year gained was 57 608 pounds . The incremental cost per life-year gained for cetuximab/irinotecan is relatively high compared with other health-care interventions. However, this result should be considered in the context of a number of factors specific to the treated patient population.",2007-01-03519,17242694,Br J Cancer,N Starling,2007,96 / 2,206-12,No,17242694,"N Starling; D Tilden; J White; D Cunningham; Cost-effectiveness analysis of cetuximab/irinotecan vs active/best supportive care for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have failed previous chemotherapy treatment, Br J Cancer, 2007-Jan-29; 96(2):0007-0920; 206-12",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cetuximab plus irinotecan vs. Active/best supportive care (ASC/BSC),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.50,57608,United Kingdom,2004,144675.79
4533,Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators for arrhythmias: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVES: The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) for arrhythmias was assessed. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials that reported mortality outcomes associated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy in people at risk of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmias was undertaken. Economic evaluations were also sought. Inclusion criteria, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by standard methodology. A decision analytic model was constructed using best available evidence to determine cost-effectiveness in a UK setting. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials, two systematic reviews, and a meta-analysis met the inclusion criteria and were of variable quality. Evidence suggests that ICDs reduce mortality in both secondary and primary prevention, although the magnitude of benefit depends on baseline risk for sudden cardiac death. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranged from 52,000 UK pounds ($98,000) to over 200,000 UK pounds ($379,000), depending on mortality risk and assumptions made. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that ICDs reduce total mortality but may be cost-effective only in some subgroups of patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Further research is needed on risk stratification of patients in whom ICDs are most likely to be clinically and cost-effective.",2007-01-03522,17234018,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Jackie Bryant,2007,23 / 1,63-70,No,17234018,"Jackie Bryant; Hakan Brodin; Emma Loveman; Andrew Clegg; Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators for arrhythmias: a systematic review and economic evaluation, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2007; 23(1):0266-4623; 63-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,ICD vs. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,6.00,1.50,241739,United Kingdom,2002,522541.14

DESIGN: We developed a computer simulation Markov model to evaluate alternative melanoma screening strategies. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of the general population and siblings of patients with melanoma. Intervention We considered the following 4 strategies: background screening only, and screening 1 time, every 2 years, and annually, all beginning at age 50 years. Prevalence, incidence, and mortality data were taken from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Sibling risk, recurrence rates, and treatment costs were taken from the literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime costs. Cost-effectiveness ratios were in dollars per quality-adjusted life year (US dollars/QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the general population, screening 1 time, every 2 years, and annually saved 1.6, 4.4, and 5.2 QALYs per 1000 persons screened, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US dollars 10,100/QALY, US dollars 80,700/QALY, and US dollars 586,800/QALY, respectively.

RESULTS: In the general population, screening 1 time, every 2 years, and annually saved 1.6, 4.4, and 5.2 QALYs per 1000 persons screened, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US dollars 10,100/QALY, US dollars 80,700/QALY, and US dollars 586,800/QALY, respectively. In siblings of patients with melanoma (relative risk, 2.24 compared with the general population), 1-time, every-2-years, and annual screenings saved 3.6, 9.8, and 11.4 QALYs per 1000 persons screened, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US dollars 4000/QALY, US dollars 35,500/QALY, and US dollars 257,800/QALY, respectively. In higher risk siblings of patients with melanoma (relative risk, 5.56), screening was more cost-effective.

4543,Cost-utility analysis applied to the treatment of burn patients in a specialized center,"OBJECTIVE: To discover the total costs and quality of life of burn patients in a specialist center classified by diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). DESIGN: Prospective study of 5-year follow-up from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2001. SETTING: Burn Center of Valencia. PATIENTS: A total of 898 patients treated at the Burn Center of Valencia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital, extrahospital, caregiving, labor, and social costs of the burn patients grouped by DRG (code 457: extensive burns without operating room procedure; code 458: nonextensive burns with skin graft; code 459: nonextensive burns with wound debridement or other operating room procedure; code 460: nonextensive burns without operating room procedure; or code 472: extensive burns with operating room procedure) were studied. The costs were compared with those that the DRG system assigns. The quality of life of the patients at the end of the follow-up period was also studied. To measure quality of life, the EuroQol 5-Dimensions survey was used. Utility calculations and cost-utility analysis were undertaken according to life expectancy. RESULTS: The number of quality-adjusted life-years produced by the center was 13 577, with a mean quality-of-life level on release from the study of 0.87. The mean cost per patient, including the social and labor costs, was $95 551, with health care costs amounting to only 10%. The mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year was $686. CONCLUSIONS: The labor costs were the most important and amounted to 56%; together with the social costs, these constituted 85% of the total costs. The DRG code 456 was an option dominated by the remaining DRG codes 458 through 460 and 472.

4544,Optimizing choledocholithiasis management: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"HYPOTHESIS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is more cost-effective for managing incidental choledocholithiasis (CDL) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiogram (LC/IOC) than laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE). DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare ERCP with LCBDE. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the key contributors to cost-effectiveness between the 2 treatment options. SETTING: Costs were approached from the institutional perspective considering a typical patient undergoing LC/IOC at a large referral center. PATIENTS: The base case patient evaluated was a woman 18 years of age or older with symptomatic cholelithiasis and incidental CDL discovered at the time of LC/IOC. INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with drainage procedure performed after LC/IOC or LCBDE during LC/IOC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years gained, mean cost-effectiveness ratios, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, ERCP was the optimal treatment choice with a cost of $24 300 for 0.9 quality-adjusted life years gained compared with $28 400 and 0.88 quality-adjusted life years for LCBDE. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography remained the optimal strategy for CDL in multiway probabilistic sensitivity analysis. If LCBDE were performed and the cost of a potential operative case lost was $3100 or less and the cost of ERCP hospitalization was $18 000 or more, then LCBDE became the preferred treatment for CDL. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was both less costly and more effective than LCBDE.

4545,Cost-utility analysis of treatment algorithms for moderate grade vesicoureteral reflux using Markov models,"PURPOSE: The optimal treatment algorithm for vesicoureteral reflux remains controversial. Previous decision analyses have attempted to determine the best approach solely from the cost or cure perspective but have not combined the goals of minimizing treatment and disease burden. We incorporated these considerations into a contemporary, comprehensive analysis of treatment for vesicoureteral reflux. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined costs from the perspective of the medical institution, and utility from the perspective of parents of children with grades II and III vesicoureteral reflux. Cost-utility analysis using Markov modeling was performed to ascertain which of 5 treatment algorithms best minimized morbidity and cost. A higher utility value was based on minimizing treatment and disease burden. Measures of treatment and disease burden included duration of suppressive antibiotics, number of invasive studies, pyelonephritis episodes, endoscopic treatments and open operations. All variables were varied spanning realistic ranges during sensitivity analyses to determine threshold values. RESULTS: The protocol of no antibiotics or followup imaging yielded the best cost-utility for vesicoureteral reflux grades II and III. Sensitivity analysis of variables spanning realistic ranges demonstrated that utility penalties for invasive imaging and outpatient pyelonephritis were particularly important in determining the highest utility protocols, with threshold values ranging from -0.5 to -0.8.

4547,Cost effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Imatinib mesylate is the first effective therapy for advanced unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Adoption of this therapy in clinical practice is partly dependent on reimbursement by third-party payers in many countries. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of GIST. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model of GIST treatment was developed. Long- term survival and duration of imatinib mesylate benefit were projected by fitting curves to 52-month follow-up data from a phase II clinical trial of imatinib and projecting weekly probabilities of survival and continued treatment over 10 years. Weekly cost estimates in 2005 US dollars included cost of imatinib mesylate 400 mg/day ($US685), other medical services for imatinib mesylate-treated patients ($US359) and palliative care for patients in the end stage of GIST ($US2575). Utility associated with successful treatment was estimated at 0.935 and that of treatment failure and progressive disease at 0.875. Costs, life-years and quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated over the 10-year time horizon and discounted to treatment initiation at an annual rate of 3%. RESULTS: Imatinib mesylate therapy for unresectable GIST was projected to increase life expectancy to 5.8 years, an increase of 2.7 years over the control group. This translated into an increase of 1.9 QALYs at a marginal cost of $US74 369, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of $US38 723 per QALY. Cost effectiveness was not very sensitive to model parameters other than the cost of imatinib mesylate itself.

4548,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis in submassive pulmonary embolism,"BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy is controversial in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare health effects and costs of treatment with alteplase plus heparin sodium vs heparin alone in hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction by developing a Markov model and using data from clinical trials and administrative sources. RESULTS: Based on data from a recent randomized trial, we assumed that the risk of clinical deterioration requiring treatment escalation was almost 3 times higher in patients who received heparin alone (23.2% vs 7.6%) but that the risk of death was equal in the 2 cohorts (2.7%). Based on registry data, we assumed that the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was approximately 3 times higher in patients who received alteplase plus heparin (1.2% vs 0.4%). Under these and other assumptions, thrombolysis resulted in marginally higher total lifetime health care costs ($43,900 vs $43,300) and was slightly less effective (10.52 vs 10.57 quality-adjusted life-years) than treatment with heparin alone.

4555,The economics of routine childhood hepatitis A immunization in the United States: the impact of herd immunity,"OBJECTIVES: Because of the herd-immunity phenomenon, the benefits of immunization against hepatitis A extend beyond those received by those who are vaccinated. This analysis estimates the impact of herd immunity on the cost-effectiveness of routine hepatitis A immunization among US children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an economic model, the costs and benefits of hepatitis A immunization were estimated for immunizing all US children at age 1 year over a 10-year period starting in 2005. The future burden of disease from hepatitis A was also estimated with this model, and the fraction that would be prevented by herd immunity was modeled by using a previously published analysis of the relationship between hepatitis A vaccination coverage and declines in hepatitis A incidence. RESULTS: Without accounting for herd-immunity effects, the costs of routine immunization would average 32,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the first 10 cohorts immunized starting with the 2005 birth cohort. Herd-immunity effects would be expected to produce substantial additional benefits, lowering the cost of the immunization program to 1000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the first 10 cohorts. Herd-immunity benefits would be greatest for the first few cohorts, more than doubling the benefits of immunization, and would decline over time. In a univariate sensitivity analysis, estimates were most sensitive to vaccination costs but remained below 20,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year under all of the assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Herd-immunity effects more than double the savings from hepatitis A immunization during the first 10 years of the program. After accounting for these effects, immunization is close to cost-neutral on a cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year basis.",2007-01-03537,17200247,Pediatrics,Gregory L Armstrong,2007,119 / 1,e22-9,No,17200247,"Gregory L Armstrong; Kaafee Billah; David B Rein; Katherine A Hicks; Kathleen E Wirth; Beth P Bell; The economics of routine childhood hepatitis A immunization in the United States: the impact of herd immunity, Pediatrics, 2007-Jan; 119(1):1098-4275; e22-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine childhood hepatitis A immunization vs. No immunization,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1384.36,United States,2005,1834.56
4556,Cost-effectiveness of routine childhood vaccination for hepatitis A in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: Economic analysis is an important component in formulating national policy. We evaluated the economic impact of hepatitis A vaccination of all US children ages 12 to 23 months as compared with no vaccination and with current implementation of the preexisting (issued in 1999), regional policy. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of hepatitis A that followed a single cohort from birth in 2005 through death or age 95 years. From the societal perspective, the model compared the outcomes that resulted from routine vaccination at age 1 year to 2 scenarios: no hepatitis A vaccination and hepatitis A vaccination at levels observed in 2003 under the preexisting policy. We evaluated the economic impact of vaccination nationwide, in areas where vaccination was already recommended, and in areas where no previous recommendation existed. RESULTS: Without childhood vaccination, the approximately 4 million children in the 2005 birth cohort would be expected over their lifetimes to have 199,000 hepatitis A virus infections, including 74,000 cases of acute hepatitis A and 82 deaths, resulting in 134 million dollars in hepatitis A-related medical costs and productivity losses. Compared with no vaccination, routine vaccination at age 1 year would prevent 172,000 infections, at a cost of 28,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year saved. Compared with maintaining the levels of hepatitis A vaccination under the preexisting regional policy, routine vaccination at age 1 year would prevent an additional 112,000 infections, at a cost of 45,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year saved. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of nationwide hepatitis A vaccination compared with no vaccination, and the incremental cost-effectiveness of this recommendation compared with preexisting recommendations, is similar to that of other accepted public health interventions. In October 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended extending hepatitis A immunization to all US children ages 12 to 23 months.",2007-01-03538,17200237,Pediatrics,David B Rein,2007,119 / 1,e12-21,No,17200237,"David B Rein; Katherine A Hicks; Kathleen E Wirth; Kaafee Billah; Lyn Finelli; Anthony E Fiore; Thomas J Hoerger; Beth P Bell; Gregory L Armstrong; Cost-effectiveness of routine childhood vaccination for hepatitis A in the United States, Pediatrics, 2007-Jan; 119(1):1098-4275; e12-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine childhood hepatitis A vaccination vs. No vaccination and current implementation of the preexisting regional policy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,28000,United States,2006,35945.97
4557,Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients failing oral agents: cost-effectiveness of biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 vs. insulin glargine in the US,"OBJECTIVES: To project the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of treatment with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 70/30, 30% soluble and 70% protaminated insulin aspart) vs. insulin glargine in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes patients failing to achieve glycemic control with oral antidiabetic agents alone (OADs). METHODS: Baseline patient characteristics and treatment effect data from the recent 'INITIATE' clinical trial served as input to a peer-reviewed, validated Markov/Monte-Carlo simulation model. INITIATE demonstrated improvements in HbA1c favouring BIAsp 70/30 vs. glargine (-0.43%; p < 0.005) and greater efficacy in reaching glycaemic targets among patients poorly controlled on OAD therapy. Effects on life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications and direct medical costs (2004 USD) were projected over 35 years. Clinical outcomes and costs were discounted at a rate of 3.0% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Improvements in glycaemic control were projected to lead to gains in LE (0.19 +/- 0.24 years) and QALE (0.19 +/- 0.17 years) favouring BIAsp 70/30 vs. glargine. Treatment with BIAsp 70/30 was also associated with reductions in the cumulative incidences of diabetes-related complications, notably in renal and retinal conditions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $46 533 per quality-adjusted life year gained with BIAsp 70/30 vs. glargine (for patients with baseline HbA1c >/= 8.5%, it was $34 916). Total lifetime costs were compared to efficacy rates in both arms as a ratio, which revealed that the lifetime cost per patient treated successfully to target HbA1c levels of <7.0% and </= 6.5% were $80 523 and $93 242 lower with BIAsp 70/30 than with glargine, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with BIAsp 70/30 was projected to be cost-effective for patients with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on OADs alone compared to glargine. Treatment with BIAsp 70/30 was estimated to represent an appropriate investment of healthcare dollars in the management of type 2 diabetes.",2007-01-03539,17199725,Diabetes Obes Metab,J A Ray,2007,9 / 1,103-13,No,17199725,"J A Ray; W J Valentine; S Roze; L Nicklasson; D Cobden; P Raskin; A Garber; A J Palmer; Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients failing oral agents: cost-effectiveness of biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 vs. insulin glargine in the US, Diabetes Obes Metab, 2007-Jan; 9(1):1462-8902; 103-13",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,BIAsp 70/30 vs. Insulin glargine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,46533,United States,2004,63754.64
4558,A cost-utility analysis of multivitamin and multimineral supplements in men and women aged 65 years and over,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: As people age there is a progressive dysregulation of the immune system that may lead to an increased risk of infections, which may precipitate hospital admission in people with chronic heart or respiratory diseases. Mineral and vitamin supplementation in older people could therefore influence infections in older people. However, the evidence from the available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is mixed. The aim of the study was to assess the relative efficiency of multivitamin and multimineral supplementation compared with no supplementation. METHODS: Cost-utility analysis alongside an RCT. Participants aged 65 years or over from six general practices in Grampian, Scotland, were studied. They were randomised to one tablet daily of either a multivitamin and multimineral supplement or matching placebo. Exclusion criteria were use of mineral, vitamin or fish oil supplements in the previous 3 months (1 month for water soluble vitamins), vitamin B12 injection in the last 3 months. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ten participants were recruited (454 placebo and 456 supplementation). Use of health service resources and costs were similar between the two groups. The supplementation arm was more costly although this was not statistically significant ( pound15 per person, 95% CI-3.75 to 34.95). After adjusting for minimisation and baseline EQ-5D scores supplementation was associated with fewer QALYs per person (-0.018, 95% CI-0.04 to 0.002). It was highly unlikely that supplementation would be considered cost effective.

4559,Lifestyle interventions are cost-effective in people with different levels of diabetes risk: results from a modeling study,"OBJECTIVE: In the current study we explore the long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness of both a community-based lifestyle program for the general population (community intervention) and an intensive lifestyle intervention for obese adults, implemented in a health care setting (health care intervention). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Short-term intervention effects on BMI and physical activity were estimated from the international literature. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment Chronic Diseases Model was used to project lifetime health effects and effects on health care costs for minimum and maximum estimates of short-term intervention effects. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a health care perspective and included intervention costs and related and unrelated medical costs. Effects and costs were discounted at 1.5 and 4.0% annually. RESULTS: One new case of diabetes per 20 years was prevented for every 7-30 participants in the health care intervention and for every 300-1,500 adults in the community intervention. Intervention costs needed to prevent one new case of diabetes (per 20 years) were lower for the community intervention (2,000-9,000 euros) than for the health care intervention (5,000-21,000 euros). The cost-effectiveness ratios were 3,100-3,900 euros per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for the community intervention and 3,900-5,500 euros per QALY for the health care intervention.

4561,Cost effectiveness of palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in high-risk children: a UK analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab (a preventative treatment against severe respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] infection) in children at high risk of hospitalisation, i.e. preterm infants < or = 35 weeks gestation, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and children with congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS: A decision tree model was developed employing data sources from the published literature, palivizumab clinical trials, official UK price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was no prophylaxis. The primary perspective of the study was that of the UK NHS. In a societal perspective scenario analysis, the future lost productivity of a child resulting from RSV-related mortality (indirect costs) was also included. The cost of administration of palivizumab, hospital care for RSV infections and the cost of asthma treatment were included. The analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up period in order to capture the impact of palivizumab on long-term morbidity and mortality resulting from an RSV infection. The primary efficacy outcome in the palivizumab clinical trials was the number of RSV hospitalisations avoided, which was extrapolated to effectiveness outcomes, i.e. number of life-years gained and number of QALYs. Costs and effects were discounted by 3.5%. RESULTS: In preterm infants and children with BPD, prophylaxis with palivizumab compared with no prophylaxis had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 7042 pounds/QALY without discounting outcomes, increasing to 16,720 pounds/QALY after discounting. In babies with CHD, the use of palivizumab resulted in an ICER of 2427 pounds/QALY without discounting outcomes and 6664 pounds/QALY after discounting.

4562,Cost effectiveness of palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in high-risk children: a UK analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab (a preventative treatment against severe respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] infection) in children at high risk of hospitalisation, i.e. preterm infants < or = 35 weeks gestation, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and children with congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS: A decision tree model was developed employing data sources from the published literature, palivizumab clinical trials, official UK price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was no prophylaxis. The primary perspective of the study was that of the UK NHS. In a societal perspective scenario analysis, the future lost productivity of a child resulting from RSV-related mortality (indirect costs) was also included. The cost of administration of palivizumab, hospital care for RSV infections and the cost of asthma treatment were included. The analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up period in order to capture the impact of palivizumab on long-term morbidity and mortality resulting from an RSV infection. The primary efficacy outcome in the palivizumab clinical trials was the number of RSV hospitalisations avoided, which was extrapolated to effectiveness outcomes, i.e. number of life-years gained and number of QALYs. Costs and effects were discounted by 3.5%. RESULTS: In preterm infants and children with BPD, prophylaxis with palivizumab compared with no prophylaxis had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 7042 pounds/QALY without discounting outcomes, increasing to 16,720 pounds/QALY after discounting. In babies with CHD, the use of palivizumab resulted in an ICER of 2427 pounds/QALY without discounting outcomes and 6664 pounds/QALY after discounting. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. A scenario analysis showed that the inclusion of indirect costs leads to further improvement in the cost-effectiveness outcomes for palivizumab.

4563,A lifetime modelled economic evaluation comparing pioglitazone and rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Adding pioglitazone or rosiglitazone to existing therapy are alternative treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have insufficient glycaemic control while receiving the maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy. Our objective was to develop a lifetime model of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its sequelae in order to compare the costs and benefits of pioglitazone versus rosiglitazone in combination with metformin. METHODS: A decision-analytic model employing a first order Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov process was constructed. The model incorporated surrogate outcome measures from a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) [n = 802] that compared the glycaemic and lipid control of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone monotherapy. These efficacy data were used with a recently validated and peer-reviewed UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) algorithm to simulate the progression of these surrogate outcomes to final health outcomes, including quality of life (QOL) and mortality, and to calculate the risks of diabetic complications and death. The model perspective was of the UK NHS and included direct healthcare costs only (pounds, 2004/5 values). Patient outcomes measured in the model included life-expectancy (LE) and QALYs. The base-case analysis was run for 56-year-old male Caucasions with a haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of 7.57% and a body mass index of 33.14 kg/m(2). RESULTS: Patients treated with pioglitazone experienced a reduction in the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (TC : HDL-C) ratio of 0.34, whereas the TC : HDL-C ratio increased by 0.65 in those receiving rosiglitazone (p < 0.001). The HbA(1c) profile was similar between the treatment groups (p = 0.13), as were other known risk factors for diabetes complications. The lifetime healthcare costs per patient estimated by the model were 9585 pounds for pioglitazone and 10,299 pounds for rosiglitazone. Patients treated with pioglitazone had a discounted LE of 8.83 years versus 8.79 years for those treated with rosiglitazone. Patients treated with pioglitazone also gained additional QALYs (6.8070 vs 6.7686). With improved health outcomes and lower costs, treatment with pioglitazone dominated rosiglitazone treatment. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the only large head-to-head RCT comparing rosiglitazone and pioglitazone suggests that more favourable changes in serum lipid profiles in patients treated with pioglitazone translate into improved health outcomes in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality and greater gains in QOL. In addition, this analysis indicates that treatment with pioglitazone is associated with lower costs than rosiglitazone. Therefore, in the UK, adjunctive pioglitazone may represent a cost-effective treatment choice for patients with type 2 diabetes who have insufficient glycaemic control while receiving the maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy.",2007-01-03545,17192117,Pharmacoeconomics,Dominic P Tilden,2007,25 / 1,39-54,Yes,17192117,"Dominic P Tilden; Segundo Mariz; Gillies O'Bryan-Tear; Julia Bottomley; Alexander Diamantopoulos; A lifetime modelled economic evaluation comparing pioglitazone and rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2007; 25(1):1179-2027; 39-54",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Pioglitazone and metformin, followed by insulin and metformin when patients were deemed to have insufficient glycemic control vs. Rosiglitazone and metformin, followed by insulin and metformin when patients were deemed to have insufficient glycemic control",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-18593.75,United Kingdom,2005,-44854.68
4564,Using economic analysis to evaluate the potential of multimodality therapy for elderly patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,"PURPOSE: Development of new and expensive drugs with activity against pancreatic cancer has made economic considerations more relevant to treatment decision-making for advanced disease. Economic modeling can be used to explore the potential of such novel therapies and to inform clinical trial design. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of radiation plus fluorouracil (RT-FU) relative to no treatment in elderly patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and to determine the economic potential of radiation plus gemcitabine (RT-GEM), a novel regimen for this disease. We used the SEER-Medicare database to estimate effectiveness and costs supplemented by data from the literature where necessary. RESULTS: Relative to no treatment, RT-FU was associated with a cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $68,724/QALY in the base case analysis. Compared with RT-FU, the ICER for RT-GEM was below $100,000/QALY when the risk of dying with the new regimen was <85% than with the standard regimen. However, >1,000 subjects would be necessary to demonstrate this level of efficacy in a randomized trial. The ICER of RT-GEM was most sensitive to utility values, and, at lower efficacy levels, to costs of gemcitabine and treatment-related toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with LAPC, RT-FU is a cost-effective alternative to no treatment. The novel regimen of RT-GEM is likely to be cost-effective at any clinically meaningful benefit, but quality-of-life issues, drug acquisition, and toxicity-related costs may be relevant, especially at lower efficacy levels.",2007-01-03547,17189071,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,Monika K Krzyzanowska,2007,67 / 1,211-8,No,17189071,"Monika K Krzyzanowska; Craig C Earle; Karen M Kuntz; Jane C Weeks; Using economic analysis to evaluate the potential of multimodality therapy for elderly patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2007-Jan-01; 67(1):0360-3016; 211-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radiation plus concurrent fluorouracil-based chemotherapy vs. No treatment,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,68724,United States,2005,91072.85
4565,Cost effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir compared with atazanavir in antiretroviral-naive patients: modelling the combined effects of HIV and heart disease,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The choice of initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) should take into account the need to balance efficacy, adverse event risk, resistance concerns for the treatment of HIV and treatment costs. Increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) may be of special concern in the selection of HAART therapy, because differences in potential CHD risk have been reported for different regimens. This study aimed to estimate the long-term combined effects of HIV disease and antiretroviral (ARV)-related risk for CHD on quality-adjusted survival and healthcare costs for ARV-naive patients. METHODS: A previously validated Markov model was updated and supplemented with the Framingham CHD risk equation. In the model, the average patient was male, aged 37 years and had a baseline 10-year CHD risk of 4.6%. Patients started with either lopinavir/ritonavir or unboosted atazanavir as the first protease inhibitor (PI). Clinical trial data were used to estimate the differences between these two therapies. The daily PI costs were $US18.52 for lopinavir/ritonavir and $US22.08 for atazanavir. Other costs were estimated from Medicaid billing databases and average wholesale drug price reports. All model costs were reported as the 2004 present value in US currency. The model's time horizon reflected a patient's lifetime, and the perspective of the analysis was that of the healthcare system and did not include indirect costs in the model cost estimates. Various CHD risk levels were tested in the sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base case, the model predicted a median duration of initial PI regimen of 5.6 years for lopinavir/ritonavir and 3.8 years for atazanavir. Over 10 years, patients who started on atazanavir had 30 additional AIDS events per 100 patients. Only 0.7 additional CHD events per 100 patients occurred for those who started on lopinavir/ritonavir. The model estimated 10-year total healthcare cost savings of $US12,543 per patient in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. The lifetime incremental cost effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir versus atazanavir was $US6797 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSION: Lopinavir/ritonavir is a highly cost-effective regimen relative to atazanavir for the treatment of HIV. The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on long-term CHD risk was minimal compared with the increased risk of AIDS/death projected for a less efficacious first PI regimen. The cost of lipid-lowering drugs and treatment of CHD for patients taking the lopinavir/ritonavir regimen was only 1.2% of the cost of AIDS care per person, which was too small to have a significant effect on the overall cost savings with lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. Thus, a decision to forgo potency and durability in an ARV regimen for an ARV-naive patient in favour of a less potent regimen with an improved lipid profile may prove to be costly over time, in terms of both budget impact and life expectancy.",2007-01-03550,17177581,Clin Drug Investig,Kit N Simpson,2007,27 / 1,67-74,Yes,17177581,"Kit N Simpson; Michelle P Luo; Elinor C Chumney; Martin S King; Scott Brun; Cost effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir compared with atazanavir in antiretroviral-naive patients: modelling the combined effects of HIV and heart disease, Clin Drug Investig, 2007; 27(1):1173-2563; 67-74",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lopinavir/ritonavir combination treatment vs. Atazanavir single therapy,Not Stated,37 Years,37 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,6797,United States,2004,9312.54

We developed a cost-effectiveness model based on patient level data from a 30-day international, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase II trial. The data were supplemented with secondary data from UK sources to estimate lifetime costs and benefits. The model produced a baseline estimate of the incremental cost per life year gained with recombinant activated factor VII relative to placebo of 12 613 UK pounds. The incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained was 18 825 UK pounds. These estimates are sensitive to the choice of discount rate and health state utility values used.

GOAL: The goal of this study was to determine the economic feasibility of hospitalizing adolescents and young women for PID. STUDY DESIGN: The authors conducted a Markov decision model, estimating the cost-effectiveness of hospitalization compared with outpatient therapy for mild to moderate PID for adolescents and young women, calculating costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained under various assumptions about hospitalization effects on complications. RESULTS: If hospitalization decreases PID complications by 10%, 20%, or 30%, the cost/QALY gained is 145,000 dollars, 67,400 dollars, or 42,400 dollars, respectively, compared with outpatient therapy. Assumptions about hospitalization effects on the development of chronic pelvic pain heavily weight the analysis; costs/QALY gained by hospitalization increase considerably if chronic pain is unaffected.

4568,A cost-utility analysis of treatment for acute childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),"BACKGROUND: The primary objective in the treatment of acute pediatric idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is to rapidly increase the platelet count. METHODS: We built a decision analytic model to evaluate the cost-utility of four commonly used treatment strategies: intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) 0.8 g/kg, anti-D 75 mcg/kg, methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg for 3 days), and prednisone (4 mg/kg/day for 4 days). In our baseline model, all children were hospitalized upon presentation, and discharged once the platelet count reached > or =20,000. We performed a literature search to estimate time to platelet count > or =20,000 for each strategy, as well as the probability of side effects. We obtained cost data and quality of life measures from institutional and published data sources. RESULTS: Total cost of one-time treatment for a 20 kg child was US dollars 786 with prednisone, US dollars 1,346 with methylprednisolone, US dollars 2,035 with anti-D, and US dollars 2,492 with IVIG. The strategies of IVIG and methylprednisolone were less effective and more expensive than anti-D and prednisone, respectively. Although anti-D caused the most rapid rise in platelet counts, the incremental cost-utility ratio (costs incurred by using anti-D instead of prednisone divided by health benefit of using anti-D instead of prednisone) was US dollars 7,616 per day of severe thrombocytopenia avoided, primarily due to the much higher medication cost of anti-D. Utilizing an outpatient model, the cost difference between anti-D and prednisone was even more striking. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit of anti-D is offset by a substantial cost increase.

4573,Implementation of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis and septic shock: A decision analysis,"Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) reduced mortality from septic shock in a single-center trial. However, implementation of EGDT faces several barriers, including perceived costs and logistic difficulties. We conducted a decision analysis to explore the potential costs and consequences of EGDT implementation.Estimates of effectiveness and resource use were based on data from the original trial and published sources. Implementation costs and lifetime projections were modeled from published sources and tested in sensitivity analyses. We generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from the hospital (short-term) and U.S. societal (lifetime) perspectives, excluding nonhealthcare costs, and applying a 3% annual discount.Simulation of an average U.S. emergency department.Total of 1,000 simulation cohorts (n = 263 for each cohort) of adult patients with severe sepsis/septic shock.EGDT under three alternative implementation strategies: emergency department-based, mobile intensive care unit team, and intensive care unit-based (after emergency department transfer).For an average emergency department, we estimated 91 cases per yr, start-up costs from $12,973 (intensive care unit-based) to $26,952 (emergency department-based), and annual outlay of $100,113. EGDT reduced length of stay such that net hospital costs fell approximately 22.9% ($8,413-$8,978). EGDT implementation had a 99.4% to 99.8% probability of being dominant (saved lives and costs) from the hospital perspective, and cost from $2,749 (intensive care unit-based) to $7019 (emergency department-based) per quality-adjusted life-yr with 96.7% to 97.7% probability of being <$20,000 per quality-adjusted life-yr from the societal perspective.

All relevant health states were modeled during a patient's expected lifespan. Outcome measures were mortality, the proportion of patients requiring a colostomy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and costs.

4579,The cost-utility of rotavirus vaccination with Rotarix (RIX4414) in the Netherlands,"The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-utility of mass vaccination of 0-4-year-old children with Rotarix in the Netherlands. We used a Markov process with Dutch data on incidence, resource use and costs (GP, hospitalisation, productivity loss and household costs) to compare vaccination to conventional treatment from a societal perspective. Utility loss due to rotavirus-induced diarrhoea was measured using EQ5D, with GPs and paediatricians serving as proxies to fill out the questions. As the costs of a vaccination course ranged from 90 euro to 100 euro per child, the cost-utility ratio varied from 21,900 euro to 35,076 euro per QALY gained.

4580,Cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood vaccination against rotavirus in France,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routine childhood vaccination by new vaccines against rotavirus in France. METHODS: We constructed a Markov decision tree to compare two alternatives: ""no vaccination"" and ""vaccination"". A hypothetical birth cohort of 750,000 children was followed until 3 years of age. First, the disease burden without vaccine was estimated using data from French databases and medical literature. Incidence rates in unvaccinated children were modelled as a function of age and seasons. Next, using data from the medical literature, the vaccine's protective effect on rotavirus diarrhoea was considered. RESULTS: A routine universal rotavirus immunization programme was estimated capable of annually avoiding 89,000 cases of diarrhoea, 10,500 hospitalizations, and 8 deaths. At a vaccination cost of euro 150/course, assuming 75% vaccine coverage, the programme would cost euro 95 million and involve a net loss of euro 68 million to the health care system. The vaccination programme would cost euro 298,000/year of life saved, and euro 138,000/QALY saved. Key variables affecting the results were disease incidence, mortality rates and vaccine price. CONCLUSION: In France, childhood rotavirus vaccination with new anti-rotavirus vaccines would reduce the morbidity burden of rotavirus infection, but would not be cost-effective unless the price of vaccine decreased considerably.",2008-01-02895,18166250,Vaccine,H Melliez,2008,26 / 5,706-15,Yes,18166250,"H Melliez; D Levybruhl; P Y Boelle; B Dervaux; S Baron; Y Yazdanpanah; D Levybruhl; P Y Boelle; B Dervaux; S Baron; Y Yazdanpanah; Cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood vaccination against rotavirus in France, Vaccine, 2008-Jan-30; 26(5):1873-2518; 706-15",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine childhood rotavirus vaccination vs. No vaccine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,138693,Euro,2005,228801.75
4581,The cost-effectiveness of alendronate in the management of osteoporosis,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK has recently issued health economic appraisals for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fracture that are more restrictive than previous guidelines for the management of osteoporosis despite a marked reduction of the cost of intervention. The aim of the present study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of the bisphosphonate, alendronate for the prevention and treatment of fractures associated with osteoporosis. A second aim was to investigate reasons for any disparities in cost-effectiveness between our findings and the NICE appraisals. We compared the effects of alendronate 70 mg weekly by mouth for 5 years with no treatment in postmenopausal women with clinical risk factors for fracture and computed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using a lifetime simulation model based on Markov cohort methodology. A sensitivity analysis examined other common interventions. Using a threshold of pound sterling 30,000 and pound sterling 20,000 per quality of life-year (QALY) gained to determine cost-effectiveness, alendronate was cost-effective for the primary prevention of fracture in women with osteoporosis irrespective of age as was treatment of women with a prior fragility fracture irrespective of BMD. Cost-effective scenarios were also found in women with strong risk factors for fracture with a bone mineral density value above the threshold for osteoporosis.

4588,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of laparoscopic gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, and nonoperative weight loss interventions","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are the two most commonly performed bariatric procedures. Although both procedures likely reduce healthcare expenditures related to the resolution of co-morbid conditions, they have different rates of perioperative risks and different rates of associated weight loss. We designed a model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of these procedures compared with nonoperative weight loss interventions and with each other. METHODS: We used a deterministic, payer-perspective model comparing the lifetime expected costs and outcomes of LAGB, LRYGB, and nonoperative treatment. The major endpoints were survival, health-related quality of life, and weight loss. Life expectancy and lifetime medical costs were calculated across age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) strata using previously published data. RESULTS: For both men and women, LRYGB and LAGB were cost-effective at <$25,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) even when evaluating the full range of baseline BMI and estimates of adverse outcomes, weight loss, and costs.

Although both procedures likely reduce healthcare expenditures related to the resolution of co-morbid conditions, they have different rates of perioperative risks and different rates of associated weight loss. We designed a model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of these procedures compared with nonoperative weight loss interventions and with each other. METHODS: We used a deterministic, payer-perspective model comparing the lifetime expected costs and outcomes of LAGB, LRYGB, and nonoperative treatment.
