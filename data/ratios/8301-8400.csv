8301,Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computed tomography screening for coronary artery calcium in asymptomatic individuals.,"The aim of this study was to assess the (cost-) effectiveness of screening asymptomatic individuals at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) for coronary artery calcium with computed tomography (CT).Coronary artery calcium on CT improves prediction of CHD.A Markov model was developed on the basis of the Rotterdam Study. Four strategies were evaluated: 1) current practice; 2) current prevention guidelines for cardiovascular disease; 3) CT screening for coronary calcium; and 4) statin therapy for all individuals. Asymptomatic individuals at intermediate risk of CHD were simulated over their remaining lifetime. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated.In men, CT screening was more effective and more costly than the other 3 strategies (CT vs. current practice: +0.13 QALY [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01 to 0.26], +$4,676 [95% CI: $3,126 to $6,339]; CT vs. statin therapy: +0.04 QALY [95% CI: -0.02 to 0.13], +$1,951 [95% CI: $1,170 to $2,754]; and CT vs. current guidelines: +0.02 QALY [95% CI: -0.04 to 0.09], +$44 [95% CI: -$441 to $486]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CT calcium screening was $48,800/QALY gained. In women, CT screening was more effective and more costly than current practice (+0.13 QALY [95% CI: 0.02 to 0.28], +$4,663 [95% CI: $3,120 to $6,277]) and statin therapy (+0.03 QALY [95% CI: -0.03 to 0.12], +$2,273 [95% CI: $1,475 to $3,109]). However, implementing current guidelines was more effective compared with CT screening (+0.02 QALY [95% CI: -0.03 to 0.07]), only a little more expensive (+$297 [95% CI: -$8 to $633]), and had a lower cost per additional QALY ($33,072/QALY vs. $35,869/QALY).

8307,Comparison of stratified primary care management for low back pain with current best practice (STarT Back): a randomised controlled trial.,"Back pain remains a challenge for primary care internationally. One model that has not been tested is stratification of the management according to the patient's prognosis (low, medium, or high risk). We compared the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stratified primary care (intervention) with non-stratified current best practice (control).1573 adults (aged =18 years) with back pain (with or without radiculopathy) consultations at ten general practices in England responded to invitations to attend an assessment clinic. Eligible participants were randomly assigned by use of computer-generated stratified blocks with a 2:1 ratio to intervention or control group. Primary outcome was the effect of treatment on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at 12 months. In the economic evaluation, we focused on estimating incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health-care costs related to back pain. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN37113406.851 patients were assigned to the intervention (n=568) and control groups (n=283). Overall, adjusted mean changes in RMDQ scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 4 months (4?7 [SD 5?9] vs 3?0 [5?9], between-group difference 1?81 [95% CI 1?06-2?57]) and at 12 months (4?3 [6?4] vs 3?3 [6?2], 1?06 [0?25-1?86]), equating to effect sizes of 0?32 (0?19-0?45) and 0?19 (0?04-0?33), respectively. At 12 months, stratified care was associated with a mean increase in generic health benefit (0?039 additional QALYs) and cost savings (?240?01 vs ?274?40) compared with the control group.The results show that a stratified approach, by use of prognostic screening with matched pathways, will have important implications for the future management of back pain in primary care.Arthritis Research UK.",2011-01-07907,21963002,Lancet,Jonathan C Hill,2011,378 /,1560-71,No,21963002,"Jonathan C Hill; David G T Whitehurst; Martyn Lewis; Stirling Bryan; Kate M Dunn; Nadine E Foster; Kika Konstantinou; Chris J Main; Elizabeth Mason; Simon Somerville; Gail Sowden; Kanchan Vohora; Elaine M Hay; Comparison of stratified primary care management for low back pain with current best practice (STarT Back): a randomised controlled trial., Lancet, ; 378 ():0140-6736; 1560-71",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stratified primary care (STarT Back Tool classification) according to the estimated risk of poor prognosis. vs. Usual care: non-stratified current best practice for back pain.,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-18189.49,United Kingdom,2009,-31772.24
8308,"Cost-effectiveness of Palivizumab for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in High-risk Children, Based on Long-term Epidemiologic Data From Austria.","OBJECTIVE:: To assess the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in infants at high risk for severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection, such as premature infants, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and those with congenital heart disease, based on long-term epidemiologic data from Austria. METHODS:: A decision-tree model was used, and the analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up investigating cost-effectiveness of palivizumab versus no RSV infection prevention. The primary perspective of the study was that of the healthcare system, the second that of society. Cost and effects were discounted by 5%. The base case analysis included only direct medical costs, and a scenario analysis included various indirect costs. RESULTS:: Analyses were based on epidemiologic data on a total of 1579 children hospitalized because of RSV lower respiratory tract infection during 16 seasons. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the first outcome measure (life years gained) amounted to discounted costs of &OV0556;34,956 (for all preterm infants), &OV0556;35,056 (for <33 weeks' gestational age [wGA] infants), &OV0556;35,233 (for 33-35 wGA infants), &OV0556;35,611 (for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and &OV0556;8956 (for infants with congenital heart disease).

8316,Cost-utility analysis of minimally invasive versus open multilevel hemilaminectomy for lumbar stenosis,"STUDY DESIGN: Two-year cost-utility study comparing minimally invasive (MIS) versus open multilevel hemilaminectomy in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether MIS versus open multilevel hemilaminectomy for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is a cost-effective advancement in lumbar decompression surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MIS-multilevel hemilaminectomy for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis allows for effective treatment of back and leg pain while theoretically minimizing blood loss, tissue injury, and postoperative recovery. No studies have evaluated comprehensive healthcare costs associated with multilevel hemilaminectomy procedures, nor assessed cost-effectiveness of MIS versus open multilevel hemilaminectomy. METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive patients with lumbar stenosis undergoing multilevel hemilaminectomy through an MIS paramedian tubular approach (n=27) versus midline open approach (n=27) were included. Total back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and health state values [quality adjusted life years (QALYs), calculated from EuroQuol-5D with US valuation] were assessed after 2-year follow-up. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost) and work-day losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). Difference in mean total cost per QALY gained for MIS versus open hemilaminectomy was assessed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER: COST(MIS)-COST(OPEN)/QALY(MIS)-QALY(OPEN)). RESULTS: MIS versus open cohorts were similar at baseline. MIS and open hemilaminectomy were associated with an equivalent cumulative gain of 0.72 QALYs 2 years after surgery. Mean direct medical costs, indirect societal costs, and total 2-year cost ($23,109 vs. $25,420; P=0.21) were similar between MIS and open hemilaminectomy. MIS versus open approach was associated with similar total costs and utility, making it a cost equivalent technology compared with the traditional open approach. CONCLUSIONS: MIS versus open multilevel hemilaminectomy was associated with similar cost over 2 years while providing equivalent improvement in QALYs. In our experience, MIS versus open multilevel hemilaminectomy is a cost equivalent technology for patients with lumbar stenosis-associated radicular pain.",2011-01-07912,21959840,J Spinal Disord Tech,Scott L Parker,2013,26 / 1,,No,21959840,"Scott L Parker; Owoicho Adogwa; Brandon J Davis; Erin Fulchiero; Oran Aaronson; Joseph Cheng; Clinton J Devin; Matthew J McGirt; Cost-utility analysis of minimally invasive versus open multilevel hemilaminectomy for lumbar stenosis, J Spinal Disord Tech , 2013 Feb; 26(1):1539-2465",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Minimally invasive (MIS) hemilaminectomy vs. Open hemilaminectomy,Not Stated,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2009,Not Stated

8321,The value of atorvastatin over the product life cycle in the United States.,"US health care reform mandates the reduction of wasteful health care spending while maintaining quality of care. Introducing new drugs into crowded therapeutic classes may be viewed as offering ""me-too"" (new drugs with a similar mechanism of action compared to existing drugs) drugs without incremental benefit. This article presents an analysis of the incremental costs and benefits of atorvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent.This analysis models the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin over the product life cycle.The yearly cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin compared to simvastatin was modeled from 1997 to 2030 from the point of view of a US third-party payer. Estimates for incremental costs (in US $) and effects (in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events were taken from previously published literature and adjusted for changes in drug prices over time. Estimates of total statin use were derived using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine variations in study parameters, including drug prices, indications, and discount rates.Assuming increasing statin use over time (with a mean of 1.07 million new users per year) and a 3% discount rate, the cumulative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of atorvastatin versus simvastatin ranged from cost-savings at release to a maximum of $45,066/QALY after 6 years of generic simvastatin use in 2012. Over the full modeled life cycle (1997-2030), the cumulative ICER of atorvastatin was $20,331/QALY. The incremental value of atorvastatin to US payers (after subtracting costs) was estimated at $44.57 to $194.78 billion, depending on willingness to pay. Findings from the sensitivity analyses were similar. A hypothetical situation in which atorvastatin did not exist was associated with a reduction in total expenditures but also a loss of QALYs gained.The cumulative ICER of atorvastatin varied across the product life cycle, increasing during the period between generic simvastatin entry and generic atorvastatin entry, and decreasing thereafter.",2011-01-07918,21955936,Clin Ther,Michael Grabner,2011,33 /,1433-43,Yes,21955936,"Michael Grabner; Wallace Johnson; Abdulla M Abdulhalim; Andreas Kuznik; C Daniel Mullins; The value of atorvastatin over the product life cycle in the United States., Clin Ther, ; 33 ():1879-114X; 1433-43",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Atorvastatin vs. Simvastatin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,34 Years,3.00,3.00,20331,United States,2009,24526.71

In a systematic review of published studies, we examined evidence for incremental benefits from repeated praziquantel dosing, given 2 to 8 weeks after an initial dose, in Schistosoma-endemic areas of Africa.We performed systematic searches of electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE for relevant data using search terms 'schistosomiasis', 'dosing' and 'praziquantel' and hand searches of personal collections and bibliographies of recovered articles. In 10 reports meeting study criteria, improvements in parasitological treatment outcomes after two doses of praziquantel were greater for S. mansoni infection than for S. haematobium infection. Observed cure rates (positive to negative conversion in egg detection assays) were, for S. mansoni, 69-91% cure after two doses vs. 42-79% after one dose and, for S. haematobium, 46-99% cure after two doses vs. 37-93% after a single dose. Treatment benefits in terms of reduction in intensity (mean egg count) were also different for the two species-for S. mansoni, the 2-dose regimen yielded an weighted average 89% reduction in standardized egg counts compared to a 83% reduction after one dose; for S. haematobium, two doses gave a 93% reduction compared to a 94% reduction with a single dose. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on Markov life path modeling.Although schedules for repeated treatment with praziquantel require greater inputs in terms of direct costs and community participation, there are incremental benefits to this approach at an estimated cost of $153 (S. mansoni)-$211 (S. haematobium) per additional lifetime QALY gained by double treatment in school-based programs.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of evidence-based strategies to improve current prevention practice in long-term care facilities.We used a validated Markov model to compare current prevention practice with the following 4 quality improvement strategies: (1) pressure redistribution mattresses for all residents, (2) oral nutritional supplements for high-risk residents with recent weight loss, (3) skin emollients for high-risk residents with dry skin, and (4) foam cleansing for high-risk residents requiring incontinence care. Primary outcomes included lifetime risk of stage 2 to 4 pressure ulcers, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and lifetime costs, calculated according to a single health care payer's perspective and expressed in 2009 Canadian dollars (Can$1?=?US$0.84).Strategies cost on average $11.66 per resident per week. They reduced lifetime risk; the associated number needed to treat was 45 (strategy 1), 63 (strategy 4), 158 (strategy 3), and 333 (strategy 2). Strategy 1 and 4 minimally improved QALYs and reduced the mean lifetime cost by $115 and $179 per resident, respectively. The cost per QALY gained was approximately $78?000 for strategy 3 and $7.8 million for strategy 2. If decision makers are willing to pay up to $50?000 for 1 QALY gained, the probability that improving prevention is cost-effective is 94% (strategy 4), 82% (strategy 1), 43% (strategy 3), and 1% (strategy 2).The clinical and economic evidence supports pressure redistribution mattresses for all long-term care residents.

8343,Health and cost consequences of early versus late invasive strategy after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction,"The NORwegian study on DIstrict treatment of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction showed an improved clinical outcome with early transfer for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to a more conservative approach after thrombolysis. The aim of this substudy was to compare the 12-month quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of these alternative strategies. Methods: Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction <6?h duration and >90?min expected delay to PCI, received full-dose tenecteplase and were randomized to either early or late invasive strategy (n?=?266). Detailed quality of life and resource use data were registered prospectively for a period of 12 months. Health outcomes were measured as quality of life using a generic instrument (15D). Quality of life scores were translated into QALYs. Unit costs were based on hospital accounts, fee schedules, and market prices. Results: After 12 months of follow-up, patients in the early invasive group had 0.008 (95% CI -0.027 to 0.043) more QALYs compared to the late invasive group. The mean total costs were ?18,201 in the early versus ?17,643 in the late invasive group, with a mean difference of ?558 (95% CI -2258 to 3484). Cost/QALY was ?69,750 while cost/avoided clinical endpoint was ?5636. Conclusion: Early and late invasive strategies after thrombolysis resulted in similar quality of life and similar costs in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients living far from a PCI centre (NCT00161005).",2011-01-07949,21450598,Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil,Ellen B?hmer,2011,18 /,717-23,No,21450598,"Ellen B?hmer; Ivar S?nb?

8349,Sequential compression biomechanical device in patients with critical limb ischemia and nonreconstructible peripheral vascular disease,"Critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients who are unsuitable for intervention face the dire prospect of primary amputation. Sequential compression biomechanical device (SCBD) therapy provides a limb salvage option for these patients. This study assessed the outcome of SCBD in severe CLI patients who otherwise would face an amputation. Primary end points were limb salvage and 30-day mortality. Secondary end points were hemodynamic outcomes (increase in popliteal artery flow and toe pressure), ulcer healing, quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or toxicity of treatment (Q-TwiST), and cost-effectiveness.From 2004 to 2009, we assessed 4538 patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Of these, 707 had CLI, 518 underwent intervention, and 189 were not suitable for any intervention. A total of 171 patients joined the SCBD program for 3 months.All patients were Rutherford category =4. Median follow-up was 13 months. Mean toe pressure increased from 39.9 to 55.42 mm Hg, with a mean difference in toe pressure of 15.49 mm Hg (P = .0001). Mean popliteal flow increased from 35.44 to 55.91 cm/s, with mean difference in popliteal flow of 20.47 cm/s (P < .0001). Mortality at 30 days was 0.6%. Median amputation-free survival was 18 months. Limb salvage at 3.5 years was 94%. Freedom from major adverse clinical events (MACE) at 4.5 years was 62.5%. We treated 171 patients with SCBD at a cost of ?681,948, with an estimated median per-patient cost of treatment with SCBD of ?3988.SCBD therapy is a cost-effective and clinically efficacious solution in CLI patients with no option of revascularization.

8356,"Using a genetic, observational study as a strategy to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of pharmacological CCR5 blockade in dialysis patients","Randomized clinical trials are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, strategies are needed to prioritise tracks for drug development. Genetic association studies may provide such a strategy by considering the differences between genotypes as a proxy for a natural, lifelong, randomized at conception, clinical trial. Previously an association with better survival was found in dialysis patients with systemic inflammation carrying a deletion variant of the CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). We hypothesized that in an analogous manner, pharmacological CCR5 blockade could protect against inflammation-driven mortality and estimated if such a treatment would be cost-effective.A genetic screen and treat strategy was modelled using a decision-analytic Markov model, in which patients were screened for the CCR5 deletion 32 polymorphism and those with the wild type and systemic inflammation were treated with pharmacological CCR5 blockers. Kidney transplantation and mortality rates were calculated using patient level data.

Literature data on the effect of smoking on AAA expansion and rupture was factored into the model.The intervention was cost-effective in all tested scenarios and sensitivity analyses. The smoking cessation intervention was cost-effective due to a decreased need for AAA repair and decreased rupture rate even when disregarding the positive effects of smoking cessation on long-term survival. The incremental cost/effectiveness ratio reached the willingness-to-pay threshold value of ?25,000 per life-year gained when assuming an intervention cost of > ?3250 or an effect of = 1% difference in long-term smoking cessation between the intervention and nonintervention groups. Smoking cessation resulted in a relative risk reduction for elective AAA repair by 9% and for rupture by 38% over 10 years of follow-up.An adequate smoking cessation intervention in patients with small AAAs identified at screening can cost-effectively increase long-term survival and decrease the need for AAA repair.",2011-01-07967,21620630,J Vasc Surg,Kevin Mani,2011,54 /,628-36,No,21620630,"Kevin Mani; Anders Wanhainen; Jonas Lundkvist; David Lindstr?m; Cost-effectiveness of intensive smoking cessation therapy among patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysms, J Vasc Surg, ; 54 ():0741-5214; 628-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,8-week intensive smoking cessation vs. None,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,924,Euro,2009,1553.37

8379,Support surfaces for intraoperative prevention of pressure ulcers in patients undergoing surgery: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Patients who undergo prolonged surgical procedures are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. Recent systematic reviews suggest that pressure redistribution overlays on operating tables significantly decrease the associated risk. Little is known about the cost effectiveness of using these overlays in a prevention program for surgical patients.Using a Markov cohort model, we evaluated the cost effectiveness of an intraoperative prevention strategy with operating table overlays made of dry, viscoelastic polymer from the perspective of a health care payer over a 1-year period. We simulated patients undergoing scheduled surgical procedures lasting =90 min in the supine or lithotomy position.Compared with the current practice of using standard mattresses on operating tables, the intraoperative prevention strategy decreased the estimated intraoperative incidence of pressure ulcers by 0.51%, corresponding to a number-needed-to-treat of 196 patients. The average cost of using the operating table overlay was $1.66 per patient. Compared with current practice, this intraoperative prevention strategy would increase slightly the quality-adjusted life days of patients and by decreasing the incidence of pressure ulcers, this strategy would decrease both hospital and home care costs for treating fewer pressure ulcers originated intraoperatively.

8391,Cost effectiveness of golimumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Golimumab is a novel TNF-a inhibitor licensed to treat patients with active PsA. Although its clinical efficacy has been proven in clinical trials, its cost effectiveness is yet to be established. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of golimumab among patients with active PsA from the UK NHS perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to simulate progression of a hypothetical cohort of active PsA patients on golimumab and other TNF-a inhibitors as well as palliative care. The clinical evidence was derived from clinical trials of TNF-a inhibitors and compared using mixed treatment models. The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated based on change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) from baseline. The annual acquisition cost of golimumab was assumed to be identical to annual cost of other subcutaneous TNF-a inhibitors. The resource use costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over a period of 40?years. The uncertainty surrounding important variables was further explored using probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: TNF-a inhibitors were significantly superior to palliative care but comparable to each other on Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC), HAQ and PASI response. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICERs) for golimumab compared to palliative care was ?16,811 for PsA patients and ?16,245 for a subgroup of PsA patients with significant psoriasis.

8392,Cost effectiveness of golimumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Golimumab is a novel TNF-a inhibitor licensed to treat patients with active PsA. Although its clinical efficacy has been proven in clinical trials, its cost effectiveness is yet to be established. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of golimumab among patients with active PsA from the UK NHS perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to simulate progression of a hypothetical cohort of active PsA patients on golimumab and other TNF-a inhibitors as well as palliative care. The clinical evidence was derived from clinical trials of TNF-a inhibitors and compared using mixed treatment models. The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated based on change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) from baseline. The annual acquisition cost of golimumab was assumed to be identical to annual cost of other subcutaneous TNF-a inhibitors. The resource use costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over a period of 40?years. The uncertainty surrounding important variables was further explored using probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: TNF-a inhibitors were significantly superior to palliative care but comparable to each other on Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC), HAQ and PASI response. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICERs) for golimumab compared to palliative care was ?16,811 for PsA patients and ?16,245 for a subgroup of PsA patients with significant psoriasis.
