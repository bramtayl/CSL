23201,Economic evaluation of surgical treatments for women with stress urinary incontinence: a cost-utility and value of information analysis,"Objectives Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) are common conditions that can have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients and serious cost implications for healthcare providers. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of nine different surgical interventions for treatment of SUI and stress-predominant MUI from a National Health Service and personal social services perspective in the UK. Methods A Markov microsimulation model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nine surgical interventions. The model was informed by undertaking a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and network meta-analysis. The main clinical parameters in the model were the cure and incidence rates of complications after different interventions. The outcomes from the model were expressed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. In addition, expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analyses were conducted to quantify the main uncertainties facing decision-makers. Results The base-case results suggest that retropubic mid-urethral sling (retro-MUS) is the most cost-effective surgical intervention over a 10-year and lifetime time horizon. The probabilistic results show that retro-MUS and traditional sling are the interventions with the highest probability of being cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds over a lifetime time horizon. The value of information analysis results suggest that the largest value appears to be in removing uncertainty around the incidence rates of complications, the relative treatment effectiveness and health utility values. Conclusions Although retro-MUS appears, at this stage, to be a cost-effective intervention, research is needed on possible long-term complications of all surgical treatments to provide reassurance of safety, or earlier warning of unanticipated adverse effects. The value of information analysis supports the need, as a first step, for further research to improve our knowledge of the actual incidence of complications. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of nine different surgical interventions for treatment of SUI and stress-predominant MUI from a National Health Service and personal social services perspective in the UK. Methods A Markov microsimulation model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nine surgical interventions. The model was informed by undertaking a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and network meta-analysis. The main clinical parameters in the model were the cure and incidence rates of complications after different interventions. The outcomes from the model were expressed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. In addition, expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analyses were conducted to quantify the main uncertainties facing decision-makers. Results The base-case results suggest that retropubic mid-urethral sling (retro-MUS) is the most cost-effective surgical intervention over a 10-year and lifetime time horizon. The probabilistic results show that retro-MUS and traditional sling are the interventions with the highest probability of being cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds over a lifetime time horizon. The value of information analysis results suggest that the largest value appears to be in removing uncertainty around the incidence rates of complications, the relative treatment effectiveness and health utility values. Conclusions Although retro-MUS appears, at this stage, to be a cost-effective intervention, research is needed on possible long-term complications of all surgical treatments to provide reassurance of safety, or earlier warning of unanticipated adverse effects. The value of information analysis supports the need, as a first step, for further research to improve our knowledge of the actual incidence of complications. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

23223,Economic evaluation of surgical treatments for women with stress urinary incontinence: a cost-utility and value of information analysis,"Objectives Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) are common conditions that can have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients and serious cost implications for healthcare providers. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of nine different surgical interventions for treatment of SUI and stress-predominant MUI from a National Health Service and personal social services perspective in the UK. Methods A Markov microsimulation model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nine surgical interventions. The model was informed by undertaking a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and network meta-analysis. The main clinical parameters in the model were the cure and incidence rates of complications after different interventions. The outcomes from the model were expressed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. In addition, expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analyses were conducted to quantify the main uncertainties facing decision-makers. Results The base-case results suggest that retropubic mid-urethral sling (retro-MUS) is the most cost-effective surgical intervention over a 10-year and lifetime time horizon. The probabilistic results show that retro-MUS and traditional sling are the interventions with the highest probability of being cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds over a lifetime time horizon. The value of information analysis results suggest that the largest value appears to be in removing uncertainty around the incidence rates of complications, the relative treatment effectiveness and health utility values. Conclusions Although retro-MUS appears, at this stage, to be a cost-effective intervention, research is needed on possible long-term complications of all surgical treatments to provide reassurance of safety, or earlier warning of unanticipated adverse effects. The value of information analysis supports the need, as a first step, for further research to improve our knowledge of the actual incidence of complications. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

23224,Real-World Setting Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Comparing Three Therapeutic Schemes of One-Year Adjuvant Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer from the Cyprus NHS Payer Perspective,"Introduction: This study is one of the first real-world cost-effectiveness analyses of one-year adjuvant trastuzumab used in HER2-positive early female breast cancer in comparison to chemotherapy alone. It is just the second one in Europe, the first one in Cyprus, and the fourth one worldwide ever carried out using real-world data. Methods: Using a Markov model (four health states), a cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out both over 20 years and for a lifetime horizon. The sampling method used in this study was the randomized sampling of 900 women. Results: The findings for the 20-year horizon showed that all trastuzumab arms were more cost-effective, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of only €60,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) [incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER): €40,436.10/QALY]. For the lifetime horizon, with thresholds of €20,000, €40,000, and €60,000/QALY, all trastuzumab arms were found to be more cost-effective (ICER: €17,753.85/QALY). Moreover, for the 20-year and the lifetime horizons, with thresholds of €20,000/QALY, €40,000/QALY, and €60,000/QALY, the most cost-effective of the three subgroups (anthracyclines and then trastuzumab, no anthracyclines and then trastuzumab, and anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab) was that of anthracyclines and then trastuzumab (ICER: €18,301.55/QALY and €8954.97/QALY, respectively). Conclusions: The study revealed that adjuvant trastuzumab for one year in female HER2-positive early breast cancer can be considered cost-effective. © 2020 by the authors.

23232,The cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation for treating patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia refractory to first line endoscopic therapy,"Objective: This economic evaluation aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) compared with argon plasma coagulation (APC) when used to treat APC-refractory gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) in symptomatic patients. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to undertake a cost-utility analysis for adults with persistent symptoms secondary to GAVE refractory to first line endoscopic therapy. The economic evaluation was conducted from a UK NHS and personal social services (PSS) perspective, with a 20-year time horizon, comparing RFA with APC. Patients transfer between health states defined by haemoglobin level. The clinical effectiveness data were sourced from expert opinion, resource use and costs were reflective of the UK NHS and benefits were quantified using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) with utility weights taken from the literature. The primary output was the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per QALY gained. Results: Over a lifetime time horizon, the base case ICER was £4840 per QALY gained with an 82.2% chance that RFA was cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. The model estimated that implementing RFA would result in reductions in the need for intravenous iron, endoscopic intervention and requirement for blood transfusions by 27.1%, 32.3% and 36.5% respectively. Compared to APC, RFA was associated with an estimated 36.7% fewer procedures. Conclusions: RFA treatment is likely to be cost-effective for patients with ongoing symptoms following failure of first line therapy with APC and could lead to substantive reductions in health care resource. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

23233,Cost-effective analysis of clopidogrel versus aspirin for high risk patients with established peripheral arterial disease in China,"Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel versus aspirin for high risk patients (pre-existing symptomatic atherosclerosis or multi-vascular territory involvement) with established peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in a Chinese setting. Methods: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed from the perspective of the national healthcare system in China. The primary outputs are quality adjusted life years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Clinical efficacy data were obtained from the CAPRIE trial. Drug acquisition cost, other direct medical costs, and utilities were from pricing records and the literature. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted to test the robustness of the model on all parameters. Results: In patients with pre-existing atherosclerosis, 2 years of treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin would yield total QALYs of 8.776 and 8.576 at associated costs of ¥18,777 ($2,838) and ¥12,302 ($1,859), respectively, resulting in an ICER of ¥32,382 ($4,893) per QALY gained. In patients with PVD, secondary prevention with the same drugs would expect to lead to total QALYs of 8.836 and 8.632 at associated costs of ¥18,518 ($2,798) and ¥12,041 ($1,820), respectively, resulting in a corresponding ICER of ¥31,743 ($4,797) per QALY gained. The results were most sensitive to the discount rate for future outcomes and costs. The PSA indicated that the probability of clopidogrel being cost-effective was 100% at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3-times GDP.

23234,Cost-effective analysis of clopidogrel versus aspirin for high risk patients with established peripheral arterial disease in China,"Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel versus aspirin for high risk patients (pre-existing symptomatic atherosclerosis or multi-vascular territory involvement) with established peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in a Chinese setting. Methods: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed from the perspective of the national healthcare system in China. The primary outputs are quality adjusted life years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Clinical efficacy data were obtained from the CAPRIE trial. Drug acquisition cost, other direct medical costs, and utilities were from pricing records and the literature. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted to test the robustness of the model on all parameters. Results: In patients with pre-existing atherosclerosis, 2 years of treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin would yield total QALYs of 8.776 and 8.576 at associated costs of ¥18,777 ($2,838) and ¥12,302 ($1,859), respectively, resulting in an ICER of ¥32,382 ($4,893) per QALY gained.

23235,Cost-effectiveness of increased screening and treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Korea,"Background: Given a hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination goal by 2030, World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend scaling up HCV screening and treatment with highly-effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of various screening and treatment strategies for chronic HCV patients in South Korea in patients aged over 40 as compared to currently screening only high-risk patients. Methods: A published Markov disease progression model was used with a screening/treatment decision-tree to model different screening and treatment strategies for Korean HCV patients (aged over 40) from a national payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon. The screening strategies included “screen-all” (upfront only: “once”; or upfront and age 65: “twice”) or a “high-risk only” screening strategy followed by treatment. Treatment strategies included either ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), SOF + ribavirin (SOF + RBV; in GT2 only), or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB). Model inputs were sourced from published literature and costing databases and validated by Korean hepatologists. Results: Regardless of treatment strategy, a “screen all twice” scenario led to the lowest rates of advanced liver disease events compared to “screen all once” and “high-risk only” screening scenarios. In this screening scenario, treatment with LDV/SOF for GT1/2 dominates (i.e. is more effective and less4costly) LDV/SOF in GT1 and SOF + RBV in GT2, while GLE/PIB is not cost-effective relative to LDV/SOF (?105,124,920/QALY) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 1xGDP per capita. Conclusion: Screening all South Korean patients twice followed by LDV/SOF treatment is cost-effective as compared current high-risk screening.

23240,Cost-Effectiveness of Dengue Vaccination in Indonesia: Considering Integrated Programs with Wolbachia-Infected Mosquitos and Health Education,"Despite the fact that morbidity and mortality rates due to dengue infection in Indonesia are relatively high, a dengue vaccination has not yet been introduced. Next to vaccination, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and health education have been considered to be potential interventions to prevent dengue infection in Indonesia. This study was aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in Indonesia whilst taking Wolbachia and health education programs into account. An age-structured decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness. Approximately 4,701,100 children were followed-up in a 10-year time horizon within a 1-year analytical cycle. We compared three vaccination strategies: one focussing on vaccination only, another combining vaccination and a Wolbachia program, and a third scenario combining vaccination and health education. All scenarios were compared with a no-intervention strategy. The result showed that only vaccination would reduce dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) by 123,203; 97,140 and 283 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $10.3 million and $6.2 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The combination of vaccination and a Wolbachia program would reduce DF, DHF and DSS by 292,488; 230,541; and 672 cases, respectively. It would also save treatment cost at $24.3 million and $14.6 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The combination of vaccination and health education would reduce DF, DHF, and DSS by 187,986; 148,220; and 432 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $15.6 million and $9.4 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the healthcare perspective were estimated to be $9,995, $4,460, and $6,399 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the respective scenarios. ICERs from the payer perspective were slightly higher. It can be concluded that vaccination combined with a Wolbachia program was confirmed to be the most cost-effective intervention. Dengue infection rate, vaccine efficacy, cost of Wolbachia program, underreporting factor for hospitalization, vaccine price and mortality rate were considered to be the most influential parameters affecting the ICERs. © 2020 by the authors.

23244,Cost-Effectiveness of Dengue Vaccination in Indonesia: Considering Integrated Programs with Wolbachia-Infected Mosquitos and Health Education,"Despite the fact that morbidity and mortality rates due to dengue infection in Indonesia are relatively high, a dengue vaccination has not yet been introduced. Next to vaccination, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and health education have been considered to be potential interventions to prevent dengue infection in Indonesia. This study was aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in Indonesia whilst taking Wolbachia and health education programs into account. An age-structured decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness. Approximately 4,701,100 children were followed-up in a 10-year time horizon within a 1-year analytical cycle. We compared three vaccination strategies: one focussing on vaccination only, another combining vaccination and a Wolbachia program, and a third scenario combining vaccination and health education. All scenarios were compared with a no-intervention strategy. The result showed that only vaccination would reduce dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) by 123,203; 97,140 and 283 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $10.3 million and $6.2 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The combination of vaccination and a Wolbachia program would reduce DF, DHF and DSS by 292,488; 230,541; and 672 cases, respectively. It would also save treatment cost at $24.3 million and $14.6 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The combination of vaccination and health education would reduce DF, DHF, and DSS by 187,986; 148,220; and 432 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $15.6 million and $9.4 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the healthcare perspective were estimated to be $9,995, $4,460, and $6,399 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the respective scenarios. ICERs from the payer perspective were slightly higher. It can be concluded that vaccination combined with a Wolbachia program was confirmed to be the most cost-effective intervention. Dengue infection rate, vaccine efficacy, cost of Wolbachia program, underreporting factor for hospitalization, vaccine price and mortality rate were considered to be the most influential parameters affecting the ICERs. © 2020 by the authors.

23246,Cost-effectiveness of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for depression from the Canadian public payer perspective,"Aim: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, versus treatment as usual (TAU), to guide treatment for patients with depression, from the Canadian public healthcare system perspective. Materials & methods: Clinical and economic data associated with depression were extracted from published literature. Clinical (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs) and economic (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) outcomes were modeled using combinatorial PGx and TAU treatment strategies across a 5-year time horizon. Results: With the combinatorial PGx strategy to guide treatment, patients were projected to gain 0.14-0.19 QALYs versus TAU. Accounting for test price, combinatorial PGx saved CAD $1,687-$3,056 versus TAU. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from-$11,861 to-$16,124/QALY gained. Conclusion: Combinatorial PGx testing was more efficacious and less costly compared with the TAU for depression. © 2020 Bryan Dechairo.",2020-01-32828,32301648,Pharmacogenomics,-A Tanner,2020,21 / 8,521-531,No,32301648,"-A Tanner; E Davies; C Overall; D Grima; J Nam; M Dechairo; Cost-effectiveness of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for depression from the Canadian public payer perspective, Pharmacogenomics, 2020; 21(8):; 521-531",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Other,pharmacogenomic testing vs. None,Not Stated,32 Years,32 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-14470.24,Canada,2018,-11510.77
23247,The emergency department as a setting-specific opportunity for population-based hepatitis C screening: An economic evaluation,"Background and Aims: The World Health Organization''s hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination strategy recognizes the need for interventions that identify populations most affected by infection. The emergency department (ED) has been suggested as a setting for HCV screening. The study objective was to explore the health and economic impact of HCV screening in the ED setting. Methods: We used a microsimulation model to conduct a cost-utility analysis evaluating two ED setting-specific strategies: no screening, and screening and subsequent treatment. Strategies were examined for two populations: (a) the general ED patient population; and (b) ED patients born between 1945 and 1975. The analysis was conducted from a healthcare payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon. A reference and high ED HCV seroprevalence measure were examined in the Canadian healthcare setting.US costs of chronic infection were used for a scenario analysis of screening in the US healthcare setting. Results: For birth cohort screening, in comparison to no screening, one liver-related death was averted for every 760 and 123 persons screened for the reference and high seroprevalence measures. For general population screening, one liver-related death was averted for every 831 and 147 persons screened for the reference and high seroprevalence measures. In comparison to no screening, birth cohort screening was cost-effective at CAN$25,584/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and US$42,615/QALY. General population screening was cost-effective at CAN$19,733/QALY and US$32,187/QALY. Conclusions: ED screening may represent a cost-effective component of population-based strategies to eliminate HCV.

23251,Age at Initiation and Frequency of Screening to Prevent Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in High-risk Regions: an Economic Evaluation,"The aim of this study was to identify the economic screening strategies for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in high-risk regions. We used a validated ESCC health policy model for comparing different screening strategies for ESCC. Strategies varied in terms of age at initiation and frequency of screening. Model inputs were derived from parameter calibration and published literature. We estimated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of ESCC, costs, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Compared with no screening, all competing screening strategies decreased the incidence of ESCC from 0.35% to 72.8%, and augmented the number of QALYs (0.002-0.086 QALYs per person) over a lifetime horizon. The screening strategies initiating at 40 years of age and repeated every 1–3 years, which gained over 70% of probabilities that was preferred in probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a $1,151/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. Results were sensitive to the parameters related to the risks of developing basal cell hyperplasia/mild dysplasia. Endoscopy screening initiating at 40 years of age and repeated every 1–3 years could substantially reduce the disease burden and is cost-effective for the general population in high-risk regions. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.",2020-01-32832,32152149,Cancer Prev.

23252,Cost-effectiveness of an in-home respite care program to support informal caregivers of persons with dementia: A model-based analysis,"Objectives: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of an in-home respite care program in addition to standard community-based dementia care to support informal caregivers of persons with dementia compared with standard community-based dementia care. Methods: An age-dependent decision-analytic Markov model was applied from a third-party payer and a societal perspective projecting results of a quasi-experimental study over a time horizon of 5 years assuming a repetition of the program every 6 months. Additionally, to deal with uncertainty and to test robustness of the model scenario, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Implementing the program resulted in a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.14 in favor of the invention group compared with controls and an incremental cost of 1270€ from the third-party payer perspective and of 1220€ from the societal perspective. Next, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 9042€/QALY and of 8690€/QALY was found in the base case, from the third-party payer perspective and the societal perspective, respectively. The scenario, one-way sensitivity, and probabilistic analyses demonstrated robustness of the base-case results. Conclusion: This cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that an in-home respite care program in addition to standard community-based dementia care is a cost-effective approach compared with standard community-based dementia care only. These findings provide more insight into the value of such services for the patient, the caregiver, and for society. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020-01-32833,32011773,Int. J. Geriatr.

23253,Early cost-utility analysis of tissue-engineered heart valves compared to bioprostheses in the aortic position in elderly patients,"Objectives: Aortic valve disease is the most frequent indication for heart valve replacement with the highest prevalence in elderly. Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) are foreseen to have important advantages over currently used bioprosthetic heart valve substitutes, most importantly reducing valve degeneration with subsequent reduction of re-intervention. We performed early Health Technology Assessment of hypothetical TEHV in elderly patients (= 70 years) requiring surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to assess the potential of TEHV and to inform future development decisions. Methods: Using a patient-level simulation model, the potential cost-effectiveness of TEHV compared with bioprostheses was predicted from a societal perspective. Anticipated, but currently hypothetical improvements in performance of TEHV, divided in durability, thrombogenicity, and infection resistance, were explored in scenario analyses to estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain, cost reduction, headroom, and budget impact. Results: Durability of TEHV had the highest impact on QALY gain and costs, followed by infection resistance. Improved TEHV performance (- 50% prosthetic valve-related events) resulted in lifetime QALY gains of 0.131 and 0.043, lifetime cost reductions of €639 and €368, translating to headrooms of €3255 and €2498 per hypothetical TEHV compared to SAVR and TAVI, respectively. National savings in the first decade after implementation varied between €2.8 and €11.2 million (SAVR) and €3.2–€12.8 million (TAVI) for TEHV substitution rates of 25–100%. Conclusions: Despite the relatively short life expectancy of elderly patients undergoing SAVR/TAVI, hypothetical TEHV are predicted to be cost-effective compared to bioprostheses, commercially viable and result in national cost savings when biomedical engineers succeed in realising improved durability and/or infection resistance of TEHV. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020-01-32834,31982976,Eur.

23255,Cost-Effectiveness of Pneumococcal Vaccination Policies and Uptake Programs in US Older Populations,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recently revised vaccination recommendations for US adults, aged 65 years and older, include both 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), with PCV13 now recommended for immunocompetent older people based on shared decision making. The public health impact and cost-effectiveness of this recommendation or of pneumococcal vaccine uptake improvement interventions are unclear. DESIGN: Markov decision analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical 65-year-old general and black population cohorts. INTERVENTION: Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older people, an alternative policy omitting PCV13 in immunocompetent older people, and vaccine uptake improvement programs. RESULTS: The current pneumococcal vaccination recommendation was the most effective strategy, but afforded slight public health benefits compared to an alternative (PPSV23 for all older people plus PCV13 for the immunocompromised) and cost greater than $750 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in either population group with a vaccine uptake improvement program (absolute uptake increase = 12.3%; cost = $1.78/eligible patient) in place. The alternative strategy was more economically favorable, but cost greater than $100 000/QALY in either population, with or without an uptake intervention. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses; however, in black older people, the alternative strategy with an uptake program was most likely to be favored in probabilistic sensitivity analyses at a $150 000/QALY gained threshold. CONCLUSION: Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older people are economically unfavorable compared to an alternative strategy omitting PCV13 in the immunocompetent. The alternative recommendation with an uptake improvement program may be economically reasonable in black population analyses and could be worth considering as a population-wide recommendation if mitigating racial disparities is a priority.

This study aimed to apply DES to perform cost-effectiveness analysis of AD treatment in Thailand. Methods: A data set of Thai AD patients, representing unique demographic and clinical characteristics, was bootstrapped to generate a baseline cohort of 50 000 patients. Each patient was cloned and assigned to donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, memantine, or no treatment. Correlated changes in cognitive and behavioral status over time were developed using patient-level data. Treatment effects were obtained from the most recent network meta-analysis. Treatment persistence; mortality; and predictive equations for functional status, costs (Thai baht in 2017), and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were derived from country-specific real-world data. Results: From a societal perspective, only the prescription of donepezil to AD patients with all disease-severity levels was found to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio): 138 524 Thai baht/QALY ($4062/QALY)]. Regardless of whether the treatment-stopping rule when the mini-mental state examination score <10 was introduced, providing early treatment with donepezil to mild AD patients further reduced the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated robust simulation findings. Conclusions: Discrete-event simulation greatly enhances the real-world representativeness of decision-analytic models for AD. Donepezil is the most cost-effective treatment option for AD in Thailand and is worth being considered for universal financial coverage.

23265,Statins for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention in people living with HIV in Thailand: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Introduction: People living with HIV (PLHIV) have an elevated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to their HIV-negative peers. Expanding statin use may help alleviate this burden. However, the choice of statin in the context of antiretroviral therapy is challenging. Pravastatin and pitavastatin improve cholesterol levels in PLHIV without interacting substantially with antiretroviral therapy. They are also more expensive than most statins. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pravastatin and pitavastatin for the primary prevention of CVD among PLHIV in Thailand who are not currently using lipid-lowering therapy. Methods: We developed a discrete-state microsimulation model that randomly selected (with replacement) individuals from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database cohort who were aged 40 to 75 years, receiving antiretroviral therapy in Thailand, and not using lipid-lowering therapy. The model simulated each individual’s probability of experiencing CVD. We evaluated: (1) treating no one with statins; (2) treating everyone with pravastatin 20mg/day (drug cost 7568 Thai Baht ($US243)/year) and (3) treating everyone with pitavastatin 2 mg/day (drug cost 8182 Baht ($US263)/year). Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assigned in annual cycles over a 20-year time horizon and discounted at 3% per year. We assumed the Thai healthcare sector perspective. Results: Pravastatin was estimated to be less effective and less cost-effective than pitavastatin and was therefore dominated (extended) by pitavastatin. Patients receiving pitavastatin accumulated 0.042 additional QALYs compared with those not using a statin, at an extra cost of 96,442 Baht ($US3095), giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2,300,000 Baht ($US73,812)/QALY gained. These findings were sensitive to statin costs and statin efficacy, pill burden, and targeting of PLHIV based on CVD risk. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Baht ($US5135)/QALY gained, we estimated that pravastatin would become cost-effective at an annual cost of 415 Baht ($US13.30)/year and pitavastatin would become cost-effective at an annual cost of 600 Baht ($US19.30)/year. Conclusions: Neither pravastatin nor pitavastatin were projected to be cost-effective for the primary prevention of CVD among PLHIV in Thailand who are not currently using lipid-lowering therapy. We do not recommend expanding current use of these drugs among PLHIV in Thailand without substantial price reduction. © 2020 The Authors.

At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Baht ($US5135)/QALY gained, we estimated that pravastatin would become cost-effective at an annual cost of 415 Baht ($US13.30)/year and pitavastatin would become cost-effective at an annual cost of 600 Baht ($US19.30)/year. Conclusions: Neither pravastatin nor pitavastatin were projected to be cost-effective for the primary prevention of CVD among PLHIV in Thailand who are not currently using lipid-lowering therapy. We do not recommend expanding current use of these drugs among PLHIV in Thailand without substantial price reduction. © 2020 The Authors.

23267,Developing Markov Models From Real-World Data: A Case Study of Heart Failure Modeling Using Administrative Data,"Objectives: Markov models characterize disease progression as specific health states based on clinical or biological measures. However, these measures are not always collected outside clinical trials. In this article, an alternative approach is presented that uses real-world data to define the health states and to model transitions between them, specific to a local setting, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring (TM) versus no TM for heart failure. Methods: The incidence of hospitalization for usual care was estimated from hospital episode statistics (HES) data in the United Kingdom and converted into a monthly transition matrix with 5 health states (4 states are defined based on the number of hospitalizations in the previous year and death) to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TM in a local UK primary care trust (PCT) using probabilistic sensitivity analysis from a healthcare perspective. Results: Geographical variation in hospitalization rates were present, which led to different health state transition matrices in different localities. In the PCT that was evaluated, TM accrued mean additional costs of £3610 and 0.075 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with usual care per patient, resulting in a mean incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £48 172/QALY. Conclusions: The use of administrative data to define health states and transition matrices based on health service events is feasible, and TM was not cost-effective in our analysis. Given the increasing emphasis on using real-world evidence, it is likely that these approaches will be used more in the future. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2020-01-32840,32540232,Value Health,P Thokala,2020,23 / 6,743-750,Yes,32540232,"P Thokala; P Dodd; H Baalbaki; A Brennan; S Dixon; K Lowrie; Developing Markov Models From Real-World Data: A Case Study of Heart Failure Modeling Using Administrative Data, Value Health, 2020; 23(6):1098-3015; 743-750",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Care Delivery,telemonitoring for heart failure vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 1 year",3.50,3.50,48172,United Kingdom,2018,66344.81
23268,Cost-effectiveness of midostaurin in the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia in France,"Background: Midostaurin (MIDO) combined with standard chemotherapy was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2017 for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on results from the RATIFY trial. Methods: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare MIDO and standard-of-care (SOC) to SOC alone in France. Per Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) guidelines, a partitioned survival model with eight health states was used: diagnosis/induction, complete remission, relapse, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), HSCT recovery, post-HSCT recovery (stabilized after HSCT recovery), post-HSCT relapse, and mortality. A lifetime horizon was used beginning at diagnosis with a “cure model,”, which assumed natural mortality after trial cut-off. Utility values were obtained from a systematic literature review and included disutilities. Resource utilization was based on HAS clinical guidelines and a survey of French physicians and included drugs and administration, adverse events, routine medical care, HSCT, and end-of-life care costs. Results: In RATIFY and after extrapolation, MIDO improved survival compared to SOC, translating into MIDO-treated patients gaining 1.12 life years (LYs) and 1.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus SOC. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for MIDO versus SOC was €68,781 per LY and €62,305 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed consistency with base case findings. Conclusions: MIDO represents a clinically significant advancement in the management of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. In this analysis, MIDO add-on therapy showed gains in LYs and QALYs versus SOC alone and was found to be a cost-effective option at a €100,000 per QALY threshold for end-of-life treatment. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020-01-32841,31970530,Eur.

23269,Cost and health effects of case management compared with outpatient clinic follow-up in a Dutch heart failure cohort,"Aims: Heart failure reduces quality of life and life expectancy; hospital admissions are frequent and create a burden on public resources. This study aims to quantify the benefits in terms of health effects [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and costs when heart failure patients receive case management at home compared with outpatient cardiology clinic follow-up. Methods and results: A health state transition (Markov) model was written, and transition probabilities were derived from a cohort of 1114 patients and available literature. QALYs in different health states of heart failure patients were retrieved from the literature, and costs were estimated with data from the financial department of the Noordwest Ziekenhuisgroep and public cost sources. Monthly simulation cycles were repeated 60 times to generate 5 years of virtual follow-up data. Baseline willingness to pay is assumed €50 000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed in a one-way deterministic and a multiway probabilistic approach; the probabilistic approach used uniform and more plausible distributions of the model parameters. Case management reduced costs by €382 and increased QALYs by 0.261 for the baseline simulation; this results in a net monetary benefit of €13 428. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on uniform and most plausible distributions of parameters resulted in 96.2% and 83.3% of the simulations, favouring a treatment strategy of case management. Conclusions: Case management is cost effective in 83.3% of the probabilistic simulations and has a tendency towards reducing costs and increasing QALYs when considering a real-world cohort of heart failure patients in the Netherlands. © 2020 The Authors.

23270,Cost-utility analysis of factor VIII diet therapies prepared using blood plasma vs. recombinant technique for patients with hemophilia A,"Background: Hemophilia is known as one of the most common coagulation disorders whose treatment costs are particularly high in developing countries, and about 90% of them are related to factor VIII (FVIII) and direct medical costs (DMCs). Thus, the present study aimed to analyze cost-utility of two FVIII diet therapies prepared using blood plasma and recombinant technique. Methods: This study was an economic evaluation fulfilled through a cost-utility approach. To this end, a total number of 120 patients were randomly selected using Krejcie & Morgan’s Table and then received blood plasma and recombinant FVIII. The decision tree structure was also utilized to estimate economic and clinical outcomes. Moreover, costs were reviewed from societal perspective. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was subsequently determined as the measure of effectiveness (MOE). Besides, one-way (univariate) sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify uncertainty effects of the study parameters. The information was ultimately analyzed using the TreeAge Pro 2011 and the Microsoft Office Excel 2010 software. Results: The results revealed that the recombinant diet therapy had higher costs and effectiveness compared with blood-plasma-derived FVIII, so that the mean costs of these two diet therapies were equal to 37,624 and 20,349 purchasing power parity (PPP) $ with utility scores of 0.78 and 0.62; respectively. Since the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the recombinant medications was over three times of the threshold level, it was considered as overwhelming because of its high cost in spite of its better effectiveness. Moreover, the results of one-way (univariate) sensitivity analysis demonstrated the highest sensitivity to the utility in patients who had been injected with blood-plasma-derived FVIII and had been successfully treated. Conclusion: The study results revealed that FVIII prepared using blood plasma for hemophilia A patients had higher cost-effectiveness compared with that made using recombinant technique.

23271,Describing the resource utilisation and costs associated withvertebral fractures: the Build Better Bones with Exercise (B3E) Pilot Trial,"Summary: This analysis examined costs/resources of 141 women with vertebral fractures, randomised to a home exercise programme or control group. Total, mean costs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. Quality of life was collected. Cost drivers were caregiver time, medications and adverse events (AEs). Results show adding an exercise programme may reduce the risk of AEs. Introduction: This exploratory economic analysis examined the health resource utilisation and costs experienced by women with vertebral fractures, and explored the effects of home exercise on those costs. Methods: Women = 65 years with one or more X-ray-confirmed vertebral fractures were randomised 1:1 to a 12-month home exercise programme or equal attention control group. Clinical and health system resources were collected during monthly phone calls and daily diaries completed by participants. Intervention costs were included. Unit costs were applied to health system resources. Quality of life (QoL) information was collected via EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Results: One hundred and forty-one women were randomised. Overall total costs (CAD 2018) were $664,923 (intervention) and $614,033 (control), respectively. The top three cost drivers were caregiver time ($250,269 and $240,811), medications ($151,000 and $122,145) and AEs ($58,807 and $71,981). The mean cost per intervention participant of $9365 ± $9988 was higher compared with the mean cost per control participant of $8772 ± $9718. The mean EQ-5D index score was higher for the intervention participants (0.81 ± 0.11) compared with that of controls (0.79 ± 0.13). The differences in quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (0.02) and mean cost ($593) were used to calculate the ICER of $29,650. Conclusions: Women with osteoporosis with a previous fracture experience a number of resources and associated costs that impact their care and quality of life. Caregiver time, medications and AEs are the biggest cost drivers for this population. The next steps would be to expand this feasibility study with more participants, longer-term follow-up and more regional variability. © 2020, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",2020-01-32852,32219499,Osteoporosis Int.,S Hassan,2020,31 / 6,1115-1123,No,32219499,"S Hassan; J Seung; E Clark; C Gibbs; C McArthur; N Mittmann; L Thabane; D Kendler; A Papaioannou; D Wark; C Ashe; D Adachi; A Templeton; M Giangregorio; Describing the resource utilisation and costs associated withvertebral fractures: the Build Better Bones with Exercise (B3E) Pilot Trial, Osteoporosis Int., 2020; 31(6):0937-941X; 1115-1123",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,home exercise program after vertebral fracture vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,one or more x-ray-confirmed vertebral fractures,Not Stated,65 Years,Female,Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,29650,Canada,2018,23585.95
23272,Bridging the gap: an economic case study of the impact and cost effectiveness of comprehensive healthcare intermediaries in rural Mexico,"Background: In rural settings where patients face significant structural barriers to accessing healthcare services, the formal existence of government-provided health coverage does not necessarily translate to meaningful care delivery. This paper analyses the effectiveness of an innovative approach to overcome these barriers, the Right to Health Care programme offered by Compañeros en Salud in Chiapas, Mexico. This programme provides comprehensive free coverage of all additional direct and indirect medical costs as well as accompaniment through the medical system. Over 550 patients had participated from 2013 until November 2018. Methods: Focusing on ten of the most frequently treated conditions, including hernias, cataracts and congenital heart defects, we performed a retrospective case study analysis of the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from treatment and the cost per QALY for 69 patients. This analysis used disability weights and uncertainty intervals from the Global Burden of Disease study and organisational micro-costing data for each patient. Each patient was compared to their own hypothetical counterfactual health outcome had they not received the secondary and tertiary care required for the specific condition. A mixed methods approach is used to establish this counterfactual baseline, drawing on pre-intervention observations, qualitative interviews and established literature precedent. Results: The programme was found to deliver an average of 14.4 additional QALYs (95% uncertainty interval 12.4-15.8) without time discounting. The mean cost per QALY over these conditions was $388 USD (95% UI $262-588) at purchasing power parity. Conclusions: These numbers compare favourably with studies of other health services and international cost per QALY guidelines. They reflect the on-treatment effect for the ten conditions analysed and are presented as a case study indicative of the promise of healthcare intermediaries rather than a definitive assessment of cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, these results show the potential feasibility and cost effectiveness of a more comprehensive approach to healthcare provision in a resource-limited rural setting. Trial registration: This study involves economic analysis of a programme facilitating access to public healthcare services. Thus, there was no associated clinical trial to be registered. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020-01-32856,32443970,Health Res.

23273,Cost-Effectiveness of Alirocumab in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes: The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES Trial,"Background: Cholesterol reduction with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors reduces ischemic events; however, the cost-effectiveness in statin-treated patients with recent acute coronary syndrome remains uncertain. Objectives: This study sought to determine whether further cholesterol reduction with alirocumab would be cost-effective in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome on optimal statin therapy. Methods: A cost-effectiveness model leveraging patient-level data from ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) was developed to estimate costs and outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Patients (n = 18,924) had a recent acute coronary syndrome and were on high-intensity or maximum-tolerated statin therapy, with a baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level =70 mg/dl, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol =100 mg/dl, or apolipoprotein B =80 mg/l. Alirocumab 75 mg or placebo was administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Alirocumab was blindly titrated to 150 mg if LDL-C remained =50 mg/dl or switched to placebo if 2 consecutive LDL-C levels were <15 mg/dl. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was determined with the addition of alirocumab versus placebo and, based on clinical efficacy findings from the trial, was stratified by baseline LDL-C levels =100 mg/dl and <100 mg/dl. Results: Across the overall population recruited to the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, using an annual treatment cost of US$5,850, the mean overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$92,200 per QALY (base case). The cost was US$41,800 per QALY in patients with baseline LDL-C =100 mg/dl, whereas in those with LDL-C <100 mg/dl the cost per QALY was US$299,400. Among patients with LDL-C =100 mg/dl, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios remained below US$100,000 per QALY across a wide variety of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: In patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome on optimal statin therapy, alirocumab improves cardiovascular outcomes at costs considered intermediate value, with good value in patients with baseline LDL-C =100 mg/dl but less economic value with LDL-C <100 mg/dl.

23274,Comparative Pricing of Branded Tenofovir Alafenamide-Emtricitabine Relative to Generic Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-Emtricitabine for HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Tenofovir alafenamide–emtricitabine (F/TAF) was recently approved as a noninferior and potentially safer option than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate–emtricitabine (F/TDF) for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the United States. Objective: To estimate the greatest possible clinical benefits and economic savings attributable to the improved safety profile of F/TAF and the maximum price payers should be willing to pay for F/TAF over generic F/TDF. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis. Data Sources: Published literature on F/TDF safety (in persons with and those without HIV) and the cost and quality-of-life effects of fractures and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Target Population: Age-stratified U.S. men who have sex with men (MSM) using PrEP. Time Horizon: Five years. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: Preexposure prophylaxis with F/TAF versus F/TDF. Outcome Measures: Fractures averted, cases of ESRD averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved, costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and maximum justifiable price for F/TAF compared with generic F/TDF. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Over a 5-year horizon, compared with F/TDF, F/TAF averted 2101 fractures and 25 cases of ESRD for the 123 610 MSM receiving PrEP, with an ICER of more than $7 million per QALY. At a 50% discount for generic F/TDF ($8300 per year) and a societal willingness to pay up to $100 000 per QALY, the maximum fair price for F/TAF was $8670 per year. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Among persons older than 55 years, the ICER for F/TAF remained more than $3 million per QALY and the maximum permissible fair price for F/TAF was $8970 per year. Results were robust to alternative time horizons and PrEP-using population sizes. Limitation: Intermittent use and on-demand PrEP were not considered. Conclusion: In the presence of a generic F/TDF alternative, the improved safety of F/TAF is worth no more than an additional $370 per person per year.

23275,Cost-effectiveness analysis of nivolumab for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the United States,"Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in the US. Methods: We constructed a cohort-based partitioned survival model for three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death). Using overall survival and progression-free survival data from the nivolumab and investigator’s choice (IC) arms of the CheckMate 141 study, the proportion of patients in each health state was estimated by parametric modeling over a 25-year period. Cost, utility, adverse event, and disease management data inputs were obtained from relevant literature and applied to patients in each health state. A scenario analysis was conducted assuming increased uptake of subsequent immunotherapies. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of variation in multiple parameters. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis in which probabilistic distributions were applied to each input during 1,000 model iterations was also conducted. Results: Total costs incurred were higher with nivolumab ($101,552) than with IC ($38,067). Nivolumab was associated with a higher number of life-years (LY; 1.21) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 0.89), compared with IC (0.68 and 0.42, respectively). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for nivolumab compared with IC was $134,438 per QALY, and this remained qualitatively similar when increased uptake of subsequent immunotherapies was assumed ($129,603 per QALY). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Conclusions: These results suggest that, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY, nivolumab is a cost-effective option for therapy of SCCHN in the US. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

23276,Cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab versus docetaxel and nivolumab in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer as a second line in France,"Aim: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel and nivolumab for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a second-line treatment, in a French setting. Materials and methods: A three-state partitioned-survival model was developed (progression-free survival, post-progression survival, death) based on the phase IIIOAK trial on a 10-year time horizon. The comparison between nivolumab and atezolizumab came from a network meta-analysis. Utilities were estimated from the OAK trial EQ-5D applying the French utility tariffs. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment duration were estimated using parametric models selected using Akaike and Bayesian information criterion. Extrapolation beyond the trial duration followed NICE DSU TSD 14. Economic perspective was the one of all payers, discount rate fixed at 4% on benefits and costs. This analysis was aligned with French Haute Autorité de Santé recommendations. Results were expressed in total cost (2019) and €/QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year). Model robustness was checked through sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results: In comparison to docetaxel, atezolizumab costs 49,429€ more and increased life expectancy by 8 months, generating 0.47 QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at 104,835€/QALY. When comparing nivolumab to atezolizumab, a cost minimization analysis was conducted since no clear evidence supporting a difference in terms of survival benefit was reported. Using list price, and the Market Access Authorization regimens, atezolizumab saved approximately 6,000€, 9.5% of its total costs. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings. Conclusion: Atezolizumab is more efficient and more costly than docetaxel in the second-line treatment of NSCLC of stage IIIB or IV, in France, with results consistent to previous French authorities’ evaluation of immunotherapies in similar indication.

23277,Cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets versus fingolimod in patients with highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis in Portugal,"Aims: To assess the cost-utility of cladribine tablets versus fingolimod in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Portugal. Methods: A 1-year cycle cohort-based Markov state transition model was developed to simulate disease progression, measured by Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), relapses, and conversion to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Patients were assumed to remain on treatment until progression to EDSS level 7, conversion to SPMS, or complete loss of efficacy due to waning effect. Natural history was based on British Columbia Multiple Sclerosis registry, London Ontario database, UK MS Trust, and cladribine tablets clinical trial (CLARITY). Portuguese all-cause mortality was adjusted for the MS associated increased mortality. Clinical inputs for active treatments (disability progression and relapse rate) were estimated on a network meta-analysis. Utility weights were derived from UK-MS Survey and published literature. Resource consumption by EDSS and due to relapses was based on published literature, National DRG microdata and expert opinion. Unit costs were obtained from official sources. The analysis was conducted from payers’ perspective, time horizon of 50 years and discount rate of 5%, for both costs and benefits. Uncertainty was assessed via probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared to fingolimod, cladribine tablets were associated with a delay in progression, resulting in a gain of 0.85 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and a cost decrease of 25,935 €. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in a mean ICER of -31,781 € per QALY and was dominant in 98.7% of the simulations. Cladribine tablets were dominant across the scenario analyses tested. Conclusions: Treatment of highly active RRMS with cladribine tablets was less costly and more effective than treatment with fingolimod. Hence, it is a dominant strategy in the Portuguese setting. No conclusions can be drawn from the present study regarding other treatment options, in particular natalizumab and alemtuzumab. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

23278,Comparative cost-effectiveness of amisulpride and olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in China,"Background: Both amisulpride and olanzapine are leading treatments for schizophrenia in China. This study aimed to investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of amisulpride and olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in China. Methods: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime clinical and economic outcomes of schizophrenia treatment from the healthcare payer perspective. The long-term costs and QALYs were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the impact of variance of parameters on the results. Results: Treatment with amisulpride provided an effectiveness gain of 16.59 QALYs at an average cost of USD 25,884 whereas olanzapine resulted in 16.38 QALYs at a cost of USD 34,839 over a lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity analysis suggested that the most sensitive variable was the unit cost of olanzapine. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on a Monte Carlo simulation with a lifetime horizon, the probability of amisulpride being cost-effective was 99.8% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of USD 9,322, the GDP per capita in China 2018. A scenario analysis with updated olanzapine unit cost suggested an ICER of 7,857 USD/QALY.

23280,Septoplasty versus non-surgical management for nasal obstruction in adults with a deviated septum: economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial,"Background: For years, the benefits of septoplasty have been questioned. Due to the scarce and inconclusive literature, several National Health Service (NHS) Clinical Commissioning Groups in England decided to add septal surgery to their list of restricted procedures with low clinical value. Recently, evidence was obtained that septoplasty is actually more effective than non-surgical management for nasal obstruction in adults with a deviated septum. However, the relation between costs and effects of septoplasty remains unknown. Methods: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside an open, multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial in two tertiary and 16 secondary referral hospitals in the Netherlands. Adults with nasal obstruction and a deviated septum were randomized to (1) septoplasty with or without concurrent turbinate surgery or (2) non-surgical management consisting of (a combination of) medical treatment and watchful waiting. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Single imputation nested in the bootstrap percentile method (using 5000 bootstrap replications) was performed to assess the effect of missing data. After 12 and 24 months, we assessed the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a healthcare and a societal perspective. Results: A total of 203 adults were randomly assigned to septoplasty (N = 102) or non-surgical management (N = 101). After 12 months, the mean cost difference between septoplasty and non-surgical management using a healthcare or societal perspective was €1181 (95%CI €1038 to €1323) or €2192 per patient (95%CI €1714 to €2670), respectively. The mean QALY difference was 0.03 per patient (95%CI-0.01 to 0.07). Incremental costs per QALY gained from a healthcare or societal perspective were €41,763 or €77,525, respectively. After 24 months, the mean cost difference between the two groups using a healthcare or societal perspective decreased to €936 (95%CI €719 to €1153) or €1671 per patient (95%CI €952 to €2390), respectively. The mean QALY difference increased to 0.05 per patient (95%CI-0.03 to 0.14). Incremental costs per QALY gained from a healthcare or societal perspective became €17,374 or €31,024, respectively. Analyses of imputed data did not alter our findings. Conclusions: Depending on the selected perspective, cost-effectiveness threshold, and time horizon, septoplasty has the potential to be cost-effective. Despite considerable uncertainty, septoplasty seems to be cost-effective from a healthcare perspective, after 24 months against a threshold of €20,000 per QALY. From a societal perspective, septoplasty is not yet cost-effective after 24 months, but it comes closer to the cost-effectiveness threshold as time passes by.

Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate the impacts of changes in key variables. All costs were adjusted to 2018 US$ with an annual discount rate of 3% applied to costs and outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for vaccinating US adults aged 19 to 85 with Tdap ranged from $248,000/QALY to $900,000/QALY.

23287,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Atezolizumab Plus Chemotherapy in the First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Introduction: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the United States (US) payers’ perspective in the first-line treatment. Methods: A mathematical Markov model was developed to estimate cost and effectiveness of atezolizumab combination therapy versus carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel alone in the first-line therapy of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC from the data of IMpower130. Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were analyzed, and model robustness was assessed by sensitivity analysis. Additional subgroup analyses were performed as well. Results: Compared to chemotherapy, treatment with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy yields an increase of 0.16 QALYs with an increase in cost of $109,809.13, resulting in an ICER of $670,309.66 per QALY. The most influential factor in this model was the cost of atezolizumab. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there was 0% probability that atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) values of $150,000 per QALY. The results of subgroup analyses showed that the ICER remained greater than $150,000/QALY across the all patient subgroups. Conclusion: First-line treatment with atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel is not a cost-effective option in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. © 2020, Springer Healthcare Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2020-01-32876,32193809,Adv.

23288,Cost-Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis: Health-Economic Evaluation Within a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Evidence was found for the effectiveness of virtual reality-based cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT) for treating paranoia in psychosis, but health-economic evaluations are lacking. Objective: This study aimed to determine the short-term cost-effectiveness of VR-CBT. Methods: The health-economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial evaluating VR-CBT in 116 patients with a psychotic disorder suffering from paranoid ideation. The control group (n=58) received treatment as usual (TAU) for psychotic disorders in accordance with the clinical guidelines. The experimental group (n=58) received TAU complemented with add-on VR-CBT to reduce paranoid ideation and social avoidance. Data were collected at baseline and at 3 and 6 months postbaseline. Treatment response was defined as a pre-post improvement of symptoms of at least 20% in social participation measures. Change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was estimated by using Sanderson et al''s conversion factor to map a change in the standardized mean difference of Green''s Paranoid Thoughts Scale score on a corresponding change in utility. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using 5000 bootstraps of seemingly unrelated regression equations of costs and effects. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were graphed for the costs per treatment responder gained and per QALY gained. Results: The average mean incremental costs for a treatment responder on social participation ranged between €8079 and €19,525, with 90.74%-99.74% showing improvement. The average incremental cost per QALY was €48,868 over the 6 months of follow-up, with 99.98% showing improved QALYs. Sensitivity analyses show costs to be lower when relevant baseline differences were included in the analysis. Average costs per treatment responder now ranged between €6800 and €16,597, while the average cost per QALY gained was €42,030. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that offering VR-CBT to patients with paranoid delusions is an economically viable approach toward improving patients'' health in a cost-effective manner. Long-term effects need further research.

23289,Cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for secondary prevention among patients with coronary artery disease and baseline LDL-C 70-100 mg/dL in Taiwan,"Background: The recommended target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients has been lowered from 100 to 70 mg/dL in several clinical guidelines for secondary prevention. We aimed to assess whether initiating statin treatment in CAD patients with baseline LDL-C 70–100 mg/dL in Taiwan could be cost-effective. Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate a hypothetical cohort of CAD patients with a baseline LDL-C level of 90 mg/dL. The incidence and recurrence of MI and stroke related to specific LDL-C levels as well as the statin effect, mortality rate, and health state utilities were obtained from the literature. The direct medical costs and rate of fatal events were derived from the national claims database. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was calculated, and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Moderate-intensity statin use, a treatment regimen expected to achieve LDL <70 mg/dL in the base case, resulted in a net gain of 562 QALYs but with an additional expenditure of $11.4 million per 10,000 patients over ten years. The ICER was $20,288 per QALY gained. The probabilities of being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of one and three gross domestic product per capita ($24,329 in 2017) per QALY were 51.1% and 94.2%, respectively. Annual drug cost was the most influential factor on the ICER. Conclusion: Lowering the target LDL-C level from 100 to 70 mg/dL among treatment-naïve CAD patients could be cost-effective given the health benefits of preventing cardiovascular events and deaths. © 2020",2020-01-32881,32081563,J.

23290,Cost-Effectiveness of Brexanolone Versus Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for the Treatment of Postpartum Depression in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Brexanolone injection (BRX) was approved by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with postpartum depression (PPD), but its cost-effectiveness has not yet been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of BRX compared with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for PPD. METHODS: We projected costs (2018 U.S. dollars) and health (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for mothers treated with BRX or SSRIs and their children. A health state transition model projected clinical and economic outcomes for mothers based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, from a U.S. payer perspective. The modeled population consisted of adult patients with moderate to severe PPD, similar to BRX clinical trial patients. Short-term efficacy for BRX and SSRIs came from an indirect treatment comparison. Long-term efficacy outcomes over 4 weeks, 11 years (base case), and 18 years were based on results from an 18-year longitudinal study. Maternal health utility values came from analysis of trial-based short-form 6D responses. Other inputs were derived from the literature. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for BRX versus SSRIs was $106,662 per QALY gained over an 11-year time horizon. Drug and administration costs for BRX averaged $38,501, compared with $25 for SSRIs over the studied time horizon. Maternal total direct medical costs averaged $65,908 in the BRX arm, compared with $73,653 in the SSRI arm. BRX-treated women averaged 6.230 QALYs compared with 5.979 QALYs for the SSRI arm. Adding partner costs and utilities in a sensitivity analysis further favored BRX. Results were sensitive to the severity of PPD at baseline and the model time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that BRX was cost-effective at the $150,000-per-QALY threshold with 58% probability. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis using a state transition model showed BRX to be a cost-effective therapy compared with SSRIs for treating women with PPD. Copyright©2020, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

23291,Cost-effectiveness of postoperative rehabilitation after surgery for lumbar disc herniation: an analysis based on a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine whether routine referral to municipal postoperative rehabilitation is cost-effective in comparison to no referral after surgery for lumbar disc herniation (LDH). METHODS One hundred forty-six patients scheduled for primary discectomy due to LDH were included. This secondary analysis, based on data from a previous randomized controlled trial, compared costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between two groups of patients recovering from LDH surgery: one group of patients received a referral for municipal physical rehabilitation (REHAB) and the other group was sent home without a referral to any postoperative rehabilitation (HOME). Primary outcomes were QALYs calculated from the EQ-5D utility score, societal costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The main cost-effectiveness analysis used intention-to-treat data, whereas sensitivity analyses included as-treated data. Questionnaires were collected after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS The main cost-effectiveness analysis showed a small, insignificant incremental QALY of 0.021 and an incremental cost of €211.8 for the REHAB group compared to the HOME group, resulting in an ICER of €10,085. In the as-treated sensitivity analysis, the REHAB group had poorer outcomes and higher costs compared to the HOME group.

23292,Cost-effectiveness of long-term clinical management of BRCA pathogenic variant carriers,"Purpose: Women who inherit a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant are at high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of long-term management in clinical practice is lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the real-world cost-effectiveness of BRCA carrier management within a structured clinical program. Methods: Lifetime health outcomes and costs of clinical management for female unaffected BRCA carriers aged 20 were measured using a microsimulation model. For the intervention, women could attend a high-risk clinic, undergo risk-reducing surgery, and receive annual breast screening. Input data for the model was from a clinical database of 983 BRCA carriers. The comparator was no risk management. Outcomes were discounted at 5%. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the program was $32,359 to $48,263 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Limiting uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy to <50% of carriers decreased cost-effectiveness by $7000–8000 per QALY. Achieving perfect adherence to guidelines was less cost-effective for BRCA2 due to increased risk-reducing mastectomy costs with smaller incremental health benefit. Conclusion: Long-term management of BRCA carriers within a structured clinical program is cost-effective. Suboptimal adherence to risk management guidelines can substantially affect outcomes and is an important consideration for future studies. © 2020, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.",2020-01-32887,31996782,Gen.

23294,Cost-Effectiveness of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel as a second-line therapy for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal cancer in China,"Aim That clinical trial (RAINBOW) showed that a 7.4 months overall survival benefit with the combination therapy with ramucirumab (RAM) and paclitaxel (PAC) as second-line therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, compared with placebo (PLA) plus paclitaxel. We performed an analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of RAM from a Chinese perspective and recognized the range of drug costs. Methods By building a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs) and lifetime costs. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities were estimated for the published literature, Chinese health care system and local price setting. We performed threshold analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the uncertainty of the model. Results Compared with PLA strategy, RAM strategy provided an incremental survival benefit of 1.22 LYs and 0.64 QALYs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that when RAM costs less than $151 or $753 per 4 weeks, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) approximated the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP), suggesting that there was 50% likelihood that the ICER for RAM + PAC would be less than $44528.4 per QALY or $48121 per QALY, respectively. Conclusions For patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who fail first-line chemotherapy, our results are conducive to the multilateral drug price guidance negotiations of RAM in China. © 2020 Li et al.

23296,Cost-Effectiveness of Pharmacist-Led Deprescribing of NSAIDs in Community-Dwelling Older Adults,"OBJECTIVES: Older adults are often prescribed potentially inappropriate medications associated with adverse health outcomes and increased health services utilization. Developing Pharmacist-led Research to Educate and Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions Burden in the Elderly (D-PRESCRIBE), a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, demonstrated how a community pharmacist-led evidence-based educational intervention successfully empowered community-dwelling older adults and their physicians to reduce chronic use of inappropriate medications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the D-PRESCRIBE intervention for discontinuing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: Decision analysis combining decision tree and Markov state transition modeling was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) compared with usual care from a Canadian healthcare system perspective with a time horizon of 1 year. Data from the D-PRESCRIBE trial and published literature were used to calculate effectiveness, utilities, and costs. Reference case and scenario analyses were conducted using probabilistic modeling. Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the reference case model. RESULTS: D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) was less costly (-$1008.61) and more effective (.11 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) than usual care and was the dominant strategy. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 per QALY and $100 000 per QALY, D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) incurred a positive incremental net benefit compared with usual care, suggesting it is cost-effective. Compared with the reference case, scenario analyses gave comparable QALYs with modest variation in cost estimates. CONCLUSION: For community-dwelling older adults, D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) provides greater benefits at lower system costs, making it a compelling strategy to reduce the use and harms associated with chronic NSAID consumption. Our findings support reimbursing community pharmacists’ clinical professional services for deprescribing inappropriate NSAIDs in community-dwelling older adults.

23297,Cost-effectiveness of a mobile health-supported lifestyle intervention for pregnant women with an elevated body mass index,"Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a mobile health-supported lifestyle intervention compared with usual care. Methods: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the publicly-funded health care system. We estimated costs associated with the intervention and health care utilisation from first antenatal care appointment through delivery. We used bootstrap methods to quantify the uncertainty around cost-effectiveness estimates. Health outcomes assessed in this analysis were gestational weight gain (GWG; kg), incidence of excessive GWG, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per QALY gained, cost per kg of GWG avoided, cost per case of excessive GWG averted, and cost per case of LGA averted. Results: Total mean cost including intervention and health care utilisation was €3745 in the intervention group and €3471 in the control group (mean difference €274, P = 0.08). The ICER was €2914 per QALY gained. Assuming a ceiling ratio of €45,000, the probability that the intervention was cost-effective based on QALYs was 79%. Cost per kg of GWG avoided was €209. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) for kg of GWG avoided reached a confidence level of 95% at €905, indicating that if one is willing to pay a maximum of an additional €905 per kg of GWG avoided, there is a 95% probability that the intervention is cost-effective. Costs per case of excessive GWG averted and case of LGA averted were €2117 and €5911, respectively. The CEAC for case of excessive GWG averted and for case of LGA averted reached a confidence level of 95% at €7090 and €25,737, respectively. Conclusions: Results suggest that a mobile-health lifestyle intervention could be cost-effective; however, a better understanding of the short- and long-term costs of LGA and excessive GWG is necessary to confirm the results. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",2020-01-32897,31965073,Int.

23298,Cost-effectiveness and Net Monetary Benefit of Durvalumab Consolidation Therapy Versus No Consolidation Therapy After Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in the Italian National Health Service,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and net monetary benefit of durvalumab consolidation therapy compared with no consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III non–small cell lung cancer with programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 expression =1% from the Italian National Health Service perspective. Methods: We developed a 12-month decision tree combined with a lifetime cohort Markov model in which patients were assigned to receive durvalumab consolidation therapy or active follow-up (Italian standard of care) after chemoradiotherapy to compare cost-effectiveness and net monetary benefit of the two strategies during a 40-year period. Clinical outcomes data were obtained from the respective clinical trials and extrapolated using survival analysis; cost data were derived from Italian official sources and relevant real-world studies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, incremental cost-utility ratio, and incremental net monetary benefit were computed and compared against a 16,372 € per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) willingness-to-pay threshold. We performed deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess how uncertainty affected results; we also performed scenario analyses to compare results under different pricing settings. Findings: In the base-case scenario, during a 40-year period, the total costs for patients treated with durvalumab consolidation therapy and active follow-up were €59,860 and €49,840 respectively; life-years gained were 3.47 and 3.31, respectively; and QALYs gained were 2.73 and 2.50, respectively, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €62,131 per life-year, an incremental cost-utility ratio of €42,322 per QALY, and an incremental net monetary benefit of €-6,144. We found that durvalumab was cost-effective (incremental net monetary benefit = 0) when a discount of 13% and 30% on its official price was applied, considering all other drugs priced according to official or maximum selling prices, respectively. Results were most sensitive to the progression-free survival rate for durvalumab and active follow-up, health utility in progression-free state, and price of subsequent treatments. Implications: Our analysis indicates that durvalumab consolidation is cost-effective when a discount is applied on its official price. These results suggest that durvalumab may deliver an incremental health benefit with a contained upfront cost during a 40-year period, from the Italian National Health Service perspective, providing added value in a potentially curative care setting. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020-01-32898,32354495,Clin Ther,P Armeni,2020,42 / 5,830-847,Yes,32354495,"P Armeni; Gerard P Slobogean; L Borsoi; G Fornaro; C Jommi; F Grossi; F Costa; Cost-effectiveness and Net Monetary Benefit of Durvalumab Consolidation Therapy Versus No Consolidation Therapy After Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in the Italian National Health Service, Clin Ther, 2020; 42(5):1879-114X; 830-847",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,durvalumab consolidation therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy,stage III and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 expression >=1%,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"40 Years, 12 months",3.00,3.00,42322,Euro,2019,47990.94
23299,Neoadjuvant treatment strategies for HER2-positive breast cancer: cost-effectiveness and quality of life outcomes,"Purpose: Achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) with neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with less recurrence and improved clinical outcomes compared to having residual cancer at surgery. However, recent data have demonstrated favorable outcomes for patients with residual HER2-positive cancer who received adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1). Therefore, we sought to determine the optimal chemotherapy/anti-HER2 treatment strategy. Methods: We created a decision-analytic model for patients with stage II–III HER2-positive cancer that incorporated utilities based on toxicity and recurrence. We separately modeled hormone receptor-negative (HR-) and positive (HR+) disease and calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs through 5 years. Simulated patients received one of the following neoadjuvant treatments: three ‘intensive’ regimens (TCHP: docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab; THP + AC: taxol, trastuzumab, pertuzumab then doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; THP: taxol, trastuzumab, pertuzumab) and two ‘de-escalated’ regimens (TH: taxol, trastuzumab; TDM-1) followed by adjuvant treatment based on pathologic response. Results: Among ‘intensive’ neoadjuvant strategies, treatment with THP was more effective and less costly than TCHP or THP + AC. When ‘de-escalated’ strategies were included, TH became the most cost-effective. For HR-negative cancer, TH had 0.003 fewer quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than THP but was less costly by $55,831, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of over $18M/QALY for THP, well above any threshold. For HR-positive cancer, neoadjuvant TH dominated the THP strategy. Conclusion: An adaptive-treatment strategy beginning with neoadjuvant THP or TH followed by tailoring post-operative therapy reduces treatment costs, and spares toxicity compared to more intensive chemotherapy regimens for women with HER2-positive breast cancer. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020-01-32903,32185586,Breast Cancer Res.
