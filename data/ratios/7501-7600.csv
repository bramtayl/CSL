7501,Cost effectiveness of preventive screening programmes for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany,"As in several other industrialized countries, Germany's statutory health insurance (SHI) is facing rising healthcare costs as well as the challenges caused by a double-aging society. The early detection and prevention of chronic diseases is considered a possible way to reduce the impact of these developments. However, controversy surrounds the costs and effects in terms of medical and financial outcomes of such programmes.To examine the cost effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from the perspective of the German SHI. The screening programme was compared with the current status quo (i.e. diagnosis of T2DM in routine clinical care or after the occurrence of the first clinical symptoms). Prevention strategies after diagnosis of pre-diabetes encompassed lifestyle and metformin interventions.Effects of introducing screening for T2DM were assessed based on a Markov Monte Carlo microsimulation model. In contrast to a cohort model, this approach easily allows for detailed subgroup analysis accounting for the different characteristics of the general German population that would be targeted by the screening programme. Assessed endpoints included quality of life, lifetime costs, age at diabetes diagnosis, and incidence and age at occurrence of diabetes-related complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and blindness.Screening for T2DM was cost effective in the general population by all commonly applied standards (euro562.54 per QALY for lifestyle intervention, euro325.44 per QALY for prevention with metformin [year 2006 values]) and even cost saving in the subgroup diagnosed with pre-diabetes and treated preventively. Occurrence of diabetes-related adverse events was reduced significantly and life expectancy was increased compared with no screening.These results suggest that early detection and disease prevention may be cost effective in the long term. However, additional political measures are necessary to support implementation, as the German SHI is currently lacking the necessary long-term incentives to support preventive screening programmes.",2010-01-11789,20408603,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Thilo M Schaufler,2010,8 / 3,191-202,Yes,20408603,"Thilo M Schaufler; Malte Wolff; Cost effectiveness of preventive screening programmes for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 8(3):1179-1896; 191-202",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) followed by prevention strategies with intensive lifestyle interventions vs. Status quo (diagnosis after the occurrence of the first clinical symptoms without preventive screening),Not Stated,75 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,Not Stated,562,Euro,2006,906.4

7507,Modelling the economic value of cross- and sustained-protection in vaccines against cervical cancer,"Two human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are on the market. Based on expected differences in sustained- and cross-protection between the two vaccines, their long-term economic value is modelled and compared for France, Ireland and Italy.A Markov cohort model reproducing the natural history of HPV infections, screening and vaccination, is adapted to country-specific data. Two hypothetical HPV vaccines (VA and VB) are compared. At baseline VA provides lifetime protection against HPV-16 and 10-year protection against HPV-18 before waning. VB is the same as VA with a 10-year protection against HPV-6 and 11. Sustained- and cross-protection is varied over wide ranges in VA to define the levels that could make VA cost-effective or dominant compared with VB.Under baseline conditions VB dominates VA. VA becomes cost-effective when the difference in cross-protection alone reaches 13-15% (undiscounted), and 22-44% (discounted). A combination of sustained- and cross-protection is required for VA to dominate VB (discounted).

7513,Cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in the prevention of cervical cancer in Malaysia,"Cervical cancers (CC) demonstrate the second highest incidence of female cancers in Malaysia. The costs of chronic management have a high impact on nation's health cost and patient's quality of life that can be avoided by better screening and HPV vaccination.Respondents were interviewed from six public Gynecology-Oncology hospitals. Methods include experts' panel discussions to estimate treatment costs by severity and direct interviews with respondents using costing and SF-36 quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. Three options were compared i.e. screening via Pap smear; quadrivalent HPV Vaccination and combined strategy (screening plus vaccination). Scenario based sensitivity analysis using screening population coverage (40-80%) and costs of vaccine (RM 300-400/dose) were calculated.502 cervical pre invasive and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) patients participated in the study. Mean age was 53.3 +/- 11.2 years, educated till secondary level (39.4%), Malays (44.2%) and married for 27.73 +/- 12.1 years. Life expectancy gained from vaccination is 13.04 years and average Quality Adjusted Life Years saved (QALYs) is 24.4 in vaccinated vs 6.29 in unvaccinated. Cost/QALYs for Pap smear at base case is RM 1,214.96/QALYs and RM 1,100.01 at increased screening coverage; for HPV Vaccination base case is at RM 35,346.79 and RM 46,530.08 when vaccination price is higher. In combined strategy, base case is RM 11,289.58; RM 7,712.74 at best case and RM 14,590.37 at worst case scenario.

7514,Cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in the prevention of cervical cancer in Malaysia,"Cervical cancers (CC) demonstrate the second highest incidence of female cancers in Malaysia. The costs of chronic management have a high impact on nation's health cost and patient's quality of life that can be avoided by better screening and HPV vaccination.Respondents were interviewed from six public Gynecology-Oncology hospitals. Methods include experts' panel discussions to estimate treatment costs by severity and direct interviews with respondents using costing and SF-36 quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. Three options were compared i.e. screening via Pap smear; quadrivalent HPV Vaccination and combined strategy (screening plus vaccination). Scenario based sensitivity analysis using screening population coverage (40-80%) and costs of vaccine (RM 300-400/dose) were calculated.502 cervical pre invasive and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) patients participated in the study. Mean age was 53.3 +/- 11.2 years, educated till secondary level (39.4%), Malays (44.2%) and married for 27.73 +/- 12.1 years. Life expectancy gained from vaccination is 13.04 years and average Quality Adjusted Life Years saved (QALYs) is 24.4 in vaccinated vs 6.29 in unvaccinated. Cost/QALYs for Pap smear at base case is RM 1,214.96/QALYs and RM 1,100.01 at increased screening coverage; for HPV Vaccination base case is at RM 35,346.79 and RM 46,530.08 when vaccination price is higher. In combined strategy, base case is RM 11,289.58; RM 7,712.74 at best case and RM 14,590.37 at worst case scenario.

7515,Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce HIV/STI incidence and promote condom use among female sex workers in the Mexico-US border region,"Previous research demonstrated efficacy of a brief behavioral intervention to reduce incidence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs) in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, cities on Mexico's border with the US. We assessed this intervention's cost-effectiveness.A life-time Markov model was developed to estimate HIV cases prevented, changes in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and costs per additional quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY), comparing (in US$2,009) no intervention to a once-only and annual intervention. Future costs and health benefits were discounted annually at 3%. Sensitivity analyses evaluated model robustness. We found that for a hypothetical 1,000 FSWs receiving the once-only intervention, there were 33 HIV cases prevented and 5.7 months of QALE gained compared to no intervention. The additional cost per QALY gained was US$183. For FSWs receiving the intervention annually, there were 29 additional HIV cases prevented and 4.5 additional months of QALE compared to the once-only intervention. The additional cost per QALY was US$1,075. When highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was included in the model, the annual intervention strategy resulted in net savings and dominated both once-only and no intervention strategies, and remained robust across extensive sensitivity analyses. Even when considering clinical benefits from HAART, ignoring added costs, the cost per QALY gained remained below three times the Mexican GDP per capita, and below established cost-effectiveness thresholds.This brief intervention was shown to be cost-effective among FSWs in two Mexico-US border cities and may have application for FSWs in other resource-limited settings.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00338845.",2010-01-11848,20617193,PLoS One,Jos?

7520,A health-economic analysis of porcine islet xenotransplantation,"Islet cell transplantation is a promising treatment for type 1 diabetes. To overcome the shortage of deceased human pancreas donors, porcine islet cell xenotransplantation is being developed as an alternative to allotransplantation. The objective of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of porcine islet transplantation in comparison with standard insulin therapy. The patient population for this study was young adults, ages 20 to 40, for whom standard medical care is inadequate in controlling blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia unawareness). Since trial data were lacking, estimates used extrapolations from data found in the literature and ongoing trials in clinical allotransplantation. Cost estimates were based on the data available in the USA.Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulations using software specifically developed for health-economic evaluations were used. Outcomes data for ongoing clinical islet allotransplantation from the University of Minnesota were used, along with probabilities of complications from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were the effectiveness measure. The upper limit of being cost-effective is $100,000 per QALY. Cost data from the literature were used and adjusted to 2007 US dollars using the medical care portion of the Consumer Price Index.In both Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulations, porcine islet xenotransplantation was both more effective and less costly over the course of the 20-yr model. For standard insulin therapy, cumulative cost per patient was $661,000, while cumulative effectiveness was 9.4 QALYs, for a cost of $71,100 per QALY. Transplantation had a cumulative cost of $659 000 per patient, a cumulative effectiveness of 10.9 QALYs, and a cost per QALY of $60,700. Islet transplantation became cost-effective at 4 yr after transplantation, and was more cost-effective than standard insulin treatment at 14 yr. These findings are related to relative high costs in the transplantation arm of the evaluation during the first years while those in the insulin arm became higher later in follow-up. Throughout the follow-up period, effectiveness of transplantation was higher than that of insulin treatment. In sensitivity analysis, duplication or triplication of one-time initial costs such as costs of donor animal, islet manufacturing and transplantation had no effect on long-term outcome in terms of cost-saving or cost-effectiveness, but the outcome of transplantation in terms of diabetes complications in cases with partial graft function could affect cost-saving and cost-effectiveness conclusions.Despite limitations in the model and lack of trial data, and under the assumption that islet transplantation outcomes for young adult type 1 diabetes patients are not dependent on the source of islet cells, this health-economic evaluation suggests that porcine islet cell xenotransplantation may prove to be a cost-effective and possibly cost-saving procedure for type 1 diabetes compared to standard management.",2010-01-11866,20636544,Xenotransplantation,Jessica Beckwith,2010,17 / 3,233-42,No,20636544,"Jessica Beckwith; John A Nyman; Brian Flanagan; Rudolf Schrover; Henk-Jan Schuurman; A health-economic analysis of porcine islet xenotransplantation, Xenotransplantation, ; 17(3):1399-3089; 233-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Porcine islet transplantation vs. Standard insluin therapy,Not Stated,40 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-2139.04,United States,2007,-2670.02

7524,A microsimulation of the cost-effectiveness of maraviroc for antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-infected individuals,"Maraviroc (MVC) is the first approved CCR5 antagonist. The aim of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of MVC in treatment-experienced or treatment-resistant HIV-infected adults.The validated HIV microsimulation model ARAMIS was used to predict clinical and economic outcomes of treating patients with optimized background therapy (OBT) alone, as compared to a strategy of testing for the patient's viral tropism and treating with OBT with or without (+/-) MVC in a cohort corresponding to the MOTIVATE screening cohort.Compared to treatment with OBT alone, a treatment strategy of OBT +/- MVC (twice daily) according to tropism test result was predicted to increase CD4+ cell count after 5 years (from mean 249 to 360 cells/microL), undiscounted life expectancy (7.6 to 8.9 years), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; from 4.99 to 5.71) for an additional $40,500, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $56,400 per QALY gained. The result was relatively insensitive to alternative clinical and cost assumptions within reasonable ranges, but for individuals with HIV susceptible to only two or fewer components of OBT, the ICER decreased to $52,000 per QALY gained.MVC is cost-effective, especially among individuals with few remaining options for active antiretroviral therapy.",2010-01-11923,20542845,HIV Clin Trials,Felicitas C Kühne,2010,11 / 2,80-99,No,20542845,"Felicitas C Kühne; Jeremy Chancellor; Patrick Mollon; Daniela E Myers; Michael Louie; William G Powderly; A microsimulation of the cost-effectiveness of maraviroc for antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-infected individuals, HIV Clin Trials, ; 11(2):1528-4336; 80-99",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Optimized background therapy (OBT) with or without Maraviroc (MVC) based on tropism test results vs. No tropism testing and treating entire population with OBT without addition of MVC,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,56443,United States,2006,72460.66

Those in the aggressively treated group gained 0.0480 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) over the standard group. When a 3% discount rate for costs and outcomes was used, the resulting cost per QALY was $82,589.The use of a 25%, 50%, and 75% reduction in drug costs resulted in a cost per QALY of $61,329, $40,070, and $18,810, respectively.This study was limited by use of a single ethnic group and by its 3-year duration.Within this 3-year study, treatment to lower BP and LDL-C below standard targets was not cost-effective because of the cost of the additional medications required to meet the lower targets.

The aim was to analyze the cost-utility of six-month methadone maintenance treatment program in a Lithuanian primary health care setting.A prospective study design was used. All the information was obtained through the validated questionnaires at the baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. WHOQOL-BREF was used to assess the quality of life; the costs were assessed using the DATCAP methodology from the perspective of a patient and outpatient clinic during follow-up period.A total of 102 opioid-dependent patients were recruited in the study; 512 follow-up patient-months were obtained. The methadone maintenance treatment has significantly improved physical, psychological, and environmental components of quality of life during follow-up. Total program costs were 61 288.87 EUR. Cost paid by a patient comprised about 31% of total program costs. Cost per quality-adjusted life-month (QALM) for physical domain was 2227.55 EUR; for psychological domain, 1879.50 EUR; for social domain, 5467.64 EUR; and for environmental domain, 4626.47 EUR.

Both acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and clopidogrel have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in various subgroups of patients with vascular disease.To estimate the cost effectiveness of clopidogrel versus aspirin in Sweden for the prevention of atherothrombotic events based on CAPRIE trial data. The focus of this study is on two high-risk subpopulations: (i) patients with pre-existing symptomatic atherosclerotic disease; and (ii) patients with polyvascular disease.A Markov model combining clinical, epidemiological and cost data was used to assess the economic value of clopidogrel compared with aspirin during a patient's lifetime. A societal perspective was used, with costs stated in Swedish kronor (SEK), year 2007 values. For the first 2 years, the clinical input for the model was based on the relevant subpopulations in the CAPRIE trial. Thereafter, transition probabilities were extrapolated, taking account of increased risks related to age and to a history of events. Cost effectiveness of 2 years of therapy is presented as cost per life-year gained (LYG) and as cost per QALY. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate robustness of results.For patients resembling the total CAPRIE population, who were treated with clopidogrel, the expected cost per LYG was SEK217,806 and the cost per QALY was estimated at SEK169,154.

7533,Cost effectiveness of insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetes drugs compared with premixed insulin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Canada,"Several treatment options are available for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are making the transition from oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) to insulin. Two options currently recommended by the Canadian Diabetes Association for initiating insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who are no longer responsive to OADs alone are insulin glargine plus OADs, and premixed insulin therapy only. Because of differences in efficacy, adverse events (such as hypoglycaemia) and acquisition costs, these two treatment options may lead to different long-term clinical and economic outcomes.To determine the cost effectiveness of insulin glargine plus OADs compared with premixed insulin without OADs in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes in Canada.Using treatment effects taken from a published clinical trial, the validated IMS-CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate the long-term cost effectiveness of insulin glargine with OADs, versus premixed insulin. Input treatment effects for the two therapeutic approaches were based on changes in glycosylated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) at clinical trial endpoint, and hypoglycaemia rates. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Canadian Provincial payer. Direct treatment and complication costs were obtained from published sources (primarily from Ontario) and reported in $Can, year 2008 values. All base-case costs and outcomes were discounted at 5% per year. Sensitivity analyses were conducted around key parameters and assumptions used in the study. Outcomes included direct medical costs associated with both treatment and diabetes-related complications. Cost-effectiveness outcomes included total average lifetime (35 years) costs, life expectancy (LE), QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).Base-case analyses showed that, compared with premixed insulin only, insulin glargine in combination with OADs was associated with a 0.051-year increase in LE and a 0.043 increase in QALYs. Insulin glargine plus OADs showed a very slight increase in total direct costs ($Can 343 +/- 2572), resulting in ICERs of $Can 6750 per life-year gained (LYG) and $Can 7923 per QALY gained. However, considerable uncertainty around the ICERs was demonstrated by insulin glargine having a 50% probability of being cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can 10,000 per QALY, and a 54% probability at a $Can 20,000 threshold. Base-case results were most sensitive to assumed disutilities for hypoglycaemic events, to the assumed effect of insulin glargine plus OADs on HbA(1c), and to its assumed acquisition costs.These findings should be interpreted within the context of a large degree of uncertainty and of several study limitations that include a single clinical trial as the source for primary treatment assumptions and a single province as the source for most cost inputs. Under current study assumptions and limitations, insulin glargine plus OADs was projected to be a cost-effective option, compared with premixed insulin only, for the treatment of insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes unresponsive to OADs.

7534,Cost Effectiveness of Paricalcitol versus a non-selective vitamin D receptor activator for secondary hyperparathyroidism in the UK: a chronic kidney disease markov model,"secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a frequent cause of clinically significant bone disease. Non-selective vitamin D receptor (VDR) activator treatment has been used to treat the condition but is ineffective for many patients with hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia and may precipitate worsening of their condition. Compared with non-selective VDR activator treatment, use of the VDR ligand paricalcitol may increase survival and reduce the risk of morbidities in patients with SHPT, which may have health economic consequences.the objective of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness of paricalcitol versus a non-selective VDR activator for the treatment of SHPT in patients with CKD in the UK setting. Methods: A Markov process model was developed employing data sources from the published literature, paricalcitol clinical trials and observational studies, official UK price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was alfacalcidol, a non-selective VDR activator medication. The primary perspective of the study was that of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The efficacy outcomes (reductions in SHPT, proteinuria, complications and mortality) were extrapolated to: number of life-years gained (LYG) and number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. The year of costing for costs determined in the study was 2006.the reference case analysis was a 10-year time horizon, based on a comparison of paricalcitol with a non-selective VDR activator, which is started in CKD stage 3 (moderate reduction in glomerular filtration rate [GFR] with kidney damage) and continued in CKD stage 4 (severe reduction in GFR) and CKD stage 5 (established kidney failure). The use of paricalcitol leads to an additional medical cost of pound3224 ($US5970). The health benefits of paricalcitol lead to an increase in LYG of 0.52 and a gain in QALYs of 0.465. Therefore the use of paricalcitol results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound6933/QALY ($US12 840/QALY) from the primary perspective of the NHS. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model.this model showed that the favourable clinical benefit of paricalcitol results in positive short- and long-term health economic benefits. This study suggests that the use of paricalcitol in patients with early CKD may be cost effective from the UK NHS perspective versus non-selective VDR activator medication.",2010-01-11943,20586517,Clin Drug Investig,Mark Nuijten,2010,30 / 8,545-57,Yes,20586517,"Mark Nuijten; Dennis L Andress; Steven E Marx; Alistair S Curry; Raimund Sterz; Cost Effectiveness of Paricalcitol versus a non-selective vitamin D receptor activator for secondary hyperparathyroidism in the UK: a chronic kidney disease markov model, Clin Drug Investig, ; 30(8):1173-2563; 545-57",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Paricalcitol (vitamin D receptor ligand) vs. Alfacalcidol (non-selective vitamin D receptor activator),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,6933,United Kingdom,2006,16406.85
7535,Cost-effectiveness of somatropin for the treatment of short children born small for gestational age,"Short children born small for gestational age (SGA) may be at increased risk for long-term morbidity and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) due to their short stature. Normalization of height in childhood and adolescence is possible in such children via the use of the recombinant human growth hormone somatropin.The aim of this study was to determine whether somatropin was a cost-effective treatment option in short children born SGA.A decision analytic model was constructed to calculate the cost-effectiveness of somatropin treatment versus no treatment over the lifetime of a short individual born SGA, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The model was based on patient-level data from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that reported the effects of somatropin on final (adult) height in short children born SGA. Health care resource and drug costs associated with each of the treatment arms were considered, and published utility scores were used to calculate improvement in HRQoL. The model calculated incremental costs and incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with somatropin treatment compared with no treatment. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as incremental cost per QALY and cost per centimeter of height gained.Over a patient's lifetime, somatropin (0.033 mg/kg/d) treatment was associated with a height gain of 16.12 cm and a cost per centimeter of height gained of pound4359 compared with no treatment. The incremental cost of somatropin treatment was pound70,263, with a QALY gain of 2.95, resulting in an incremental cost per QALY of pound23,807-below the widely accepted cost-effectiveness threshold in the United Kingdom of pound30,000.In this model, somatropin was a cost-effective treatment option for short children born SGA from the perspective of the UK NHS.",2010-01-11944,20637961,Clin Ther,Torsten Christensen,2010,32 / 6,1068-82,Yes,20637961,"Torsten Christensen; Andrew Buckland; Anthony Bentley; Christian Djurhuus; Rachael Baker-Searle; Cost-effectiveness of somatropin for the treatment of short children born small for gestational age, Clin Ther, ; 32(6):1879-114X; 1068-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Somatropin vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,23807,United Kingdom,2007,59492.73
7536,"If you try to stop smoking, should we pay for it? The cost-utility of reimbursing smoking cessation support in the Netherlands","Smoking cessation can be encouraged by reimbursing the costs of smoking cessation support (SCS). The short-term efficiency of reimbursement has been evaluated previously. However, a thorough estimate of the long-term cost-utility is lacking.To evaluate long-term effects of reimbursement of SCS.Results from a randomized controlled trial were extrapolated to long-term outcomes in terms of health care costs and (quality adjusted) life years (QALY) gained, using the Chronic Disease Model. Our first scenario was no reimbursement. In a second scenario, the short-term cessation rates from the trial were extrapolated directly. Sensitivity analyses were based on the trial's confidence intervals. In the third scenario the additional use of SCS as found in the trial was combined with cessation rates from international meta-analyses.Intervention costs per QALY gained compared to the reference scenario were approximately euro1200 extrapolating the trial effects directly, and euro4200 when combining the trial's use of SCS with the cessation rates from the literature. Taking all health care effects into account, even costs in life years gained, resulted in an estimated incremental cost-utility of euro4500 and euro7400, respectively. In both scenarios costs per QALY remained below euro16 000 in sensitivity analyses using a life-time horizon.Extrapolating the higher use of SCS due to reimbursement led to more successful quitters and a gain in life years and QALYs.

7537,"Multimodal exercise improves quality of life of women being treated for breast cancer, but at what cost? Randomized trial with economic evaluation","To evaluate the efficacy and economic efficiency of a multimedia, multimodal physical activity program for women undergoing adjuvant therapy following surgery for breast cancer. We conducted a randomized trial with concurrent incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and blinded baseline, 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up assessments amongst women undergoing adjuvant therapy following surgery for breast cancer (n = 89). The intervention was a multimedia, multimodal exercise program comprising strength, balance and endurance training elements. The control was sham flexibility and relaxation program delivered using similar materials. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (EQ-5D & VAS, EORTC C30, BR23). Economic outcomes included direct health care costs and productivity gains and losses. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated greater improvement in health-related quality of life between baseline and the 3-month assessment [mean (sd) EQ-5D VAS (0-100) baseline: 72.6 (15.6), 3 month: 80.6 (11.6)] when compared to control group participants [baseline: 77.5 (13.5), 3 month: 74.1 (20.6), P = 0.006] and also improved more in terms of physical function [mean (sd) EORTC C30 physical function scale intervention (0-100) baseline: 84.9 (14.8), 3 month: 86.9 (10.7), control baseline: 91.3 (9.6), 3 month: 86.7 (14.9), P = 0.02]. These improvements were not sustained beyond this point. Upper limb volumes were also lower amongst intervention group participants. However, there was low probability that the intervention would be both less costly and more effective than the control condition (range probability = 0.05-50.02% depending on approach).

Treatment outcomes and direct costs were analysed for both the high-risk non-compliant patient population and the general schizophrenia population.An existing DES model was adapted to simulate the treatment of schizophrenia in Sweden. Model inputs were based on literature research and supplemented with expert opinion. In the high-risk non-compliant schizophrenia population, RLAI was compared with haloperidol LAI. The analysis was built upon differences in symptom reduction, time between relapses, compliance and adverse effect profile between the two drugs. Main outcomes were the predicted incremental (discounted) costs (?) and effects (QALYs). In the general schizophrenia population, RLAI was compared with oral olanzapine. This analysis was built upon differences in compliance and adverse effects between the drugs. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were carried out to assess the sensitivity of the results of the two analyses.In the high-risk non-compliant patient population, RLAI was predicted to generate 0.103 QALYs per patient over 3 years while realizing cost savings of ?5013 (year 2007 values) compared with haloperidol LAI. The main driver of the cost effectiveness of RLAI was the difference in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) reduction between the two drugs, followed by the difference in adverse effects. The PSA showed that, in this setting, RLAI had a probability of 100% of being cost effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of ?43,300 per QALY gained, compared with haloperidol LAI. The probability that RLAI combines additional effectiveness with cost savings compared with haloperidol LAI was estimated at 94%. When analysing RLAI in the general schizophrenia population, it was predicted to generate 0.043 QALYs and save ?239 per patient over 5 years compared with olanzapine. Compliance was the main driver of the cost effectiveness of RLAI in this scenario. In the PSA it was shown that RLAI had a probability of 78% of being cost effective at a WTP threshold of ?43,300 per QALY gained, compared with olanzapine. The estimated probability that RLAI combines additional effectiveness with cost savings was 50% and the probability that RLAI is less effective and more costly than olanzapine was negligible (0.2%).Treatment with RLAI is suggested to result in improved QALYs combined with cost savings compared with haloperidol LAI among the Swedish, high-risk non-compliant schizophrenia patient population. In the general schizophrenia population, RLAI also resulted in positive incremental QALYs and cost savings, when compared with olanzapine.

7561,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in Brazil in the public and private sectors,"Many randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICDs) in death reduction of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Some developed countries studies have evaluated its cost-effectiveness, but these data are not applicable to Brazil.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICD in CHF patients under two perspectives in Brazil: public and supplementary health systems.A Markov model was developed to analyze the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ICD compared to conventional therapy in patients with CHF. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We searched the literature for data regarding effectiveness and complications. Costs were retrieved from public and health insurances reimbursement codebooks and from mean cost of admissions from a public and a private hospital. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed in all variables of the model.ICER was R$ 68,318/QALY in the public and R$ 90,942/QALY in the private perspective.

7562,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in Brazil in the public and private sectors,"Many randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICDs) in death reduction of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Some developed countries studies have evaluated its cost-effectiveness, but these data are not applicable to Brazil.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICD in CHF patients under two perspectives in Brazil: public and supplementary health systems.A Markov model was developed to analyze the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ICD compared to conventional therapy in patients with CHF. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We searched the literature for data regarding effectiveness and complications. Costs were retrieved from public and health insurances reimbursement codebooks and from mean cost of admissions from a public and a private hospital. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed in all variables of the model.ICER was R$ 68,318/QALY in the public and R$ 90,942/QALY in the private perspective.

7563,Societal costs of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome,"To estimate the societal costs of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in New Zealand and develop a simulation tool to evaluate treatment options.Treatment profiles, availability, uptake, and costs were based on services in the Wellington Region, and were used to develop a decision analytic model with micro costing of each potential outcome. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations randomly varying each model parameter between high and low estimates.Total annual societal costs of OSAS for New Zealanders aged 30-60 years were estimated at $40 million (range $33-$90 million) or $419 per case, with accidents being the major contributor. This included 58% direct medical, 13% direct non-medical, 25% indirect, and 3% intangible costs. The estimated incremental net cost of treating OSAS was $389 per case treated (range $338-$427). The estimated incremental net direct medical cost per quality of life year (QALY) gained was $94 (range $56-$310).The estimated incremental direct medical cost per QALY gained by OSAS treatment is well below the average QALY cost ($6865) for drugs selected by PHARMAC to receive government subsidy for use in the healthcare system.

Effectiveness data were derived from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention AHI study conducted in three settings: municipal sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, a community clinic serving a population of men who have sex with men, and HIV counseling and testing sites. Our analysis included a micro-costing study of NAAT and a mathematical model of HIV transmission. Cost-effectiveness ratios are reported as costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in US dollars from the societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on key variables, including AHI positivity rates, antibody testing frequency, symptomatic detection of AHI, and costs. Pooled NAAT for AHI screening following annual antibody testing had cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding US$200,000 per QALY gained for the municipal STD clinics and HIV counseling and testing sites and was cost saving for the community clinic.

7577,Reducing uncertainty in value-based pricing using evidence development agreements: the case of continuous intraduodenal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa (Duodopa?) in Sweden,"Value-based pricing (VBP), whereby prices are set according to the perceived benefits offered to the consumer at a time when costs and benefits are characterized by considerable uncertainty and are then reviewed ex post, is a much discussed topic in pharmaceutical reimbursement. It is usually combined with coverage with evidence development (CED), a tool in which manufacturers are granted temporary reimbursement but are required to collect and submit additional health economic data at review. Many countries, including the UK, are signalling shifts in this direction. Several countries, including Sweden, have already adopted this approach and offer good insight into the benefits and pitfalls in actual practice.To describe VBP reimbursement decision making using CED in actual practice in Sweden.Decision making by The Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV) in Sweden was reviewed using a case study of continuous intraduodenal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa (Duodopa?) in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) with severe motor fluctuations.The manufacturer of Duodopa? applied for reimbursement in late 2003. While the proper economic data were not included in the submission, TLV granted reimbursement until early 2005 to provide time for the manufacturer to submit a formal economic evaluation. The re-submission with economic data was considered inadequate to judge cost effectiveness, so TLV granted an additional extension of reimbursement until August 2007, at which time conclusive data were expected. The manufacturer initiated a 3-year, prospective health economic study and a formal economic model. Data from a pre-planned interim analysis of the data were loaded into the model and the cost-effectiveness ratio was the basis of the next re-submission. TLV concluded that the data were suitable for making a definite decision and that the drug was not cost effective, deciding to discontinue reimbursement for any new patients (current patients were unaffected). The manufacturer continued to collect data and to improve the economic model and re-submitted in 2008. New data and the improved model resulted in reduced uncertainty and a lower cost-effectiveness ratio in the range of Swedish kronor (SEK)430,000 per QALY gained in the base-case analysis, ranging up to SEK900,000 in the most conservative sensitivity analysis, resulting in reimbursement being granted.The case of Duodopa? provides excellent insight into VBP reimbursement decision making in combination with CED and ex post review in actual practice. Publicly available decisions document the rigorous, time-consuming process (four iterations were required before a final decision could be reached). The data generated as part of the risk-sharing agreement proved correct the initial decision to grant limited coverage despite lack of economic data. Access was provided to 100 patients while evidence was generated.Economic appraisal differs from clinical assessment, and decision makers benefit from analysis of naturalistic, actual practice data. Despite reviewing the initial trial-based, 'piggy-back' economic analysis, TLV was uncertain of the cost effectiveness in actual practice and deferred a final decision until observational data from the DAPHNE study became available. Second, acceptance of economic modelling and use of temporary reimbursement conditional on additional evidence development provide a mechanism for risk sharing between TLV and manufacturers, which enabled patient access to a drug with proven clinical benefit while necessary evidence to support claims of cost effectiveness could be generated.",2010-01-12041,21043539,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Michael Willis,2010,8 / 6,377-86,Yes,21043539,"Michael Willis; Ulf Persson; York Zoellner; Birgit Gradl; Reducing uncertainty in value-based pricing using evidence development agreements: the case of continuous intraduodenal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa (Duodopa?) in Sweden, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 8(6):1179-1896; 377-86",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intraduodenal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa (Duodopa) vs. Conventional oral treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,430000,Sweden,2008,79415.42

The cost-effectiveness of BIAsp 30 versus IGlarg in the Chinese setting is estimated here.The validated and peer-reviewed CORE Diabetes Model was used. The nephropathy, retinopathy, and stroke submodels were modified to incorporate available Chinese clinical data. Diabetes complication costs were derived from hospital surveys in Beijing and Chengdu. Simulated cohorts and insulin treatment effects were based on the OnceMix study for once-daily BIAsp 30 versus IGlarg and on the INITIATE study for twice-daily BIAsp 30 versus IGlarg. Life expectancy and direct medical costs were calculated. Projections were made over 30-year time horizons, with costs and life years discounted at 3% annually. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed, including adjustments to cardiovascular risk for Chinese ethnicity.Once-daily BIAsp 30 increased life expectancy by 0.04 years (12.37 vs. 12.33 years) and reduced direct medical costs by Chinese Yuan (CNY) 59,710 per patient (CNY 229,911 vs. CNY 289,621 per patient) compared with IGlarg in the OnceMix-based analysis.

Improvements in life expectancy were driven by reduced incidences of most diabetes-related complications.

Parameters from ACTG A5164 included initial mean CD4 count (47/microL), linkage to outpatient care (87%), and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 1 month after ART initiation (7%). The estimated intervention cost was $1,650/patient.early ART lowered projected 1-year mortality from 10.4% to 8.2% and increased life expectancy from 10.07 to 10.39 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Lifetime costs increased from $385,220 with deferred ART to $397,500 with early ART, primarily because life expectancy increased, producing an ICER of $38,600/QALY. Results were most sensitive to increased intervention cost and decreased virologic efficacy in the early ART strategy.an intervention to initiate ART early in patients with acute OIs improves survival and meets US cost-effectiveness thresholds. Programs should be developed to implement this strategy at sites where HIV-infected patients present with OIs.",2010-01-12058,21126955,HIV Clin Trials,Paul E Sax,2010,11 / 5,248-59,No,21126955,"Paul E Sax; Caroline E Sloan; Bruce R Schackman; Philip M Grant; Jian Rong; Andrew R Zolopa; William Powderly; Elena Losina; Kenneth A Freedberg; Cepac US And Actg A5164 Investig; Early antiretroviral therapy for patients with acute aids-related opportunistic infections: a cost-effectiveness analysis of ACTG A5164, HIV Clin Trials, ; 11(5):1528-4336; 248-59",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Delayed antiretroviral therapy vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,36300,United States,2008,43635.43
7587,Comparative cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccines in the prevention of cervical cancer in Malaysia,"Cervical cancer (CC) had the second highest incidence of female cancers in Malaysia in 2003-2006.

7593,"Results of a model analysis of the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus exenatide added to metformin, glimepiride, or both for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States","Nearly half of all US patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are unable to maintain adequate glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1(c)) control (ie, <7.0%).The aim of this work was to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of incretin-based therapy with once-daily liraglutide (vs twice-daily exenatide) combined with metformin, glimepiride, or both for the treatment of T2DM.Patient data were obtained from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 (LEAD 6) trial. Baseline data included mean HbA1(c) (8.15%), age (56.7 years), disease duration (8 years), sex, body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels, cardiovascular and renal risk factors, and other complications. The IMS Center for Outcomes Research Diabetes Model was used to project and compare lifetime (ie, 35-year) clinical and economic outcomes for once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg compared with twice-daily exenatide 10 (ig, each used as add-on therapy with maximum-dose metformin and/or glimepiride. Treatment-effect assumptions were also derived from the LEAD 6 trial. Transition probabilities, utilities, and complication costs were obtained from published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer in the United States.The base-case analysis indicated that, compared with exenatide, liraglutide add-on therapy was associated with a mean (SD) increase in life expectancy of 0.187 (0.250) years and an increase in qualityadjusted life-years of 0.322 (0.164) years. Compared with exenatide, total lifetime treatment costs for liraglutide were $12,956 higher, yielding an incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of $40,282. However, the costs of diabetes-related complications were lower with liraglutide than with exenatide ($49,784 vs $52,429, respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicated that setting patient HbA(1c) levels at the 95% upper limit reduced the ICER for liraglutide compared with exenatide to $33,086.In this model analysis using published clinical data and current medication acquisition price assumptions, liraglutide (in combination with metformin and/or glimepiride) appeared to be cost-effective in the US payer setting over a 35-year time horizon.",2010-01-12068,21194600,Clin Ther,Won Chan Lee,2010,32 / 10,1756-67,Yes,21194600,"Won Chan Lee; Christopher Conner; Mette Hammer; Results of a model analysis of the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus exenatide added to metformin, glimepiride, or both for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States, Clin Ther, ; 32(10):1879-114X; 1756-67",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Liraglutide vs. Exenatide,Not Stated,80 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,40282,United States,2010,47810.77
7594,Cost-effectiveness analysis of tapentadol immediate release for the treatment of acute pain,"Tapentadol immediate-release (IR) tablets are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. In clinical trials, tapentadol IR effectively reduced moderate to severe pain with improved tolerability compared with oxycodone IR at doses providing comparable analgesia.This analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of tapentadol IR with doses of oxycodone IR providing comparable analgesia in the outpatient treatment of acute postsurgical and nonsurgical pain. The perspective was that of a US managed care health plan as third-party payer.A Markov model was developed to simulate clinical-economic outcomes for tapentadol IR 100 mg compared with oxycodone IR 15 mg in the treatment of acute postsurgical pain (3 days) and for tapentadol IR 50 mg compared with oxycodone IR 10 mg in the treatment of acute nonsurgical pain (10 days). The model simulated changes in pain relief; occurrence of opioid-related adverse events (AEs); opioid switching, discontinuation, and dose change; and number of quality-adjusted life-days (QALDs). Data inputs for the model were obtained from clinical trials, claims databases, surveys, Medicare fee schedules, and other published sources. Only direct costs were included. Drug costs were based on the wholesale acquisition cost. Prescription copayments were set at $5 for oxycodone IR and $25 for tapentadol IR. All costs were in 2008 US dollars. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on key model parameters.The cost of pain medication per patient was higher for tapentadol IR than for oxycodone IR in both the surgical pain setting ($15.23 vs $9.57, respectively) and the nonsurgical pain setting ($57.17 vs $21.31). However, this cost difference was offset by reductions in pharmacy and medical costs associated with the treatment of AEs and opioid switching/discontinuation, resulting in a lower mean treatment cost per patient for tapentadol IR 100 mg compared with oxycodone IR 15 mg in the treatment of acute surgical pain ($52.90 vs $55.99) and for tapentadol IR 50 mg compared with oxycodone IR 10 mg in the treatment of acute nonsurgical pain ($139.48 vs $144.79). Tapentadol IR also was associated with a greater mean number of treatment days with =30% improvement in pain intensity without opioid-related AEs compared with oxycodone IR and a greater mean number of QALDs (surgical pain: 1.73 vs 1.68; nonsurgical pain: 6.03 vs 4.92). Because both doses of tapentadol IR were dominant (ie, lower treatment costs and greater effectiveness) relative to the corresponding doses of oxycodone IR providing com- parable analgesia, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were not calculated.The results of this model suggest that at doses providing comparable analgesia, tapentadol IR is a cost-effective alternative to oxycodone IR for the treatment of acute surgical and nonsurgical pain.",2010-01-12069,21194601,Clin Ther,W Jacqueline Kwong,2010,32 / 10,1768-81,Yes,21194601,"W Jacqueline Kwong; Ipek Ozer-Stillman; Jeffrey D Miller; Noah A Haber; Mason W Russell; Shane Kavanagh; Cost-effectiveness analysis of tapentadol immediate release for the treatment of acute pain, Clin Ther, ; 32(10):1879-114X; 1768-81",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tapendatol immediate release vs. Oxycodone immediate release,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2008,Not Stated
