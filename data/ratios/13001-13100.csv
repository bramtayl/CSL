13001,Eribulin for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer: a NICE single technology appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of eribulin (Eisai Ltd) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of eribulin as treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (LABC/MBC) pre-treated with at least two chemotherapy regimens. This article summarizes the review of evidence by the Evidence Review Group (ERG) and provides a summary of the NICE Appraisal Committee's (AC's) decision. The clinical evidence was derived from a multi-centred, open-label, randomized, phase III study comparing eribulin with treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in 762 patients with LABC/MBC. Clinical effectiveness results were submitted for two populations: the overall intention-to-treat (ITT) population and a subset (n = 488) that included only patients from North America, Western Europe and Australia (Region 1). For the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), a primary analysis (after 55 % of patients had died) and an updated analysis (after 77 % of patients had died) were conducted. In the ITT population, treatment with eribulin was associated with a significant improvement in median OS compared with TPC in both primary [difference in median OS 2.5 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.99] and updated analyses (2.7 months; HR 0.81, 95 % CI 0.67-0.96). A statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was reported for eribulin compared with TPC when assessed by the investigator (difference in median PFS 1.48 months; HR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.64-0.90), but not when assessed by the ERG (1.44 months; HR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.71-1.05). Gains in OS were greater for Region 1 patients than for the ITT population (3.1 vs. 2.7 months). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data suggested a benefit for eribulin responders, but was based on phase II studies. In the eribulin arm, serious adverse events included febrile neutropenia (4.2 %) and neutropenia (1.8 %), with peripheral neuropathy being the most common reason for treatment discontinuation. The manufacturer's economic evaluation using Patient Access Scheme costs reported a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for eribulin versus TPC (Region 1) of pound46,050 per quality-adjusted life year gained (corrected to pound45,106 when an erroneous data entry was removed). The ERG's revised ICERs were pound61,804 for Region 1 and pound76,110 for the overall population. The AC concluded that the evidence had not demonstrated sufficient benefit in OS, cost effectiveness or HRQoL and that eribulin was not recommended for use in this patient group.",2014-01-15887,25213036,Pharmacoeconomics,Janette Greenhalgh,2015,33 / 2,,Yes,25213036,"Janette Greenhalgh; Adrian Bagust; Angela Boland; James Oyee; Nicola Trevor; Sophie Beale; Yenal Dundar; Juliet Hockenhull; Chris Proudlove; Susan O'Reilly; Eribulin for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer: a NICE single technology appraisal, Pharmacoeconomics, 2015 Feb; 33(2):1179-2027",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eribulin vs. Treatment of physicianâ€™s choice (TPC),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,93565,United Kingdom,2011,172710.01

METHODS: A previously developed cohort model for T2DM was applied over a 35-year time horizon. Data on T2DM patients on metformin monotherapy with HbA1c > 7% were collected from the Swedish National Diabetes Register. Treatment effects were taken from published studies. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from a societal perspective. The robustness of the results was evaluated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Treatment with GLP-1 agonists was associated with a discounted incremental benefit of 0.10 and 0.25 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and higher discounted costs of Swedish Krona (SEK) 34,865 and SEK 40,802 compared with DPP-4 inhibitors and NPH insulin, respectively. Assuming willingness-to-pay (WTP) of SEK 500,000 per QALY, treatment strategy with GLP-1 agonists was a cost-effective option with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of SEK 353,172 and SEK 160,618 per QALY gained versus DPP-4 inhibitors and NPH insulin, respectively. The results were most sensitive to incidence rate of moderate/major hypoglycemia and disutilities associated with insulin treatment, body mass index (BMI), and hypoglycemia.

13007,Support and Assessment for Fall Emergency Referrals (SAFER 1): cluster randomised trial of computerised clinical decision support for paramedics,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of Computerised Clinical Decision Support (CCDS) for paramedics attending older people who fall. DESIGN: Cluster trial randomised by paramedic; modelling. SETTING: 13 ambulance stations in two UK emergency ambulance services. PARTICIPANTS: 42 of 409 eligible paramedics, who attended 779 older patients for a reported fall. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention paramedics received CCDS on Tablet computers to guide patient care. Control paramedics provided care as usual. One service had already installed electronic data capture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness: patients referred to falls service, patient reported quality of life and satisfaction, processes of care. SAFETY: Further emergency contacts or death within one month. COST-EFFECTIVENESS: Costs and quality of life. We used findings from published Community Falls Prevention Trial to model cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: 17 intervention paramedics used CCDS for 54 (12.4%) of 436 participants. They referred 42 (9.6%) to falls services, compared with 17 (5.0%) of 343 participants seen by 19 control paramedics [Odds ratio (OR) 2.04, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.72]. No adverse events were related to the intervention. Non-significant differences between groups included: subsequent emergency contacts (34.6% versus 29.1%; OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.72); quality of life (mean SF12 differences: MCS -0.74, 95% CI -2.83 to +1.28; PCS -0.13, 95% CI -1.65 to +1.39) and non-conveyance (42.0% versus 36.7%; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.52). However ambulance job cycle time was 8.9 minutes longer for intervention patients (95% CI 2.3 to 15.3). Average net cost of implementing CCDS was pound208 per patient with existing electronic data capture, and pound308 without. Modelling estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year at pound15,000 with existing electronic data capture; and pound22,200 without. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention paramedics referred twice as many participants to falls services with no difference in safety. CCDS is potentially cost-effective, especially with existing electronic data capture.

13008,Is it cost-effective to use a test to decide which individuals with an intermediate cardiovascular disease risk would benefit from statin treatment?,"BACKGROUND: The 2012 European guidelines recommend statins for intermediate-risk individuals with elevated cholesterol levels. Improved discrimination of intermediate-risk individuals is needed to prevent both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and statin side-effects (e.g. myopathy) efficiently since only 3-15 in every 100 individuals actually experience a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years. We estimated the potential cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical test which helps to determine which individuals will benefit from statins. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prognosis of different age- and gender-specific cohorts with an intermediate risk was simulated with a Markov model to estimate the potential costs and quality-adjusted life-years for four strategies: treat all with statins, treat none with statins, treat according to the European guidelines, or use a test to select individuals for statin treatment. The test-first strategy dominated the other strategies if the hypothetical test was 100% accurate and cost no more than euro237. This strategy and the treat-all strategy were equally effective but the test generated lower costs by reducing statin usage and side-effects. The treat-none strategy was the least effective strategy. Threshold analyses show that the test must be highly accurate (especially sensitive) and inexpensive to be the most cost-effective strategy, since myopathy has a negligible impact on cost-effectiveness and statin costs are low. CONCLUSION: Use of a highly accurate prognostic test could reduce overall CVD risk, frequency of drug side-effects and lifetime costs.

13011,Sacral neuromodulation and Botulinum toxin A for refractory idiopathic overactive bladder: a cost-utility analysis in the perspective of Italian Healthcare System,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of two therapeutic strategies: one starting with sacral neuromodulation (SNM) versus one starting with Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) for the management of refractory incontinent idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) patients, from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (INHS). METHODS: Direct medical costs (<euro>2011) and benefits (quality-adjusted life years-QALYs) were assessed over a ten-year time frame adapting to the Italian practice a published Markov model. Clinical inputs were based on the published literature and on the expert opinion. Resource consumption rates were provided by clinical experts; unit costs were collected from a single hospital accounting and from standard tariff lists and public prices. Interventional procedures and management of adverse events were costed through a micro-costing approach. The primary outcome was incremental costs per QALYs gained (i.e. differential costs divided by differential benefits). Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Starting with SNM appears to be cost effective (i.e. under <euro>40.000/QALY) from year three (<euro>21,259/QALY) onwards and becomes dominant (i.e. more effective and less costly) at year ten: cumulative costs were <euro>32,975 for early SNM and <euro>33,309 for early BTX-A, while cumulative QALYs were 7.52 and 6.93, respectively.

13012,Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir in the treatment of patients with hepatitis C,"In France, 190,306 patients were suffering from chronic hepatitis C in 2012. These patients have a decreased life expectancy and are susceptible to complications associated with chronic hepatitis. Current treatments are poorly tolerated and their effectiveness varies depending on the genotype of the virus. Sofosbuvir, a new class of treatment, has demonstrated in five phase III trials sustained viral response (SVR) rates of over 90% across genotypes, higher than current treatments and has a tolerance profile similar to placebo. The objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of using sofosbuvir in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. A Markov model was used to compare treatment strategies with and without sofosbuvir. The model simulated the natural history of HCV infection. SVR rates were based on data from clinical trials. Utilities associated with different stages of disease were based on data from the literature. French direct medical costs were used. Price for sofosbuvir was the price used in the early access program for severe fibrosis stages. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for sofosbuvir versus current reference treatments was euro 16,278/QALY and varied from 40,000 euro/QALY for F0 stages to 12,080 euro/QALY for F4 stages. The sensitivity analyses carried out confirmed the robustness of this result.

13013,Cost-effectiveness analysis of panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 compared with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin) compared with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 in first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). DESIGN: A semi-Markov model was constructed from a French health collective perspective, with health states related to first-line treatment (progression-free), disease progression with and without subsequent active treatment, resection of metastases, disease-free after successful resection and death. METHODS: Parametric survival analyses of patient-level progression-free and overall survival data from the only head-to-head clinical trial of panitumumab and bevacizumab (PEAK) were performed to estimate transitions to disease progression and death. Additional data from PEAK informed the amount of each drug consumed, duration of therapy, subsequent therapy use, and toxicities related to mCRC treatment. Literature and French public data sources were used to estimate unit costs associated with treatment and duration of subsequent active therapies. Utility weights were calculated from patient-level data from panitumumab trials in the first-, second- and third-line settings. A life-time perspective was applied. Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Based on a head-to-head clinical trial that demonstrates better efficacy outcomes for patients with wild-type RAS mCRC who receive panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6, the incremental cost per life-year gained was estimated to be euro26,918, and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated to be euro36,577. Sensitivity analyses indicate the model is robust to alternative parameters and assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost per QALY gained indicates that panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 represents good value for money in comparison to bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 and, with a willingness-to-pay ranging from euro40,000 to euro60,000, can be considered cost-effective in first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC.",2014-01-15900,25219451,Eur J Cancer,Christopher N Graham,2014,50 / 16,2791-801,No,25219451,"Christopher N Graham; Guy Hechmati; Jonas Hjelmgren; Frederique de Liege; Julie Lanier; Hediyyih Knox; Beth Barber; Cost-effectiveness analysis of panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 compared with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, Eur J Cancer, ; 50(16):0959-8049; 2791-801",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 medication vs. Bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 medication,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,36577,Euro,2013,53970.78

METHODS: All costs from randomization to 36 months were included. Costs were from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicare databases and clinical trial data. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were from Quality of Well Being questionnaires. RESULTS: Provider costs were similar for the 144 GPi and 130 STN patients (GPi: $138,044 vs. STN: $131,822; difference = $6,222, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -$42,125 to $45,343). Societal costs were also similar (GPi: $171,061 vs. STN: $167,706; difference = $3,356, 95% CI: -$57,371 to $60,294). The GPi patients had nonsignificantly more QALYs.

13015,Carotid artery stenosis: cost-effectiveness of assessment of cerebrovascular reserve to guide treatment of asymptomatic patients,"PURPOSE: To project and compare the lifetime health benefits, health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness of a decision rule based on assessment of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) compared with medical therapy and immediate revascularization in asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis for prevention of stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The three strategies compared included immediate revascularization (carotid endarterectomy) and ongoing medical therapy (with antiplatelet, statin, and antihypertensive agents plus lifestyle modification), medical therapy-based treatment with revascularization only for patients who progressed, and use of a CVR-based decision rule for treatment in which patients with CVR impairment undergo immediate revascularization and all others receive medical therapy. A decision analytic model was developed to project lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis with 70%-89% carotid luminal narrowing at presentation. Risks of clinical events, costs, and quality-of-life values were estimated on the basis of those in published sources. The analysis was conducted from a health care system perspective, with health and cost outcomes discounted at 3%. Results Total costs per person and lifetime QALYs were lowest for the medical therapy-based strategy ($14 597, 9.848 QALYs), followed by CVR testing ($16 583, 9.934 QALYs) and immediate revascularization ($20 950, 9.940 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the CVR-based strategy compared with the medical therapy-based strategy was $23 000 per QALY and for the immediate revascularization versus the CVR-based strategy was $760 000 per QALY.

13017,The cost-effectiveness and public health benefit of nalmefene added to psychosocial support for the reduction of alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent patients with high/very high drinking risk levels: a Markov model,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether nalmefene combined with psychosocial support is cost-effective compared with psychosocial support alone for reducing alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent patients with high/very high drinking risk levels (DRLs) as defined by the WHO, and to evaluate the public health benefit of reducing harmful alcohol-attributable diseases, injuries and deaths. DESIGN: Decision modelling using Markov chains compared costs and effects over 5 years. SETTING: The analysis was from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: The model considered the licensed population for nalmefene, specifically adults with both alcohol dependence and high/very high DRLs, who do not require immediate detoxification and who continue to have high/very high DRLs after initial assessment. DATA SOURCES: We modelled treatment effect using data from three clinical trials for nalmefene (ESENSE 1 (NCT00811720), ESENSE 2 (NCT00812461) and SENSE (NCT00811941)). Baseline characteristics of the model population, treatment resource utilisation and utilities were from these trials. We estimated the number of alcohol-attributable events occurring at different levels of alcohol consumption based on published epidemiological risk-relation studies. Health-related costs were from UK sources. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and number of alcohol-attributable harmful events avoided. RESULTS: Nalmefene in combination with psychosocial support had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound5204 per QALY gained, and was therefore cost-effective at the pound20,000 per QALY gained decision threshold. Sensitivity analyses showed that the conclusion was robust. Nalmefene plus psychosocial support led to the avoidance of 7179 alcohol-attributable diseases/injuries and 309 deaths per 100,000 patients compared to psychosocial support alone over the course of 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Nalmefene can be seen as a cost-effective treatment for alcohol dependence, with substantial public health benefits.

STUDY DESIGN: Based on the pertinent literature of the past decade, a Markov model was developed to investigate this issue. In the wait-and-see strategy arm, surgery was performed if the tumor attained a size >/=2 cm or surpassed 20% of the initial size. In a Monte Carlo probabilistic analysis, 100 hypothetical patients undergoing a wait-and-see strategy were compared to 100 patients directly undergoing surgery, with the aim of investigating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the two strategies. RESULTS: During the postdiagnostic lifetime, 63 NF-PETs in the wait-and-see group showed significant growth and underwent surgery: 38 were stage I, 10 were stage II, 15 were stage III and none were stage IV. In the base-case scenario, the mean life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy were found to be superior after immediate surgery [26.1 years and 11.8 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] than with the wait-and-see strategy (22.1 years and 8.3 QALYs) as the consequence of ageing during the wait-and-see follow-up which increased mortality due to surgery, when surgery was needed. The model was sensitive to starting age and length of follow-up; in particular, for patients >65 years of age, the two strategies provided similar results but the wait-and-see strategy was more cost-effective.

The aim of this study was to determine whether annual colonoscopy among patients with IBD-PSC is cost-effective compared with less frequent intervals from the perspective of a publicly funded health care system. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model was used to simulate a 35-year-old patient with a 10-year history of well-controlled IBD and a recent diagnosis of concomitant PSC. The following strategies were compared: no surveillance, colonoscopy every 5 years, biennial colonoscopy, and annual colonoscopy. Outcome measures included: costs, number of cases of dysplasia found, number of cancers found and missed, deaths, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and the incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, no surveillance was the least expensive and least effective strategy. Compared with no surveillance, the cost per QALY of surveillance every 5 years was CAD $15,021. The cost per QALY of biennial surveillance compared with surveillance every 5 years was CAD $37,522.

13023,"Cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant women, health care workers and persons with underlying illnesses in Belgium","Risk groups with increased vulnerability for influenza complications such as pregnant women, persons with underlying illnesses as well as persons who come into contact with them, such as health care workers, are currently given priority (along with other classic target groups) to receive seasonal influenza vaccination in Belgium. We aimed to evaluate this policy from a health care payer perspective by cost-effectiveness analysis in the three specific target groups above, while accounting for effects beyond the target group. Increasing the coverage of influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective for pregnant women (median euro6589 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained [euro4073-euro10,249]) and health care workers (median euro24,096/QALY gained [euro16,442-euro36,342]), if this can be achieved without incurring additional administration costs. Assuming an additional physician's consult is charged to administer each additional vaccine dose, the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating pregnant women depends strongly on the extent of its impact on the neonate's health.

13024,"Cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant women, health care workers and persons with underlying illnesses in Belgium","Risk groups with increased vulnerability for influenza complications such as pregnant women, persons with underlying illnesses as well as persons who come into contact with them, such as health care workers, are currently given priority (along with other classic target groups) to receive seasonal influenza vaccination in Belgium. We aimed to evaluate this policy from a health care payer perspective by cost-effectiveness analysis in the three specific target groups above, while accounting for effects beyond the target group. Increasing the coverage of influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective for pregnant women (median euro6589 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained [euro4073-euro10,249]) and health care workers (median euro24,096/QALY gained [euro16,442-euro36,342]), if this can be achieved without incurring additional administration costs. Assuming an additional physician's consult is charged to administer each additional vaccine dose, the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating pregnant women depends strongly on the extent of its impact on the neonate's health. For health care workers, the assumed number of preventable secondary infections has a strong influence on the cost-effectiveness.

13025,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the Portuguese setting,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: To project the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients for stroke prevention with rivaroxaban compared to warfarin in Portugal. METHODS: A Markov model was used that included health and treatment states describing the management and consequences of AF and its treatment. The model's time horizon was set at a patient's lifetime and each cycle at three months. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective and a 5% discount rate was applied to both costs and outcomes. Treatment effect data were obtained from the pivotal phase III ROCKET AF trial. The model was also populated with utility values obtained from the literature and with cost data derived from official Portuguese sources. The outcomes of the model included life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental costs, and associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Extensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken to further assess the findings of the model. As there is evidence indicating underuse and underprescription of warfarin in Portugal, an additional analysis was performed using a mixed comparator composed of no treatment, aspirin, and warfarin, which better reflects real-world prescribing in Portugal. RESULTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis produced an ICER of euro3895/QALY for the base-case analysis (vs. warfarin) and of euro6697/QALY for the real-world prescribing analysis (vs. mixed comparator). The findings were robust when tested in sensitivity analyses.

13026,Cost-utility analysis of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy in patients with moderate-to-high risk acute coronary syndrome and planned percutaneous coronary intervention,"BACKGROUND: Prasugrel is recommended over clopidogrel in poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizers with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), reducing the risk of ischemic events. CYP2C19 genetic testing can guide antiplatelet therapy in ACS patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of genotype-guided treatment, compared with prasugrel or generic clopidogrel treatment without genotyping, from the US healthcare provider's perspective. METHODS: A decision model was developed to project lifetime economic and humanistic burden associated with clinical outcomes (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke and major bleeding) for the three strategies in patients with ACS. Probabilities, costs and age-adjusted quality of life were identified through systematic literature review. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated for the treatment strategies, with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the primary effectiveness outcome. Relative risk of developing myocardial infarction and stroke between patients with and without variant CYP2C19 when receiving clopidogrel were estimated to be 1.34 and 3.66, respectively. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Clopidogrel cost USD19,147 and provided 10.03 QALYs versus prasugrel (USD21,425, 10.04 QALYs) and genotype-guided therapy (USD19,231, 10.05 QALYs). The ICUR of genotype-guided therapy compared with clopidogrel was USD4,200. Genotype-guided therapy provided more QALYs at lower costs compared with prasugrel. Results were sensitive to the cost of clopidogrel and relative risk of myocardial infarction and stroke between CYP2C19 variant vs. non-variant. Net monetary benefit curves showed that genotype-guided therapy had at least 70% likelihood of being the most cost-effective alternative at a willingness-to-pay of USD100,000/QALY. In comparison with clopidogrel, prasugrel therapy was more cost-effective with <21% certainty at willingness-to-pay of >USD170,000/QALY.

13028,Health technology assessment of belimumab: a new monoclonal antibody for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus,"OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is treated with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs and off-label biologics. Belimumab is the first biologic approved after 50 years as an add-on therapy for active disease. This paper summarizes a health technology assessment performed in Italy. METHODS: SLE epidemiology and burden were assessed using the best published international and national evidences and efficacy and safety of belimumab were synthesized using clinical data. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by a lifetime microsimulation model comparing belimumab to standard of care (SoC). Organizational and ethical implications were discussed. RESULTS: Literature review showed that SLE affects 47 per 100,000 people for a total of 28,500 patients in Italy, 50% of whom are affected by active form of the disease despite SoC. These patients, if autoantibodies and anti-dsDNA positive with low complement, are eligible for belimumab. SLE determines work disability and a 2-5-fold increase in mortality. Belimumab with SoC may prevent 4,742 flares in three years being cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro32,859 per quality adjusted life year gained. From the organizational perspective, the development of clear and comprehensive clinical pathways is crucial.

13029,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy and physical exercise for alleviating treatment-induced menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients,"PURPOSE: Many breast cancer patients experience (severe) menopausal symptoms after an early onset of menopause caused by cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and physical exercise (PE), compared to a waiting list control group (WLC). METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from a healthcare system perspective, using a Markov model. Effectiveness data came from a recent randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of CBT and PE. Cost data were obtained from relevant Dutch sources. Outcome measures were incremental treatment costs (ITCs) per patient with a clinically relevant improvement on a measure of endocrine symptoms, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy questionnaire (FACT-ES), and on a measure of hot flushes, the Hot Flush Rating Scale (HFRS), and costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained over a 5-year time period. RESULTS: ITCs for achieving a clinically relevant decline on the FACT-ES for one patient were euro1,051 for CBT and euro1,315 for PE, compared to the WLC. The corresponding value for the HFRS was euro1,067 for CBT, while PE was not more effective than the WLC. Incremental cost-utility ratios were euro22,502/QALY for CBT and euro28,078/QALY for PE.

DESIGN: Economic evaluation with a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Long-term care facilities. PARTICIPANTS: LTCF residents (N = 928, 703 female, median age 84), stratified according to UTI risk. MEASUREMENTS: UTI incidence (clinically or strictly defined), survival, quality of life, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. RESULTS: In the weeks after a clinical UTI, participants showed a significant but moderate deterioration in quality of life, survival, care dependency, and costs. In high-UTI-risk participants, cranberry costs were estimated at euro439 per year (1.00 euro = 1.37 U.S. dollar), which is euro3,800 per prevented clinically defined UTI (95% confidence interval = euro1,300-infinity).

13033,Depression in working adults: comparing the costs and health outcomes of working when ill,"OBJECTIVE: Working through a depressive illness can improve mental health but also carries risks and costs from reduced concentration, fatigue, and poor on-the-job performance. However, evidence-based recommendations for managing work attendance decisions, which benefit individuals and employers, are lacking. Therefore, this study has compared the costs and health outcomes of short-term absenteeism versus working while ill (""presenteeism"") amongst employed Australians reporting lifetime major depression. METHODS: Cohort simulation using state-transition Markov models simulated movement of a hypothetical cohort of workers, reporting lifetime major depression, between health states over one- and five-years according to probabilities derived from a quality epidemiological data source and existing clinical literature. Model outcomes were health service and employment-related costs, and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), captured for absenteeism relative to presenteeism, and stratified by occupation (blue versus white-collar). RESULTS: Per employee with depression, absenteeism produced higher mean costs than presenteeism over one- and five-years ($42,573/5-years for absenteeism, $37,791/5-years for presenteeism). However, overlapping confidence intervals rendered differences non-significant. Employment-related costs (lost productive time, job turnover), and antidepressant medication and service use costs of absenteeism and presenteeism were significantly higher for white-collar workers. Health outcomes differed for absenteeism versus presenteeism amongst white-collar workers only. CONCLUSIONS: Costs and health outcomes for absenteeism and presenteeism were not significantly different; service use costs excepted. Significant variation by occupation type was identified. These findings provide the first occupation-specific cost evidence which can be used by clinicians, employees, and employers to review their management of depression-related work attendance, and may suggest encouraging employees to continue working is warranted.",2014-01-15940,25181469,PLoS One,Fiona Cocker,2014,9 / 9,e105430,No,25181469,"Fiona Cocker; Jan M Nicholson; Nicholas Graves; Brian Oldenburg; Andrew J Palmer; Angela Martin; Jenn Scott; Alison Venn; Kristy Sanderson; Depression in working adults: comparing the costs and health outcomes of working when ill, PLoS One , ; 9(9):1932-6203; e105430",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Absenteeism (not working when feeling ill) over a five-year time horizon vs. Presenteeism (working while feeling ill) amongst employed Australians reporting lifetime major depressionover a five-year time horizon,Not Stated,85 Years,16 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 1 year",3.00,3.00,-10868.18,Australia,2007,-11383.7
13034,Cost-effectiveness of annual versus biennial screening mammography for women with high mammographic breast density,"OBJECTIVES: The sensitivity of screening mammography is much lower among women who have dense breast tissue, compared with women who have largely fatty breasts, and they are also at much higher risk of developing the disease. Increasing mammography screening frequency from biennially to annually has been suggested as a policy option to address the elevated risk in this population. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of annual versus biennial screening mammography among women aged 50-79 with dense breast tissue. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on screening, diagnostic, and treatment pathways for the population-based screening and cancer care programme in British Columbia, Canada. Model probabilities and screening costs were calculated from screening programme data. Costs for breast cancer treatment were calculated from treatment data, and utility values were obtained from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness was expressed as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY), and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Compared with biennial screening, annual screening generated an additional 0.0014 QALYs (95% CI: -0.0480-0.0359) at a cost of $819 ($ = Canadian dollars) per patient (95% CI: 506-1185), resulting in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $565,912/QALY. Annual screening had a 37.5% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: There is considerable uncertainty about the incremental cost-effectiveness of annual mammography.

13035,The 5-year cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and cervical disc replacement: a Markov analysis,"STUDY DESIGN: A Markov state-transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and cervical disc replacement (CDR) at 5 years. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of ACDF and CDR at 5 years. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ACDF and CDR are surgical options for the treatment of an acute cervical disc herniation with associated myelopathy/radiculopathy. Cost-effectiveness analysis provides valuable information regarding which intervention will lead to a more efficient utilization of health care resources. METHODS: Outcome and complication probabilities were obtained from existing literature. Physician costs were based on a fixed percentage of 140% of 2010 Medicare reimbursement. Hospital costs were determined from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Utilities were derived from responses to health state surveys (Short Form 36) at baseline and at 5 years from the treatment arms of the ProDisc-C trial. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to compare treatments. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on all parameters within the model. RESULTS: CDR generated a total 5-year cost of $102,274, whereas ACDF resulted in a 5-year cost of $119,814. CDR resulted in a generation of 2.84 quality-adjusted life years, whereas ACDF resulted in 2.81. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$557,849 per quality-adjusted life year gained. CDR remained the dominant strategy below a cost of $20,486. ACDF was found to be a cost-effective strategy below a cost of $18,607. CDR was the dominant strategy when the utility value was above 0.713. CDR remained the dominant strategy assuming an annual complication rate less than 4.37%. CONCLUSION: ACDF and CDR were both shown to be cost-effective strategies at 5 years. CDR was found to be the dominant treatment strategy in our model. Further long-term studies evaluating the clinical and quality-of-life outcomes of these 2 treatments are needed to further validate the model.

13036,Cost-effectiveness of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator within 3 hours of acute ischemic stroke: current evidence,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the availability of results from multiple newer clinical trials and changing healthcare costs, the cost-effectiveness of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) for treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 0 to 3 hours of symptom onset was last evaluated in 1998 for the United States Using current evidence, we evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of r-tPA administered 0 to 3 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset versus no r-tPA. METHODS: A disease-based decision model to project lifetime outcomes of patients after acute ischemic stroke by r-tPA treatment status from the US payer perspective was developed. Model inputs were derived from a recent meta-analysis of r-tPA trials, cohort studies, and health state preference studies. Cost data, inflated to 2013 dollars, were based on drug wholesale acquisition cost and the literature. To compare r-tPA to no r-tPA, we calculated incremental total direct costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We performed 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: r-tPA resulted in a gain of 0.39 quality-adjusted life years (95% confidence range, 0.16-0.66) on average per patient and a lifetime cost-saving of $25,000 (95% confidence range, -$42,500 to -$11,000) compared with no r-tPA. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, r-tPA was dominant compared with no r-tPA in approximately 100% of simulations. The model was sensitive to inputs for r-tPA efficacy, healthcare costs for disabled patients, mortality rates for disabled and nondisabled patients, and quality of life estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis supports earlier economic evaluations that r-tPA is a cost-effective method to treat stroke. Appropriate use of r-tPA should be prioritized nationally.",2014-01-15954,25190439,Stroke,Denise M Boudreau,2014,45 / 10,3032-9,No,25190439,"Denise M Boudreau; Gregory F Guzauskas; Er Chen; Deepa Lalla; Darren Tayama; Susan C Fagan; David L Veenstra; Cost-effectiveness of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator within 3 hours of acute ischemic stroke: current evidence, Stroke, ; 45(10):1524-4628; 3032-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) administered 0 to 3 hours of acute ichemic stroke symptom onset vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-64102.57,United States,2013,-71216.79
13037,"Societal cost-effectiveness analysis of the 21-gene assay in estrogen-receptor-positive, lymph-node-negative early-stage breast cancer in Japan","BACKGROUND: Breast-cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing in Japan. Japanese-specific clinical validity and utility data for the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX(R) Breast Cancer Assay; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, USA) are now available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 21-gene assay for the guidance of adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in estrogen-receptor-positive, lymph-node-negative, early-stage breast cancer patients, from the Japanese societal perspective. METHODS: The recurrence risk group distribution by the 21-gene assay result and the assay's influence on adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations were obtained from a study of 104 patients. A state-transition cohort (Markov) model tracked time from surgery until distant recurrence and from distant recurrence to death. Adjuvant chemotherapy benefit by 21-gene assay risk group was based on published clinical validation studies. Direct and indirect medical costs were obtained from the referral centers. Utilities associated with progression and chemotherapy-related adverse events were extracted from literature. Sensitivity analyses assessed the key drivers and robustness of the primary outcomes. RESULTS: The 21-gene assay identified 48% of patients as low-risk, 36% as intermediate-risk, and 16% as high-risk. Total acute chemotherapy-related costs decreased by yen154,066 due to less adjuvant chemotherapy usage. In the high-risk group, adjuvant chemotherapy use increased 18%, leading to survival benefits. Chemotherapy use overall decreased by 19%. Monitoring costs increased by yen3,744 but recurrence costs declined by yen46,113 per patient. Use of the 21-gene assay increased quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) by 0.241 per patient on average; the net cost per QALY gained was yen636,752 ($6,368).

13038,The cost-effectiveness of weight management programmes in a postnatal population,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a weight management programme including elements of physical exercise and dietary restriction which are designed to help women lose excess weight gained during pregnancy in the vulnerable postnatal period and inhibit the development of behaviours which could lead to future excess weight gain and obesity. STUDY DESIGN: A mathematical model based on a regression equation predicting change in weight over a fifteen year postnatal period was developed. METHODS: The model included programme effectiveness and resource data based on a randomized controlled trial of a weight management programme implemented in a postnatal population in the United States. Utility and mortality data based on body mass index categories were also included. The model adopted a National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS) perspective, a lifetime time horizon and estimated the cost effectiveness of a weight management programme against a no change comparator in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The baseline results show that the difference in weight between women who received the weight management programme and women who received the control intervention was 3.02 kg at six months and 3.53 kg at fifteen years following childbirth. This results in an ICER of pound7355 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for women who were married at childbirth. CONCLUSION: The estimated ICER would suggest that such a weight management programme is cost-effective at a NICE threshold of pound20,000 per QALY.

13039,Cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies for BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma,"PURPOSE: Genetically-targeted therapies are both promising and costly advances in the field of oncology. Several treatments for metastatic melanoma with a mutation in the BRAF gene have been approved. They extend life but are more expensive than the previous standard of care (dacarbazine). Vemurafenib, the first drug in this class, costs $13,000 per month ($207,000 for a patient with median survival). Patients failing vemurafenib are often given ipilimumab, an immunomodulator, at $150,000 per course. Assessment of cost-effectiveness is a valuable tool to help navigate the transition toward targeted cancer therapy. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis to compare three strategies for patients with BRAF+ metastatic melanoma using a deterministic expected-value decision tree model to calculate the present value of lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy. We performed sensitivity analyses on all variables. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vemurafenib compared with dacarbazine was $353,993 per QALY gained (0.42 QALYs added, $156,831 added). The ICER for vemurafenib followed by ipilimumab compared with vemurafenib alone was $158,139. In sensitivity analysis, treatment cost had the largest influence on results: the ICER for vemurafenib versus dacarbazine dropped to $100,000 per QALY gained with a treatment cost of $3600 per month.

13041,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle modification versus metformin therapy for the prevention of diabetes in Singapore,"BACKGROUND: In Singapore, as diabetes is an increasingly important public health issue, the cost-effectiveness of pursuing lifestyle modification programs and/or alternative prevention strategies is of critical importance for policymakers. While the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) compared weight loss through lifestyle modification with oral treatment of diabetes drug metformin to prevent/delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic subjects, no data on either the actual or potential cost effectiveness of such a program is available for East or South-east Asian populations. This study estimates the 3-year cost-effectiveness of lifestyle modification and metformin among pre-diabetic subjects from a Singapore health system and societal perspective. METHODOLOGY: Cost effectiveness was analysed from 2010-2012 using a decision-based model to estimate the rates of getting diabetes, healthcare costs and health-related quality of life. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was estimated using costs relevant to the time horizon of the study from Singapore. All costs are expressed in 2012 US dollars. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The total economic cost for non-diabetic subjects from the societal perspective was US$25,867, US$28,108 and US$26,177 for placebo, lifestyle modification and metformin intervention respectively. For diabetic patients, the total economic cost from the societal perspective was US$32,921, US$35,163 and US$33,232 for placebo, lifestyle modification and metformin intervention respectively. Lifestyle modification relative to placebo is likely to be associated with an incremental cost per QALY gained at US$36,663 while that of metformin intervention is likely to be US$6,367 from a societal perspective. CONCLUSION: Based on adaptation of the DPP data to local conditions, both lifestyle modification and metformin intervention are likely to be cost-effective and worth implementing in Singapore to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.

13043,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia comorbid with depression: Analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"AIM: Although the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia has been confirmed, dissemination depends on the balance of benefits and costs. This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia consisting of four weekly individual sessions. METHODS: We conducted a 4-week randomized controlled trial with a 4-week follow up in outpatient clinics in Japan. Thirty-seven patients diagnosed as having major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV and suffering from chronic insomnia were randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU) alone or TAU plus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Effectiveness was evaluated as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) over 8 weeks' time, estimated by bootstrapping of the observed total scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Direct medical costs for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and TAU were also evaluated. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Over the 8 weeks of the study, the group receiving cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia plus TAU had significantly higher QALY (P = 0.002) than the TAU-alone group with an incremental value of 0.019 (SD 0.006), and had non-significantly higher costs with an incremental value of 254 (SD 203) USD in direct costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 13 678 USD (95% confidence interval: -5691 to 71 316). Adding cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia demonstrated an approximately 95% chance of gaining one more QALY if a decision-maker was willing to pay 60 000 USD, and approximately 90% for 40 000 USD.

Appropriate treatment of hyponatremia may reduce the risk of death, hospital resource utilization, and economic burden. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan treatment in patients who need to be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to assess the clinical and economic impact of tolvaptan compared with placebo during a 1-month treatment period. The probabilities, utility weights, resource utilization, and costs in the model were derived from clinical trials, survey research, and the Korean National Health Insurance database. Cost analysis was performed from the perspective of the South Korean health care setting in 2012 Korean won (KRW). The model outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed to identify the cost-effectiveness in case of tolvaptan treatment only for patients with marked hyponatremia. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on key model parameters and assumptions. FINDINGS: The total cost per patient was KRW 1,826,771 for tolvaptan treatment and KRW 2,281,926 for placebo. The quality-adjusted life-years for treatment with and without tolvaptan were 0.0481 and 0.0446, respectively. The base-case analysis revealed that tolvaptan was a more effective and less expensive strategy compared with placebo. In the subgroup analysis, this trend was more apparent in case of tolvaptan treatment only for patients with marked hyponatremia. The robustness of the results was confirmed by using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. IMPLICATIONS: This cost-effectiveness analysis found that the use of tolvaptan was less expensive and more effective than treatment without tolvaptan in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.",2014-01-15985,25151571,Clin Ther,Min-Young Lee,2014,36 / 9,1183-94,Yes,25151571,"Min-Young Lee; Hee-Jin Kang; Se-Young Park; Hye-Lin Kim; Euna Han; Eui-Kyung Lee; Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan for euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia, Clin Ther, ; 36(9):1879-114X; 1183-94",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tolvaptan vs. Placebo,serum sodium level <135 mEq/L,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,1 Month,Not Stated,Not Stated,-130044280,South Korea,2012,-130241.79

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of insulin glargine compared with sitagliptin in type 2 diabetes patients, from the perspective of the publicly funded Canadian health care system. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model, a standard Markov structure and Monte Carlo simulation model, was used. The model used a lifetime horizon to capture the long-term complications associated with type 2 diabetes. The efficacy of insulin glargine and sitagliptin in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin reduction and corresponding rates of hypoglycemia were obtained from the EASIE trial. Health utility and cost data were obtained from recently published Canadian publications. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. FINDINGS: In the lifetime base-case analysis, treatment with insulin glargine resulted in cost savings of $1434 CAD in 2012 and a gain of 0.08 quality-adjusted life years per patient. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis found the robustness of the base-case analysis, with 88% probability of insulin glargine being dominant (ie, cost savings and more quality-adjusted life years).

13047,Cephalic arch stenosis: angioplasty to preserve a brachiocephalic fistula or new brachiobasilic fistula? A cost-effectiveness study,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of repeat angioplasty versus new brachiobasilic fistula (BBF) in patients with symptomatic cephalic arch stenosis (CAS). METHODS: Patients presenting with symptomatic CAS (n = 22) underwent angioplasty. They were compared to patients undergoing BBF creation (n = 51). Primary outcomes were functional primary arteriovenous fistulae patency at 3, 6 and 12 months. Data were collected on number of interventions, alternative accesses and hospital days for access-related complications. Quality of life was assessed using Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 scores. Decision tree, Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis permitted cost-utility analysis. Healthcare costs were derived from Department of Health figures and are presented as cost ( pound)/patient/year, cost/access preserved and cost/quality of life-adjusted year (QALY) for each of the treatment strategies. RESULTS: Functional primary patency rates at 3, 6, 12 months were 87.5%, 81% and 43% for repeated angioplasty and 78%, 63% and 41% for BBF. The angioplasty cohort required 1.64 +/- 0.23 angioplasties/patient and 0.64 +/- 0.34 lines/patient. BBF required 0.36 +/- 0.12 angioplasties/patient and 1.2 +/- 0.2 lines/patient. Patients in the BBF cohort spent an additional 0.9 days/year in hospital due to access-related complications.

13048,Comparative economics of a 12-gene assay for predicting risk of recurrence in stage II colon cancer,"BACKGROUND: Prior economic analysis that compared the 12-gene assay to published patterns of care predicted the assay would improve outcomes while lowering medical costs for stage II, T3, mismatch-repair-proficient (MMR-P) colon cancer patients. This study assessed the validity of those findings with real-world adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT) recommendations from the US third-party payer perspective. METHODS: Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for stage II, T3, MMR-P colon cancer patients using guideline-compliant, state-transition probability estimation methods in a Markov model. A study of 141 patients from 17 sites in the Mayo Clinic Cancer Research Consortium provided aCT recommendations before and after knowledge of the 12-gene assay results. Progression and adverse events data with aCT regimens were based on published literature. Drug and administration costs for aCT were obtained from 2014 Medicare Fee Schedule. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the drivers and robustness of the primary outcomes. RESULTS: After receiving the 12-gene assay results, physician recommendations in favor of aCT decreased 22 %; fluoropyrimidine monotherapy and FOLFOX recommendations each declined 11 %. Average per-patient drugs, administration, and adverse events costs decreased $US2,339, $US733, and $US3,211, respectively. Average total direct medical costs decreased $US991. Average patient well-being improved by 0.114 QALYs. Savings are expected to persist even if the cost of oxaliplatin drops by >75 % due to generic substitution. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that real-world changes in aCT recommendations due to the 12-gene assay are likely to reduce direct medical costs and improve well-being for stage II, T3, MMR-P colon cancer patients.",2014-01-15993,25154747,Pharmacoeconomics,Steven R Alberts,2014,32 / 12,1231-43,Yes,25154747,"Steven R Alberts; Tiffany M Yu; Robert J Behrens; Lindsay A Renfro; Geetika Srivastava; Gamini S Soori; Shaker R Dakhil; Rex B Mowat; John P Kuebler; George P Kim; Miroslaw A Mazurczak; John Hornberger; Comparative economics of a 12-gene assay for predicting risk of recurrence in stage II colon cancer, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 32(12):1179-2027; 1231-43",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy after use of-12-gene-assay for prediction of stage II colon cancer recurrence vs. Treatment recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy without use of-12-gene-assay to assess risk of colon cancer recurrence,Not Stated,87 Years,27 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5 Years (see sensitivity analysis in Ratio form)",3.00,3.00,-8692.98,United States,2014,-9503.58
13049,Cost effectiveness of apixaban versus aspirin for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in Belgium,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Evidence indicates that vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and oral anticoagulant therapy are under-utilised for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), and patients who decline or cannot tolerate such treatment are often prescribed aspirin instead. Apixaban has been shown in the AVERROES trial to be superior to aspirin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism without significantly increasing the risk of major bleeding among patients with AF who are unsuitable for VKA therapy. This study estimates the economic implications and potential cost effectiveness of apixaban compared with aspirin in such individuals from the perspective of healthcare payers in Belgium. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of apixaban compared with aspirin in patients unsuitable for VKA therapy. The clinical events modelled include ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, intracranial haemorrhage, other major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular hospitalisation and treatment discontinuations obtained from AVERROES. Outcomes included life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a lifetime. RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase life expectancy and QALYs compared with aspirin, with an associated increase in drug acquisition costs. The estimated ICER was <euro>7,334 per QALY gained with apixaban compared with aspirin.

Recent guidelines suggest a 3-yearly endoscopic follow-up for these patients. Our aim was to determine the cost utility of endoscopic surveillance of patients with extensive gastric premalignant conditions such as extensive atrophy or intestinal metaplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost-utility economic analysis was performed from a societal perspective in Portugal using a Markov model to compare two strategies: surveillance versus no surveillance. Clinical data were collected from a systematic review of the literature, costs from published national data, and community utilities derived from a population study by the EuroQol questionnaire in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Population started at age 50, for a time horizon of 25 years and an annual discount rate of 3% was used for cost and effectiveness. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a 3-yearly endoscopic surveillance versus no surveillance for a base case scenario and in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Secondary outcomes were ICER of 5- and 10-yearly endoscopic surveillance versus no surveillance. RESULTS: Endoscopic surveillance every 3 years provided an ICER of euro 18,336, below the adopted threshold of euro 36,575 which corresponds to the proposed guideline limit of USD 50,000 and this strategy dominated surveillance every 5 or 10 years.

13053,Economic effects of treatment of chronic kidney disease with low-protein diet,"OBJECTIVE: The most recent literature has shown extensively that a low-protein diet in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) delays the natural progression of end-stage renal disease and the necessary treatment of chronic dialysis. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a very low-protein diet compared with a moderate low-protein diet. DESIGN: Markov model. SETTING: The study was conducted from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. SUBJECTS: Patients with CKD stages 4 and 5. Seven hundred and two patients were considered, and half were treated with a very low-protein diet and the other half with a moderate low-protein diet. INTERVENTION: The Markov model estimates the costs and the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with a very low-protein diet versus a moderate low-protein diet for patients with CKD Stages 4 and 5. The transition probability was estimated on data from 7 studies, which determined the efficacy of very low-protein diets in delaying the need to start maintenance dialysis. Utilities and cost were estimated from literature review and projected for the lifespan considered in the model. The annual cost of dialysis per patient was approximately euro34,072. The cost of a very low-protein diet was euro1,440 per patient per year in the Lazio region (conservative assumptions). Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: QALY, cost of treatment, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The model estimates that a very low-protein diet should be more effective. Dietary treatment improved 0.09 QALYs after 2 years, 0.16 after 3 years, 0.36 after 5 years, and up to 0.93 incremental QALYs after the first 10 years. After 2 years, the model estimated increment cost in favor of the most restrictive dietary treatment of euro826, euro2,146, euro5,203, and euro10,375 for 2, 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these simulations indicate that the treatment of CKD patients with a very low-protein diet is cost-effective relative to a moderate low-protein diet in an Italian setting.

13054,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a colonoscopy screening navigator program designed for Hispanic men,"Although Hispanic men are at higher risk of developing colon cancer compared to non-Hispanic white men, colonoscopy screening among Hispanic men is much lower than among non-Hispanic white men. University Health System (UHS) in San Antonio, Texas, instituted a Colorectal Cancer Male Navigation (CCMN) Program in 2011 specifically designed for Hispanic men. The CCMN Program contacted 461 Hispanic men 50 years of age and older to participate over a 2-year period. Of these age-eligible men, 370 were screened for CRC after being contacted by the navigator. Using participant and program data, a Markov model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the CCMN Program. An average 50-year-old Hispanic male who participates in the CCMN Program will have 0.3 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared to a similar male receiving usual care. Life expectancy is also predicted to increase by 6 months for participants compared to non-participants. The program results in net health care savings of $1,148 per participant ($424,760 for the 370 CCMN Program participants). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is estimated at $3,765 per QALY in favor of the navigation program. Interventions to reduce disparities in CRC screening across ethnic groups are needed, and this is one of the first studies to evaluate the economic benefit of a patient navigator program specifically designed for an urban population of Hispanic men.

13055,"Continuous positive airway pressure in older people with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (PREDICT): a 12-month, multicentre, randomised trial","BACKGROUND: The therapeutic and economic benefits of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) syndrome have been established in middle-aged people; however, the benefits in older people are unknown. This trial was designed to address this evidence gap. METHODS: This 12-month, multicentre, randomised trial enrolled patients across 14 National Health Service sleep centres in the UK. Consecutive patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed OSA syndrome were eligible to join the trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) into parallel groups to receive either CPAP with best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone for 12 months. Randomisation was done by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit with computer-generated randomisation. The main investigator at each centre was masked to the trial randomisation. Coprimary endpoints were Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) at 3 months and cost-effectiveness over the 12-month trial period. Secondary outcomes were subjective sleepiness at 12 months, plus objective sleepiness, quality of life, mood, functionality, nocturia, mobility, accidents, cognitive function, and cardiovascular risk factors and events at 3 months and 12 months. The analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN90464927. FINDINGS: Between Feb 24, 2010, and May 30, 2012, 278 patients were randomly assigned to the trial, of whom 231 (83%) completed the trial. 140 patients were allocated to and received CPAP plus BSC and 138 were allocated to and received BSC only. CPAP reduced ESS by 2.1 points (95% CI -3.0 to -1.3; p<0.0001) at 3 months for 124 (89%) of 140 patients compared with 124 (90%) of 138 patients given BSC, and by 2.0 points (-2.8 to -1.2; p<0.0001) at 12 months for 116 patients compared with 122 patients given BSC. The effect was greater in patients with higher CPAP usage or higher baseline ESS. Quality-adjusted life-years were similar between the groups (treatment effect 0.01 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.04; p=0.787) and health-care costs were marginally reduced with CPAP (- pound35, -390 to 321; p=0.847). CPAP improved objective sleepiness (p=0.024), mobility (p=0.029), total cholesterol (p=0.048), and LDL cholesterol (p=0.042) at 3 months, but these were not sustained at 12 months. Measures of mood, functionality, nocturia, accidents, cognitive function, and cardiovascular events remained unchanged. Systolic blood pressure fell in the BSC group. 37 serious adverse events occurred in the CPAP group, and 22 in BSC group; all were independently classified as being unrelated to the trial and no significant harm was attributed to CPAP use. INTERPRETATION: In older people with OSA syndrome, CPAP reduces sleepiness and is marginally more cost effective over 12 months than is BSC alone. On the basis of these results, we recommend that CPAP treatment should be offered routinely to older patients with OSA syndrome.

METHODS: A within-trial incremental cost-utility analysis was conducted with 108 participants randomized to either the EXTRA programme (n = 52) or usual care (n = 56). A health care perspective was assumed for the primary analysis with a 36 week follow-up. Resource use information was collected on interventions, medication, primary and secondary care contacts, private health care and social care costs. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the EuroQol five-dimension three-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire responses at baseline, 12 and 36 weeks. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, total QALYs gained were higher in the EXTRA programme, leading to an increase of 0.0296 QALYs. The mean National Health Service (NHS) costs per participant were slightly higher in the EXTRA programme (by pound82), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound2770 per additional QALY gained. Thus the EXTRA programme was cost effective from an NHS perspective when assessed against the threshold of pound20 000- pound30 000/QALY gained. Overall, costs were lower in the EXTRA programme compared with usual care, suggesting it was the dominant treatment option from a societal perspective. At a willingness-to-pay of pound20 000/QALY gained, there was a 65% probability that the EXTRA programme was the most cost-effective option. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses accounting for missing data, changing the cost perspective and removing cost outliers. CONCLUSION: The physiotherapist-led EXTRA programme represents a cost-effective use of resources compared with usual care and leads to lower health care costs and work absence.

Biomarkers, such as the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), allow further tailoring of treatment. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness and clinical effectiveness of pursuing PCa, Ca, or Feno-driven controlled asthma (FCa). METHODS: In a nonblind, pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial in primary care, adults (18-50 years of age) with a doctor's diagnosis of asthma who were prescribed inhaled corticosteroids were allocated to one of 3 treatment strategies: (1) aiming at PCa (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score <1.50); (2) aiming at Ca (ACQ score <0.75); and (3) aiming at FCa (ACQ score <0.75 and Feno value <25 ppb). During 12 months' follow-up, treatment was adjusted every 3 months by using an online decision support tool. Outcomes were incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, asthma control (ACQ score), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score), asthma medication use, and severe exacerbation rate. RESULTS: Six hundred eleven participants were allocated to the PCa (n = 219), Ca (n = 203), or FCa (n = 189) strategies. The FCa strategy improved asthma control compared with the PCa strategy (P < .02). There were no differences in quality of life (P >/= .36).

13059,Symptom- and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide-driven strategies for asthma control: A cluster-randomized trial in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Aiming at partly controlled asthma (PCa) instead of controlled asthma (Ca) might decrease asthma medication use. Biomarkers, such as the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), allow further tailoring of treatment. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness and clinical effectiveness of pursuing PCa, Ca, or Feno-driven controlled asthma (FCa). METHODS: In a nonblind, pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial in primary care, adults (18-50 years of age) with a doctor's diagnosis of asthma who were prescribed inhaled corticosteroids were allocated to one of 3 treatment strategies: (1) aiming at PCa (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score <1.50); (2) aiming at Ca (ACQ score <0.75); and (3) aiming at FCa (ACQ score <0.75 and Feno value <25 ppb). During 12 months' follow-up, treatment was adjusted every 3 months by using an online decision support tool. Outcomes were incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, asthma control (ACQ score), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score), asthma medication use, and severe exacerbation rate. RESULTS: Six hundred eleven participants were allocated to the PCa (n = 219), Ca (n = 203), or FCa (n = 189) strategies. The FCa strategy improved asthma control compared with the PCa strategy (P < .02). There were no differences in quality of life (P >/= .36). Asthma medication use was significantly lower for the PCa and FCa strategies compared with the Ca strategy (medication costs: PCa, $452; Ca, $551; and FCa, $456; P </= .04). The FCa strategy had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year (86%; PCa, 2%; Ca, 12%).

13060,Cost-effectiveness of subthalmic nucleus deep brain stimulation for the treatment of advanced Parkinson disease in Hong Kong: a prospective study,"BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective but costly treatment for patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD). This study examined the cost-effectiveness of DBS in relation to its improved effectiveness to help funding decision makers decide whether the treatment should be adopted. The incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year has been benchmarked as being between US$50,000 and US$100,000 by US agencies, whereas it is less than euro30,000 per quality-adjusted life year in Europe. OBJECTIVE: To provide cost-effectiveness information of subthalamic nucleus DBS for patients with advanced PD. MATERIALS: Direct medical expenses during the year before the DBS treatment were used to measure the baseline cost. Cost-effectiveness was measured by the ICER for the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III and the ICER for the EuroQol Group's Health-Related Quality of Life measurement. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with advanced PD were recruited between January 2009 and January 2011. A 1-point improvement in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III score was associated with an ICER of US$926 in the first year and US$421 in the second year. A 1-point improvement on the EuroQol Group's Health-Related Quality of Life measurement was associated with an ICER of US$123,110 in the first year and US$62,846 in the second year. CONCLUSION: Cost-effectiveness of subthalamic nucleus DBS for treatment of advanced PD is greater during a 2-year period than 1 year only.

METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted from a Canadian public healthcare perspective with a one year time horizon. In the no FP dose change scenarios, remaining on daily low (FP 100 ug BID) or medium (FP 200-250 ug BID) or high dose (FP 500 ug BID) was considered. In the increased FP dose scenarios, doubling the FP dose from low to medium dose and from medium to high dose regimens were considered. A decision model was developed with two health states: ""symptom free"" or ""with symptoms"". Clinical efficacy was based on a meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials. Over the one year time horizon the percentage with symptom free days (SFD) was used as the measure of differential treatment scenario effectiveness. Drug costs and non-drug costs were incorporated into the analysis. Utilities, derived from EQ5D scores and health services resource use based on patient diaries for 'symptom free' and 'with symptoms' were based on regression analyses of individual patient data from the Gaining Optimal Asthma controL (GOAL) trial. Costs were assessed by assigning unit cost for each health services resource use for each patient. The incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) for SFC vs no FP dose change or increased FP dose were estimated using descriptive statistics. Uncertainty was assessed by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: Over one year, SFC resulted in an incremental cost per patient of $544-$655 compared to no FP dose change and $47-$380 per year compared to increased FP dose. SFC results in incremental QALYs per patient of 0.0100-0.0149 compared to no FP dose change and 0.0136-0.0152 compared to increased FP dose. The one year ICURs were $43,000 to $54,400 per QALY gained for SFC compared to no FP dose change and $25,000 to $3500 per QALY gained compared to increased FP dose scenarios. The probability of SFC being cost-effective at $50,000 per QALY gained was greater than 75% compared to increased FP dose scenarios and compared to no dose change for patients on low or medium dose FP.

A 12-month clinical trial in 834 patients with moderate RA investigated whether etanercept 50 mg/wk could be reduced to half dose or discontinued in patients who achieved low disease activity after 36 weeks. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the three maintenance strategies. METHODS: A Markov model integrated the three strategies from the clinical trial and extrapolated to 10 years using data from the Swedish RA registry. Assumed treatment strategies after the trial were similar in all three arms, with patients failing to maintain remission on half-dose etanercept or methotrexate alone switching to the full dose of etanercept and patients maintaining remission on full-dose etanercept allowed switching to half dose. Resource use and utilities were taken from an observational study. Results are presented as cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (both discounted 3%) in the societal perspective. RESULTS: The cost/QALY gained with half-dose etanercept versus methotrexate ranged from euro14,000 to euro29,000: Longer simulations result in a higher cost/QALY, as the acquisition cost of etanercept increases.

13068,Treating to target with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis: cost-effectiveness of dose reductions when remission is achieved,"BACKGROUND: Current management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) focuses on inducing remission as early as possible to avoid lasting joint damage, and maintenance of remission has become important. A 12-month clinical trial in 834 patients with moderate RA investigated whether etanercept 50 mg/wk could be reduced to half dose or discontinued in patients who achieved low disease activity after 36 weeks. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the three maintenance strategies. METHODS: A Markov model integrated the three strategies from the clinical trial and extrapolated to 10 years using data from the Swedish RA registry. Assumed treatment strategies after the trial were similar in all three arms, with patients failing to maintain remission on half-dose etanercept or methotrexate alone switching to the full dose of etanercept and patients maintaining remission on full-dose etanercept allowed switching to half dose. Resource use and utilities were taken from an observational study. Results are presented as cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (both discounted 3%) in the societal perspective. RESULTS: The cost/QALY gained with half-dose etanercept versus methotrexate ranged from euro14,000 to euro29,000: Longer simulations result in a higher cost/QALY, as the acquisition cost of etanercept increases.

13069,A framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the NADiA ProsVue slope to guide adjuvant radiotherapy among men with high-risk characteristics following prostatectomy for prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVES: The NADiA ProsVue is a prognostic system that measures prostate-specific antigen slope to identify men at lower risk of clinical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. We developed a decision-modeling framework to evaluate its cost-effectiveness to guide the use of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART). METHODS: We populated the model using patient-level data and external sources. Patients were classified as intermediate risk or high risk on the basis of Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) nomogram and then stratified by the ProsVue slope (</=2 pg/mL/mo; >2 pg/mL/mo) and receipt of ART. In sensitivity analyses, we varied the effect of the ProsVue slope on the use of ART and other model parameters. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of the ProsVue-guided strategy varied widely because of small differences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 10 years. In the intermediate-risk group, when the use of ART decreased from 20% (standard care) to 7.5% among patients with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25,160/QALY. In the high-risk group, the use of ART would have to decrease from 40% (standard care) to 11.5% among those with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less to obtain a ratio of $50,000/QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to varying benefits of salvage therapy, quality of life, and costs of ART and ProsVue testing. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the ProsVue system on costs will be dependent on the extent to which ART decreases among men identified as having a low risk of recurrence.

13071,A cost-effectiveness analysis of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and automated insulin suspension versus standard pump therapy for hypoglycemic unaware patients with type 1 diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with ""Low Glucose Suspend"" (LGS) functionality versus standard pump therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes who have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. METHODS: A clinical trial-based economic evaluation was performed in which the net costs and effectiveness of the two treatment modalities were calculated and expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The clinical outcome of interest for the evaluation was the rate of severe hypoglycemia in each arm of the LGS study. Quality-of-life utility scores were calculated using the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Resource use costs were estimated using public sources. RESULTS: After 6 months, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoglycemia compared with standard pump therapy (incident rate difference 1.85 [0.17-3.53]; P = 0.037). Based on a primary randomized study, the ICER per severe hypoglycemic event avoided was $18,257 for all patients and $14,944 for those aged 12 years and older. Including all major medical resource costs (e.g., hospital admissions), the ICERs were $17,602 and $14,289, respectively. Over the 6-month period, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $40,803 for patients aged 12 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the Australian experience evaluating new interventions across a broad range of therapeutic areas, sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS may be considered a cost-effective alternative to standard pump therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose in hypoglycemia unaware patients with type 1 diabetes.",2014-01-16040,25128049,Value Health,Trang T Ly,2014,17 / 5,561-9,Yes,25128049,"Trang T Ly; Alan J M Brnabic; Andrew Eggleston; Athena Kolivos; Margaret E McBride; Rudolf Schrover; Timothy W Jones; A cost-effectiveness analysis of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and automated insulin suspension versus standard pump therapy for hypoglycemic unaware patients with type 1 diabetes, Value Health, ; 17(5):1098-3015; 561-9",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with Low Glucose Suspend functionality vs. Standard pump therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose,Reduced/impaired knowledge of hypoglycemic status,50 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,40803,Australia,2013,43894.5
13072,Cost effectiveness of telecare management for pain and depression in patients with cancer: results from a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: Pain and depression are prevalent and treatable symptoms among patients with cancer, yet they are often undetected and undertreated. The Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial demonstrated that telecare management can improve pain and depression outcomes. This article investigates the incremental cost effectiveness of the INCPAD intervention. METHODS: The INCPAD trial was conducted in 16 community-based urban and rural oncology practices in Indiana. Of the 405 participants, 202 were randomized to the intervention group and 203 to the usual-care group. Intervention costs were determined, and effectiveness outcomes were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years. RESULTS: The intervention group was associated with a yearly increase of 60.3 depression-free days (S.E. = 15.4; P < 0.01) and an increase of between 0.033 and 0.066 quality-adjusted life years compared to the usual care group. Total cost of the intervention per patient was US$1189, which included physician, nurse care manager and automated monitoring set-up and maintenance costs. Incremental cost per depression-free day was US$19.72, which yields a range of US$18,018 to US$36,035 per quality-adjusted life year when converted to that metric. When measured directly, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranged from US$10,826 based on the modified EQ-5D to US$73,286.92 based on the SF-12.

13073,"Economic evaluation of meningococcal serogroup B childhood vaccination in Ontario, Canada","OBJECTIVE: Invasive Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) disease is a low incidence but severe infection (mean annual incidence 0.19/100,000/year, case fatality 11%, major long-term sequelae 10%) in Ontario, Canada. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of a novel MenB vaccine from the Ontario healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov cohort model of invasive MenB disease based on high quality local data and data from the literature was developed. A 4-dose vaccination schedule, 97% coverage, 90% effectiveness, 66% strain coverage, 10-year duration of protection, and vaccine cost of C$75/dose were assumed. A hypothetical Ontario birth cohort (n=150,000) was simulated to estimate expected lifetime health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs, discounted at 5%. RESULTS: A MenB infant vaccination program is expected to prevent 4.6 invasive MenB disease cases over the lifetime of an Ontario birth cohort, equivalent to 10 QALYs gained. The estimated program cost of C$46.6 million per cohort (including C$318,383 for treatment of vaccine-associated adverse events) were not offset by healthcare cost savings of C$150,522 from preventing MenB cases, resulting in an incremental cost of C$4.76 million per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed the findings to be robust.

We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of two- and three-dose schedules of girls-only and girls & boys HPV vaccination programmes in Canada. METHODS: We used HPV-ADVISE, an individual-based transmission-dynamic model of multi-type HPV infection and diseases (anogenital warts, and cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis and oropharynx). We conducted the analysis from the health payer perspective, with a 70-year time horizon and 3% discount rate, and performed extensive sensitivity analyses, including duration of vaccine protection and vaccine cost. FINDINGS: Assuming 80% coverage and a vaccine cost per dose of $85, two-dose girls-only vaccination (vs. no vaccination) produced cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)-gained varying between $7900-24,300.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate cost and quality of life (QoL) implications of implementing a HF management program (HFMP) in primary health care (PHC). METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective randomized open-label study including 160 patients with a diagnosis of HF from five PHC centers in south-eastern Sweden. Patients randomized to the intervention group received information about HF from HF nurses and from a validated computer-based awareness program. HF nurses and physicians followed the patients intensely in order to optimize HF treatment according to current guidelines. The patients in the control group were followed by their regular general practitioner (GP) and received standard treatment according to local management routines. No significant changes were observed in NYHA class and quality-adjusted life years (QALY), implying that functional class and QoL were preserved. However, costs for hospital care (HC) and PHC were reduced by EUR 2167, or 33%. The total cost was EUR 4471 in the intervention group and EUR 6638 in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing HFMP in Swedish PHC in patients with HF entails a significant reduction in resource utilization and costs, and maintains QoL.

However, costs for hospital care (HC) and PHC were reduced by EUR 2167, or 33%. The total cost was EUR 4471 in the intervention group and EUR 6638 in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing HFMP in Swedish PHC in patients with HF entails a significant reduction in resource utilization and costs, and maintains QoL. Based on these results, a broader implementation of HFMP in PHC may be recommended.

13080,The appropriateness of more intensive colonoscopy screening than recommended in Medicare beneficiaries: a modeling study,"IMPORTANCE: Many Medicare beneficiaries undergo more intensive colonoscopy screening than recommended. Whether this is favorable for beneficiaries and efficient from a societal perspective is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether more intensive colonoscopy screening than recommended is favorable for Medicare beneficiaries (ie, whether it results in a net health benefit) and whether it is efficient from a societal perspective (ie, whether the net health benefit justifies the additional resources required). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation modeling study of 65-year-old Medicare beneficiaries at average risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) and with an average life expectancy who underwent a screening colonoscopy at 55 years with negative results. INTERVENTIONS: Colonoscopy screening as recommended by guidelines (ie, at 65 and 75 years) vs scenarios with a shorter screening interval (5 or 3 instead of 10 years) or in which screening was continued to 85 or 95 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (measure of net health benefit); additional colonoscopies required per additional QALY gained and additional costs per additional QALY gained (measures of efficiency). RESULTS: Screening previously screened Medicare beneficiaries more intensively than recommended resulted in only small increases in CRC deaths prevented and life-years gained. In comparison, the increases in colonoscopies performed and colonoscopy-related complications experienced were large. As a result, all scenarios of more intensive screening than recommended resulted in a loss of QALYs, rather than a gain (ie, a net harm). The only exception was shortening the screening interval from 10 to 5 years, which resulted in 0.7 QALYs gained per 1000 beneficiaries. However, this scenario was inefficient because it required no less than 909 additional colonoscopies and an additional $711 000 per additional QALY gained. Results in previously unscreened beneficiaries were slightly less unfavorable, but conclusions were identical. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening Medicare beneficiaries more intensively than recommended is not only inefficient from a societal perspective; often it is also unfavorable for those being screened.

13085,Cost-effectiveness of health promotion targeting physical activity and healthy eating in mental health care,"BACKGROUND: There is a higher prevalence of obesity in individuals with mental disorders compared to the general population. The results of several studies suggested that weight reduction in this population is possible following psycho-educational and/or behavioural weight management interventions. Evidence of the effectiveness alone is however inadequate for policy making. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a health promotion intervention targeting physical activity and healthy eating in individuals with mental disorders. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model using a public payer perspective was applied, projecting the one-year results of a 10-week intervention over a time horizon of 20 years, assuming a repeated yearly implementation of the programme. Scenario analysis was applied evaluating the effects on the results of alternative modelling assumptions. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects on the results of varying key input parameters. RESULTS: An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 27,096euro/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in men, and 40,139euro/QALY in women was found in the base case. Scenario analysis assuming an increase in health-related quality of life as a result of the body mass index decrease resulted in much better cost-effectiveness in both men (3,357euro/QALY) and women (3,766euro/QALY). The uncertainty associated with the intervention effect had the greatest impact on the model.

We compared 12 screening strategies combining annual or biennial MRI with mammography and clinical breast examination (CBE) in intervals of 0.5, 1, or 2 years vs without, and reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Based on an ICER threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy for women at 25% lifetime risk was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every year from age 30 to 74, yielding ICER $58,400 (compared to biennial MRI alone).

We compared 12 screening strategies combining annual or biennial MRI with mammography and clinical breast examination (CBE) in intervals of 0.5, 1, or 2 years vs without, and reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Based on an ICER threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy for women at 25% lifetime risk was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every year from age 30 to 74, yielding ICER $58,400 (compared to biennial MRI alone). At 50% lifetime risk and with 70% reduction in MRI cost, the recommended strategy was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$84,400). At 75% lifetime risk, the recommended strategy is biennial MRI combined with mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$62,800).

13098,Primum non nocere: shared informed decision making in low back pain--a pilot cluster randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common and disabling condition leading to large health service and societal costs. Although there are several treatment options for back pain little is known about how to improve patient choice in treatment selection. The purpose of this study was to pilot a decision support package to help people choose between low back pain treatments. METHODS: This was a single-centred pilot cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a community physiotherapy service. We included adults with non-specific low back pain referred for physiotherapy. Intervention participants were sent an information booklet prior to their first consultation. Intervention physiotherapists were trained to enhance their skills in shared informed decision making. Those in the control arm received care as usual. The primary outcome was satisfaction with the treatment received at four months using a five-point Likert Scale dichotomised into ""satisfaction"" (very satisfied or somewhat satisfied) and ""non-satisfaction"" (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied). RESULTS: We recruited 148 participants. In the control arm 67% of participants were satisfied with their treatment and in the intervention arm 53%. The adjusted relative risk of being satisfied was 1.28 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 2.09). For most secondary outcomes the trend was towards worse outcomes in the intervention group. For one measure; the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, this difference was clinically important (2.27, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 4.47). Mean healthcare costs were slightly lower ( pound38 saving per patient) within the intervention arm but health outcomes were also less favourable (0.02 fewer QALYs); the estimated probability that the intervention would be cost-effective at an incremental threshold of pound20,000 per QALY was 16%. CONCLUSION: We did not find that this decision support package improved satisfaction with treatment; it may have had a substantial negative effect on clinical outcome, and is very unlikely to prove cost-effective. That a decision support package might have a clinically important detrimental effect is of concern. To our knowledge this has not been observed previously. Decision support packages should be formally tested for clinical and cost-effectiveness, and safety before implementation.

13099,"Health economics analysis of insulin aspart vs. regular human insulin in type 2 diabetes patients, based on observational real life evidence from general practices in Germany","BACKGROUND: A retrospective analysis of German general practice data demonstrated that insulin aspart (IA) was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of macrovascular events (MVE: stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease or coronary heart disease) vs. regular human insulin (RHI) in type 2 diabetes patients. Economic implications, balanced against potential improvements in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from lower risks of complications with IA in this setting have not yet been explored. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed utilizing 3-year initial MVE rates for each comparator, combined with published German-specific insulin and MVE costs and health utilities to calculate number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid any MVE, incremental costs and QALYs gained/ person for IA vs. RHI. A 3-year time horizon and German 3(rd)-party payer perspective were used. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed, sampling from distributions of key parameters. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: NNT over a 3 year period to avoid any MVE was 8 patients for IA vs. RHI. Due to lower MVE rates, IA dominated RHI with 0.020 QALYs gained (95% confidence interval: 0.014-0.025) and cost savings of EUR 1 556 (1 062-2 076)/person for IA vs. RHI over the 3-year time horizon. Sensitivity analysis revealed that IA would still be overall cost saving even if the cost of IA was double the cost/unit of RHI. CONCLUSIONS: From a health economics perspective, IA was the superior alternative for the insulin treatment of type 2 diabetes, with lower incidence of MVE events translating to improved QALYs and lower costs vs. RHI within a 3-year time horizon.",2014-01-16072,25148263,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes,A Liebl,2014,122 / 9,517-22,No,25148263,"A Liebl; L Seitz; A J Palmer; Health economics analysis of insulin aspart vs. regular human insulin in type 2 diabetes patients, based on observational real life evidence from general practices in Germany, Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes , ; 122(9):1439-3646; 517-22",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous treatment at same practice vs. Standard/Usual Care- Regular human insulin (RHI),Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,Not Stated,Full,3 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-77800,Euro,2010,-122207.42
13100,Cost utility of telaprevir-PR (peginterferon-ribavirin) versus boceprevir-PR and versus PR alone in chronic hepatitis C in The Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: The hepatitis C virus may lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver transplant, and increased mortality. With standard treatment peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin (PR), sustained viral response (SVR) was less than 50 %. SVR rates improve greatly when PR is combined with telaprevir or boceprevir. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost utility of telaprevir-peginterferon-ribavirin (TPR) versus PR and boceprevir-peginterferon-ribavirin (BPR) in treatment-naive (TN) and treatment-experienced (TE) adults with chronic hepatitis C in the Netherlands. METHODS: A Markov model with a lifelong time horizon and annual cycles was developed. Clinical data stemmed from phase III trials (TPR vs PR, BPR vs PR). A mixed treatment comparison (MTC) was developed to compare TPR and BPR indirectly. Unit costs and utilities based on EQ-5D were established in a Dutch cross-sectional study. Cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was calculated according to the societal perspective. RESULTS: Treating TN patients with TPR generates 1.12 additional QALYs with euro333 additional cost compared with PR, resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro299/QALY. In TE patients, TPR dominates PR with cost savings (-euro7,819) and 1.63 additional QALYs. TPR dominates BPR yielding additional QALYs (0.26 in TN; 0.71 in TE) and cost savings (-euro7,296, -euro18,144, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: TPR seems a cost-effective alternative to PR in TN patients and dominant in TE patients. TPR was a dominant, more effective and less costly alternative to BPR in both patient types. The cost effectiveness of both TPR and BPR is well below generally accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds and may be considered cost effective.",2014-01-16078,25103219,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Aikaterini Vellopoulou,2014,12 / 6,647-59,Yes,25103219,"Aikaterini Vellopoulou; Michel van Agthoven; Annemarie van der Kolk; Robert J de Knegt; Gilles Berdeaux; Sandrine Cure; Florence Bianic; Mark Lamotte; Cost utility of telaprevir-PR (peginterferon-ribavirin) versus boceprevir-PR and versus PR alone in chronic hepatitis C in The Netherlands, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 12(6):1179-1896; 647-59",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Telaprevir regimen vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard of care (SOC) regimen: PR (PEG 2a 180 lg/ week; ribavirin 1,000 mg/day) for 48 weeks for both TN and TE patients following the Dutch guidelines",Treatment navie,Not Stated,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,376.79,Euro,2011,603.28
