5601,Treatment options for Graves disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: First-line treatment for Graves disease is frequently 18 months of antithyroid medication (ATM). Controversy exists concerning the next best line of treatment for patients who have failed to achieve euthyroidism; options include lifelong ATM, radioactive iodine (RAI), or total thyroidectomy (TT). We aim to determine the most cost-effective option. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing these different strategies. Treatment efficacy and complication data were derived from a literature review. Costs were examined from a health-care system perspective using actual Medicare reimbursement rates to an urban university hospital. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Costs and effectiveness were converted to present values; all key variables were subjected to sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: TT was the most cost-effective strategy, resulting in a gain of 1.32 QALYs compared with RAI (at an additional cost of 9,594 US dollars) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 7,240 US dollars/QALY. RAI was the least costly option at 23,600 US dollars but also provided the least QALY (25.08 QALY). Once the cost of TT exceeds 19,300 US dollars, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of lifelong ATM and TT reverse and lifelong ATM becomes the more cost-effective strategy at 15,000US dollars/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first formal cost-effectiveness study in the US of the optimal treatment for patients with Graves disease who fail to achieve euthyroidism after 18 months of ATM. Our findings demonstrate that TT is more cost effective than RAI or lifelong ATM in these patients; this continues until the cost of TT becomes > 19,300 US dollars.",2009-01-04762,19632593,J Am Coll Surg,Haejin In,2009,209 / 2,170-179.e1-2,No,19632593,"Haejin In; Elizabeth N Pearce; Arthur K Wong; James F Burgess; David B McAneny; Jennifer E Rosen; Elizabeth N Pearce; Arthur K Wong; James F Burgess; David B McAneny; Jennifer E Rosen; Treatment options for Graves disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis, J Am Coll Surg, 2009-Aug; 209(2):1072-7515; 170-179.e1-2",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radioactive iodine treatment vs. Total thyroidectomy,Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7250,United States,2007,9049.68
5602,Cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim versus six days of filgrastim for preventing febrile neutropenia in breast cancer patients,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a major complication of chemotherapy and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis with, pegfilgrastim versus six-day filgrastim in preventing FN in Italian patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy associated with a > or = 20% FN risk. METHODS: The pharmacoeconomic evaluation was based on a decision-analytic model taking into account the possible consequences of FN (e.g., death and reduction/delay of chemotherapy dose). Parameters included in the model were relative risk of FN with pegfilgrastim versus six-day filgrastim; direct costs (drug purchase and FN-related hospitalizations); relative risk of relative dose intensity < 85% with pegfilgrastim versus filgrastim; impact on long-term survival due to relative dose intensity < 85%; and impact of age on FN and relative dose intensity < 85%. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, pegfilgrastim was cost-effective compared to six-day filgrastim in Italy. The estimated cost, life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years per person for pegfilgrastim were Euro 3078, 16.47 years, and 15.32; the corresponding figures for six-day filgrastim were Euro 3033, 16.35 years, and 15.22. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with pegfilgrastim was Euro 409 per life-year gained and Euro 429 per quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to the relative risk of FN for 6-day filgrastim versus pegfilgrastim. The results were moderately sensitive to the cost of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim, cost of drug administration, cost of FN hospitalization, and number of chemotherapy cycles. Pegfilgrastim remained cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well below the accepted limit of Euro 50,000 per life year gained in all one-way sensitivity analyses. A two-way sensitivity analysis on cost of drugs showed a range of pegfilgrastim dominance over six-day filgrastim. CONCLUSIONS: At the current official price in Italy, primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim improved health outcomes with a very limited cost increase for the National Health Service payer. Even when very low prices of filgrastim and high prices of pegfilgrastim were considered in the model, the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained well within the acceptable cost-effectiveness limit of Euro 50,000/quality-adjusted life year.",2009-01-04776,19579869,Tumori,Marco Danova,2009,95 / 2,219-26,No,19579869,"Marco Danova; Silvia Chiroli; Giovanni Rosti; Quan V Doan; Cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim versus six days of filgrastim for preventing febrile neutropenia in breast cancer patients, Tumori, 2009 Mar-Apr; 95(2):0300-8916; 219-26",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pegfilgrastim vs. Filgrastim (6-days),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.00,429,Euro,2006,691.9
5603,Modeling the cost-effectiveness of different oral antiviral therapies in patients with chronic hepatitis B,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a common disease associated with high morbidity, mortality and impact on healthcare costs. Several oral antiviral therapies can lead to complete virologic response, which is associated with prevention of disease progression. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the oral antiviral treatments lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, in patients with CHB. METHODS: A Markov model was used to project the lifetime complications and costs in cohorts of both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with one of the above drugs or no treatment. Rescue therapy with two different combination therapies (adefovir plus lamivudine or tenofovir plus entecavir) with their corresponding costs and efficacy rates was also considered. The probabilities of disease progression were based on serum HBV DNA levels. Disease and complication costs were assessed using the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. RESULTS: The highest rate of virologic response was obtained with tenofovir, and this translated to its higher life years saved (LYS) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) compared with the rest of the alternatives in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. Tenofovir is associated with lower costs and higher efficacy over entecavir, telbivudine and adefovir in HBeAg-positive patients, and telbivudine and entecavir in HBeAg-negative patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with respect to the rest of the alternatives are below the common reference efficiency threshold of 30,000euro per LYS/QALY.

5608,How to screen for cervical cancer after HPV16/18 vaccination in The Netherlands,"In The Netherlands, vaccination against HPV16/18 has been recommended for all 12-year-old girls. Because screening of vaccinated women remains important, we evaluated the model-based cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening strategies. We considered cytology and the HPV DNA test as primary screening instrument, varied the number of screening rounds from 7 to 4, and set the screening starting age at 30 and 35 years. Our model predicted reductions in cervical cancer mortality between 60 and 81% (from 199 deaths to 37-79) when adding screening to vaccination (assumptions for vaccination: 95% efficacy, 100% compliance, lifelong protection). Screening 5 times with HPV DNA (euro11,133/QALY) or 7 times with cytology (euro17,627/QALY) were scenarios with comparable costs and effects and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below the threshold in The Netherlands (euro20,000 per QALY).",2009-01-04786,19567242,Vaccine,Veerle M H Coupé,2009,27 / 37,5111-9,Yes,19567242,"Veerle M H Coupé; H E de Melker; Peter J F Snijders; Chris J L M Meijer; Johannes Berkhof; H E de Melker; Peter J F Snijders; Chris J L M Meijer; Johannes Berkhof; How to screen for cervical cancer after HPV16/18 vaccination in The Netherlands, Vaccine, 2009-Aug-13; 27(37):1873-2518; 5111-9",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cytological screening for HPV and cervical cancer (4 times between age 30 and 60) vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,30 Years,4.00,1.50,2667,Euro,2006,4301.36
5609,The cost-effectiveness of risedronate in the UK for the management of osteoporosis using the FRAX(R),"The study estimated the cost-effectiveness of risedronate compared to no treatment in UK women using the FRAX algorithm for fracture risk assessment. A Markov cohort model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness. Risedronate was found cost-effective from the age of 65 years, assuming a willingness to pay for a QALY of pound30,000. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of risedronate for the prevention and treatment in a UK setting using the FRAX(R) algorithm for fracture risk assessment. A further aim was to establish intervention thresholds with risedronate treatment. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of risedronate was compared to no treatment in post-menopausal women with clinical risk factors for fracture using a Markov cohort model populated with data relevant for the UK. The model incorporated the features of FRAX(R) (the WHO risk assessment tool). The analysis had a health care perspective and quality adjusted life years was used as the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Treatment was cost-effective from the age of 65 years, assuming a willingness to pay for a QALY of pound30,000. Treatment was also cost-effective at all ages in women who had previously sustained a fragility fracture or in women with a parental history of hip fracture with a bone mineral density set at the threshold of osteoporosis. At the pound30,000 threshold value for a QALY, risedronate was on average found to cost-effective below the 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fractures of 13.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Risedronate is a cost-effective agent for the treatment of established osteoporosis (osteoporosis and a prior fragility fracture) in women from the age of 50 years and older and above 65 years in women with osteoporosis alone.

5610,The Cost-Effectiveness of Bosentan in the United Kingdom for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension of WHO Functional Class III,"ABSTRACT Objectives: To assess whether bosentan or no active intervention, in addition to palliative care, is the more cost-effective first-line treatment option for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) or PAH associated with connective tissue disease (PAH-CTD) of WHO functional classification (FC) III in the United Kingdom. Methods: A cost-utility model simulated the treatment of patients with PAH of FC III. Patients remained on the selected intervention until death or clinical deterioration to FC IV, which would trigger initiation of epoprostenol treatment. The initial first-line treatment choice was assumed to not affect survival, but to affect the time until clinical deterioration, with this assumption being relaxed in sensitivity analyses. The distribution of time to clinical deterioration was estimated from long-term clinical trial databases of bosentan and from published literature. Utility associated with FC was taken from published literature. Costs were sourced from published literature and from specialist PAH centers. The time horizon was that of patients' lifetimes, with costs and benefits discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In the base case, bosentan dominated no active intervention because of the longer time to clinical deterioration and therefore the reduced time, per patient, spent in FC IV, which was associated with high costs of epoprostenol and reduced utility. In sensitivity analyses, bosentan was estimated to be more cost-effective than no active intervention, provided that any survival benefit was not greater than 2 years for patients with iPAH and 1 year for those with PAH-CTD.

5612,An economic evaluation of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis strategies in critically ill trauma patients at risk of bleeding,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill trauma patients with severe injuries are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding simultaneously. Currently, the optimal VTE prophylaxis strategy is unknown for trauma patients with a contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis because of a risk of bleeding. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using decision analysis, we estimated the cost effectiveness of three VTE prophylaxis strategies-pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) and expectant management alone, serial Doppler ultrasound (SDU) screening, and prophylactic insertion of a vena cava filter (VCF) -- in trauma patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with severe injuries who were believed to have a contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis for up to two weeks because of a risk of major bleeding. Data on the probability of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and on the effectiveness of the prophylactic strategies, were taken from observational and randomized controlled studies. The probabilities of in-hospital death, ICU and hospital discharge rates, and resource use were taken from a population-based cohort of trauma patients with severe injuries (injury severity scores >12) admitted to the ICU of a regional trauma centre. The incidence of DVT at 12 weeks was similar for the PCD (14.9%) and SDU (15.0%) strategies, but higher for the VCF (25.7%) strategy. Conversely, the incidence of PE at 12 weeks was highest in the PCD strategy (2.9%), followed by the SDU (1.5%) and VCF (0.3%) strategies. Expected mortality and quality-adjusted life years were nearly identical for all three management strategies. Expected health care costs at 12 weeks were Can$55,831 for the PCD strategy, Can$55,334 for the SDU screening strategy, and Can$57,377 for the VCF strategy, with similar trends noted over a lifetime analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The attributable mortality due to PE in trauma patients with severe injuries is low relative to other causes of mortality. Prophylactic placement of VCF in patients at high risk of VTE who cannot receive pharmacological prophylaxis is expensive and associated with an increased risk of DVT.

Expected health care costs at 12 weeks were Can$55,831 for the PCD strategy, Can$55,334 for the SDU screening strategy, and Can$57,377 for the VCF strategy, with similar trends noted over a lifetime analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The attributable mortality due to PE in trauma patients with severe injuries is low relative to other causes of mortality. Prophylactic placement of VCF in patients at high risk of VTE who cannot receive pharmacological prophylaxis is expensive and associated with an increased risk of DVT.

5614,An economic evaluation of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis strategies in critically ill trauma patients at risk of bleeding,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill trauma patients with severe injuries are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding simultaneously. Currently, the optimal VTE prophylaxis strategy is unknown for trauma patients with a contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis because of a risk of bleeding. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using decision analysis, we estimated the cost effectiveness of three VTE prophylaxis strategies-pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) and expectant management alone, serial Doppler ultrasound (SDU) screening, and prophylactic insertion of a vena cava filter (VCF) -- in trauma patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with severe injuries who were believed to have a contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis for up to two weeks because of a risk of major bleeding. Data on the probability of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and on the effectiveness of the prophylactic strategies, were taken from observational and randomized controlled studies. The probabilities of in-hospital death, ICU and hospital discharge rates, and resource use were taken from a population-based cohort of trauma patients with severe injuries (injury severity scores >12) admitted to the ICU of a regional trauma centre. The incidence of DVT at 12 weeks was similar for the PCD (14.9%) and SDU (15.0%) strategies, but higher for the VCF (25.7%) strategy. Conversely, the incidence of PE at 12 weeks was highest in the PCD strategy (2.9%), followed by the SDU (1.5%) and VCF (0.3%) strategies. Expected mortality and quality-adjusted life years were nearly identical for all three management strategies. Expected health care costs at 12 weeks were Can$55,831 for the PCD strategy, Can$55,334 for the SDU screening strategy, and Can$57,377 for the VCF strategy, with similar trends noted over a lifetime analysis.

5615,Analysis of cost effectiveness of screening Danish men aged 65 for abdominal aortic aneurysm,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of screening men aged 65 for abdominal aortic aneurysm. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on a probabilistic, enhanced economic decision analytical model from screening to death. POPULATION AND SETTING: Hypothetical population of men aged 65 invited (or not invited) for ultrasound screening in the Danish healthcare system. DATA SOURCES: Published results from randomised trials and observational epidemiological studies retrieved from electronic bibliographic databases, and supplementary data obtained from the Danish Vascular Registry. DATA SYNTHESIS: A hybrid decision tree and Markov model was developed to simulate the short term and long term effects of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm compared with no systematic screening on clinical and cost effectiveness outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation were carried out. Results were presented in a cost effectiveness acceptability curve, an expected value of perfect information curve, and a curve showing the expected (net) number of avoided deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysm over time after the introduction of screening. The model was validated by calibrating base case health outcomes and expected activity levels against evidence from the recent Cochrane review of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. RESULTS: The estimated costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained discounted at 3% per year over a lifetime for costs and QALYs was pound43 485 (euro54,852; $71,160). At a willingness to pay threshold of pound30,000 the probability of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm being cost effective was less than 30%. One way sensitivity analyses showed the incremental cost effectiveness ratio varying from pound32,640 to pound66,001 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm does not seem to be cost effective.

5616,Economic Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 97-14: Multiple Versus Single Fraction Radiation Treatment of Patients With Bone Metastases,"INTRODUCTION:: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 97-14 concluded that a single fraction of radiation was as effective in relieving pain as multiple fractions in the treatment of patients with bone metastases. A statistically significant higher retreatment rate, however, was noted in patients undergoing a single fraction treatment. The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether multiple fraction treatment is cost-effective in treating patients with bone metastasis, by preventing further retreatment. METHODS AND MATERIAL:: A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 30 Gy in 10 fractions in comparison with 8 Gy in 1 fraction. Transition probabilities, cost, and utilities were obtained from the clinical trial. Costs and outcomes were not discounted because of the short time line for the study. RESULTS:: The expected mean cost and quality-adjusted survival in months for patients receiving 8 Gy in 1 fraction and 30 Gy in 10 fractions was $998 and 7.26 months and $2316 and 9.53 months, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $6973/quality-adjusted life year. The results were sensitive to the utility of the posttreatment state for both single and multiple fraction treatments. CONCLUSION:: Single fraction treatment was the less expensive treatment in the treatment of patients with bone metastasis treated on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 97-14.",2009-01-04814,19546803,Am J Clin Oncol,Andre Konski,2009,/,,No,19546803,"Andre Konski; Jennifer James; William Hartsell; Mark Leibenhaut; Nora Janjan; Walter Curran; Mack Roach; Deborah Watkins-Bruner; Jennifer James; William Hartsell; Mark H Leibenhaut; Nora Janjan; Walter Curran; Mack Roach; Deborah Watkins-Bruner; Economic Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 97-14: Multiple Versus Single Fraction Radiation Treatment of Patients With Bone Metastases, Am J Clin Oncol, 2009-Jun-19; ():1537-453X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,30Gy of radiation divided in 10 fractions vs. 8Gy radiation in single fraction,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,36 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,6975,United States,2008,8384.49
5617,Cost-effectiveness of total knee arthroplasty in the United States: patient risk and hospital volume,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) relieves pain and improves quality of life for persons with advanced knee osteoarthritis. However, to our knowledge, the cost-effectiveness of TKA and the influences of hospital volume and patient risk on TKA cost-effectiveness have not been investigated in the United States. METHODS: We developed a Markov, state-transition, computer simulation model and populated it with Medicare claims data and cost and outcomes data from national and multinational sources. We projected lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for different risk populations and varied TKA intervention and hospital volume. Cost-effectiveness of TKA was estimated across all patient risk and hospital volume permutations. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to determine various parameters' influences on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Overall, TKA increased QALE from 6.822 to 7.957 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Lifetime costs rose from $37,100 (no TKA) to $57 900 after TKA, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $18,300 per QALY. For high-risk patients, TKA increased QALE from 5.713 to 6.594 QALY, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,100 per QALY. At all risk levels, TKA was more costly and less effective in low-volume centers than in high-volume centers. Results were insensitive to variations of key input parameters within policy-relevant, clinically plausible ranges. The greatest variations were seen for the quality of life gain after TKA and the cost of TKA. CONCLUSIONS: Total knee arthroplasty appears to be cost-effective in the US Medicare-aged population, as currently practiced across all risk groups. Policy decisions should be made on the basis of available local options for TKA. However, when a high-volume hospital is available, TKAs performed in a high-volume hospital confer even greater value per dollar spent than TKAs performed in low-volume centers.",2009-01-04815,19546411,Arch Intern Med,Elena Losina,2009,169 / 12,1113-21; discussion 1121-2,No,19546411,"Elena Losina; Rochelle P Walensky; Courtenay L Kessler; Parastu S Emrani; William M Reichmann; Elizabeth A Wright; Holly L Holt; Daniel H Solomon; Edward Yelin; A David Paltiel; Jeffrey N Katz; Cost-effectiveness of total knee arthroplasty in the United States: patient risk and hospital volume, Arch Intern Med, 2009-Jun-22; 169(12):0003-9926; 1113-21; discussion 1121-2",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Total knee replacement vs. No surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,18300,United States,2006,23493.26
5618,Cost-effectiveness of micafungin as an alternative to fluconazole empiric treatment of suspected ICU-acquired candidemia among patients with sepsis: a model simulation,"INTRODUCTION: Recent epidemiologic literature indicates that candidal species resistant to azoles are becoming more prevalent in the face of increasing incidence of hospitalizations with candidemia. Echinocandins, a new class of antifungal agents, are effective against resistant candidal species. As delaying appropriate antifungal coverage leads to increased mortality, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 100 mg daily empiric micafungin (MIC) vs. 400 mg daily fluconazole (FLU) for suspected intensive care unit-acquired candidemia (ICU-AC) among septic patients. METHODS: We designed a decision model with inputs from the literature in a hypothetical 1000-patient cohort with suspected ICU-AC treated empirically with either MIC or FLU or no treatment accompanied by a watchful waiting strategy. We examined the differences in the number of survivors, acquisition costs of antifungals, and lifetime costs among survivors in the cohort under each scenario, and calculated cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). We conducted Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses to determine the stability of our estimates. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, assuming ICU-AC attributable mortality of 0.40 and a 52% relative risk reduction in mortality with appropriate timely therapy, compared with FLU (total deaths 31), treatment with MIC (total deaths 27) would result in four fewer deaths at an incremental cost/death averted of $61,446. Similarly, in reference case, incremental cost-effectiveness of MIC over FLU was $34,734 (95% confidence interval $26,312 to $49,209) per QALY. The estimates were most sensitive to the QALY adjustment factor and the risk of candidemia among septic patients.

METHODS: A model using patient-level data from a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (n = 824), combined with data from a claims database and published literature, was used to assess the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs associated with eszopiclone versus placebo in adults with primary insomnia. Quality of life data were collected during the trial via the SF-36, from which preference-based utility scores were derived using published algorithms. Medical and absenteeism costs, estimated via a retrospective analysis of a claims and absenteeism database, were assigned to patients based on the degree of severity of their insomnia, assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index collected in the clinical trial. Presenteeism costs (lost productivity while at work) were estimated from responses to the Work Limitation Questionnaire collected during the trial. Six-month gains in QALYs and costs for each treatment group were calculated to derive cost-effectiveness ratios. Uncertainty was addressed via univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, eszopiclone use resulted in a net gain of 0.0137 QALYs over placebo at an additional cost of $67, resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of slightly less than $5,000. When absenteeism and presenteeism costs were excluded, the cost-effectiveness ratio increased to approximately $33,000 per QALY gained, which is below the commonly used threshold of $50,000 used to define cost-effectiveness. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicate the results are generally robust.

OBJECTIVE: We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (starting in cycle 1 of chemotherapy) with pegfilgrastim versus filgrastim in women with early-stage breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy in the United States. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed from a health payer's perspective with a lifetime study horizon. The model considered direct medical costs and outcomes related to reduced FN and potential survival benefits due to reduced FN-related mortality and on-time receipt of full-dose chemotherapy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Pegfilgrastim was cost-saving and more effective (ie, dominant strategy) than 11-day filgrastim. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pegfilgrastim versus 6-day filgrastim was $12,904 per FN episode avoided. Adding the survival benefit due to reduced FN mortality and receipt of optimal chemotherapy dose yielded an ICER of $31,511 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and $14,415 per QALY gained, respectively. The most influential factors included inpatient FN case-fatality rate, cost of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim, baseline probability of FN, relative risk for FN between filgrastim and pegfil-grastim, and cost of administration of filgrastim.

5631,Results of a model analysis to estimate cost utility and value of information for intravenous immunoglobulin in Canadian adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) compared with oral prednisone as a treatment for Canadian adults with persistent chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). METHODS: The lifetime costs and effectiveness of IVIg and prednisone were estimated from the perspective of a publicly funded health care system in Canada, using a Markov model that was developed based on a systematic clinical and economic review and recommendations of clinical experts in Canada. Transition probabilities (ie, point estimates and 95% CIs) were estimated from the studies identified in a systematic literature review using a random-effect meta-analysis; point estimates were weighted-mean values from the meta-analysis. No published studies directly estimate the utility weight for patients with relapsed or refractory ITP; therefore, a value of 0.76 was used, based on the mean of the utilities for thrombocytopenia without major bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke. Costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were reported as year-2007 Can $. RESULTS: The incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of IVIg versus prednisone were Can $8080 and 0.0071, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Can $1.13 million/ QALY in the base-case analysis. The probability of IVIg being cost-effective was 0 if the maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP) value for an additional QALY was below Can $40,000. The probability that IVIg would be cost-effective was only 20%, even if the WTP increased to Can $100,000. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) were 0 if the WTP was less than Can $30,000. If WTP increased to Can $100,000, the EVPI was Can $1700, and the EVPPI was Can $1010 for utility weights of relapse/refractory states, Can $136 for initial response rates of the treatments, and Can $6 for first-year relapse rates for the treatments.

DESIGN: The Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes simulation model was used to simulate both direct and indirect effects of smoking cessation. All calculations were performed in 2003 Swedish prices. SETTING: Sweden in 2003. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: The modelled cohort consisted of 25% of adult smokers motivated to quit smoking (168,844 males and 208,737 females).

5634,"Cost-effectiveness of intensive lipid lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin, versus 10 mg of atorvastatin, for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Canada","BACKGROUND: The TNT study compared high dose atorvastatin (80 mg) versus moderate atorvastatin (10 mg) treatment in 10,001 patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD), over 4.9 years. Intensive lipid-lowering with atorvastatin (80 mg) reduced major cardiovascular events by 22%. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive lipid-lowering versus moderate lipid lowering treatment from the perspective of the Canadian Ministries of Health. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to predict cardiovascular (CV) events, costs, survival, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for CHD patients receiving 80 mg versus 10 mg of atorvastatin. Predictions were also made for 10- and 5-year horizons. Treatment-specific event risks were used until five years. Beyond year five, equivalent CV risks were assumed for all patients. Medical-care costs and post-event survival were estimated using Canadian data. Health utility scores were obtained from published studies. Benefits and costs were discounted 5% annually. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Treatment with atorvastatin (80 mg) over a lifetime horizon resulted in increased costs (Can$16,542 vs. Can$15,365), survival (10.12 vs. 10.03 life years), and QALYs (7.71 vs. 7.61) per patient compared with atorvastatin (10 mg), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness of Can$12,946 per life year gained and Can$11,969 per QALY. The incremental cost per QALY remained below Can$50,000 in 98.1% of 1000 simulations. Results were robust to variations in event hazard ratios, costs, health utility values, and discount rate.

5635,Cost effectiveness of pharmacogenetic testing for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 before irinotecan administration for metastatic colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND:: The objective of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of using a pharmacogenetic test for uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1A1*28 (UGT1A1*28) variant homozygosity before administering irinotecan to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS:: A decision-analytic model from the Medicare payer perspective followed hypothetical patients who were treated with combined 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan. Under usual care, patients received a full dose of irinotecan. With genetic testing, irinotecan dosage was reduced 25% in homozygotes with the UGT1A1*28 variant allele. Test performance, chemotherapy toxicity, and quality-of-life weights were derived from clinical literature and product labels, and costs were derived from 2007 Medicare fee schedules. Chemotherapy efficacy after dose reduction, adverse event risk, and other parameters were varied in 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The authors also calculated the value of investing in further studies of chemotherapy efficacy after homozygote dose reductions. RESULTS:: Pretreatment genetic testing costs less ($272 savings per patient tested) and yields slightly improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.1 quality-adjusted day per patient tested; approximately 2 quality-adjusted hours). Results depended on treatment efficacy but not adverse event risk assumptions. The results indicated that testing would avoid 84 cases of severe neutropenia, including 4.4 deaths. At a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the therapeutic efficacy of irinotecan in homozygotes after dose reduction had to be >/=98.4% of full-dose efficacy for genetic testing to remain preferred. Future studies to determine whether this efficacy level can be achieved have an economic value of $22 million. CONCLUSIONS:: The current results indicated that pharmacogenetic testing for UGT1A1*28 variant homozygosity may be cost effective, but only if irinotecan dose reduction in homozygotes does not reduce efficacy. Future studies to evaluate reduced-dose efficacy in homozygotes should be considered. Cancer 2009.

5636,A cost-utility analysis of nursing intervention via telephone follow-up for injured road users,"BACKGROUND: Traffic injuries can cause physical, psychological, and economical impairment, and affected individuals may also experience shortcomings in their post-accident care and treatment. In an earlier randomised controlled study of nursing intervention via telephone follow-up, self-ratings of health-related quality of life were generally higher in the intervention group than in the control group. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nursing intervention via telephone follow-up by examining costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). METHODS: A randomised controlled study was conducted between April 2003 and April 2005. Car occupants, cyclists, and pedestrians aged between 18 and 70 years and attending the Emergency Department of Umeå University Hospital in Sweden after an injury event in the traffic environment were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 288) or control group (n = 280). The intervention group received routine care supplemented by nursing via telephone follow-up during half a year, while the control group received routine care only. Data were collected from a mail survey using the non-disease-specific health-related quality of life instrument EQ5D, and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed including the costs of the intervention and the QALYs gained. RESULTS: Overall, the intervention group gained 2.60 QALYs (260 individuals with an average gain of 0.01 QALYs). The car occupants gained 1.54 QALYs (76 individuals, average of 0.02). Thus, the cost per QALY gained was 16 000 Swedish Crown (SEK) overall and 8 500 SEK for car occupants.

Data were collected from a mail survey using the non-disease-specific health-related quality of life instrument EQ5D, and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed including the costs of the intervention and the QALYs gained. RESULTS: Overall, the intervention group gained 2.60 QALYs (260 individuals with an average gain of 0.01 QALYs). The car occupants gained 1.54 QALYs (76 individuals, average of 0.02). Thus, the cost per QALY gained was 16 000 Swedish Crown (SEK) overall and 8 500 SEK for car occupants. CONCLUSION: Nursing intervention by telephone follow-up after an injury event, is a cost effective method giving improved QALY to a very low cost, especially for those with minor injuries.

5638,The cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate in the UK for the management of osteoporosis,"The cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate was compared to no treatment in UK women using the FRAX(R) algorithm for fracture risk assessment. At a willingness-to-pay of pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), strontium ranelate was generally cost-effective in women with prior fracture at the threshold of osteoporosis from an age of 65 years. INTRODUCTION: The objectives of the study were to estimate the cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate in the UK for the treatment of osteoporosis and to establish intervention thresholds for treatment using the FRAX(R) tool. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate was compared to no treatment in postmenopausal women with clinical risk factors for fracture using a lifetime simulation model based on Markov cohort methodology that incorporated the features of FRAX(R). RESULTS: At a threshold of pound30,000 per QALY, strontium ranelate was generally cost-effective in women from an age of 65 years with prior fracture at the threshold of osteoporosis (i.e., a T-score of -2.5 SD) and in women with a prior fracture (and no information on bone mineral density) from the age of 65 years. At a threshold of pound20,000, strontium ranelate became cost-effective at a 10-year fracture probability of 25.7% and at 16.9% with a threshold of pound30,000 for a QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Strontium ranelate is a cost-effective agent for the treatment of established osteoporosis in women over the age of 65 years. Cost-effective scenarios were also found for the prevention and treatment of fractures associated with osteoporosis, in younger women with additional clinical risk factors.",2009-01-04841,19513577,Osteoporos Int,F Borgström,2009,/,,No,19513577,"F Borgström; O Ström; J Coelho; H Johansson; A Oden; E McCloskey; J Kanis; The cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate in the UK for the management of osteoporosis, Osteoporos Int, 2009-Jun-10; ():0937-941X",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Strontium ranelate vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,61300,United Kingdom,2006,145065.64
5639,Primary angioplasty versus thrombolysis for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: an economic analysis of the National Infarct Angioplasty Project,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of primary angioplasty compared to thrombolysis for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Cost analysis of UK observational database, incorporated into decision analytic model. METHODS: We compared patients receiving treatment within a comprehensive angioplasty service to control patients receiving thrombolysis-based care. The treatment costs and delays to treatment of thrombolysis and angioplasty were estimated. These estimates were then incorporated into an existing model of cost effectiveness that synthesises evidence from 22 randomised trials to estimate health outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs from a health service perspective and outcomes measured as quality-adjusted. RESULTS: The mean cost of the initial treatment episode was pound3,509 for thrombolysis at control sites, pound5,176 for angioplasty in usual working hours at NIAP sites and an additional pound245 if undertaken out of hours . Angioplasty-based care had an incremental cost of pound4520 per QALY gained and 0.9 probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained. This probability was >0.95 if patients were directly admitted to the cardiac catheter laboratory, 0.75 if admitted via the emergency department or coronary care unit, and 0.38 if transferred to the angioplasty centre from another hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, primary angioplasty based care is highly likely to be cost-effective at an assumed threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained. It is more likely to be cost-effective if patients are admitted directly to the cardiac catheter laboratory than via other hospital departments, or if transferred from another hospital.",2009-01-04843,19508972,Heart,Allan J Wailoo,2009,/,,No,19508972,"Allan J Wailoo; Steve Goodacre; Fiona Sampson; Monica Hernandez; Christian Asseburg; Stephen John Palmer; Mark Sculpher; Keith Abrams; Mark A de Belder; Huon Gray; Primary angioplasty versus thrombolysis for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: an economic analysis of the National Infarct Angioplasty Project, Heart, 2009-Jun-08; ():1468-201X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Angioplasty vs. Thrombolysis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,5000,United Kingdom,2007,12494.8

Methods: The HEALTH model (Health Economic Assessment of Life with Teveten((R)) for Hypertension) is an object-oriented probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model. It combines a Framingham-based risk calculation with a systolic blood pressure approach to estimate the relative risk reduction of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events based on recent meta-analyses. In secondary prevention, an additional risk reduction is modeled for eprosartan according to the results of the MOSES study (""Morbidity and Mortality after Stroke-Eprosartan Compared to Nitrendipine for Secondary Prevention""). Costs and utilities were derived from published estimates considering European country-specific health-care payer perspectives. Results: Comparing eprosartan to enalapril in a primary prevention setting the mean costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were highest in Germany (Euro 24,036) followed by Belgium (Euro 17,863), the UK (Euro 16,364), Norway (Euro 13,834), Sweden (Euro 11,691) and Spain (Euro 7918).

Results: Comparing eprosartan to enalapril in a primary prevention setting the mean costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were highest in Germany (Euro 24,036) followed by Belgium (Euro 17,863), the UK (Euro 16,364), Norway (Euro 13,834), Sweden (Euro 11,691) and Spain (Euro 7918). In a secondary prevention setting (eprosartan vs. nitrendipine) the highest costs per QALY gained have been observed in Germany (Euro 9136) followed by the UK (Euro 6008), Norway (Euro 1695), Sweden (Euro 907), Spain (Euro -2054) and Belgium (Euro -5767). Conclusions: Considering a Euro 30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per QALY gained, eprosartan is cost-effective as compared to enalapril in primary prevention (patients >/=50 years old and a systolic blood pressure >/=160 mm Hg) and cost-effective as compared to nitrendipine in secondary prevention (all investigated patients).",2009-01-04844,19508663,Value Health,Björn Schwander,2009,/,,Yes,19508663,"Björn Schwander; Birgit Gradl; York Zöllner; Peter Lindgren; Hans-Christoph Diener; Stephan Lüders; Joachim Schrader; Fernando Antoñanzas Villar; Wolfgang Greiner; Bengt Jönsson; Birgit Gradl; York Zöllner; Peter Lindgren; Hans-Christoph Diener; Stephan Lüders; Joachim Schrader; Fernando Antoñanzas Villar; Wolfgang Greiner; Bengt Jönsson; Cost-Utility Analysis of Eprosartan Compared to Enalapril in Primary Prevention and Nitrendipine in Secondary Prevention in Europe-The HEALTH Model, Value Health, 2009-Mar-10; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eprosartan (ARB) (600 mg daily) vs. Nitrendipine (CCB) (20 mg daily)/amlodipine (5 mg daily),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,16981.13,Euro,2007,29061.6

5652,Cost-Effectiveness of Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Management of Multiple Sclerosis for the Medicare Population,"ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to best supportive care in the United States. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using a state transition model of disease natural history and the impact of DMTs for the representative Medicare beneficiary with MS. Costs and outcomes were evaluated from the health-care payer perspective using a 50-year time horizon. Natural history data were drawn from a longitudinal cohort study. The effectiveness of the DMTs was evaluated through a systematic review. Utility data were taken from a study of patients with clinically definite MS in Nova Scotia. Resource use and cost data were derived from the Sonya Slifka database and associated literature. Results: When based on placebo-controlled evidence, the marginal cost-effectiveness of interferon beta (IFNbeta) and glatiramer acetate compared to best supportive care is expected to be in excess of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. When evidence from head-to-head trials is incorporated into the model, the cost-effectiveness of 6 MIU IFNbeta-1a is expected to be considerably less favorable. Treatment discontinuation upon progression to Expanded Disability Status Scale 7.0 is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of all DMTs. Conclusions: Further research is required to examine the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these therapies.

5659,Cost-effectiveness of pregabalin versus venlafaxine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: findings from a Spanish perspective,"The objective of the present study was to describe a new model of the cost-effectiveness of treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and its application to a comparison of pregabalin versus venlafaxine extended-release (XR) from a Spanish healthcare perspective. Microsimulation techniques, including Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) score, number of weeks with minimal or no anxiety (HAM-A </= 9), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), were used to predict treatment outcomes for patients with moderate-to-severe GAD who would be treated with pregabalin vs venlafaxine XR. Expected levels of healthcare utilization and unit cost of care are derived from Spanish published sources. We express cost-effectiveness alternatively in terms of incremental cost per additional week with minimal or no anxiety, and incremental cost per QALY gained [in 2007 Euros (<euro>)]. Considering costs of drug treatment only, the incremental cost [mean (95% confidence interval)] of pregabalin (vs venlafaxine XR) would be <euro>96 (<euro>86, <euro>107) per additional week with minimal or no anxiety, and <euro>32,832 (<euro>29,656, <euro>36,308) per QALY gained. When other medical care costs are considered, cost-effectiveness ratios decline to <euro>70 (<euro>61, <euro>80) per additional week with no or minimal anxiety, and <euro>23,909 (<euro>20,820, <euro>27,006) per QALY gained.

5660,When is Pharmacogenetic Testing for Antidepressant Response Ready for the Clinic? A Cost-effectiveness Analysis Based on Data from the STAR(*)D Study,"The potential of personalized medicine to transform the treatment of mood disorders has been widely touted in psychiatry, but has not been quantified. We estimated the costs and benefits of a putative pharmacogenetic test for antidepressant response in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) from the societal perspective. Specifically, we performed cost-effectiveness analyses using state-transition probability models incorporating probabilities from the multicenter STAR(*)D effectiveness study of MDD. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared for sequential antidepressant trials, with or without guidance from a pharmacogenetic test for differential response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Likely SSRI responders received an SSRI, whereas likely nonresponders received the norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion. For a 40-year old with MDD, applying the pharmacogenetic test and using the non-SSRI bupropion for those at higher risk for nonresponse cost $93 520 per additional QALY compared with treating all patients with an SSRI first and switching sequentially in the case of nonremission.

5665,Cost Effectiveness of Ulcerative Colitis Surveillance in the Setting of 5-Aminosalicylates,"OBJECTIVES:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a feared complication of chronic ulcerative colitis (UC). Annual endoscopic surveillance is recommended for the detection of early neoplasia. 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) may prevent some UC-associated CRC. Therefore, in patients prescribed 5-ASAs for maintenance of remission, annual surveillance might be overly burdensome and inefficient. We aimed to determine the ideal frequency of surveillance in patients with UC maintained on 5-ASAs.METHODS:We performed systematic reviews of the literature, and created a Markov computer model simulating a cohort of 35-year-old men with chronic UC, followed until the age of 90 years. Twenty-two strategies were modeled: natural history (no 5-ASA or surveillance), surveillance without 5-ASA at intervals of 1-10 years, 5-ASA plus surveillance every 1-10 years, and 5-ASA alone. The primary outcome was the ideal interval of surveillance in the setting of 5-ASA maintenance, assuming a third-party payer was willing to pay $100,000 for each quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.RESULTS:In the natural history strategy, the CRC incidence was 30%. Without 5-ASA, annual surveillance was the ideal strategy, preventing 89% of CRC and costing $69,100 per QALY gained compared with surveillance every 2 years. 5-ASA alone prevented 49% of CRC. In the setting of 5-ASA, surveillance every 3 years was ideal, preventing 87% of CRC. 5-ASA with surveillance every 2 years cost an additional $147,500 per QALY gained, and 5-ASA with annual surveillance cost nearly $1 million additional per QALY gained compared with every 2 years. In Monte Carlo simulations, surveillance every 2 years or less often was ideal in 95% of simulations.CONCLUSIONS:If 5-ASA is efficacious chemoprevention for UC-associated CRC, endoscopic surveillance might be safely performed every 2 years or less often. Such practice could decrease burdens to patients and on endoscopic resources with a minimal decrease in quality-adjusted length of life, because 5-ASA with annual surveillance may cost nearly $1 million per additional QALY gained.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 2 June 2009; doi:10.1038/ajg.2009.264.",2009-01-04866,19491824,Am J Gastroenterol,Joel H Rubenstein,2009,/,,No,19491824,"Joel H Rubenstein; Akbar K Waljee; Joanne M Jeter; Fernando S Velayos; Uri Ladabaum; Peter D R Higgins; Akbar K Waljee; Joanne M Jeter; Fernando S Velayos; Uri Ladabaum; Peter D R Higgins; Cost Effectiveness of Ulcerative Colitis Surveillance in the Setting of 5-Aminosalicylates, Am J Gastroenterol, 2009-Jun-02; ():0002-9270",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surveillance colonoscopy every 4 years vs. No therapy,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,55 Years,3.00,3.00,-5882.35,United States,2007,-7342.54

Annual endoscopic surveillance is recommended for the detection of early neoplasia. 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) may prevent some UC-associated CRC. Therefore, in patients prescribed 5-ASAs for maintenance of remission, annual surveillance might be overly burdensome and inefficient. We aimed to determine the ideal frequency of surveillance in patients with UC maintained on 5-ASAs.METHODS:We performed systematic reviews of the literature, and created a Markov computer model simulating a cohort of 35-year-old men with chronic UC, followed until the age of 90 years. Twenty-two strategies were modeled: natural history (no 5-ASA or surveillance), surveillance without 5-ASA at intervals of 1-10 years, 5-ASA plus surveillance every 1-10 years, and 5-ASA alone. The primary outcome was the ideal interval of surveillance in the setting of 5-ASA maintenance, assuming a third-party payer was willing to pay $100,000 for each quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.RESULTS:In the natural history strategy, the CRC incidence was 30%. Without 5-ASA, annual surveillance was the ideal strategy, preventing 89% of CRC and costing $69,100 per QALY gained compared with surveillance every 2 years. 5-ASA alone prevented 49% of CRC. In the setting of 5-ASA, surveillance every 3 years was ideal, preventing 87% of CRC. 5-ASA with surveillance every 2 years cost an additional $147,500 per QALY gained, and 5-ASA with annual surveillance cost nearly $1 million additional per QALY gained compared with every 2 years. In Monte Carlo simulations, surveillance every 2 years or less often was ideal in 95% of simulations.CONCLUSIONS:If 5-ASA is efficacious chemoprevention for UC-associated CRC, endoscopic surveillance might be safely performed every 2 years or less often.

5673,Cost-effectiveness of varenicline compared with nicotine patches for smoking cessation--results from four European countries,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation in four European countries (Belgium, France, Sweden and the UK). METHODS: Markov simulations, using the Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes (BENESCO) model, were performed. We simulated the incidence of four smoking-related morbidities: lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease and stroke. The model computes quality-adjusted life-years gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Incremental cost-utility ratios were calculated, adopting a lifetime perspective. Efficacy data were obtained from a randomized open-label trial: Week 52 continuous abstinence rates were 26.1% for varenicline and 20.3% for NRT. RESULTS: The analyses imply that for countries analysed, smoking cessation using varenicline versus NRT was associated with reduced smoking-related morbidity and mortality. The number of morbidities avoided, per 1000 smokers attempting to quit, ranged from 9.7 in Belgium to 6.5 in the UK. The number of quality-adjusted life-years gained, per 1000 smokers, was 23 (Belgium); 19.5 (France); 29.9 (Sweden); and 23.7 (UK). In all base-case simulations (except France), varenicline dominated (more effective and cost saving) NRT regarding costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained; for France the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 2803.

METHODS: We used and adapted a pre-existent model in which two cohorts of patients received palivizumab or no prophylaxis. The patients were followed for their expected lifetimes. The economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. We considered Life-Years Gained (LYGs), Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and direct medical costs (pharmacological treatment, hospitalization, recurrences for wheezing, etc.). LYGs and QALYs were based on the results of a double blind cohort study with prospective follow-up and direct medical costs were based on Italian treatment patterns. Benefits and costs were discounted at 3%. Costs were assessed in 2007 Euros. Sensitivity and threshold analysis on key clinical and economic parameters were performed. RESULT: For the two cohorts, the expected life-years (per patient) with palivizumab versus no prophylaxis were 29.842 and 29.754 years, respectively. Quality-adjusted life years (per patient) with palivizumab were 29.202, and for no prophylaxis were 29.043. The expected cost (per patient) was euro 6,244.20 with palivizumab and euro 4,867.70 with no prophylaxis. We calculated for palivizumab versus no prophylaxis the incremental cost per LYG and per QALY gained. It was euro 15,568.65 and euro 8,676.74, respectively.

5685,The Cost-Utility of Sequential Adjuvant Trastuzumab in Women with Her2/Neu-Positive Breast Cancer: An Analysis Based On Updated Results from the HERA Trial,"ABSTRACT Background: The efficacy of sequential adjuvant trastuzumab (aTZ) after chemotherapy in women with early-stage human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2/neu)-positive breast cancer reported by the updated Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial appears less favorable than originally reported. Based on these updated results, we estimated the cost-utility (CU) of sequential aTZ relative to chemotherapy alone in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Methods: A Markov model estimated incremental costs and outcomes of 12 months of aTZ after adjuvant chemotherapy in women with HER2/neu-positive breast cancer over a 25-year horizon. The model incorporated four broad health states (disease-free, local recurrence [LCR], distant recurrence [DCR], death), stratified with or without symptomatic cardiotoxicity. Baseline event rates and 3-year relative risk (RR = 0.75) were derived from the HERA trial. As the duration of the benefit remains uncertain, the analysis considered 5-year and 3-year duration of benefit in two scenarios. Costs and utility weights were from the literature. The analysis took a direct payer perspective, with costs reported in 2007 Canadian dollars. Costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% annually. Results: The mean CU of sequential aTZ at a 25-year horizon was $72,292 per QALY gained in the 5-year scenario and $127,862 per QALY gained in the 3-year scenario. Results were particularly sensitive to the magnitude and duration of carryover benefit. Conclusions: The CU of sequential aTZ is primarily dependent on the magnitude and duration of benefit. Further clinical research is required to establish the optimum sequence and duration of aTZ therapy and clarify the magnitude and duration of treatment benefit.",2009-01-04874,19490562,Value Health,Chris Skedgel,2009,/,,Yes,19490562,"Chris Skedgel; Daniel Rayson; Tallal Younis; The Cost-Utility of Sequential Adjuvant Trastuzumab in Women with Her2/Neu-Positive Breast Cancer: An Analysis Based On Updated Results from the HERA Trial, Value Health, 2009-Mar-10; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Adjuvant Trastuzumab treatment (5-year) after chemotherapy treatment for breast-cancer vs. Usual Care, observation alone after chemotherapy",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,70292,Canada,2007,82121.06
5686,Age-Based Programs for Vaccination against HPV,"ABSTRACT Background: The risk of infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) increases with age. Answering the question of which age groups are appropriate to target for catch-up vaccination with the newly licensed quadrivalent HPV vaccine (types 6/11/16/18) will be important for developing vaccine policy recommendations. Objectives: To assess the value of varying female HPV vaccination strategies by specific age groups of a catch-up program in the United States. Methods: The authors used previously published mathematical population dynamic model and cost-utility analysis to evaluate the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative quadrivalent HPV (6/11/16/18) vaccination strategies. The model simulates heterosexual transmission of HPV infection and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer, and external genital warts in an age-structured population stratified by sex and sexual activity groups. The cost-utility analysis estimates the cost of vaccination, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV diseases, and quality-adjusted survival. Results: Compared with the current screening practices, vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 24 years was the most effective strategy, reducing the number of HPV6/11/16/18-related genital warts, CIN grades 2 and 3, and cervical cancer cases among women in the next 25 years by 3,049,285, 1,399,935, and 30,021; respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy when compared with vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 19 years was $10,986 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

5687,Economic Evaluation of Atorvastatin for Prevention of Recurrent Stroke Based on the SPARCL Trial,"ABSTRACT Objectives: This study evaluated the economic implications of results obtained by the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial. Methods: To enable long-term projection of the trial results, a discrete event simulation of the course of clinical care after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was developed. It generates pairs of identical patients; both receive usual care, one receives atorvastatin in addition. Their clinical course is simulated based on their risk of stroke, cardiovascular events, and case fatality rates taken from SPARCL, life expectancy from Saskatchewan Health data, and utility weights from literature. Costs, from a US health-care payer perspective in 2005 US dollars, were estimated for a within-trial 5-year period; survival and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were extrapolated over a patient's lifetime; all discounted at 3%/year. Results: The prevention of stroke, coronary, and other cardiovascular events expected with atorvastatin translates to mean gains of 0.155 life-years gained and 0.172 QALYs per patient over their lifetime. Reducing associated medical costs ($8405 vs. $11,237) but increasing drug costs ($13,984 vs. $8752) results in net $2400/patient, or $13,916/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates no simulations yield ratios above $50,000/QALY.

Methods and Results: We developed a Markov model based on clinical outcome data from a meta-analysis including 17 randomized controlled trials comparing drug-eluting versus BMS with a minimum follow-up of 1 (n = 8221) and a maximum follow-up of 3 years (n = 4105) in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. Costs were obtained as reimbursement rates for diagnosis related groups from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. All costs and effects were discounted at 3% annually. All costs are reported in US dollars of the financial year 2007. The incremental effects are 0.002 (95% confidence interval -0.039 to 0.041) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the sirolimus- and -0.001 (-0.040 to 0.038) QALYs for the paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES).

Methods: A static equilibrium model was developed to evaluate health benefits and budget impact of vaccinating five successive birth cohorts with PRV at $50 per dose and 85% coverage (three doses). Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the societal perspective in year 5 of the program, with future health benefits discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: By the age of 5 years, one in five children will have sought medical advice for rotavirus gastroenteritis and one in 43 will have been hospitalized. In 2009, we estimate 1506 hospitalizations (476 per 100,000; 95% confidence interval 451, 502), 3086 Emergency Department (ED) presentations not requiring hospitalization, plus 10,120 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis managed solely in primary care. The annual societal cost is $7.07 million, including 41% from hospitalization and 25% from caregiver income loss. Health benefits will increase and the cost of illness will decline by 78% in year 5 as successive birth cohorts are immunized. In the fifth year, 1191 hospitalizations, 2442 ED treated cases, 9762 primary care consultations, and 0.8 deaths will be averted. It requires six vaccinated children to avoid one primary care consultation, 49 to avert one hospitalization, and 73,357 to prevent one death. The incremental cost is $2.99 million and the break-even price per vaccine dose is $32.39 at 2006 prices. The cost is $2509 to avert one hospitalization and $305 to prevent one case seeking health-care assistance. The cost per life-year gained in year 5 is $143,097 and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is $46,092 (US$26,774). The cost per QALY is sensitive to incidence rates, vaccine price and efficacy, loss of quality of life by the child, case fatality, and caregiver income loss.

5693,Clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of tailoring chronic hepatitis C treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin to HCV genotype and early viral response: a decision analysis based on german guidelines,"Recently developed German guidelines for antiviral treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C recommend basing drug dosage, intended treatment duration and early stopping rules on the genotype of the hepatitis C virus and early viral responses to treatment. To evaluate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different antiviral treatment strategies including the German guidelines, for chronic hepatitis C. A validated lifetime Markov model was used to project life expectancy, QALYs and lifetime costs for the following strategies: (i) no antiviral therapy (NoAVT); (ii) interferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (IFN + R); (iii) peginterferon-alpha-2b plus weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks (PEG + R); (iv) peginterferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin according to German guidelines with genotype-dependent treatment duration, dosage and 12-week viral response evaluation (GUIDE). Clinical and resource utilization data were derived from a clinical trial, the published literature and a survey of German hepatologists. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated adopting the German societal perspective. Costs (in euro, year 2005 values) and health outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Compared with NoAVT, PEG + R increased undiscounted life expectancy by 5.0 life-years (5.2 QALYs) and GUIDE increased undiscounted life expectancy by 4.9 years (5.1 QALYs).

To evaluate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different antiviral treatment strategies including the German guidelines, for chronic hepatitis C. A validated lifetime Markov model was used to project life expectancy, QALYs and lifetime costs for the following strategies: (i) no antiviral therapy (NoAVT); (ii) interferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (IFN + R); (iii) peginterferon-alpha-2b plus weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks (PEG + R); (iv) peginterferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin according to German guidelines with genotype-dependent treatment duration, dosage and 12-week viral response evaluation (GUIDE). Clinical and resource utilization data were derived from a clinical trial, the published literature and a survey of German hepatologists. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated adopting the German societal perspective. Costs (in euro, year 2005 values) and health outcomes were discounted at 3% annually.

5696,Cost effectiveness of drug-eluting stents in belgian practice: healthcare payer perspective,"There has been a steep increase in the number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed for coronary heart disease since their introduction about 30 years ago. Recently, the use of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with the original bare metal stents (BMS) has increased in many countries. To assess the cost effectiveness of DES versus BMS in a real-world setting from the Belgian healthcare payer perspective. We developed a decision analysis model to estimate incremental costs (year 2004 or 2007 values [depending on the underlying variable]) and effectiveness. Incremental effectiveness was calculated by combining relative benefits from published meta-analyses with real-world observations from a Belgian registry. Probabilistic modelling and sensitivity analyses were performed. The model had a 1-year time horizon. Sixteen sub groups were created based on the following characteristics: initial stent type, diabetic status, complex lesion and multi-vessel disease. Scenario analyses were performed for the influence on reinterventions and the duration of clopidogrel use. In each analysis, 1000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The incremental costs for switching from BMS to DES are substantial (approximately euro1000), while the benefits, expressed as QALYs, are extremely small (on average <0.001 QALYs gained). This led to very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: over euro860 000 per QALY gained in all subgroups and scenario analyses.
