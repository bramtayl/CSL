10401,Establishing the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion in stable angina: a decision-analytic model,"In the setting of chronic stable angina, successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusions (CTO) has been shown to produce significant symptom improvement with some evidence for survival benefit. However, the economic basis for this procedure has not been established compared with optimal medical treatment (OMT) of chronic stable angina.The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of CTO-PCI in chronic stable angina using a Markov model.The transition probabilities, utilities and costs related to CTO-PCI and OMT used to inform the model were derived from literature and our experience. Implications with respect to cost and quality of life were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were based on factors noted to influence model outcome.In the reference case, mean age 60 years, rate of successful CTO-PCI 67.9%, and mean transition probabilities, utilities and costs as defined by literature and clinical experience, the strategy of CTO-PCI incurred higher costs relative to OMT (US$31 512 vs US$27 805), but also accumulated greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (2.38 vs 1.99), yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$9505 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed the utility of OMT and utilities postsuccessful and postunsuccessful CTO-PCI to be the most influential drivers of outcome. Procedural success held limited influence over model outcome at particular utility threshold values.On the basis of the supporting evidence, this decision-analytic model suggests that CTO-PCI is cost-effective in a patient population with severe symptoms. Quality-of-life metrics should be employed in future appropriateness criteria developed for CTO-PCI.",2012-01-09905,23038791,Heart,Hemal Gada,2012,98 / 24,1790-7,No,23038791,"Hemal Gada; Patrick L Whitlow; Thomas H Marwick; Establishing the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion in stable angina: a decision-analytic model, Heart, ; 98(24):1468-201X; 1790-7",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusions (CTO) (CTO-PCI) vs. Optimal medical treatment (OMT),Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,9505,United States,2012,10714.56
10402,A model of the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in comparison with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer,"To determine the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) compared with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for men with localised prostate cancer from a UK National Health Service perspective.A discrete event simulation model was developed to simulate the progress of patients through advancing disease states until death from prostate cancer or other causes. Clinical effectiveness data for IMRT and 3DCRT were derived from a systematic review. Four scenarios were modelled based on different clinical studies. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken and the incremental cost per quality adjusted life years (ICER) calculated.In scenarios where estimated survival was greater for IMRT than 3DCRT, IMRT was clearly cost-effective (ICER <?20 000). For scenarios where only a difference in late gastrointestinal toxicity was assumed, the ICER was highly sensitive to uncertain model parameters, including the magnitude of the difference, the duration of gastrointestinal toxicity and the cost difference between treatments. For the most likely scenario, a 15% difference in late gastrointestinal toxicity, the ICER was ?35 000, with a 20% probability that it is cost-effective at a maximum threshold of ?20 000 and a 48% probability at a threshold of ?30 000.If IMRT can be used to prolong survival, it is very cost-effective.

10414,Cost-effectiveness analysis of primary arthroscopic stabilization versus nonoperative treatment for first-time anterior glenohumeral dislocations,"The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of initial observation versus surgery for first-time anterior shoulder dislocation.The clinical scenario of first-time anterior glenohumeral dislocation was simulated using a Markov model (where variables change over time depending on previous states). Nonoperative outcomes include success (no recurrence) and recurrence; surgical outcomes include success, recurrence, and complications of infection or stiffness. Probabilities for outcomes were determined from published literature. Costs were tabulated from Medicare Current Procedural Terminology data, as well as hospital and office billing records. We performed microsimulation and probabilistic sensitivity analysis running 6 models for 1,000 patients over a period of 15 years. The 6 models tested were male versus female patients aged 15 years versus 25 years versus 35 years.Primary surgery was less costly and more effective for 15-year-old boys, 15-year-old girls, and 25-year-old men. For the remaining scenarios (25-year-old women and 35-year-old men and women), primary surgery was also more effective but was more costly. However, for these scenarios, primary surgery was still very cost-effective (cost per quality-adjusted life-year, <$25,000). After 1 recurrence, surgery was less costly and more effective for all scenarios.Primary arthroscopic stabilization is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for first-time anterior shoulder dislocations in the cohorts studied.

10415,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pancreatin minimicrospheres in patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is the most common cause of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). Management of PEI due to CP is achieved through lifelong treatment with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). To the authors' knowledge, no cost-effectiveness analysis on the benefit of PERT in CP patients with PEI has been performed to date. The objective of this analysis was to examine the cost-effectiveness of Creon (pancreatin minimicrospheres [MMS]), one of the main PERTs available in Poland, in treating patients with CP-related PEI.The cost-effectiveness of pancreatin MMS in the treatment of patients with CP-related PEI vs no PERT treatment was estimated using a decision analysis based on clinical data from relevant studies. The model horizon was 20 years. Main outcomes included the percentage of patients with controlled PEI, survival, total medical costs, number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). All costs were analysed from the Polish payer perspective.The model included clinical data from 176 patients treated in five pancreatin MMS randomized trials. Treatment with pancreatin MMS resulted in a considerably higher proportion of patients with controlled PEI compared to those not treated with any PERT. Over a horizon of 20 years, the total treatment cost and the ICER for pancreatin MMS was ?8223 and ?6312 per QALY, respectively.Important limitations include the lack of long-term and comparative clinical data available. The use of 'no PERT treatment' as a comparator against pancreatin MMS treatment may not accurately reflect current practice in Poland.Treatment of CP-related PEI with pancreatin MMS is cost-effective from a Polish payer perspective, with an ICER below the accepted 'willingness to pay' threshold of 3-times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

We examined the health and economic impacts of quadrivalent HPV vaccination in Brazil.We adapted a previously developed transmission dynamic model to estimate the effectiveness of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (CIN2/3), CIN1, and genital warts. We evaluated following vaccination strategies: routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls and routine vaccination in combination with a catch-up vaccination of 12 to 26-year-old women.The model projected that the vaccination would reduce the incidence rates of HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancer, CIN2/3, CIN1, and female genital warts by 94% to 98% at year 100. Routine vaccination in combination with a catch-up vaccination could prevent approximately 163,000 cases of cervical cancer, 48,000 deaths from cervical cancer, 2.3 million cases of CIN2/3, and 11.4 million genital warts in the next 50 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for female vaccination strategies ranged from R$350 to R$720 (US$219 to US$450) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.Our study demonstrates that quadrivalent HPV female vaccination can be a cost-effective public health intervention that can substantially reduce the burden of cervical diseases and genital warts in Brazil.",2012-01-09918,23046886,BMC Infect Dis,Kosuke Kawai,2012,12 / 1,250,No,23046886,"Kosuke Kawai; Gabriela Tannus Branco de Araujo; Marcelo Fonseca; Matthew Pillsbury; Puneet K Singhal; Estimated health and economic impact of quadrivalent HPV (types 6/11/16/18) vaccination in Brazil using a transmission dynamic model, BMC Infect Dis, ; 12(1):1471-2334; 250",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine vaccination of 12 year-old girls combined with a catch-up vaccination of 12 to 26 year olds vs. Routine vaccination of 12 year-old girls,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,100 Years,3.00,3.00,450,United States,2011,517.76

10419,Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial,"ABSTRACT:Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score = 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were ?4795 in the PST group and ?6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.Nederlands Trial Register ISRCTN51021015.",2012-01-09920,23052105,BMC Fam Pract,Judith E Bosmans,2012,13 /,98,No,23052105,"Judith E Bosmans; Bettine Schreuders; Harm W J van Marwijk; Jan H Smit; Patricia van Oppen; Maurits W van Tulder; Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial, BMC Fam Pract, ; 13():1471-2296; 98",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Problem-solving treatment (PST) by mental health nurses (brief treatment focused on practical skill building, education & managing depressive symptoms) vs. Usual care by general practitioner",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,9 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-68733.34,Euro,2012,-99629.53
10420,Cost-effectiveness analysis of intranasal live attenuated vaccine (LAIV) versus injectable inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) for Canadian children and adolescents,"Influenza affects all age groups and is common in children. Between 15% and 42% of preschool- and school-aged children experience influenza each season. Recently, intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine, trivalent (LAIV) has been approved in Canada.The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of LAIV compared with that of the injectable inactivated influenza vaccine, trivalent (TIV) in Canadian children and adolescents from both a payer (eg. Ministry of Health) perspective and a societal perspective.A cost-effectiveness model comparing LAIV and TIV in children aged 24-59 months old was supplemented by primary (ie, a survey of 144 Canadian physicians) and secondary (eg, literature) data to model children aged 2-17 years old. Parameter uncertainty was addressed through univariate and probability analyses.Although LAIV increased vaccination costs when compared to TIV, LAIV reduced the number of influenza cases and lowered the number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, outpatient visits, and parents' days lost from work. The estimated offsets in direct and societal costs saved were CAD$4.20 and CAD$35.34, respectively, per vaccinated child aged 2-17 years old. When costs and outcomes were considered, LAIV when compared to TIV, was the dominant strategy. At a willingness to pay of CAD$50,000 per quality adjusted life year gained, or CAD$100,000 per quality adjusted life year gained, the probabilistic results indicated that the probability of LAIV being cost-effective was almost 1.LAIV reduces the burden of influenza in children and adolescents.

10426,Cost effectiveness of different treatment strategies in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in china,"To analyse the cost-effectiveness of traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) compared to biological therapies from the perspective of Chinese society.A mathematical model was developed by incorporating the clinical trial data and Chinese unit costs and treatment sequences from a lifetime perspective. Hypothetical cohorts with moderate to severe RA were simulated. The primary outcome measure-quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)-was derived from disease severity (HAQ scores). Primary analysis included drug costs, monitoring costs, and other costs. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Treatment sequences that included TNF antagonists and rituximab produced a greater number of QALYs than tDMARDs alone or TNF antagonists plus DMARDs. In comparison with tDMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab without rituximab were $77,357.7, $26,562.4 and $57,838.4 per QALY and $66,422.9, $28,780.6 and $50,937.6 per QALY, for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab with rituximab. No biotherapy was cost-effective under the willingness to pay threshold when the threshold was 3 times the per capita GDP of China.

10427,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"Apixaban was shown to be superior to adjusted-dose warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and at least one additional risk factor for stroke, and associated with reduced rates of hemorrhage. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of using apixaban for stroke prevention.Based on the results from the Apixaban Versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial and other published studies, we constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin from the Medicare perspective. The base-case analysis assumed a cohort of 65-year-old patients with a CHADS(2) score of 2.1 and no contraindication to oral anticoagulation. We utilized a 2-week cycle length and a lifetime time horizon. Outcome measures included costs in 2012 US$, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life years saved and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Under base case conditions, quality adjusted life expectancy was 10.69 and 11.16 years for warfarin and apixaban, respectively. Total costs were $94,941 for warfarin and $86,007 for apixaban, demonstrating apixaban to be a dominant economic strategy. Upon one-way sensitivity analysis, these results were sensitive to variability in the drug cost of apixaban and various intracranial hemorrhage related variables. In Monte Carlo simulation, apixaban was a dominant strategy in 57% of 10,000 simulations and cost-effective in 98% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY.In patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke and a baseline risk of ICH risk of about 0.8%, treatment with apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to warfarin.",2012-01-09926,23056642,PLoS One,Soyon Lee,2012,7 / 10,e47473,No,23056642,"Soyon Lee; Rachel Mullin; Jon Blazawski; Craig I Coleman; Cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, PLoS One , ; 7(10):1932-6203; e47473",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban (5 mg twice daily) vs. Adjusted-dose warfarin with target INR of 2 to 3,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-7744.12,United States,2012,-8729.6
10428,Modeling the impact of the difference in cross-protection data between a human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine and a human papillomavirus (HPV)-6/11/16/18 vaccine in Canada,"In Canada, two vaccines that have demonstrated high efficacy against infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) types -16 and -18 are available. The HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine provides protection against genital warts (GW) while the HPV-16/18 vaccine may provide better protection against other oncogenic HPV types. In this analysis, the estimated clinical and economic benefit of each of these vaccines was compared in the Canadian setting.A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection among women, cervical cancer (CC) and GW was used to estimate the impact of vaccinating a cohort of 100,000 12-year-old females on lifetime outcomes and healthcare system costs (no indirect benefit in males included). A budget impact model was used to estimate the impact of each vaccine by province.In the base case, vaccination with the HPV-16/18 vaccine was predicted to prevent 48 additional CC cases, and 16 additional CC deaths, while vaccination with the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine was predicted to prevent 6,933 additional GW cases. Vaccination with the HPV-16/18 vaccine was estimated to save 1 additional discounted quality adjusted life year (QALY) at an overall lower lifetime cost to the healthcare system compared to the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (assuming vaccine price parity). In sensitivity analyses, the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine was associated with greater QALYs saved when the cross-protection efficacy of the HPV-16/18 vaccine was reduced, or the burden of GW due to HPV-6/11 was increased. In most scenarios with price parity, the lifetime healthcare cost of the strategy with the HPV-16/18 vaccine was predicted to be lower than the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the HPV-16/18 vaccine provided more QALY benefit than the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine in 49.2% of scenarios, with lower relative lifetime costs in 83.5% of scenarios.Overall, the predicted lifetime healthcare costs and QALYs saved by implementing each of the vaccines are similar. Vaccination with the HPV-16/18 vaccine is expected to be associated with reduced CC disease morbidity and mortality compared to vaccination with the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. Differences in these outcomes depend on the extent of cervical disease prevented by cross-protection and the burden of GW caused by HPV-6/11.",2012-01-09930,23061913,BMC Public Health,Michele Kohli,2012,12 /,872,No,23061913,"Michele Kohli; Donna Lawrence; Jennifer Haig; Andrea Anonychuk; Nadia Demarteau; Modeling the impact of the difference in cross-protection data between a human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine and a human papillomavirus (HPV)-6/11/16/18 vaccine in Canada, BMC Public Health, ; 12():1471-2458; 872",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine plus screening vs. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-6/11/16/18 vaccine plus screening,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-683107,Canada,2006,-773526.11
10429,Cost-effectiveness of a European preventive cardiology programme in primary care: a Markov modelling approach,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the longer-term cost-effectiveness of a nurse-coordinated preventive cardiology programme for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to routine practice from a health service perspective. DESIGN: A matched, paired cluster-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Six pairs of general practices in six countries. PARTICIPANTS: 1019 patients were randomised to the EUROACTION intervention programme and 1005 patients to usual care (UC) and who completed the 1-year follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence on health outcomes and costs was based on patient-level data from the study, which had a 1-year follow-up period. Future risk of CVD events was modelled, using published risk models based on patient characteristics. An individual-level Markov model for each patient was used to extrapolate beyond the end of the trial, which was populated with data from published sources. We used an 11-year time horizon and investigated the impact on the cost-effectiveness of varying the duration of the effect of the intervention beyond the end of the trial. Results are expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: Unadjusted results found the intervention to be more costly and also more effective than UC. However, after adjusting for differences in age, gender, country and baseline risk factors, the intervention was dominated by UC, but this analysis was not able to take into account the lifestyle changes in terms of diet and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Although the EUROACTION study achieved healthier lifestyle changes and improvements in management of blood pressure and lipids for patients at high risk of CVD, compared to UC, it was not possible to show, using available risk equations which do not incorporate diet and physical activity, that the intervention reduced longer-term cardiovascular risk cost-effectively. Whether or not an intervention such as that offered by EUROACTION is cost-effective requires a longer-term trial with major cardiovascular events as the outcome.

10432,Which long-acting bronchodilator is most cost-effective for the treatment of COPD?,"The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tiotropium versus salmeterol to inform decision making within the Dutch healthcare setting.A previously published, validated COPD progression model was updated with new exacerbation data and adapted to the Dutch setting by including Dutch estimates of healthcare use for COPD maintenance treatment and Dutch unit costs. Exacerbation data from the POET-COPD trial were combined with evidence from earlier tiotropium studies using Bayesian meta-analysis. The model-based analysis was performed using a one- and five-year time horizon. Main health outcomes were the number of exacerbations and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).One-year costs per patient from the healthcare perspective were v1370 for tiotropium and v1359 for salmeterol; a difference of v11 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): -198-212). The annual number of exacerbations was 0.068 (-0.005-0.140) lower in the tiotropium group. The number of QALYs in the tiotropium group was 0.011 (-0.019-0.049) higher, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of v1015 per QALY.

10437,Future impact of various interventions on the burden of COPD in canada: a dynamic population model,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a growing economic burden worldwide. Smoking cessation is thought to be the single most effective way of reducing the economic burden of COPD. The impact of other strategies such as interventions that predict risk of disease, reduce progression of disease, or reduce exacerbations has not been systematically studied.We estimated the economic and clinical burden of COPD over the next 25 years in Canada and the impact of three potential interventions (screening test for predisposition to COPD, new drugs to avoid progression into more severe disease stages, and predictive test for exacerbations) on COPD burden.Using a dynamic simulation model, we projected the total burden of COPD (cost, morbidity, and mortality) from 2011 to 2035 using the population of Canada as a case study.

10440,Cost effectiveness of oromucosal cannabis-based medicine (sativex?) for spasticity in multiple sclerosis,"Spasticity is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is a major contributor to disability. Sativex?, an oromucosal spray containing cannabis-based medicinal products, has been found to be effective in reducing spasticity symptoms.Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of Sativex? plus oral anti-spasticity medicines compared with the current standard treatment for moderate or severe spasticity in MS in the UK.A Markov model was used to assess the costs and benefits of Sativex? plus oral anti-spasticity medicines or current standard treatment based on their effects on the quality of life of patients. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of costs per additional QALY gained over 5 years of treatment. One-way, multi-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties on the findings. Results: In the base case, Sativex? plus oral anti-spasticity medicines resulted in incremental costs of ?7600 and a QALY gain of 0.15 per person over 5 years (ICER?=??49?300 per QALY).[year 2009 data for costs]. Findings were sensitive to the costs of Sativex? (price and dose) and differences in utilities between responders and non-responders.Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?30?000 per QALY, Sativex? appears unlikely to be considered cost effective by UK funders of healthcare for spasticity in MS.

10441,Economic and humanistic consequences of preventable bladder tumor recurrences in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer cases,"Perioperative intravesical chemotherapy following transurethral resection of bladder tumor has been underused despite level 1 evidence supporting its performance. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the economic and humanistic consequences associated with preventable recurrences in patients initially diagnosed with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.Using population based estimates of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer incidence, a 2-year model was developed to estimate the number of preventable recurrences in eligible patients untreated with perioperative intravesical chemotherapy. Therapy utilization rates were obtained from a retrospective database analysis and a chart review study of 1,010 patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Recurrence rates of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer were obtained from a randomized clinical trial comparing transurethral resection of bladder tumor with or without perioperative mitomycin C. Costs were estimated using prevailing Medicare reimbursement rates. Quality adjusted life-year estimates and disutilities for complications were obtained from the literature.The model estimated that 7,827 bladder recurrences could be avoided if all patients received immediate intravesical chemotherapy. It estimated an economic savings of $3,847 per avoidable recurrence, resulting in an aggregate savings of $30.1 million. The model also estimated that 1,025 quality adjusted life-years are lost every 2 years due to preventable recurrences, resulting in 0.13 quality adjusted life-years (48 quality adjusted days) lost per avoidable recurrence. This translates into 0.02 quality adjusted life-years (8.1 quality adjusted days) lost per patient not receiving immediate intravesical chemotherapy.Greater use of immediate intravesical chemotherapy in the United States has the potential to substantially decrease the economic and humanistic burdens of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.",2012-01-09950,23083857,J Urol,Cheryl T Lee,2012,188 / 6,2114-9,No,23083857,"Cheryl T Lee; Daniel Barocas; Denise R Globe; Michael G Oefelein; Danielle C Colayco; Amanda Bruno; Ken O'Day; Thomas Bramley; Economic and humanistic consequences of preventable bladder tumor recurrences in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer cases, J Urol, ; 188(6):0022-5347; 2114-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjuvant perioperative intravesical chemotherapy vs. Usual care (resection only),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-24750,United States,2011,-28476.93
10442,Cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome: findings from an economic evaluation conducted alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial in primary care,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is a cost-effective treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjunct to usual care versus usual care alone for the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Cost-utility analysis conducted alongside a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. 233 patients with irritable bowel syndrome were randomly allocated to either acupuncture plus usual care, or usual care alone. Cost-effectiveness outcomes are expressed in terms of incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at one year after randomisation. Costs were estimated from the UK National Health Service perspective for a time horizon of one year. Cost-utility ratios were estimated based on complete case analysis for the base case analysis, where only patients with available EQ-5D and cost data were included. Sensitivity analyses comprised a multiple imputation approach for missing data and a subgroup analysis for the more severe cases of IBS. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed acupuncture to be marginally more effective than usual care (gain of 0.0035 QALYs, 95% CI: -0.00395 to 0.0465) and more expensive (incremental cost of GBP218 per patient (95% CI: 55.87 to 492.87) resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately GBP62,500. Sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation for missing data resulted in acupuncture appearing less effective and more costly than usual care, so usual care is dominant. Subgroup analysis selecting the most severe cases of IBS (Symptom Severity Score of over 300) suggested that acupuncture may be a cost-effective treatment option for this group, with a cost-per-QALY of GBP6,500.

10446,Cost-effectiveness of polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination in people aged 65 and above in Poland,"Introduction: Invasive pneumococcal disease is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and cost implications, which could be reduced by vaccination. Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine in the elderly (65 and older) in Poland. Methods: A Markov model with a 1-year cycle length was developed, allowing up to 10 cohorts to enter the model over the lifetime horizon (35 years). In the base case, costs and benefits were assessed using the public health care payer (NFZ) perspective.

The new strategies reduced the length of pre-emptive isolation per patient (by 43.9 h and 57.5 h for the daytime Xpert strategy and 24 h Xpert strategy, respectively), and also the number of unavailable room-hours per case (by 57.1 h and 77.7 h, respectively). The improvement in patients' quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was nominal (2.4*10(-4) and 3.0*10(-4) QALYs per patient for the daytime Xpert strategy and 24 h Xpert strategy, respectively). The sensitivity analyses indicated that these results were robust to reasonable changes in the model parameters.The 24 h Xpert strategy appears to be the best strategy for active surveillance as it reduces costs and unfavourable outcomes compared with the other strategies, while improving favourable outcomes under reasonable assumptions.",2012-01-09965,23098683,J Hosp Infect,J Li,2012,82 / 4,227-33,No,23098683,"J Li; K Ulvin; H Biboh; I S Kristiansen; Cost-effectiveness of supplementing a broth-enriched culture test with the Xpert meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) assay for screening inpatients at high risk of MRSA, J Hosp Infect, ; 82(4):0195-6701; 227-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Supplementing a broth-enriched culture test with the Xpert MRSA assay on a 24 hr basis vs. Culture test alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-785416.63,Norway,2009,-151455.99

10459,Economic evaluation of internet-based interventions for harmful alcohol use alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Internet interventions with and without therapist support have been found to be effective treatment options for harmful alcohol users. Internet-based therapy (IT) leads to larger and longer-lasting positive effects than Internet-based self-help (IS), but it is also more costly to provide.To evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of Internet-based interventions for harmful use of alcohol through the assessment of the incremental cost effectiveness of IT compared with IS.This study was performed in a substance abuse treatment center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We collected data over the years 2008-2009. A total of 136 participants were included, 70 (51%) were female, and mean age was 41.5 (SD 9.83) years. Reported alcohol consumption and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores indicated harmful drinking behavior at baseline. We collected self-reported outcome data prospectively at baseline and 6 months after randomization. Cost data were extracted from the treatment center's cost records, and sex- and age-specific mean productivity cost data for the Netherlands.The median incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at ?3683 per additional treatment responder and ?14,710 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. At a willingness to pay ?20,000 for 1 additional QALY, IT had a 60% likelihood of being more cost effective than IS. Sensitivity analyses attested to the robustness of the findings.IT offers better value for money than IS and might therefore be considered as a treatment option, either as first-line treatment in a matched-care approach or as a second-line treatment in the context of a stepped-care approach.Netherlands Trial Register NTR-TC1155; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1155 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6AqnV4eTU).",2012-01-09971,23103771,J Med Internet Res,Matthijs Blankers,2012,14 / 5,e134,No,23103771,"Matthijs Blankers; Udo Nabitz; Filip Smit; Maarten W J Koeter; Gerard M Schippers; Economic evaluation of internet-based interventions for harmful alcohol use alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, J Med Internet Res, ; 14(5):1438-8871; e134",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Internet-based interventions (IT) (7 synchronous text-based chat-therapy sessions with a personal (Internet) cognitive behavioral therapy-trained therapist along with homework assignments) for harmful alcohol use vs. Internet-based self-help (IS) (various treatment exercises without therapist’s support),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,14710,Euro,2010,23106.31
10460,The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of Vietnam's methadone maintenance treatment programme in HIV prevention and treatment among injection drug users,"Abstract We analysed the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programme in HIV prevention and treatment among injection drug users (DUs) in Vietnam. The costs and health outcomes of providing MMT for opioid-dependent DUs versus non-MMT were estimated using a decision analytical model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to justify uncertainties of model parameters simultaneously. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MMT in HIV prevention was US$3324 per one averted HIV case. The decision model showed that the cost-effectiveness ratio of MMT and non-MMT strategies was US$480 and US$204 per 1 quality-adjusted life year (QALY), equivalent to 0.43 and 0.18 times the gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc). The ICER for MMT versus non-MMT strategy was US$1964, approximately 1.76 times the GDPpc/QALY, classifying MMT as a cost-effective intervention. At the willingness to pay threshold of three times the GDPpc, the probability of MMT and non-MMT strategies being cost-effective was 80.3 and 19.7%, respectively. The budget impact of scaling up MMT from 2011 to 2015 will be US$97 million for 65% coverage or US$49 million for treating 80,000 DUs. The results indicated that MMT was cost-effective in HIV prevention and treatment among DUs who were opioid dependent.",2012-01-09974,23106230,Glob Public Health,Bach Xuan Tran,2012,7 / 5,1080-94,No,23106230,"Bach Xuan Tran; Arto Ohinmaa; Anh Thuy Duong; Long Thanh Nguyen; Phu Xuan Vu; Steve Mills; Stan Houston; Philip Jacobs; The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of Vietnam's methadone maintenance treatment programme in HIV prevention and treatment among injection drug users, Glob Public Health, ; 7(5):1744-1706; 1080-94",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for methadone-naive, opioid dependent users vs. Non-MMT",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,1964.7,United States,2009,2370.16
10461,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pediatric rotavirus vaccination in British Columbia: a model-based evaluation,"Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) is associated with widespread morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. In high-income countries, including Canada, the burden of RVGE relates largely to morbidity and healthcare utilization. Two live rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq(?) (Merck Frosst Canada Ltd.) and Rotarix? (GlaxoSmithKline Inc.)), are now approved for use in Canada, but their economic attractiveness has not been evaluated in the Canadian context.We performed a model-based economic analysis using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of RVGE in populations of British Columbia children. Models were parameterized based on best available data on disease natural history and epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness and cost, and healthcare costs, and calibrated such that projections of healthcare utilization and vaccine coverage closely matched empirical estimates. Robustness of projections was evaluated in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Based on the best available data, childhood immunization against RVGE was projected to prevent 63-81 infections per 100 children vaccinated, and to prevent substantial numbers of outpatient medical visits. It was projected that either vaccine would prevent 1-2 hospitalizations per 100 children immunized. Vaccination was projected to increase healthcare costs: immunization with Rotarix? would prevent incident infections at a cost of approximately $10 per infection prevented or $2400 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Vaccination with RotaTeq? would be more costly and less effective and would not be preferred. Projections were robust in the face of wide-ranging sensitivity analyses.The use of currently available vaccines against RVGE in British Columbia children is projected to result in a substantial reduction in the burden of illness and healthcare utilization associated with RVGE, with a modest increase in healthcare costs.

(GlaxoSmithKline Inc.)), are now approved for use in Canada, but their economic attractiveness has not been evaluated in the Canadian context.We performed a model-based economic analysis using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of RVGE in populations of British Columbia children. Models were parameterized based on best available data on disease natural history and epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness and cost, and healthcare costs, and calibrated such that projections of healthcare utilization and vaccine coverage closely matched empirical estimates. Robustness of projections was evaluated in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Based on the best available data, childhood immunization against RVGE was projected to prevent 63-81 infections per 100 children vaccinated, and to prevent substantial numbers of outpatient medical visits. It was projected that either vaccine would prevent 1-2 hospitalizations per 100 children immunized. Vaccination was projected to increase healthcare costs: immunization with Rotarix? would prevent incident infections at a cost of approximately $10 per infection prevented or $2400 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Vaccination with RotaTeq? would be more costly and less effective and would not be preferred. Projections were robust in the face of wide-ranging sensitivity analyses.The use of currently available vaccines against RVGE in British Columbia children is projected to result in a substantial reduction in the burden of illness and healthcare utilization associated with RVGE, with a modest increase in healthcare costs. RVGE vaccination should be considered ""highly cost-effective"" relative to other commonly available health interventions.",2012-01-09977,23107595,Vaccine,David N Fisman,2012,30 / 52,7601-7,Yes,23107595,"David N Fisman; Christina H Chan; Elizabeth Lowcock; Monika Naus; Victoria Lee; Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pediatric rotavirus vaccination in British Columbia: a model-based evaluation, Vaccine, Dec/14/2012; 30(52):1873-2518; 7601-7",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rotatrix vaccine against rotavirus vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,2400,Canada,2007,2637.29
10463,Cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination with the AS04-adjuvanted human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine to cervical cancer screening in Hungary,"ABSTRACT:The cervical cancer screening program implemented in Hungary to date has not been successful. Along with screening, vaccination is an effective intervention to prevent cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination with the human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine to the current cervical cancer screening program in Hungary.We developed a cohort simulation state-transition Markov model to model the life course of 12-year-old girls. Eighty percent participation in the HPV vaccination program at 12 years of age was assumed. Transitional probabilities were estimated using data from the literature. Local data were used regarding screening participation rates, and the costs were estimated in US $. We applied the purchasing power parity exchange rate of 129 HUF/$ to the cost data. Only direct health care costs were considered. We used a 3.7% discount rate for both the cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The time horizon was 88 years.Inclusion of HPV vaccination at age 12 in the cervical cancer prevention program was predicted to be cost-effective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding HPV vaccination to the current national cancer screening program was estimated to be 27 588 $/QALY. The results were sensitive to the price of the vaccine, the discount rate, the screening participation rate and whether herd immunity was taken into account.Our modeling analysis showed that the vaccination of 12-year-old adolescent girls against cervical cancer with the AS04-adjuvanted human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine would be a cost-effective strategy to prevent cervical cancer in Hungary.",2012-01-09982,23110361,BMC Public Health,Zolt?n Vok?,2012,12 /,924,No,23110361,"Zolt?n Vok?; L?szl?

10472,Cost effectiveness of guanfacine extended-release versus atomoxetine for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: application of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison,"About 7% of children and adolescents are diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the US. Patients with ADHD who are intolerant of or do not have an optimal response to stimulants often use non-stimulants as alternative therapies. Guanfacine extended-release (GXR) and atomoxetine (ATX) are the only non-stimulants approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for once-daily use in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD in the US. ATX has been on the market since 2002 while GXR was recently approved in 2009. To date, there is no comparative effectiveness or cost-effectiveness study comparing the two drugs.The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents, using the comparative efficacy results from a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC).The MAIC method was used to compare the efficacy between GXR (target dose and lower doses) and ATX (target dose) in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials. Individual patients in the GXR trials were weighted such that the summary baseline characteristics and the efficacy of the placebo arm of the GXR trials matched exactly with those from published ATX trials. After weighting, the efficacy (i.e. change in the ADHD rating scale, fourth edition [ADHD-RS-IV] total score from baseline) was compared between each GXR dosing group and the ATX group. The results from the MAIC analyses were used to populate a 1-year Markov model that is used to compare the cost effectiveness of GXR versus ATX from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness outcomes for each treatment group were estimated as the proportion of responders, defined as patients with =25% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline, and average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Utilities associated with response/non-response and disutilities due to adverse events were applied in the model. Costs included drug and medical service costs and were inflated to 2011 US dollars ($US). Incremental cost/QALY and incremental cost/responder were estimated. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying all model parameters, including costs, utilities, and response rate.The target dose of GXR was 0.12?mg/kg/day. In match-adjusted populations with balanced baseline characteristics, patients receiving GXR at the dose of 0.09-0.12 (p?=?0.0009) and 0.075-0.09?mg/kg/day (p?=?0.0248) had better efficacy, while those receiving GXR at the dose of 0.046-0.075?mg/kg/day had comparable efficacy (p?=?0.0699), compared with patients receiving ATX at the target dose of 1.2?mg/kg/day. In the base case of the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), GXR had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $US10?637/QALY and $US853/responder, compared with ATX (incremental costs: $US74; incremental effectiveness: 0.007 QALYs and 86 responders per 1000 patients treated). Results of all univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the model results were robust to changes in model inputs.To our knowledge, this is the first application of the novel comparative efficacy method of MAIC to a CEA model. The MAIC results indicate that GXR (0.075-0.12?mg/kg/day) was more effective than ATX (1.2?mg/kg/day) in the trial population. The CEA results indicate that GXR is cost effective compared with ATX for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents.",2012-01-09988,23113551,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,M Haim Erder,2012,10 / 6,381-95,Yes,23113551,"M Haim Erder; Jipan Xie; James E Signorovitch; Kristina S Chen; Paul Hodgkins; Mei Lu; Eric Q Wu; Vanja Sikirica; Cost effectiveness of guanfacine extended-release versus atomoxetine for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: application of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, Nov/1/2012; 10(6):1179-1896; 381-95",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Guanfacine extended-release (GXR) within weight-based dosing range of 0.075 - 0.12 mg/kg/day (target dose and lower doses) vs. Atomoxetine (ATX) with weight-based dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day (target dose),Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,10637,United States,2011,12238.75

VA costs were obtained using methods previously developed by the VA Health Economics Resource Center. Costs for non-VA care were determined from Medicare or billing data.Mean life-years were 1.78 in the endovascular and 1.74 in the open repair group (P?=?0.29), and mean QALYs were 1.462 in the endovascular and 1.461 in the open group (P?=?0.78). Although graft costs were higher in the endovascular group ($14,052 vs. $1363; P?<?0.001), length of stay was shorter (5.0 vs. 10.5 days; P?<?0.001), resulting in lower cost of AAA repair hospitalization in the endovascular group ($37,068 vs. $42,970; P?=?0.04). Costs remained lower after 2 years in the endovascular group but the difference was no longer significant (-$5019; 95% CI:?-$16,720 to $4928; P?=?0.35). The probability that endovascular repair was both more effective and less costly was 70.9% for life-years and 51.4% for QALYs.Endovascular repair is a cost-effective alternative to open repair in the US VA healthcare system for at least the first two years.",2012-01-09992,23116986,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,F A Lederle,2012,44 / 6,543-8,No,23116986,"F A Lederle; K T Stroupe; Open Versus Endovascular Repair; Cost-effectiveness at two years in the VA Open Versus Endovascular Repair Trial, Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg, ; 44(6):1078-5884; 543-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular repair vs. Open repair,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-5019000,United States,2008,-6033229.49
10474,Brain damage treated with non proven intensive training 2003-2011: a Norwegian cost analysis,"There has been an increased request for intensive training and rehabilitation of patients with brain damage in Norway. These programs are demanding with regard to personnel, travelling, time and economic resources. We aimed to indicate cost and gain to make these programs cost-effective.A retrospective study included all patients referred to the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority (NNRHA) trust during the nine years period 2003-2011. All referrals to the NNRHA trust for the economic coverage of foreign based rehabilitation or habilitation programs (The Advanced Bio-Mechanical Rehabilitation (ABR), Institutes of Achievement of Human Potential program (IAHP) (Doman Method), Family Hope Center (FHC) program and the Kozijavkin Method) were included. 17 patients were detected and 15 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for funding. Median age was 8 years (1-31 years). Cost from the specialist health care point of view was calculated. A cut-off limit of ?57,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY) and a 4% discount rate was employed.The undiscounted cost per patient enrolled was calculated ?133,210 (discounted ?121,348). To make these therapies cost effective, a total of at least 2.13 QALYs (2.34 undiscounted QALYs) must be gained per patient enrolled. Such a gain could not be indicated and we doubt it is achievable.Non-proven intensive training programs for patients with brain damage are costly. As long as their effect has not been documented, health care services should not spend resources on these programs outside clinical trials.",2012-01-09994,23121754,Glob J Health Sci,Jan Norum,2012,4 / 6,179-84,No,23121754,"Jan Norum; Arnborg Ramsvik; Knut Tjeldnes; Brain damage treated with non proven intensive training 2003-2011: a Norwegian cost analysis, Glob J Health Sci, ; 4(6):1916-9736; 179-84",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive training and rehabilitation vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,9 Years,4.00,4.00,57000,Euro,2012,82621.96

Cumulative 12-month costs (assessed from a U.S. societal perspective) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared separately for the transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) cohorts.Although 12-month costs and QALYs were similar for TAVR and AVR in the overall population, there were important differences when results were stratified by access site. In the TF cohort, total 12-month costs were slightly lower with TAVR and QALYs were slightly higher such that TF-TAVR was economically dominant compared with AVR in the base case and economically attractive (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000/QALY) in 70.9% of bootstrap replicates. In the TA cohort, 12-month costs remained substantially higher with TAVR, whereas QALYs tended to be lower such that TA-TAVR was economically dominated by AVR in the base case and economically attractive in only 7.1% of replicates.In the PARTNER trial, TAVR was an economically attractive strategy compared with AVR for patients suitable for TF access.

10478,Should we invest in environmental interventions to encourage physical activity in England? An economic appraisal,"The Department of Health in England asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop guidance on environmental interventions that promote physical activity. The economic appraisals summarized in this study informed the development of that guidance. In view of the difficulties inherent in applying conventional health economic evaluation techniques to public health interventions, the economic appraisal employed a multi-faceted approach.The analyses comprised of three components. Two cost-utility analyses; the first used a life-time disease progression model which sought to take into account the long-term benefits of physical activity on health outcomes, whereas the second used data from a regression analysis which captured some of the short-term, process benefits of physical activity which might manifest themselves in terms of improved mental health and wellbeing. The third approach was a cost-benefit analysis that took into account benefits beyond healthcare.The cost-utility approaches generated cost-effectiveness estimates ranging between ?100 and ?10?000 per QALY depending on the level of effectiveness of the intervention and the proportion of the intervention cost that was deemed to be attributable to health.

We compare the cost effectiveness of a 13-valent PCV (PCV-13) and a 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) with that of PCV-7 in Turkey.A cost-utility analysis was conducted and a decision analytical model was used to estimate the proportion of the Turkish population <10 years old that would experience 10 mutually exclusive outcomes over the course of 1 year from a perspective of a healthcare system. Model outcomes were adjusted according to the population demographics and region-specific serotype distribution in Turkey. Health outcomes and direct healthcare costs were simulated for PCV-7, PCV-13 and PHiD-CV.PCV-13 and PHiD-CV are projected to have a substantial impact on pneumococcal disease in Turkey versus PCV-7, with 2,223 and 3,156 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 2,146 and 2,081 life years, respectively, being saved under a 3+1 schedule. Projections of direct medical costs showed that a PHiD-CV vaccination programme would provide the greatest cost savings, offering additional savings of US$11,718,813 versus PCV-7 and US$8,235,010 versus PCV-13.

To address this gap, data from 9 sites of EnhanceLink, a project that enrolled HIV-infected releasees from jails across the US, were examined. Figures on the number of clients served, cost of linkage services, number of linkages and 6-month sustained linkages to community HIV care, and number of clients achieving viral suppression were assessed for subjects released in the first quarter of 2010 (n = 543). The cost analysis included all costs that participating service agencies incurred. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the new HIV cases averted by EnhanceLink and the cost per quality-adjusted life year saved by the program. The mean cost per linked client was $4,219; the mean cost per 6-month sustained linkage was $4,670; and the mean cost per client achieving viral suppression was $8,432.

10495,Dynamic modelling of costs and health consequences of school closure during an influenza pandemic,"ABSTRACT:The purpose of this article is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of school closure during a potential influenza pandemic and to examine the trade-off between costs and health benefits for school closure involving different target groups and different closure durations.We developed two models: a dynamic disease model capturing the spread of influenza and an economic model capturing the costs and benefits of school closure. Decisions were based on quality-adjusted life years gained using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The disease model is an age-structured SEIR compartmental model based on the population of Oslo. We studied the costs and benefits of school closure by varying the age targets (kindergarten, primary school, secondary school) and closure durations (1-10 weeks), given pandemics with basic reproductive number of 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5.The cost-effectiveness of school closure varies depending on the target group, duration and whether indirect costs are considered. Using a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.1-0.2% and with current cost-effectiveness threshold for Norway, closing secondary school is the only cost-effective strategy, when indirect costs are included. The most cost-effective strategies would be closing secondary schools for 8 weeks if R0=1.5, 6 weeks if R0=2.0, and 4 weeks if R0= 2.5. For severe pandemics with case fatality rates of 1-2%, similar to the Spanish flu, or when indirect costs are disregarded, the optimal strategy is closing kindergarten, primary and secondary school for extended periods of time. For a pandemic with 2009 H1N1 characteristics (mild severity and low transmissibility), closing schools would not be cost-effective, regardless of the age target of school children.School closure has moderate impact on the epidemic's scope, but the resulting disruption to society imposes a potentially great cost in terms of lost productivity from parents' work absenteeism.",2012-01-10017,23140513,BMC Public Health,Yiting Xue,2012,12 /,962,No,23140513,"Yiting Xue; Ivar S?nb?

We studied the costs and benefits of school closure by varying the age targets (kindergarten, primary school, secondary school) and closure durations (1-10 weeks), given pandemics with basic reproductive number of 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5.The cost-effectiveness of school closure varies depending on the target group, duration and whether indirect costs are considered. Using a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.1-0.2% and with current cost-effectiveness threshold for Norway, closing secondary school is the only cost-effective strategy, when indirect costs are included. The most cost-effective strategies would be closing secondary schools for 8 weeks if R0=1.5, 6 weeks if R0=2.0, and 4 weeks if R0= 2.5. For severe pandemics with case fatality rates of 1-2%, similar to the Spanish flu, or when indirect costs are disregarded, the optimal strategy is closing kindergarten, primary and secondary school for extended periods of time. For a pandemic with 2009 H1N1 characteristics (mild severity and low transmissibility), closing schools would not be cost-effective, regardless of the age target of school children.School closure has moderate impact on the epidemic's scope, but the resulting disruption to society imposes a potentially great cost in terms of lost productivity from parents' work absenteeism.",2012-01-10017,23140513,BMC Public Health,Yiting Xue,2012,12 /,962,No,23140513,"Yiting Xue; Ivar S?nb?

10499,Primary prevention of pediatric abusive head trauma: A cost audit and cost-utility analysis,"To obtain comprehensive, reliable data on the direct cost of pediatric abusive head trauma in New Zealand, and to use this data to evaluate the possible cost-benefit of a national primary prevention program.A 5 year cohort of infants with abusive head trauma admitted to hospital in Auckland, New Zealand was reviewed. We determined the direct costs of hospital care (from hospital and Ministry of Health financial records), community rehabilitation (from the Accident Compensation Corporation), special education (from the Ministry of Education), investigation and child protection (from the Police and Child Protective Services), criminal trials (from the Police, prosecution and defence), punishment of offenders (from the Department of Corrections) and life-time care for moderate or severe disability (from the Accident Compensation Corporation). Analysis of the possible cost-utility of a national primary prevention program was undertaken, using the costs established in our cohort, recent New Zealand national data on the incidence of pediatric abusive head trauma, international data on quality of life after head trauma, and published international literature on prevention programs.There were 52 cases of abusive head trauma in the sample. Hospital costs totaled $NZ2,433,340, child protection $NZ1,560,123, police investigation $NZ1,842,237, criminal trials $NZ3,214,020, punishment of offenders $NZ4,411,852 and community rehabilitation $NZ2,895,848. Projected education costs for disabled survivors were $NZ2,452,148, and the cost of projected lifetime care was $NZ33,624,297. Total costs were $NZ52,433,864, averaging $NZ1,008,344 per child. Cost-utility analysis resulted in a strongly positive economic argument for primary prevention, with expected case scenarios showing lowered net costs with improved health outcomes.Pediatric abusive head trauma is very expensive, and on a conservative estimate the costs of acute hospitalization represent no more than 4% of lifetime direct costs. If shaken baby prevention programs are effective, there is likely to be a strong economic argument for their implementation. This study also provides robust data for future cost-benefit analysis in the field of abusive head trauma prevention.",2012-01-10020,23141137,Child Abuse Negl,Joshua Friedman,2012,36 / 11-12,760-70,No,23141137,"Joshua Friedman; Peter Reed; Peter Sharplin; Patrick Kelly; Primary prevention of pediatric abusive head trauma: A cost audit and cost-utility analysis, Child Abuse Negl, ; 36(11-12):0145-2134; 760-70",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Not Stated,National newborn-based intervention program to reduce pediatric abusive head trauma (AHT) (20% national reduction of AHT) vs. None,Not Stated,2 Years,2 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,36100,New Zealand,2012,32980.6
10500,Economic evaluation of different treatment modalities in acute kidney injury,"Major controversy exists regarding the preferred treatment option for acute kidney injury (AKI). The purpose of this study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) versus intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) and conservative (CONS) AKI treatment in Belgium.An area-under-the-curve model based on survival analysis was used to estimate costs and health outcomes using a 2-year time horizon. Input data were derived from the multi-centre Stuivenberg Hospital Acute Renal Failure 4 study.Analyses indicated that in-hospital mortality, hospitalization costs and hospital length of stay differed significantly between treatment modes. Follow-up mortality rates and follow-up cost per day showed no significant difference between the treatment modes. Utility values, which improved gradually after admission to the hospital, revealed no significant differences between the three treatment strategies. CONS treatment was associated with a 2-year cost of 33,802? and 0.54 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The CRRT was the most expensive therapy with a cost of 51,365? leading to 0.57 QALYs. The cost and QALYs associated with IRRT were 43,445? and 0.50, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated the 'in-hospital mortality' as the variable with the greatest influence on the results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in a significant difference in treatment costs but no significant difference in QALY gain.This study has indicated that the most expensive treatment (CRRT) associated with an incremental cost of approximately ?7920 generates only a minor non-significant increase in QALYs of 0.07 compared with IRRT. Additionally, the results revealed that the RRTs did not result in a significant increase in QALYs despite their higher cost compared with the CONS treatment. From a health economic perspective, the latter seems to be the preferred treatment strategy.",2012-01-10024,23144072,Nephrol Dial Transplant,Delphine M De Smedt,2012,27 / 11,4095-101,No,23144072,"Delphine M De Smedt; Monique M Elseviers; Robert L Lins; Lieven Annemans; Economic evaluation of different treatment modalities in acute kidney injury, Nephrol Dial Transplant, ; 27(11):0931-0509; 4095-101",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) vs. Conservative (CONS) acute kidney injury (AKI) treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,Not Stated,590410,Euro,2010,927409.79
