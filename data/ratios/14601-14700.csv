14601,Echo-based screening of rheumatic heart disease in children: a cost-effectiveness Markov model,"OBJECTIVES: To project the cost-effectiveness of population-based echo screening to prevent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) consequences. BACKGROUND: RHD is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity during adolescence and young adulthood in low- and middle-per capita income settings. Echocardiography-based screening approaches can dramatically expand the number of children identified at risk of progressive RHD. Cost-effectiveness analysis can inform public health agencies and payers about the net economic benefit of such large-scale population-based screening. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed comparing a no-screen to echo screen approach. The echo screen program was modeled as a 2-staged screen of a cohort of 11-year-old children with initial short screening performed by dedicated technicians and follow-up complete echo by cardiologists. Penicillin RHD prophylaxis was modeled to only reduce rheumatic fever recurrence-related exacerbation. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and societal costs (in 2010 Australian dollars) associated with each approach were estimated. One-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on RHD prevalence and transition probabilities; echocardiography test characteristics; and societal level costs including supplies, transportation, and labor. RESULTS: The incremental costs and QALYs of the screen compared to no screen strategy were -$432 (95% CI = -$1357 to $575) and 0.007 (95% CI = -0.0101 to 0.0237), respectively. The joint probability that the screen was both less costly and more effective exceeded 80%. Sensitivity analyses suggested screen strategy dominance depends mostly on the probability of transitioning out of sub-clinical RHD. CONCLUSION: Two-stage echo RHD screening and secondary prophylaxis may achieve modestly improved outcomes at lower cost compared to clinical detection and deserves closer attention from health policy stakeholders.",2015-01-18829,25629653,J Med Econ,Justin P Zachariah,2015,18 / 6,410-9,Yes,25629653,"Justin P Zachariah; Mihail Samnaliev; Echo-based screening of rheumatic heart disease in children: a cost-effectiveness Markov model, J Med Econ, 2015 Jun; 18(6):1369-6998; 410-9",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Echo-based screening of rheumatic heart disease vs. Standard/Usual Care- Clinical exam detection,Not Stated,11 Years,11 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.50,3.50,-43200,Australia,2010,-47172.17
14602,Cost-utility analysis of operative versus non-operative treatment for colorectal liver metastases,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) is the standard of care when possible, although this strategy has not been compared with non-operative interventions in controlled trials. Although survival outcomes are clear, the cost-effectiveness of surgery is not. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of resection for CRLMs compared with non-operative treatment (palliative care including chemotherapy). METHODS: Operative and non-operative cohorts were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients in the operative cohort had a minimum of 10 years of follow-up. A model-based cost-utility analysis was conducted to quantify the mean cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over a lifetime time horizon. The analysis was conducted from a healthcare provider perspective (UK National Health Service) in a secondary care (hospital) setting. RESULTS: Median survival was 41 and 21 months in the operative and non-operative cohorts respectively (P < 0.001). The operative strategy dominated non-operative treatments, being less costly (euro22,200 versus euro32,800) and more effective (4.017 versus 1.111 QALYs gained). The results of extensive sensitivity analysis showed that the operative strategy dominated non-operative treatment in every scenario. CONCLUSION: Operative treatment of CRLMs yields greater survival than non-operative treatment, and is both more effective and less costly.",2015-01-18837,25624168,J Clin Psychopharmacol,K J Roberts,2015,102 / 4,388-98,No,25624168,"K J Roberts; A J Sutton; K R Prasad; G J Toogood; J P A Lodge; Cost-utility analysis of operative versus non-operative treatment for colorectal liver metastases, J Clin Psychopharmacol, 2015 Mar; 102(4):0271-0749; 388-98",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgical colorectal liver metastases resection vs. Non surgical precedure to treat colorectal liver metastases,With liver metastases,74 Years,54 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-3647.63,Euro,2014,-5302.4
14603,A cost-effectiveness analysis of management of low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer using office-based fulguration,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic treatment of low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) via office-based fulguration vs operating room-based transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was created to simulate and compare the economic burden of managing patients with office-based fulguration vs TURB. Direct procedural and hospitalization costs were queried from our institution. Patients were modeled as being followed up routinely with flexible cystoscopy, whereas tumor recurrences were treated with either fulguration or TURB. RESULTS: A strategy of office-based fulguration was more cost-effective than TURB ($1171 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] vs. $1208 per QALY) to treat recurrent NMIBC over a 5-year period. Fulguration was both more effective (14.94 vs. 14.91 QALYs) as well as less expensive ($17,494 vs. $18,005), thus dominating TURB. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$18,440 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the relative costs of the procedures are more significant in determining cost-effectiveness than their respective utilities. CONCLUSION: Office-based cystoscopy and fulguration was more cost-effective than TURB for treating recurrent low-risk NMIBC. Adherence to an office-based treatment plan can lead to significant cost savings with a decreased therapeutic burden over the lifetime of a patient with NMIBC.",2015-01-18839,25623694,Urology,Bashir Al Hussein Al Awamlh,2015,85 / 2,381-6,No,25623694,"Bashir Al Hussein Al Awamlh; Richard Lee; Bilal Chughtai; S Machele Donat; Jaspreet S Sandhu; Harry W Herr; A cost-effectiveness analysis of management of low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer using office-based fulguration, Urology, 2015 Feb; 85(2):1527-9995; 381-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endoscopic treatment via office-based fulguration vs. Operating room-based transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,2.26,2.26,-17033.33,United States,2012,-19200.91
14604,Cost-effectiveness of the evaluation of a suspicious biliary stricture,"BACKGROUND: Biliary stricture without mass presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges because the poor sensitivity of the available tests and significant mortality and cost with operation. METHODS: A decision model was developed to analyze costs and survival for 1) investigation first with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration, 2) investigation first with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and brushing, or 3) surgery on every patient. The average age of someone with a biliary stricture was found to be 62-y-old and the rate of cancer was 55%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated based on the change in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (US$) between the different options, with a threshold of $150,000 to determine the most cost-effective strategy. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic-sensitivity analysis were performed to validate the model. RESULTS: ERCP results in 9.05 QALYs and a cost of $34,685.11 for a cost-effectiveness ratio of $3832.33. EUS results in an incremental increase in 0.13 QALYs and $2773.69 for an ICER of $20,840.28 per QALY gained. Surgery resulted in a decrease of 1.37 QALYs and increased cost of $14,323.94 (ICER-$10,490.53). These trends remained within most sensitivity analyses; however, ERCP and EUS were dependent on the test sensitivity.

14606,Cost-effectiveness of point-of-care C-reactive protein tests for respiratory tract infection in primary care in England,"INTRODUCTION: Despite recommendations that general practitioners (GPs) delay antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs), antibiotic prescriptions in primary care in England increased by 4.1% from 2010 to 2013. C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care tests (POCT), for example, the Afinion Analyzer (Alere Ltd, Stockport, UK) device, are widely used in several countries in the European Union. Studies suggest that CRP POCT use, either alone or in combination with communication training, reduces antibiotic prescribing and improves quality of life for patients presenting with RTI symptoms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CRP POCT for RTIs in primary care in England over 3 years for three different strategies of care compared to standard practice. METHODS: An economic evaluation was carried out to compare the costs and benefits of three different strategies of CRP testing (GP plus CRP; practice nurse plus CRP; and GP plus CRP and communication training) for patients with RTI symptoms as defined by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline CG69, compared with current standard GP practice without CRP testing. Analysis consisted of a decision tree and Markov model to describe the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost per 100 patients, together with the number of antibiotic prescriptions and RTIs for each group. RESULTS: Compared with current standard practice, the GP plus CRP and practice nurse plus CRP test strategies result in increased QALYs and reduced costs, while the GP plus CRP testing and communication training strategy is associated with increased costs and reduced QALYs. Additionally, all three CRP arms led to fewer antibiotic prescriptions and infections over 3 years.

AIM: To estimate the health economic outcomes for LDV/SOF compared with current treatments in US patients infected with HCV genotype 1. METHODS: A hybrid decision-tree and Markov state-transition model was developed. For a cohort of 10,000 patients, the model captured outcomes for several pairings of LDV/SOF with comparators, including long-term health outcomes, number need to treat, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS) gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and costs per sustained virologic response (SVR). Patients with different levels of treatment experience and different cirrhosis stages were included. RESULTS: LDV/SOF decreased the number of advanced liver disease cases by 0-93% compared with current regimens or no treatment in treatment-naive patients. In treatment-experienced [pegIFN plus ribavirin (PR) or protease inhibitor (PI) + PR] patients, treatment with LDV/SOF decreased the incidence of advanced liver disease complications in most of the cases analysed, except SOF + SMV. For all patient sub-cohorts, LDV/SOF was associated with the lowest 1-year costs per SVR and, with regard to lifetime incremental costs per QALY gained, was either dominant or the most cost-effective treatment.

For a cohort of 10,000 patients, the model captured outcomes for several pairings of LDV/SOF with comparators, including long-term health outcomes, number need to treat, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS) gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and costs per sustained virologic response (SVR). Patients with different levels of treatment experience and different cirrhosis stages were included. RESULTS: LDV/SOF decreased the number of advanced liver disease cases by 0-93% compared with current regimens or no treatment in treatment-naive patients. In treatment-experienced [pegIFN plus ribavirin (PR) or protease inhibitor (PI) + PR] patients, treatment with LDV/SOF decreased the incidence of advanced liver disease complications in most of the cases analysed, except SOF + SMV. For all patient sub-cohorts, LDV/SOF was associated with the lowest 1-year costs per SVR and, with regard to lifetime incremental costs per QALY gained, was either dominant or the most cost-effective treatment. Overall, treatment initiation at earlier stages of liver fibrosis resulted in improved health economic outcomes.

Treatment efficacy, cost, and quality of life estimates were obtained from published sources. Long-term treatment adherence was measured based on data from the national prescription register. RESULTS: At an assumed willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000 per QALY gained, statin treatment with real-world adherence was cost-effective among the older patient groups when the patients' 10-year CHD risk was as high as 20% and did not seem cost-effective in the youngest age groups. Conversely, statin treatment with full adherence was cost-effective for almost all patient groups with a 10-year CHD risk of at least 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Even though generic statins are now low-cost drugs, treatment adherence seems to have a major impact on the cost-effectiveness of statin treatment in primary prevention. This finding stresses the importance of making a concerted effort for improving adherence among patients on statin therapy to obtain full benefit of the investment in statins.

14638,Spacers in radiotherapy treatment of prostate cancer: is reduction of toxicity cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of treating prostate cancer patients with intensity-modulated radiation therapy and a spacer (IMRT+S) versus IMRT-only without a spacer (IMRT-O). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to examine the effect of late rectal toxicity and compare the costs and quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of IMRT-O and IMRT+S. The main assumption of this modeling study was that disease progression, genito-urinary toxicity and survival were equal for both comparators. RESULTS: For all patients, IMRT+S revealed a lower toxicity than IMRT-O. Treatment follow-up and toxicity costs for IMRT-O and IMRT+S amounted to euro1604 and euro1444, respectively, thus saving euro160 on the complication costs at an extra charge of euro1700 for the spacer in IMRT+S. The QALYs yielded for IMRT-O and IMRT+S were 3.542 and 3.570, respectively. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro55,880 per QALY gained. For a ceiling ratio of euro80,000, IMRT+S had a 77% probability of being cost-effective.

14639,Cost-effectiveness of the ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of children with intractable epilepsy,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of the ketogenic diet (KD), vague nerve stimulation (VNS) and care as usual (CAU), using a decision analytic model with a 5-year time horizon. METHODS: A Markov decision analytical model was constructed to estimate the incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and successfully treated patient (i.e. 50% or more seizure reduction) of the treatment strategies KD, VNS and CAU, from a health care perspective. The base case considered children with intractable epilepsy (i.e. two or more antiepileptic drugs had failed) aged between 1 and 18 years. Data were derived from literature and expert meetings. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Our results suggest that KD is more effective and less costly, and thus cost-effective compared with VNS, after 12 months. However, compared to CAU, neither KD nor VNS are cost-effective options, they are both more effective but also more expensive (euro346,899 and euro641,068 per QALY, respectively). At 5 years, VNS is cost-effective compared with KD and CAU (euro11,378 and euro68,489 per QALY, respectively) and has a 51% probability of being cost-effective at a ceiling ratio of euro80,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that on average the benefits of KD and VNS fail to outweigh the costs of the therapies. However, these treatment options should not be ignored in the treatment for intractable epilepsy in individual or specific groups of patients.

14642,Economic evaluation of pharmacogenomic-guided warfarin treatment for elderly Croatian atrial fibrillation patients with ischemic stroke,"BACKGROUND & METHODS: Economic evaluation in genomic medicine is an emerging discipline to assess the cost-effectiveness of genome-guided treatment. Here, we developed a pharmaco-economic model to assess whether pharmacogenomic (PGx)-guided warfarin treatment of elderly ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation in Croatia is cost effective compared with non-PGx therapy. The time horizon of the model was set at 1 year. RESULTS: Our primary analysis indicates that 97.07% (95% CI: 94.08-99.34%) of patients belonging to the PGx-guided group have not had any major complications, compared with the control group (89.12%; 95% CI: 84.00-93.87%, p < 0.05). The total cost per patient was estimated at euro538.7 (95% CI: euro526.3-551.2) for the PGx-guided group versus euro219.7 (95% CI: euro137.9-304.2) for the control group. In terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, total QALYs was estimated at 0.954 (95% CI: 0.943-0.964) and 0.944 (95% CI: 0.931-0.956) for the PGx-guided and the control groups, respectively. The true difference in QALYs was estimated at 0.01 (95% CI: 0.005-0.015) in favor of the PGx-guided group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the PGx-guided versus the control groups was estimated at euro31,225/QALY.

14643,High-dose hemodialysis versus conventional in-center hemodialysis: a cost-utility analysis from a UK payer perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of high-dose hemodialysis (HD) versus conventional in-center HD (ICHD), over a lifetime time horizon from the UK payer's perspective. METHODS: We used a Markov modeling approach to compare high-dose HD (in-center or at home) with conventional ICHD using current and hypothetical home HD reimbursement tariffs in England. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Over a lifetime, high-dose HD in-center (5 sessions/wk) is associated with higher per-patient costs and QALYs (increases of pound108,713 and 0.862, respectively) versus conventional ICHD. The corresponding ICER ( pound126,106/QALY) indicates that high-dose HD in-center is not cost-effective versus conventional ICHD at a UK willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 to pound30,000. High-dose HD at home is associated with lower total costs ( pound522 less per patient) and a per-patient QALY increase of 1.273 compared with ICHD under the current Payment-by Results reimbursement tariff ( pound456/wk). At an increased home HD tariff ( pound575/wk), the ICER for high-dose HD at home versus conventional ICHD is pound17,404/QALY. High-dose HD at home had a 62% to 84% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 to pound30,000/QALY.

We estimated cost-effectiveness of multiplexed predictive biomarker screening in metastatic NSCLC from a societal perspective in the United States. METHODS: We constructed a microsimulation model to compare the life expectancy and costs of multiplexed testing and molecularly guided therapy versus treatment with cisplatin-pemetrexed (CisPem).

14647,The clinical role and cost-effectiveness of long-acting antiretroviral therapy,"BACKGROUND: Long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) is currently under development and could improve outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with poor daily ART adherence. METHODS: We used a computer simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3 LA-ART strategies vs daily oral ART for all: (1) LA-ART for patients with multiple ART failures; (2) second-line LA-ART for those failing first-line therapy; and (3) first-line LA-ART for ART-naive patients. We calculated the maximum annual cost of LA-ART at which each strategy would be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We assumed HIV RNA suppression on daily ART ranged from 0% to 91% depending on adherence, vs 91% suppression on LA-ART regardless of daily ART adherence. In sensitivity analyses, we varied adherence, efficacy of LA-ART and daily ART, and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Relative to daily ART, LA-ART increased overall life expectancy by 0.15-0.24 years, and by 0.51-0.89 years among poorly adherent patients, depending on the LA-ART strategy. LA-ART after multiple failures became cost-effective at an annual drug cost of $48 000; in sensitivity analysis, this threshold varied from $40 000-$70 000. Second-line LA-ART and first-line LA-ART became cost-effective at an annual drug cost of $26 000-$31 000 and $24 000-$27 000, vs $28 000 and $25 000 for current second-line and first-line regimens.

METHODS: We used a computer simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3 LA-ART strategies vs daily oral ART for all: (1) LA-ART for patients with multiple ART failures; (2) second-line LA-ART for those failing first-line therapy; and (3) first-line LA-ART for ART-naive patients. We calculated the maximum annual cost of LA-ART at which each strategy would be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We assumed HIV RNA suppression on daily ART ranged from 0% to 91% depending on adherence, vs 91% suppression on LA-ART regardless of daily ART adherence. In sensitivity analyses, we varied adherence, efficacy of LA-ART and daily ART, and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Relative to daily ART, LA-ART increased overall life expectancy by 0.15-0.24 years, and by 0.51-0.89 years among poorly adherent patients, depending on the LA-ART strategy. LA-ART after multiple failures became cost-effective at an annual drug cost of $48 000; in sensitivity analysis, this threshold varied from $40 000-$70 000.

Of those with chronic HCV infection, 10% to 20% will experience advanced liver disease by 30 years of infection. Targeted screening seems a plausible strategy. We aimed to estimate the health and economic effects of various screening and treatment strategies for chronic HCV infection in Canada. METHODS: We used a state-transition model to examine the cost-effectiveness of 4 screening strategies: no screening; screen and treat with pegylated interferon plus ribavarin; screen and treat with pegylated interferon and ribavarin-based direct-acting antiviral agents; and screen and treat with interferon-free direct-acting antivirals. We considered Canadian residents in 2 age groups: 25-64 and 45-64 years of age. We obtained model data from the literature. We predicted deaths related to chronic HCV infection, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: We found that screening and treating would prevent at least 9 HCV-related deaths per 10,000 persons screened over the lifetime of the cohort. Screening was associated with QALY increases of 0.0032 to 0.0095 and cost increases of $124 to $338 per person, which translated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $34,359 to $44,034 per QALY gained, relative to no screening, depending on age group screened and antiviral therapy received.

14662,Cost-effectiveness analysis of two rituximab retreatment regimens for longstanding rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: Rituximab (RTX) is licensed for second-line treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after first tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor failure. RTX is generally administered intravenously at 1 gm 2 weeks apart, and the retreatment is scheduled at the time of clinical relapse (regimen 1). A more intensive regimen is proposed with a fixed full cycle after 6 months (regimen 2) if remission is not reached. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) compared these 2 regimens of RTX administration in patients with longstanding RA based on data provided by an observational study. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted on 102 patients, enrolled in 3 hospitals and followed for >/=12 months. Forty-seven patients followed regimen 1, while 55 patients followed regimen 2. A CEA based on a Markov model was conducted. A lifelong and social perspective was adopted. CEA was conducted for the entire cohort and for the 2 subgroups separately (patients with positive rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide and failures to TNF inhibitors). RESULTS: Results for the overall sample show at 10, 20, and 30 years that regimen 1 is less costly and associated with a higher quality of life compared to regimen 2. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis at 10 years estimated a probability of 95.1% for regimen 1 to be cost effective given a willingness to pay of euro35,000/quality-adjusted life year, while for seropositive patients and for TNF failures it was estimated to be 92% and 92.7%, respectively.

METHODS: We developed the Norwegian RA model as a Markov model simulating 10 years of treatment with either TNFi plus sDMARDs (TNFi strategy) or sDMARDs alone (synthetic strategy). Patients in both strategies started in one of seven health states, based on the Short Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D). The patients could move to better or worse health states according to transition probabilities. In the TNFi strategy, patients could stay on TNFi (including switch of TNFi), or switch to non-TNFi-biologics (abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab), sDMARDs or no DMARD. In the synthetic strategy, patients remained on sDMARDs. Data from two observational studies were used for the assessment of resource use and utilities in the health states. Health benefits were evaluated using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and SF-6D. RESULTS: The Norwegian RA model predicted that 10-year discounted health care costs totalled euro124,942 (euro475,266 including production losses) for the TNFi strategy and euro65,584 (euro436,517) for the synthetic strategy. The cost per additionally gained quality-adjusted life-year of adding a TNFi was euro92,557 (euro60,227 including production losses) using SF-6D and euro61,285 (euro39,841) using EQ-5D. Including health care costs only, the probability that TNFi treatment was cost-effective was 90% when using EQ-5D, assuming a Norwegian willingness-to-pay level of euro67,300.

In this study we carried out a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the most cost-effective diagnostic test strategy. METHODS: In this prospective study, we recruited 102 patients from Singapore National Eye Centre with signs suggestive of tuberculous uveitis. Using prospective data from this cohort and from published meta-analyses, we modelled the incremental cost effectiveness of the following strategies: tuberculin skin test (TST) only; interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) only; IGRA following a positive TST result; and dual-test strategy, conducting TST and IGRA at presentation. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each strategy and analysed using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In our population, the least cost effective was the IGRA-only strategy. The dual-test strategy was the most cost effective, with an improvement of 0.017 QALY at an incremental cost of $190 relative to the TST-only strategy (ICER $11,500); while the TST-only strategy was more cost effective than the third strategy, using IGRA following a positive TST result (ICER $3610).

METHODS: A decision tree was designed to simulate outcomes of three diagnostic assessment strategies in adult patients hospitalized for suspected active PTB: conventional approach, sputum smear plus Xpert for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-negative, and a single sputum Xpert test. Model inputs were derived from the literature. Outcome measures were direct medical cost, one-year mortality rate, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY (ICER). RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, Xpert was more effective with higher QALYs gained and a lower mortality rate when compared with smear plus Xpert by an ICER of USD99. A conventional diagnostic approach was the least preferred option with the highest cost, lowest QALYs gained and highest mortality rate.

14670,Cost-effectiveness of revascularization strategies: the ASCERT study,"BACKGROUND: ASCERT (American College of Cardiology Foundation and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Collaboration on the Comparative Effectiveness of Revascularization Strategies) was a large observational study designed to compare the long-term effectiveness of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat coronary artery disease (CAD) over 4 to 5 years. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the cost-effectiveness of CABG versus PCI for stable ischemic heart disease. METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and American College of Cardiology Foundation databases were linked to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data. Costs for the index and observation period (2004 to 2008) hospitalizations were assessed by diagnosis-related group Medicare reimbursement rates; costs beyond the observation period were estimated from average Medicare participant per capita expenditure. Effectiveness was measured via mortality and life-expectancy data. Cost and effectiveness comparisons were adjusted using propensity score matching with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: CABG patients (n = 86,244) and PCI patients (n = 103,549) were at least 65 years old with 2- or 3-vessel coronary artery disease. Adjusted costs were higher for CABG for the index hospitalization, study period, and lifetime by $10,670, $8,145, and $11,575, respectively. Patients undergoing CABG gained an adjusted average of 0.2525 and 0.3801 life-years relative to PCI over the observation period and lifetime, respectively. The life-time incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CABG compared to PCI was $30,454/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 4 years or longer, patients undergoing CABG had better outcomes but at higher costs than those undergoing PCI.",2015-01-18922,25572503,J Am Coll Cardiol,Zugui Zhang,2015,65 / 1,1-11,No,25572503,"Zugui Zhang; Paul Kolm; Maria V Grau-Sepulveda; Angelo Ponirakis; Sean M O'Brien; Lloyd W Klein; Richard E Shaw; Charles McKay; David M Shahian; Frederick L Grover; John E Mayer; Kirk N Garratt; Mark Hlatky; Fred H Edwards; William S Weintraub; Cost-effectiveness of revascularization strategies: the ASCERT study, J Am Coll Cardiol, 2015 Jan 6; 65(1):0735-1097; 1-11",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) vs. Percutaneous coronary intervention,2- or 3-vessel coronary artery disease,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, observation period (5 year)",3.00,3.00,30454,United States,2013,33833.84
14671,Cost-effectiveness of hip protector use on a geriatric ward in Germany: a Markov model,"In this study, we determined the cost-effectiveness of hip protector use compared with no hip protector on a geriatric ward in Germany. From both the societal and the statutory health insurance (SHI) perspectives, the cost-effectiveness ratios for the provision of hip protectors were below <euro>12,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) even if unrelated costs in added life years were included. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of the provision of hip protectors compared with no hip protectors on a geriatric ward in Germany. METHODS: A lifetime decision-analytic Markov model was developed. Costs were measured from the societal and from the statutory health insurance (SHI) perspectives and comprised direct medical, non-medical and unrelated costs in additional life years gained. Health outcomes were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). To reflect several levels of uncertainty, first- and second-order Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approaches were applied. RESULTS: Hip protector use compared with no hip protector results in savings (costs, -5.1/QALYs, 0.003) for the societal perspective. For the SHI perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was <euro>4416 <euro>/QALY (costs, +13.4). If unrelated costs in life years gained were included, the cost-effectiveness ratio increases to <euro>9794/QALY for the societal perspective and to <euro>11,426/QALY for the SHI perspective. In the MCS, for the societal perspective without unrelated costs, 47 % of simulations indicated hip protectors to be cost saving (i.e. lower costs and higher effects). CONCLUSION: Although the gain in QALYs due to the provision of providing hip protectors to patients on geriatric wards is small, all scenarios showed acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios or even savings.",2015-01-18924,25572047,Osteoporos Int,B Stollenwerk,2015,26 / 4,1367-79,No,25572047,"B Stollenwerk; T Bartmus; F Klug; S Stock; D Muller; Cost-effectiveness of hip protector use on a geriatric ward in Germany: a Markov model, Osteoporos Int, 2015 Apr; 26(4):0937-941X; 1367-79",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hip protector vs. None,"Inpatients from hospital geriatric divisions, with high risk of hip fractures",103 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-1667.87,Euro,2014,-2424.52
14672,Sirolimus Versus Tacrolimus as Primary Immunosuppressant After Renal Transplantation: A Meta-Analysis and Economics Evaluation,"Sirolimus and tacrolimus are the major immunosuppressants for renal transplantation. Several studies have compared these 2 drugs, but the outcomes were not consistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacoeconomics of sirolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of renal transplantation and provide evidence for the selection of essential drugs. Trials were identified through a computerized literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane controlled trials register, Cochrane Renal Group Specialized Register of randomized controlled trials, and Chinese Biomedical database. Two independent reviewers assessed trials for eligibility and quality and then extracted data. Data were extracted for patient and graft mortality, acute rejection (AR), and adverse events. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. A decision tree model was populated with data from a literature review and used to estimate costs and QALYs gained and incremental cost-effectiveness. Altogether, 1189 patients from 8 randomized controlled trials were included. The results of our analysis were that tacrolimus reduced the risks after renal transplantation of AR and patient withdrawn. Nevertheless, tacrolimus increased the risk of infection. Pharmacoeconomic analysis showed that tacrolimus represented a more cost-effective treatment than does cyclosporine for the prevention of adverse events after renal transplant. Tacrolimus is an effective and safe immunosuppressive agent, and it may be more cost-effective than cyclosporine for the primary prevention of AR in renal transplant recipients. However, it should be noted that such superiority was reversal when the cost of sirolimus and tacrolimus changed.",2015-01-18926,25569597,Am J Ther,Jin-Yu Liu,2015,/,,No,25569597,"Jin-Yu Liu; Ming Song; Min Guo; Feng Huang; Bing-Jun Ma; Lan Zhu; Gang Xu; Juan Li; Ru-Xu You; Sirolimus Versus Tacrolimus as Primary Immunosuppressant After Renal Transplantation: A Meta-Analysis and Economics Evaluation, Am J Ther, 2015 Jan 7; ():1075-2765",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tacrolimus vs. Sirolimus,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-43346,United States,2013,-48156.62
14673,Costs and benefits of opportunistic salpingectomy as an ovarian cancer prevention strategy,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of opportunistic salpingectomy (elective salpingectomy at hysterectomy or instead of tubal ligation). METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo simulation model estimated the costs and benefits of opportunistic salpingectomy in a hypothetical cohort of women undergoing hysterectomy for benign gynecologic conditions or surgical sterilization. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Effectiveness was measured in terms of life expectancy gain. Sensitivity analyses accounted for uncertainty around various parameters. Monte Carlo simulation estimated the number of ovarian cancer cases associated with each strategy in the Canadian population. RESULTS: Salpingectomy with hysterectomy was less costly ($11,044.32 +/- $1.56) than hysterectomy alone ($11,206.52 +/- $29.81) or with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ($12,626.84 +/- $13.11) but more effective at 21.12 +/- 0.02 years compared with 21.10 +/- 0.03 and 20.94 +/- 0.03 years, representing average gains of 1 week and 2 months, respectively. For surgical sterilization, salpingectomy was more costly ($9,719.52 +/- $3.74) than tubal ligation ($9,339.48 +/- $26.74) but more effective at 22.45 +/- 0.02 years compared with 22.43 +/- 0.02 years (average gain of 1 week) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,278 per year of life gained. Our results were stable over a wide range of costs and risk estimates. Monte Carlo simulation predicted that salpingectomy would reduce ovarian cancer risk by 38.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 36.5-41.3%) and 29.2% (95% CI 28.0-31.4%) compared with hysterectomy alone or tubal ligation, respectively. CONCLUSION: Salpingectomy with hysterectomy for benign conditions will reduce ovarian cancer risk at acceptable cost and is a cost-effective alternative to tubal ligation for sterilization.

14674,A decade of investment in infection prevention: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Health care-associated infection (HAI) rates have fallen with the development of multifaceted infection prevention programs. These programs require ongoing investments, however. Our objective was to examine the cost-effectiveness of hospitals' ongoing investments in HAI prevention in intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: Five years of Medicare data were combined with HAI rates and cost and quality of life estimates drawn from the literature. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and health care expenditures with and without central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and/or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of multifaceted HAI prevention programs, were modeled. RESULTS: Total LYs and QALYs gained per ICU due to infection prevention programs were 15.55 LY and 9.61 QALY for CLABSI and 10.84 LY and 6.55 QALY for VAP. Reductions in index admission ICU costs were $174,713.09 for CLABSI and $163,090.54 for VAP. The ICERs were $14,250.74 per LY gained and $23,277.86 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Multifaceted HAI prevention programs are cost-effective. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining ongoing investments in HAI prevention.

14675,Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib for renal cancer in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Current first-line treatments for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) include the multityrosine kinase inhibitors pazopanib and sunitinib. Both agents had similar progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the COMPARZ trial (Comparing the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Pazopanib versus Sunitinib); however, the adverse event profiles of the 2 agents are different. In the PISCES trial (Patient Preference Study of Pazopanib versus Sunitinib in Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer), patients and physicians preferred pazopanib primarily because it offered better health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and caused less fatigue. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib from a U.S. health care system perspective in the first-line treatment of patients with mRCC. METHODS: A partitioned-survival analysis model with 3 health states (preprogression, postprogression, and dead), data from 2 randomized controlled trials of pazopanib versus sunitinib (COMPARZ and PISCES), and secondary sources were used to calculate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for pazopanib versus sunitinib. A time horizon of 37.5 months was used in the base case, consistent with the duration of follow-up used in the COMPARZ trial. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was based on Kaplan-Meier survival distributions for PFS and OS from the COMPARZ trial. Utility values were obtained from the PISCES trial. Costs were based on medical resource utilization data from the COMPARZ trial and unit costs from secondary sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the base case, pazopanib was estimated to provide more QALYs at a lower cost compared with sunitinib (pazopanib dominant). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, pazopanib was projected to be dominant in 69% of the simulations. The probability that pazopanib was more cost-effective than sunitinib was >/= 90% for threshold values of cost-effectiveness between the range of $10,000-$160,000 per QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, pazopanib was dominant in all scenarios examined. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that pazopanib is cost-effective compared with sunitinib as the first-line treatment of patients with mRCC in the United States.",2015-01-18940,25562772,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,Thomas E Delea,2015,21 / 1,"46-54, 54a-b",No,25562772,"Thomas E Delea; Jordan Amdahl; Jose Diaz; Hamid Reza Nakhaipour; Michelle D Hackshaw; Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib for renal cancer in the United States, J Manag Care Spec Pharm, 2015 Jan; 21(1):2376-1032; 46-54, 54a-b",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pazopanib vs. Sunitinib,Treatment naïve patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,38 Months,3.00,3.00,-75032.97,United States,2013,-83360.27
14676,Toxicity and cost-effectiveness analysis of intensity modulated radiation therapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for postoperative treatment of gynecologic cancers,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate toxicity and cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in the postoperative treatment of uterine and cervical cancer. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2012, eighty patients at our institution received post-hysterectomy 3DCRT (46) or IMRT (34) for uterine or cervical cancer. Baseline characteristics, outcome, and >/=CTCAE grade 2 toxicities were compared between the two groups. Predictors of toxicity-free survival were identified. A decision analysis model was designed to capture individual health states at 1, 2, and 3 years after treatment. Micro-costing technique and estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Utilization of IMRT increased from 25% (2005-2007) to 75% (2008-2012). Recurrence-free and overall survival rates were not different between the two groups. Toxicity rates were reduced with IMRT versus 3DCRT (HR 0.42, p=0.04). Women who received IMRT had numerically lower rates of late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity and significantly lower rates of late overall toxicity at 3 years (16% vs. 45%, p=0.04). On univariate analysis, IMRT was associated with decreased late toxicity (HR 0.43, p=0.04). Treatment costs were higher and toxicity costs were lower with IMRT. IMRT had an ICER of $235,233 (year 1), $114,270 (year 2), and $75,555 (year 3) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: IMRT is associated with reduced late overall toxicity compared to 3DCRT without compromising clinical outcome.

14687,Cost-effectiveness of genotype testing for primary resistance in Brazil,"OBJECTIVE: HIV genotype-resistance testing can help identify more effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens for patients, substantially increasing the likelihood of viral suppression and immune recovery. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of genotype-resistance testing before first-line ART initiation in Brazil. DESIGN: We used a previously published microsimulation model of HIV disease (CEPAC-International) and data from Brazil to compare the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of initial genotype testing (Genotype) with no initial genotype testing (No genotype). METHODS: Model parameters were derived from the HIV Clinical Cohort at the Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute and from published data, using Brazilian sources whenever possible. Baseline patient characteristics included 69% male, mean age of 36 years (SD, 10 years), mean CD4 count of 347 per microliter (SD, 300/microL) at ART initiation, annual ART costs from 2012 US $1400 to US $13,400, genotype test cost of US $230, and primary resistance prevalence of 4.4%. Life expectancy and costs were discounted 3% per year. Genotype was defined as ""cost-effective"" compared with No Genotype if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than 3 times the 2012 Brazilian per capita GDP of US $12,300. RESULTS: Compared with No genotype, Genotype increased life expectancy from 18.45 to 18.47 years and reduced lifetime cost from US $45,000 to $44,770; thus, in the base case, Genotype was cost saving. Genotype was cost-effective at primary resistance prevalence as low as 1.4% and remained cost-effective when subsequent-line ART costs decreased to 30% of baseline value. Cost-inefficient results were observed only when simultaneously holding multiple parameters to extremes of their plausible ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-resistance testing in ART-naive individuals in Brazil will improve survival and decrease costs and should be incorporated into HIV treatment guidelines in Brazil.",2015-01-19006,25415289,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Paula M Luz,2015,68 / 2,152-61,No,25415289,"Paula M Luz; Bethany L Morris; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Kenneth A Freedberg; Valdilea G Veloso; Rochelle P Walensky; Elena Losina; Yoriko M Nakamura; Michael P Girouard; Paul E Sax; Claudio J Struchiner; A David Paltiel; Cost-effectiveness of genotype testing for primary resistance in Brazil, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2015 Feb 1; 68(2):1525-4135; 152-61",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genotype test before first-line antiretroviral treatment initiation vs. Standard/Usual Care- No genotype test before first-line antiretroviral treatment initiation,"Treatment-naïve, mean CD4 count of 347 per microliter (SD, 300/mL) at ART initiation",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2012,Not Stated
14688,Opportunities for improving the efficiency of paediatric HIV treatment programmes,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct two economic analyses addressing whether to: routinely monitor HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinically or with laboratory tests; continue or stop cotrimoxazole prophylaxis when children become stabilized on ART. DESIGN AND METHODS: The ARROW randomized trial investigated alternative strategies to deliver paediatric ART and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 1206 Ugandan/Zimbabwean children. Incremental cost-effectiveness and value of implementation analyses were undertaken. Scenario analyses investigated whether laboratory monitoring (CD4 tests for efficacy monitoring; haematology/biochemistry for toxicity) could be tailored and targeted to be delivered cost-effectively. Cotrimoxazole use was examined in malaria-endemic and non-endemic settings. RESULTS: Using all trial data, clinical monitoring delivered similar health outcomes to routine laboratory monitoring, but at a reduced cost, so was cost-effective. Continuing cotrimoxazole improved health outcomes at reduced costs. Restricting routine CD4 monitoring to after 52 weeks following ART initiation and removing toxicity testing was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6084 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) across all age groups, but was much lower for older children (12+ years at initiation; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $769/QALY). Committing resources to improve cotrimoxazole implementation appears cost-effective. A healthcare system that could pay $600/QALY should be willing to spend up to $12.0 per patient-year to ensure continued provision of cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSION: Clinically driven monitoring of ART is cost-effective in most circumstances.

DESIGN: We used a decision analytic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of no HCV testing referral or offer, off-site HCV testing referral, on-site rapid HCV testing offer and on-site rapid HCV and HIV testing offer. Base case inputs included 11% undetected chronic HCV, 0.4% undetected HIV, 35% HCV co-infection among HIV-infected, 53% linked to HCV care after testing antibody-positive and 67% linked to HIV care. Disease outcomes were estimated from established computer simulation models of HCV [Hepatitis C Cost-Effectiveness (HEP-CE)] and HIV [Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)]. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data on test acceptance and costs were from a national randomized trial of HIV testing strategies conducted at 12 substance abuse treatment programs in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime costs (2011 US$) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 3% annually; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). FINDINGS: On-site rapid HCV testing had an ICER of $18,300/QALY compared with no testing, and was more efficient than (dominated) off-site HCV testing referral. On-site rapid HCV and HIV testing had an ICER of $64,500/QALY compared with on-site rapid HCV testing alone. In one- and two-way sensitivity analyses, the ICER of on-site rapid HCV and HIV testing remained <$100,000/QALY, except when undetected HIV prevalence was <0.1% or when we assumed frequent HIV testing elsewhere. The ICER remained <$100,000/QALY in 91% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
