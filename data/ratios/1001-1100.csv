1001,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of recurrent stroke in the UK. Aspirin, dipyridamole and aspirin-dipyridamole","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness from a UK health and social services perspective of antiplatelet therapies tested in the Second European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS-2) in preventing recurrent stroke. To demonstrate the value of modelling studies in this area. DESIGN AND SETTING: A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate health outcomes and associated costs. Sources of data for efficacy, adverse events, background event risks, disability and mortality were ESPS-2, the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project and UK national statistics. Published national unit costs were applied to clinician panel estimates of resource use for acute stroke, rehabilitation and long term care. Outcome measures were strokes or disabled life-years averted, and disability-free, stroke-free or quality-adjusted life-years gained. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: 30-day survivors of ischaemic stroke treated with low dose aspirin, modified-release dipyridamole; the coformulation of low dose aspirin plus modified-release dipyridamole, or no antiplatelet therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The model predicted that over 5 years the coformulation prevented 29 more strokes than aspirin alone per 1000 patients, at an additional cost of 1900 Pounds per stroke averted (1996 values). Over 5 years, each antiplatelet therapy was cost saving compared with no therapy. Results were sensitive to the cost of acute care, the cost of long term care of disabled stroke survivors, the effectiveness of therapy and the background risk of recurrent stroke. In sensitivity analyses, the cost effectiveness did not exceed 7000 Pounds per stroke averted or 11,000 Pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, except when varying the effectiveness parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Application of a decision-analytic model to the results of ESPS-2 indicated that first-line therapy with the coformulation of modified-release dipyridamole and low dose aspirin to patients with a previous ischaemic stroke is likely to generate significant health benefits at modest extra costs to health and social services. The extra costs of treatment are balanced by the savings in future costs of acute care and long term care of the disabled. Future economic evaluations in this area should pay particular attention to the cost perspective, the duration of analysis, the selection of trials from which effectiveness data are derived, and the impact of the pooling of outcome events with potentially different economic consequences.",1999-01-02060,10662482,Pharmacoeconomics,M Chambers,1999,16 / 5 Pt 2,577-93,Yes,10662482,"M Chambers; J Hutton; J Gladman; Cost-effectiveness analysis of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of recurrent stroke in the UK.

1003,Economic evaluation of ciprofloxacin compared with usual antibacterial care for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in patients followed for 1 year,"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a 1-year prospective economic evaluation of ciprofloxacin compared with usual antibacterial care (any antibacterial other than a quinolone) for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) in adults presenting with a type I or type II AECB. DESIGN: Patients entered the study with an initial AECB and were randomised to the ciprofloxacin group or the usual care group. The following measurements were taken at the end of each AECB and every 3 months: resource utilisation, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, Nottingham Health Profile and Health Utilities Index (HUI). The following additional measurements were taken after each AECB: AECB-symptom days and willingness to pay to avoid the AECB. Economic evaluations were performed from the societal viewpoint and the viewpoint of a major third-party payer. Cost-effectiveness analysis was based on cost per AECB-symptom day averted; cost-utility analysis (CUA) was based on cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using the HUI as the basis for calculating QALYs. Cost-benefit analysis was based on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) data. SETTING: This was a study of outpatients enrolled from 46 family physicians and 2 respirologists in Ontario (29 sites) and QuÃ©bec (19 sites), Canada, between November 1993 and June 1994. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: 240 adult male and female patients aged > or = 18 years with chronic bronchitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: WTP data did not pass scope tests for reasonableness. Ciprofloxacin was more costly and provided better outcomes compared with usual antibacterial care. The base-case results are as follows (1994/1995 values): the incremental annual cost was 578 Canadian dollars ($Can) from the societal viewpoint and $Can840 for the third-party payer; the cost-effectiveness ratio per AECB-symptom day averted was $Can209 from the societal viewpoint and $Can304 for the third-party payer; the cost-utility ratio per QALY gained was $Can18,600 from the societal viewpoint and $Can27,000 for the third-party payer. According to Laupacis criteria, these CUA results are strong evidence in favour of adoption from the societal viewpoint and moderate evidence in favour from the viewpoint of the third-party payer. A subgroup analysis suggests that ciprofloxacin may be particularly cost effective, even 'win-win', in patients with more severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity analyses indicate that the results are relatively robust. Nevertheless, the statistical uncertainty in the results is sufficient that the findings cannot be accepted unequivocally. A further study with a larger sample size would be useful to confirm (or deny) the findings of this study.",1999-01-02061,10662396,Pharmacoeconomics,G Torrance,1999,16 / 5 Pt 1,499-520,Yes,10662396,"G Torrance; V Walker; R Grossman; J Mukherjee; D Vaughan; J La Forge; N Lampron; Economic evaluation of ciprofloxacin compared with usual antibacterial care for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in patients followed for 1 year, Pharmacoeconomics, 1999-Nov; 16(5 Pt 1):1179-2027; 499-520",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ciprofloxacin vs. Usual antibacterial care (any antibiotics other than ciprofloxacin or a quinolone),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,18588,Canada,1995,23005.94
1004,"Cost effectiveness, quality-adjusted life-years and supportive care. Recombinant human erythropoietin as a treatment of cancer-associated anaemia","OBJECTIVE: To measure the cost effectiveness of a supportive care intervention when the no-treatment option is unrealistic in an analysis of recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) treatment for anaemic patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Further, to assess whether quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) can provide the basis for an appropriate measure of the value of supportive care interventions. DESIGN: A modelling study drawing cost and effectiveness assumptions from a literature review and from 3 US clinical trials involving more than 4500 patients with cancer who were treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, epoetin and blood transfusions as needed under standard care for patients with cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: When compared with transfusions, epoetin is cost effective under varying assumptions, whether effectiveness is measured by haemoglobin level or quality of life. Specifically, under a base-case scenario, the effectiveness resulting from $US1 spent on standard care can be achieved with only $US0.81 of epoetin care. Due in part to the health-state dependence of the significance patients attach to incremental changes in their responses on the linear analogue scale, cost per QALY results are ambiguous in this supportive care context. CONCLUSIONS: Under a broad range of plausible assumptions, epoetin can be used cost effectively in the treatment of anaemic patients with cancer. Further, QALYs have limited applicability here because, as a short term supportive treatment, epoetin enhances the quality but not the length of life. Future research would benefit from the establishment of consistent values for quality-of-life changes across patients and health status, and the extension of the QALY framework to supportive care.",1999-01-02062,10662393,Pharmacoeconomics,P Y Cremieux,1999,16 / 5 Pt 1,459-72,Yes,10662393,"P Y Cremieux; S N Finkelstein; E R Berndt; J Crawford; M B Slavin; Cost effectiveness, quality-adjusted life-years and supportive care.

1005,Cost-effectiveness of MR imaging and core-needle biopsy in the preoperative work-up of suspicious breast lesions,"PURPOSE: To assess the clinical and economic consequences of the use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and core-needle biopsy (CNB) to avert excisional biopsy (EXB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to compare MR imaging, CNB, and EXB without preoperative testing in a woman with a suspicious breast lesion. Stage-specific cancer prevalence, tumor recurrence, progression rates, and MR imaging and CNB sensitivity and specificity were obtained from the literature. Cost estimates were obtained from the literature and from the Medicare fee schedule. RESULTS: EXB without preoperative testing was associated with the greatest quality-adjusted life expectancy, followed by MR imaging and CNB; life expectancies were 17.409, 17.405, and 17.398 years, respectively. EXB resulted in the greatest lifetime treatment cost ($31,438), followed by MR imaging ($29,072) and CNB ($28,573). Results were robust over a wide range of cancer prevalence, stage distribution, tumor progression rates, and procedure and treatment costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed that preoperative testing was cost-effective, but the choice between MR imaging and CNB was highly dependent on the accuracy of each test and to patient preferences.

In separate cost-effectiveness analyses, hypothetical cohorts of trauma patients from three defined clinical scenarios were considered: high, moderate, and low risk for cervical spine fracture. Outcome measures included cases of paralysis prevented, total cost of screening strategies, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In high-risk patients, screening with CT is a dominant strategy that prevents cases of paralysis and saves money for society. In moderate-risk patients, screening with CT is cost-effective with reference-case assumptions and within the range of most sensitivity analyses.

1011,A cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination strategies against N. meningitidis meningitis in sub-Saharan African countries,"This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness (C/E) of routine vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis. Three different preventive strategies are analyzed: mass vaccination during epidemics (the current standard of care), routine preventive vaccination and a combination strategy of routine vaccination with mass vaccination during epidemics. A Markov model is used to simulate the epidemics of meningitis in a cohort of 5-year old children and compare these different strategies. The results show that mass vaccination strategy is dominated by the two other strategies. The incremental C/E ratios are US$50/QALY for the routine vaccination, and US$199/QALY for the combination strategy. The costs per fatal case averted are US$1161 for the routine vaccination, and US$2397 for the combination strategy. The C/E ratios are sensitive to: the incidence of meningococcal meningitis, the costs of treating cases, the costs of routine vaccination and the costs and effectiveness of mass immunization campaign. However the rank ordering of the strategies is almost never altered. In conclusion, the results of this analysis suggest that mass vaccination in sub-Saharan Africa in case of epidemics should be reconsidered.

Issues not considered in previous management strategies are patient perception of quality of life with a colostomy and the true cost of each therapeutic option, which includes colostomy supplies and costs of colostomy takedown. To evaluate these issues, we performed a cost-utility analysis. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree with 3 options: primary repair, resection and anastomosis, and colostomy. Chance and decision nodes on each decision branch represent injury severity, complications, colostomy takedown, and death. Chance node frequencies and utility assignments were taken from published data. We obtained actual costs for all components of perioperative care. The outcomes reported are cost and quality of life. RESULTS: Colostomy has the least quality of life and the greatest cost. Primary repair and resection each dominate colostomy in the baseline analysis.

1018,The cost-effectiveness of autologous transfusion revisited: implications of an increased risk of bacterial infection with allogeneic transfusion,"BACKGROUND: Previous analyses have found autologous transfusion to be very expensive but have not considered avoidance of postoperative bacterial infections as one of its benefits. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov cohort simulation model compared autologous blood transfusion to allogeneic transfusion in a hypothetical cohort of patients undergoing elective total hip replacement with respect to discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health-care system costs. RESULTS: Assuming a base case rate of serious infection of 3.7 percent, a relative risk of infection of 1.85, and additional costs of $12,980 per infection, autologous transfusion has a cost-effectiveness of $2,470 per QALY. If the relative risk of bacterial infection following allogeneic transfusion exceeds 1.1, the cost-effectiveness of autologous transfusion is less than $50,000 per QALY and if the relative risk exceeds 2.4, autologous transfusion is dominant, resulting in both lower costs and greater QALYs. If there were no increased risk of transfusion, the cost-effectiveness of autologous transfusion would be $3,400,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: If there is only a modest increase in the risk of bacterial infection following allogeneic transfusion, autologous transfusion would result in improved outcomes at a cost of less than $50,000 per QALY. Autologous transfusion would be dominant above a relative risk of infection that is within the range of values observed in randomized controlled trials. However, if there is no increased risk of bacterial infection, autologous transfusion would be a very expensive strategy. Until more definitive data are available on the magnitude and costs of this risk, we advise against prematurely closing the debate about the cost-effectiveness of autologous transfusion.",1999-01-02067,10504114,Transfusion,F A Sonnenberg,1999,39 / 8,808-17,No,10504114,"F A Sonnenberg; P Gregory; R Yomtovian; L B Russell; W Tierney; M Kosmin; J L Carson; The cost-effectiveness of autologous transfusion revisited: implications of an increased risk of bacterial infection with allogeneic transfusion, Transfusion, 1999-Aug; 39(8):0041-1132; 808-17",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous blood donation and transfusion vs. Allogeneic transfusion,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2470,United States,1997,3982.95
1019,Barrett's esophagus: a new look at surveillance based on emerging estimates of cancer risk,"OBJECTIVE: Surveillance of Barrett's patients is recommended, to detect dysplasia and early cancer. The reported risk for developing cancer varies substantially, however. Our previous analysis used an average cancer incidence of 1/75 patient-years (PY). Recent reports suggest that the risk may range from 1/251 to 1/208 PY in combined series of patients with long segment Barrett's esophagus (LSBE, >3 cm), and short segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE), and up to 1% annually in patients with SSBE. Our goal was to consider these new estimates of cancer risk in a cost-utility analysis of surveillance of patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Using our previously published model, we incorporated an average of the recent estimates of cancer risk (0.4% annually, 1/227 PY), and our primary data on quality of life after esophagectomy. We included actual variable (direct) costs and used a discount rate of 5%. From the perspective of an HMO, the model evaluates surveillance every 1-5 yr and no surveillance, with esophagectomy performed if high grade dysplasia is diagnosed, and calculates the incremental cost-utility ratios for each strategy. RESULTS: The results suggest that, at our baseline, annual cancer risk surveillance every 5 yr is the only viable strategy. More frequent surveillance costs more and yields a lower life expectancy. The incremental cost-utility ratio for surveillance every 5 yr is $98,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, comparable to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of accepted practices (heart transplantation and screening for tuberculosis in selected populations, $160,000/LY gained and $216,000/LY gained, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of Barrett's patients should extend life, with incremental cost-utility ratios that compare favorably with some accepted medical practices.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the net health consequences, costs, and cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies for cervical neoplasia and cancer in HIV-infected women. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective done by using a state-transition Markov model. Values for incidence, progression, and regression of cervical neoplasia; efficacy of screening and treatment; progression of HIV disease; mortality from HIV infection and cancer; quality of life; and costs were obtained from the literature. SETTING: Simulated clinical practice in the United States. PATIENTS: HIV-infected women representative of the U.S. population. INTERVENTION: Six main screening strategies--no screening, annual Papanicolaou smears, annual Papanicolaou smears after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart (recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), semiannual Papanicolaou smears, annual colposcopy, and semiannual colposcopy--were considered. MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Annual Papanicolaou smear screening resulted in a 2.1-month gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an incremental cost of $12,800 per QALY saved. Annual Papanicolaou smear screening after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart provided an additional 0.04 QALYs at a cost of $14,800 per QALY saved.

MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Annual Papanicolaou smear screening resulted in a 2.1-month gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an incremental cost of $12,800 per QALY saved. Annual Papanicolaou smear screening after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart provided an additional 0.04 QALYs at a cost of $14,800 per QALY saved.

1037,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of postmastectomy radiation therapy,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of postmastectomy local-regional radiation therapy (RT) for patients with breast cancer with regard to local-regional relapse (LRR) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data from the literature are used to estimate the risk of LRR, and the impact of RT on the risk of LRR and survival. The risk of LRR is related linearly to the number of positive axillary nodes 1% rate of LRR = 10 + (4 x number of positive nodes)]. RT reduces the risk of LRR by 67%. LRRs are treated with excision or biopsy followed by RT; half being controlled locally and half receiving additional salvage surgery and chemotherapy. Absolute improvements in 10-year overall survival due to RT are assumed to vary between 1 and 12%; and accrue linearly during the initial 10-year follow-up period. Professional and technical charges are used as a surrogate for costs. Money spent and benefits recognized in future years are discounted to 1997 values using a 3% annual rate. Quality factors are used to adjust for treatment, disease, and toxicity status. RESULTS: The cost per LRR prevented with the addition of routine postmastectomy RT is highly dependent upon the number of positive axillary nodes and ranges from $100,000-$200,000 for patients with 0-2 nodes, and $25,000-$75,000 for > or = 4 nodes. The cost per QALY gained at 10 years is $10,000-$110,000 for survival benefits > or = 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The cost per LRR prevented decreases with increasing numbers of positive axillary nodes. There is not a sharp cutoff at the < or = 3 vs. > or = 4 lymph node number, suggesting that using this cutoff for recommending or not recommending RT following mastectomy is not economically logical. The cost per QALY of $10,000-$100,000 compares favorably to that of other accepted medical procedures. Modest changes in the quantitative assumptions do not qualitatively alter the results.

1038,"Cost-utility analysis of chemotherapy using paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinorelbine for patients with anthracycline-resistant breast cancer","PURPOSE: Paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vinorelbine have been approved for chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer that is resistant to anthracyclines. Selecting which agent to use is difficult because each possesses advantages and disadvantages related to clinical response, toxicity, method of administration, and cost. A cost-utility analysis was therefore performed to create a rank order on the basis of effectiveness, quality of life, and economic considerations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight anthracycline-resistant breast cancer patients who had received paclitaxel (n = 34), docetaxel (n = 29), or vinorelbine (n = 25) during the past 2 years were identified. Total resource consumption was collected, which included expenditures for chemotherapy, supportive care, laboratory tests, management of adverse effects, and all related physician fees. Utilities from 25 oncology care providers and 25 breast cancer patients were estimated using the time trade-off technique. The economic estimates from the chart review and clinical data from the literature were then modeled using the principles of decision analysis. RESULTS: Each of the three drugs led to a similar duration of quality-adjusted progression-free survival (paclitaxel, 37.2 days; docetaxel, 33.6 days; vinorelbine, 38.0 days). Vinorelbine was the least costly strategy, with an overall treatment expenditure of Can $3,259 per patient, compared with Can $6,039 and Can $10,090 for paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively. CONCLUSION: Palliative chemotherapy with vinorelbine in anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer patients has economic advantages over the taxanes and provides at least equivalent quality-adjusted progression-free survival.

1041,What is the cost utility of screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in intravenous drug users?,"OBJECTIVES: To model the likely cost utility of the prevalence round of a screening programme for hepatitis C (HCV) in intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in contact with services in the South and West health region of the UK. METHODS: Information on the prevalence of HCV, performance of diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of interferon alpha (IFN alpha) for treatment of chronic hepatitis were brought together with estimates of the costs of service provision. A simple spreadsheet model was used to estimate cost utility (cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY)). Assumptions (including use of ribavirin plus IFN alpha combination therapy) were tested by a one way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: About 5600 IVDUs live in the region. A combination of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting HCV. There is excellent evidence that IFN alpha is effective in producing sustained normalisation of liver function and, by inference, eradicating HCV. Evidence for long term benefits comes from modelling studies based on progression of HBV or non-A, non-B hepatitis and is considerably less robust. The cost of the prevalence round of screening in IVDUs would be about 700,000 Pounds and is likely to identify about 1400 people, of whom about 270 would be eligible for treatment and 20 would respond to IFN alpha. This gives a cost/QALY of 9300 Pounds for the screening programme. However, much uncertainty around the estimates used to inform the cost utility calculation limits confidence in the value of screening IVDUs for HCV. Sensitivity analysis shows a range of possible cost utility from 3333 Pounds to 81,438 Pounds. Estimates are particularly sensitive to adherence to liver biopsy and treatment and to discounting of benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Although potentially cost effective, many important uncertainties surround the assumptions used to estimate the long term effectiveness of screening and treatment. There is insufficient evidence to inform policy development and further research is required in this rapidly changing field.",1999-01-02073,10572842,J Med Screen,P Leal,1999,6 / 3,124-31,No,10572842,"P Leal; K Stein; W Rosenberg; What is the cost utility of screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in intravenous drug users?, J Med Screen, 1999; 6(3):0969-1413; 124-31",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,HCV Screening vs. Unclear,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,6.00,6.00,66546,United Kingdom,1997,175730.39
1042,The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in homosexual and bisexual HIV-positive men,"CONTEXT: Homosexual and bisexual men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for human papillomavirus-related anal neoplasia and anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men foranal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL) and anal SCC. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis performed from a societal perspective that used reference case recommendations from the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. A state-transition Markov model was developed to calculate lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy for no screening vs several screening strategies for ASIL and anal SCC using anal Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at different intervals. Values for incidence, progression, and regression of anal neoplasia; efficacy of screening and treatment; natural history of HIV; health-related quality of life; and costs were obtained from the literature. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of homosexual and bisexual HIV-positive men living in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, quality-adjusted years of life saved, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Screening for ASIL increased quality-adjusted life expectancy at all stages of HIV disease. Screening with anal Pap tests every 2 years, beginning in early HIV disease (CD4 cell count >0.50 x 10(9)/L), resulted in a 2.7-month gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. Screening with anal Pap tests yearly provided additional benefit at an incremental cost of $16,600 per quality-adjusted life year saved. If screening was not initiated until later in the course of HIV disease (CD4 cell count <0.50 x 10(9)/L), then yearly Pap test screening was preferred due to the greater amount of prevalent anal disease (cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $25,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved compared with no screening). Screening every 6 months provided little additional benefit over that of yearly screening. Results were most sensitive to the rate of progression of ASIL to anal SCC and the effectiveness of treatment of precancerous lesions.

A state-transition Markov model was developed to calculate lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy for no screening vs several screening strategies for ASIL and anal SCC using anal Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at different intervals. Values for incidence, progression, and regression of anal neoplasia; efficacy of screening and treatment; natural history of HIV; health-related quality of life; and costs were obtained from the literature. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of homosexual and bisexual HIV-positive men living in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, quality-adjusted years of life saved, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Screening for ASIL increased quality-adjusted life expectancy at all stages of HIV disease. Screening with anal Pap tests every 2 years, beginning in early HIV disease (CD4 cell count >0.50 x 10(9)/L), resulted in a 2.7-month gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. Screening with anal Pap tests yearly provided additional benefit at an incremental cost of $16,600 per quality-adjusted life year saved. If screening was not initiated until later in the course of HIV disease (CD4 cell count <0.50 x 10(9)/L), then yearly Pap test screening was preferred due to the greater amount of prevalent anal disease (cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $25,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved compared with no screening). Screening every 6 months provided little additional benefit over that of yearly screening. Results were most sensitive to the rate of progression of ASIL to anal SCC and the effectiveness of treatment of precancerous lesions.

1054,Hepatitis C: an economic evaluation of extended treatment with interferon,"OBJECTIVES: To re-evaluate the cost effectiveness of treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with interferon alfa (IF alpha) in Australia, taking into account changes in clinical practice. DESIGN: A decision-analytic method (Markov model) was used to simulate the costs and effects of 6 months and 12 months of treatment with IF alpha versus no treatment (conventional management). Both costs and effects were modelled over 30 years. DATA SOURCES: Published meta-analysis of the effectiveness of treatment, professional judgement about treatment protocols, scheduled medical fees, diagnosis-related costs for hospital admission, and a literature search for quality-of-life weights. PATIENTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients with chronic HCV infection aged 40 years at the start of treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs per life-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, IF alpha treatment for 6 months results in an extra 94.2 life-years or 320.1 QALYs at an extra cost of $1.8 million (after discounting at 3%) in a cohort of 1000 patients. Discounted cost per life-year gained is $19,110, which is about a quarter of the cost reported in 1994. The discounted cost per QALY gained is $5625.

1056,A cost-effectiveness analysis of axillary node dissection in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and clinically negative axillary nodes,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of immediate axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in estrogen receptor-positive women with clinically negative nodes. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model comparing hypothetical cohorts of postmenopausal women who were estrogen receptor positive with clinically negative axillae. The women underwent immediate ALND or watchful waiting, with ALND performed only for those patients developing palpable axillary nodes. Recurrence risks, chemotherapeutic benefits, and treatment costs were estimated from the published literature. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted survival and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: For 55-year-old women with palpable (3 cm) tumors, immediate ALND results in improved survival (10.3 versus 10.05 QALYs) and a cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,700 per QALY, if chemotherapy is given to those with histologically positive lymph nodes. The benefits of ALND are greatest for younger women with larger palpable tumors. Because of the lower risk of nodal metastases, patients with 1-cm nonpalpable tumors experience minimal benefit at markedly higher incremental costs ($308,000 per QALY). If chemotherapy will not be given to patients with histologically positive lymph nodes because of a patient's or a physician's wishes, then there is no benefit to immediate ALND in any patient subgroup. CONCLUSION: When the results of ALND are used to guide postoperative decisions, immediate ALND results in considerable benefit at a reasonable cost for most women with palpable tumors. Because the benefits are lower in patients with nonpalpable tumors, ALND should not be considered mandatory for that subgroup.

1058,Cost utility analysis of prophylactic pamidronate for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced breast cancer,"Metastatic bone disease is a common complication of advanced breast cancer. Recently, the results of a large randomized placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that monthly pamidronate infusions reduce the incidence of skeletal related events in these patients. In the current study, a cost-utility analysis was performed from a Canadian health care system perspective to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of pamidronate in patients with advanced breast cancer. Twenty-five advanced breast cancer patients who were bisphosphonate naYve and had developed skeletal related complications were identified. Total hospital resource consumption was then collected for all patients. This included direct costs for hospitalization and costs for radiation treatment to bone, surgery, analgesics, blood products, diagnostic imaging, paramedical services and all related physician fees. Treatment preferences were estimated from a random sample of 25 women selected from the general population and 25 female health care professionals, using the Time Trade-Off technique. The outcomes were then generated through a decision-analytic model. Over a 12-month period, total costs in the pamidronate arm were approximately 44% higher than those in the no-treatment alternative (Can$ 9,180 vs Can$ 6,380). When treatment preferences were incorporated into the analysis, the results of the decision model revealed an incremental pamidronate cost of $18,700 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggested that this estimate was dependent on the cost of treating skeletal related events, particularly bone surgery. Even though pamidronate has a high drug acquisition cost, the results of the cost-utility analysis suggest that this agent does provide patients with a substantial quality-adjusted survival benefit at a reasonable cost to the Canadian health care system.",1999-01-02077,10423054,Support Care Cancer,G Dranitsaris,1999,7 / 4,271-9,No,10423054,"G Dranitsaris; T Hsu; Cost utility analysis of prophylactic pamidronate for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced breast cancer, Support Care Cancer, 1999-Jul; 7(4):0941-4355; 271-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic promidronate infusions vs. No prophylactic treatment for skeletal related events (placebo),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,18700,Canada,1997,21778.11

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov decision-analytic model to determine the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis relative to surgery for a hypothetical cohort of patients with acute lower extremity arterial occlusion. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), defined as the incremental lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Estimates of 1-year outcomes were based on the TOPAS trial: mortality (lysis, 20%; surgery, 17%), amputation (lysis, 15%; surgery, 13%), the number of additional interventions required following the initial procedure (lysis, 544; surgery, 439). Procedural costs were estimated from the cost accounting system at the New York Presbyterian Hospital as well as from the literature. RESULTS: Operative intervention for acute lower extremity arterial occlusion extended life and was less costly compared to thrombolysis. The projected life expectancy for patients who underwent initial surgery was 5.04 years versus 4.75 years for initial thrombolysis. The lifetime costs were $57,429 for surgery versus $dollar;76,326 for thrombolysis. In performing sensitivity analyses, a threshold CER of $60,000 was considered what society would pay for accepted medical interventions. Thrombolysis became cost-effective if the 1-year mortality rate for lysis was lowered from 20 to 10.7%, if the amputation rate for lysis diminished from 15 to 3.9%, or if the 1-year cost of lysis could be reduced to a level below $13,000. CONCLUSIONS: Initial surgery provides the most efficient and economical utilization of resources for acute lower extremity arterial occlusion. The high cost of thrombolysis is related to the expense of the lytic agents, the need for subsequent interventions in patients treated with initial lysis, and the long-term costs of amputation in patients who fail lytic therapy.",1999-01-02078,10329103,J Surg Res,S T Patel,1999,83 / 2,106-12,No,10329103,"S T Patel; P B Haser; H L Bush; K C Kent; Is thrombolysis of lower extremity acute arterial occlusion cost-effective?, J Surg Res, 1999-May-15; 83(2):0022-4804; 106-12",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thrombolysis vs. Surgery,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-65162.07,United States,1997,-105075.76
1060,Cost-effectiveness of transfusing virus-inactivated plasma instead of standard plasma,"BACKGROUND: Virus inactivation of plasma intended for transfusion avoids the transmission of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. However, because most plasma recipients also receive other blood components concomitantly, the procedure reduces but cannot eliminate the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. As virus-inactivated plasma has just been licensed in the United States and other countries, a cost-effectiveness analysis is pertinent. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov model representing the possible outcomes of plasma recipients was used to derive costs and utilities of transfusing virus-inactivated plasma instead of standard plasma. Probability distributions for patients' age and sex and for the number of blood components transfused per case were determined in 924 plasma recipients in a tertiary-care hospital. Other values were obtained from the medical literature. Results of the baseline and sensitivity analyses are the mean (+/- SD) of 10 simulations with 10(7) patients per simulation. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, transfusing virus-inactivated plasma instead of standard plasma prolonged the quality-adjusted survival by 1 hour and 11 minutes per patient, at a cost-effectiveness ratio of $2,156,398 +/- $257,587 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the patients' mean age, the incremental cost per unit of virus-inactivated plasma, the HIV and hepatitis C virus transmission rates, and the short-term mortality of plasma recipients due to their underlying diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to most accepted medical procedures, the transfusion of virus-inactivated plasma produces little health benefit at a very high cost. This poor cost-effectiveness ratio is due to the low current risk of infection with transfusion-transmitted viruses and to the greater age and poor short-term prognosis of most plasma recipients.",1999-01-02079,10335997,Transfusion,A Pereira,1999,39 / 5,479-87,No,10335997,"A Pereira; Cost-effectiveness of transfusing virus-inactivated plasma instead of standard plasma, Transfusion, 1999-May; 39(5):0041-1132; 479-87",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transfusion of virus inactivated plasma vs. Transfusion of standard plasma,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,2156398,United States,1997,3477255.59

1077,Tuberculosis preventive therapy for HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa is cost-effective,"OBJECTIVE: Since antiretroviral therapy is largely unavailable to HIV-infected patients in developing countries and recent clinical trials have shown that tuberculosis (TB) preventive therapy can reduce TB and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality, we studied the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TB preventive therapy for HIV-infected persons in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A Markov model that used results of clinical trials of TB preventive therapy in sub-Saharan Africa and literature-derived medical care costs was used to evaluate three preventive therapy regimens in HIV-infected, tuberculin-positive patients in Uganda: (1) daily isoniazid (INH) for 6 months, (2) daily INH and rifampin (RIF) for 3 months, and (3) twice-weekly RIF and pyrazinamide (PZA) for 2 months. RESULTS: All three regimens extend life expectancy and reduce the number of TB cases. When only medical care costs are considered, all three preventive therapy regimens cost more than not providing preventive therapy to extend life and prevent active tuberculosis. When medical care and social costs are considered together, 6-months of daily INH treatment will save money relative to no preventive therapy and when the costs associated with treating secondary infections are included, all three preventive therapy regimens are less expensive than no preventive therapy. With the inclusion of secondary infection costs, 6 months of daily INH results in savings of $24.16 per person.

1080,Screening for malignant melanoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Increasing evidence suggests that screening for malignant melanoma is effective, but its cost-effectiveness has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: We attempted to determine the effectiveness and costs of a visual screen to diagnose malignant melanoma in high-risk persons. METHODS: We developed a decision analysis comparing no skin cancer screen with a single screen by a dermatologist. Clinical outcomes included malignant melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, or no skin cancer. Life expectancy and costs of care were projected on the basis of clinical findings. RESULTS: Skin cancer screening increased average discounted life expectancy from 15.0963 years to 15.0975 years. Based on the prevalence of malignant melanoma, however, this translates into an increased discounted life expectancy of 0.9231 years for each person with diagnosed melanoma. Using a cost of $30 per screen, total skin cancer-related costs for a cohort of 1 million people increased from $826 million with no screen to $861 million with screening, with an increase of 1200 years of life. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $29,170 per year of life saved (YLS) with screening. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness ratio for screening remained below $50,000/YLS if the prevalence of melanoma in the screened population was at least 0. 0009, the probability that a melanoma detected in screening was localized was at least 94.8%, or the cost of each screen was below $57. CONCLUSION: Skin cancer screening in high-risk patients is likely to be associated with a small increase in discounted life expectancy and is reasonably cost-effective compared with other cancer screening strategies.",1999-01-02082,10534637,J Am Acad Dermatol,K A Freedberg,1999,41 / 5 Pt 1,738-45,No,10534637,"K A Freedberg; A C Geller; D R Miller; R A Lew; H K Koh; Screening for malignant melanoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis, J Am Acad Dermatol, 1999-Nov; 41(5 Pt 1):0190-9622; 738-45",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,One-time visual screening examination by a dermatologist vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,21 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,30360,United States,1996,50079.68
1081,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms. A mathematical model","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysmal rupture is a major cause of cerebrovascular disease-related death. This problem could be eliminated by diagnosis and successful treatment of aneurysms before rupture. Recent developments in high-resolution imaging technology have made screening for unruptured aneurysms possible in the general population. Such screening has become widespread in Japan (""No Dokku, "" or brain checkup). As a result, unruptured aneurysms are being identified with increasing frequency. However, the economic implications of treatment decisions for unruptured aneurysms have not been analyzed. Therefore, we performed such an analysis. METHODS: We used a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The model involved a set of variables describing discrete health states. Each state was assigned a quality of life score and an associated medical cost. A comparison of the expected outcomes was then made between 2 hypothetical cohorts, one receiving screening and the other no screening. A sensitivity analysis was performed by altering the input values within clinically reasonable ranges to reflect uncertainty in the baseline analysis and then assessing the effects on outcomes. RESULTS: Combining the incremental cost and effectiveness data revealed a cost per quality-adjusted life-year of $7760 for an annual rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to unruptured aneurysms (rupture rate) of 0.02; this cost was $39 450 for a rupture rate of 0.01. There was no benefit (negative quality-adjusted life-year benefit) for a rupture rate of 0.005, the rupture rate found in a recently published international cooperative study. The risks of surgery for unruptured aneurysms and the discounting ratio used to assess the impact of timing of costs and benefits on future outcomes also had significant effects on the results. Other variables had little impact on cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of screening for an unruptured aneurysm is highly sensitive to the annual rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to unruptured aneurysms. The low annual rupture rate seen in the recent large international cooperative study implies that screening asymptomatic populations to identify and treat unruptured aneurysms would not be cost cost-effective.",1999-01-02083,10436111,Stroke,Y Yoshimoto,1999,30 / 8,1621-7,No,10436111,"Y Yoshimoto; S Wakai; Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

1083,The cost effectiveness of testing for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility genes,"We evaluated the cost effectiveness of testing women for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. A Markov decision model is used to simulate the expected costs and benefits of testing. The model incorporates estimates of the likelihood of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer, survival, and quality of life. We obtained cost data and values for model parameters from public sources. Post test options include immediate or delayed prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, oophorectomy, both mastectomy and oophorectomy, both mastectomy and oophorectomy, or taking no action. We calculated the cost effectiveness of testing from the societal perspective as the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year saved in 30 year old women and varying levels of hereditary risk. For women with the average population risk, the cost effectiveness of testing is $1.6 million per quality adjusted life year gained. For women with a slightly elevated risk of carrying a mutation (0.05 probability for both BRCA1 and BRCA2), cost effectiveness drops to $34,000/quality adjusted life year. For women at moderate risk (0.1 probability), cost effectiveness is $15,000/quality adjusted life year. For women at high risk, cost effectiveness ranges from $3500-$4900/quality adjusted life year depending upon whether they are at high risk for mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2.

1087,The cost effectiveness of testing for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility genes,"We evaluated the cost effectiveness of testing women for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. A Markov decision model is used to simulate the expected costs and benefits of testing. The model incorporates estimates of the likelihood of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer, survival, and quality of life. We obtained cost data and values for model parameters from public sources. Post test options include immediate or delayed prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, oophorectomy, both mastectomy and oophorectomy, both mastectomy and oophorectomy, or taking no action. We calculated the cost effectiveness of testing from the societal perspective as the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year saved in 30 year old women and varying levels of hereditary risk. For women with the average population risk, the cost effectiveness of testing is $1.6 million per quality adjusted life year gained. For women with a slightly elevated risk of carrying a mutation (0.05 probability for both BRCA1 and BRCA2), cost effectiveness drops to $34,000/quality adjusted life year. For women at moderate risk (0.1 probability), cost effectiveness is $15,000/quality adjusted life year. For women at high risk, cost effectiveness ranges from $3500-$4900/quality adjusted life year depending upon whether they are at high risk for mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2.

1089,The cost-effectiveness of expanded HIV counselling and testing in primary care settings: a first look,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of approaches to expanded HIV counselling and testing. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Primary care practices in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: New patient visits. INTERVENTIONS: Two approaches were examined: (i) requesting all patients to complete an HIV-risk screening instrument, with counselling as well as testing offered only to patients disclosing risk factors ('risk histories' option); and (ii) routine offering of voluntary testing to all patients, with consent obtained but no pre-test counselling ('routine testing'). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the cost per infection identified. We also examined: (i) the costs and numbers of infections averted if individuals change their risk behaviours; and (ii) the additional years of life and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained as a result of earlier HIV testing and treatment for infected individuals. RESULTS: Routine testing is the most cost-effective approach to identifying infected individuals at an incremental cost of US$4200 per infection identified. Although using risk histories is more costly and less effective than routine testing, it becomes similarly cost-effective using plausible ranges for sensitivity analyses. If at least 10% of HIV-positive individuals change their behavior, both routine testing and using risk histories would save money. If testing identifies infected individuals one year earlier than they otherwise would have been diagnosed, routine testing would cost US$22000 per QALY gained.

1092,The cost-effectiveness of elective Cesarean delivery for HIV-infected women with detectable HIV RNA during pregnancy,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the net health consequences, costs, and cost-effectiveness of alternative delivery strategies for HIV-infected pregnant women with detectable HIV RNA in the USA. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a probabilistic decision model. METHODS: The model compared two strategies: elective Cesarean section and vaginal delivery. Data for HIV transmission rate, maternal death rate, health-related quality of life and costs were obtained from the literature, national databases, and a tertiary hospital's cost accounting system. Model outcomes included total lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, maternal death rate, HIV transmission rate, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Elective Cesarean section resulted in a vertical HIV transmission rate of 34.9 per 1000 births compared with 62.3 per 1000 births for vaginal delivery. Elective Cesarean section was more effective (38.7 quality adjusted life years per mother and child pair) and less costly ($10600 per delivery) than trial of labor (38.2 combined quality adjusted life years at a cost of $14500 per delivery). However, elective Cesarean section increased maternal mortality by 2.4 deaths per 100000 deliveries. The results were consistent over a wide range of the variables, but were sensitive to the risk of HIV transmission with vaginal delivery and the relative risk of HIV transmission with elective Cesarean section. CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant HIV-infected women with detectable HIV RNA, elective Cesarean section would reduce total costs and increase overall quality-adjusted life expectancy for the mother-child pair, albeit at a slight loss of quality adjusted life expectancy to the mother.",2000-01-02085,11101066,AIDS,J M Mrus,2000,14 / 16,2543-52,No,11101066,"J M Mrus; S J Goldie; M C Weinstein; J Tsevat; The cost-effectiveness of elective Cesarean delivery for HIV-infected women with detectable HIV RNA during pregnancy, AIDS, 2000-Nov-10; 14(16):0269-9370; 2543-52",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Elective Cesarean section vs. Vaginal delivery,Not Stated,25 Years,25 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-7800,United States,1997,-12577.73
1093,Cost-effectiveness of an HIV risk reduction intervention for adults with severe mental illness,"Small-group HIV prevention interventions that focus on individual behavioural change have been shown to be especially effective in reducing HIV risk among persons with severe mental illness. Because economic resources to fund HIV prevention efforts are limited, health departments, community planning groups and other key decision-makers need reliable information on the cost and cost-effectiveness (not solely on effectiveness) of different HIV prevention interventions. This study used an economic evaluation technique known as cost-utility analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of three related cognitive-behavioural HIV risk reduction interventions: a single-session, one-on-one intervention; a multi-session small-group intervention; and a multi-session small-group intervention that taught participants to act as safer sex advocates to their peers. For men, all three interventions were cost-effective, but advocacy training was the most cost-effective of the three. For women, only the single-session intervention was cost-effective.

1095,Cost utility analysis of radiographic screening for an orbital foreign body before MR imaging,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of clinical versus radiographic screening for an orbital foreign body before MR imaging. METHODS: Costs of screening were determined on the basis of published reports, disability rating guides, and a practice survey. Base case estimates were derived from published guidelines. A single-state change model was constructed using social cost as the unit of analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed for each variable. The benefit of screening was avoidance of immediate, permanent, nonameliorable, unilateral blindness. RESULTS: Using base case estimates and a discount rate of zero, we calculated the cost of the current guideline as $328,580 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Sensitivity analysis identified screening cost as a critical variable. Discount rates and effectiveness of foreign body removal also were found to be important factors. Probability of injury and prevalence of foreign body may impact the analysis. CONCLUSION: Clinical screening before radiography increases the cost-effectiveness of foreign body screening by an order of magnitude, assuming base case ocular foreign body removal rates. Asking the patient ""Did a doctor get it all out?"" serves this purpose. Occupational history by itself is not sufficient to mandate radiographic orbital screening. Current practice guidelines for foreign body screening should be altered.",2000-01-02087,10696035,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,D J Seidenwurm,2000,21 / 2,426-33,No,10696035,"D J Seidenwurm; C H McDonnell; N Raghavan; J Breslau; Cost utility analysis of radiographic screening for an orbital foreign body before MR imaging, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, 2000-Feb; 21(2):0195-6108; 426-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radiographic screening for orbital foreign body before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) vs. Clinical screening for orbital foreign body before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,328580,United States,1998,521718.52
1096,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous treatment of iliac artery occlusive disease in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: The costs of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement for iliac artery occlusive disease in the United States were assessed and the cost-effectiveness was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy were estimated using a Markov decision model for a hypothetic cohort of patients with life-style-limiting claudication caused by an iliac artery stenosis for whom a percutaneous intervention was indicated. Various percutaneous treatment strategies were evaluated, each consisting of an initial intervention followed by a secondary intervention. Procedures considered were angioplasty alone and angioplasty with selective stent placement. RESULTS: From the perspective of the interventional radiology department, angioplasty with selective stent placement costs more than angioplasty alone ($2926 versus $2106). Taking into account follow-up costs and procedures for long-term failures, the cost differential was reduced because of a lower failure rate of selective stent placement ($13,158 versus $12,458, respectively). Treatment strategies using angioplasty with selective stent placement (as an initial procedure or including reintervention) dominated treatment strategies using angioplasty alone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $7,624-8,519 per quality-adjusted life-year gained).

CONCLUSION: Angioplasty with selective stent placement is a cost-effective treatment strategy compared with angioplasty alone in the treatment of intermittent claudication in the United States.",2000-01-02088,10915706,AJR Am J Roentgenol,J L Bosch,2000,175 / 2,517-21,No,10915706,"J L Bosch; C Haaring; M F Meyerovitz; K A Cullen; M G Hunink; Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous treatment of iliac artery occlusive disease in the United States, AJR Am J Roentgenol, 2000-Aug; 175(2):0361-803X; 517-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Angioplasty with selective stent placement, initially and for long-term failure vs. Initial angioplasty, then angioplasty with selected stent placement for long-term failure",Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,1480.09,United States,1998,2350.08
