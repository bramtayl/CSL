21501,Cost-utility analysis of germline BRCA1/2 testing in women with high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer in Spain,"PURPOSE: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes (gBRCA1/2m) are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC). The aim of this study was to estimate the efficiency of providing germline BRCA1/2 testing to high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (HGEOC) patients without family history of OC or BC and the subsequent testing and management of their relatives with gBRCA1/2m in Spain. METHODS/PATIENTS: Incident HGEOC patients without family history of OC or BC who were gBRCA1/2m carriers and their relatives were simulated in a 50-year time horizon. The study compared two scenarios: BRCA1/2 testing vs no testing, using the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. Cancer risk among gBRCA1/2m carriers was estimated based on their age and whether they had undergone risk-reducing surgeries. Direct healthcare costs and utilities of patients who developed EOC and BC were also included. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) with 5 thousand simulations was developed considering +/- 25% of the base-case value. RESULTS: The BRCA1/2-testing scenario amounted to euro13,437,897.43 while the no-testing scenario amounted to euro12,053,291.17. It was estimated that the screening test improved the quality of life among the patients'' relatives by 43.8 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was euro31,621.33/QALY in the base case. The PSA showed that 89.12% of the simulations were below the euro50,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSION: Providing this screening test to HGEOC patients and their relatives is cost-effective and it allows one to identify a target population with high risk of cancer to provide effective prevention strategies.",2019-01-30717,30617925,Clin Transl Oncol,Carlota Moya-Alarcon,2019,21 / 8,1076-1084,No,30617925,"Carlota Moya-Alarcon; Almudena Gonzalez-Dominguez; Susana Simon; Ines Perez-Roman; Antonio Gonzalez-Martin; Eloisa Bayo-Lozano; Ana Beatriz Sanchez-Heras; Cost-utility analysis of germline BRCA1/2 testing in women with high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer in Spain, Clin Transl Oncol, 2019 Aug; 21(8):1699-048X; 1076-1084",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Screening,BRCA1/2 testing vs. Cancer management,High-grade disease without family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,31621.3,Euro,2017,37729.56

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT in the first year of screening compared with alternatives for the 50 states and separately for Puerto Rico. Design: Microsimulation that captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients, sexual partners, and their infants. Data Sources: National testing results compiled by AABB and costs, utilities, and outcome probabilities estimated from the literature. Target Population: Transfusion recipients. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Universal ID-NAT, universal mini-pool NAT (MP-NAT), and ID-NAT exclusively for components transfused to women of childbearing age. Seasonally targeted strategies in Puerto Rico and geographically targeted strategies in the 50 states were also considered. Outcome Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and outcomes. Results of Base-Case Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT exclusively during high mosquito season was cost-effective at $81 123 per QALY (95% CI, -$49 138 to $978 242 per QALY). No screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. Universal ID-NAT cost $341 million per QALY (CI, $125 million to $2.90 billion per QALY) compared with no screening in the 50 states. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT only during the season of high mosquito activity was most cost-effective in 64% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations.

21509,Penicillin skin testing in methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Beta-lactams are the mainstay for treating methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections complicated by bacteremia due to superior outcomes compared with vancomycin. With approximately 11% of inpatients reporting a penicillin (PCN) allergy, many patients receive suboptimal treatment for MSSA bacteremia. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of penicillin skin testing (PST) in adult patients with self-reported PCN allergy in an inpatient setting undergoing treatment for MSSA bacteremia. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed comparing an acute care PST intervention to a scenario with no confirmatory allergy testing. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health-sector perspective over a 1-year time horizon using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the measure for effectiveness. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the ICER estimation. RESULTS: Over a 1-year time horizon, PST services applied to all MSSA bacteremia patients reporting a PCN-allergy would result in a cost per patient of $12,559 and 0.73 QALYs while no PST services would have a higher cost per patient of $13,219 and 0.66 QALYs per patient. This resulted in a cost-effectiveness estimate of -$9,429 per QALY gained. Varying the cost of implementing PST services determined a break-even point of $959.98 where any PST cost less than this amount would actually be cost saving. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reporting a PCN allergy on admission may receive sub-optimal alternative therapies to beta-lactams, such as vancomycin, for MSSA bacteremia. This economic analysis demonstrates that inpatient PST services confirming PCN allergy are cost-effective for patients with MSSA bacteremia.",2019-01-30724,30615655,PLoS One,T Joseph 2nd Mattingly,2019,14 / 1,e0210271,No,30615655,"T Joseph 2nd Mattingly; Stephen Meninger; Emily L Heil; Penicillin skin testing in methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: A cost-effectiveness analysis, PLoS One , 2019; 14(1):1932-6203; e0210271",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,Penicillin Allergy Skin Test vs. Standard/Usual Care- No universal screening on admitted patients with penicillin skin allergy,Before Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia treatment,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-9428.57,United States,2017,-9955.2
21510,Cost-effectiveness of implementing guidelines for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in Japan,"A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing the clinical guideline for the treatment for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO). The treatment indication for GIO in the current Japanese clinical guidelines is likely to be cost-effective except for the limited patients who are at low risk for fracture. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing the clinical guideline for the treatment for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) from the perspective of the Japanese healthcare system. METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was developed to predict lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in postmenopausal Japanese women with osteopenia or osteoporosis using glucocorticoid (GC). An annual discount rate of 2% for both costs and QALYs was applied. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5-year alendronate therapy compared with no therapy was estimated with different combinations of the risk factors such as starting age (45, 55, or 65), femoral neck BMD (% young adult mean (YAM) of 70%, 75%, or 80%), dose of GC (2.5, 5, or 10 mg per day), and the presence of previous fracture (yes or no). RESULTS: For 55-year-old women using GC with a BMD of 75% of YAM, the ICER ranged from $10,958 to $ 29,727 per QALY. Scenario analyses indicated that the lower age, the lower BMD, the higher dose of GC, and the presence of previous fracture associated with lower ICER. The best-case scenario was 45-year-old women with a BMD of 70% of YAM, GC dose of 10 mg per day, and previous fracture, and resulted in healthcare cost-savings. The worst-case scenario was 65-year-old women with a BMD of 80% of YAM, GC dose of 2.5 mg per day, and no previous fracture, and resulted in the ICER of $66,791 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses in the worst-case scenario showed that the annual discount rate for costs and health benefit had the strong influence on the estimated ICER. Although the ICER was influenced by other parameters such as disutility due to vertebral fracture, efficacy of alendronate, and so on, the ICERs remained more than $50,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of preventive alendronate therapy for postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis using GC is sensitive to age, BMD, GC dose, and the presence of previous fracture. Our analysis suggested that the treatment indication for postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis using GC in the current Japanese clinical guidelines is likely to be cost-effective except for the limited patients who are at low risk for fracture.",2019-01-30731,30610244,Osteoporos Int,K Moriwaki,2019,30 / 2,299-310,No,30610244,"K Moriwaki; H Fukuda; Cost-effectiveness of implementing guidelines for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in Japan, Osteoporos Int, 2019 Feb; 30(2):0937-941X; 299-310",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,alendronate vs. None,osteopenia or osteoporosis; using glucocorticoid; no previous fracture; glucocorticoid dose of 2.5mg/day,65 Years,45 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,2.00,2.00,29727,United States,2017,31387.38

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing the clinical guideline for the treatment for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) from the perspective of the Japanese healthcare system. METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was developed to predict lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in postmenopausal Japanese women with osteopenia or osteoporosis using glucocorticoid (GC). An annual discount rate of 2% for both costs and QALYs was applied. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5-year alendronate therapy compared with no therapy was estimated with different combinations of the risk factors such as starting age (45, 55, or 65), femoral neck BMD (% young adult mean (YAM) of 70%, 75%, or 80%), dose of GC (2.5, 5, or 10 mg per day), and the presence of previous fracture (yes or no). RESULTS: For 55-year-old women using GC with a BMD of 75% of YAM, the ICER ranged from $10,958 to $ 29,727 per QALY. Scenario analyses indicated that the lower age, the lower BMD, the higher dose of GC, and the presence of previous fracture associated with lower ICER. The best-case scenario was 45-year-old women with a BMD of 70% of YAM, GC dose of 10 mg per day, and previous fracture, and resulted in healthcare cost-savings.

21516,Optimal gender-specific age for cost-effective vaccination with adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in Chinese adults,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvanted herpes zoster (HZ) subunit (HZ/su) vaccine is recommended for healthy adults aged >/=50 years, yet vaccine efficacy is expected to wane over time. Age-sex specific cost-effectiveness analyses of HZ/su vaccine are warranted to inform decision-making on vaccine policy. We aimed to determine the optimal gender-specific age for cost-effective HZ/su vaccination in Hong Kong. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare outcomes with and without HZ/su in healthy males and females at age 50-80 years. Model outcome measures were total cost, HZ cases, and HZ-associated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss. Incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER) by HZ/su was estimated for each age-sex group. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of model results. RESULTS: HZ/su reduced incidence of HZ in both males and females aged 50-80 years and the numbers needed to vaccinate to avoid one HZ case were lowest at age 60 years for males (6.05) and females (5.50). The highest QALY-saved occurred in females (0.00396 QALYs) and males (0.00379 QALYs) who were vaccinated at 60 years old. The ICERs were lowest at age 60-70 years for both genders. Using 1x gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong (USD46,153) as willingness-to-pay threshold, HZ/su vaccine was accepted to be cost-effective for all female and male age groups at vaccine cost = USD160, for female aged 50-79 years and male aged 54-74 years at vaccine cost = USD200, and for female aged 59-71 years at vaccine cost = USD240. CONCLUSIONS: HZ/su vaccine is more likely to be cost-effective for males and females aged between 60-70 years than the extreme age groups (less than 60 years and older than 70 years) in Hong Kong. The age range for cost-effective acceptance of HZ/su vaccine appears to be broader in females than males given the same vaccine cost and willingness-to-pay threshold.",2019-01-30733,30608953,PLoS One,Joyce H S You,2019,14 / 1,e0210005,No,30608953,"Joyce H S You; Wai-Kit Ming; Owen Tak-Yin Tsang; Paul Kay-Sheung Chan; Optimal gender-specific age for cost-effective vaccination with adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in Chinese adults, PLoS One , 2019; 14(1):1932-6203; e0210005",QALY,China,Not Stated,Immunization,adjuvanted herpes zoster vs. None,Latent herpes zoster virus,80 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,40404.04,United States,2017,42660.78
21517,Cost-Effectiveness of Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Displaced Midshaft Clavicle Fractures: A Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND: While previous studies have shown higher union rates and a quicker return to work with operative treatment of substantially displaced clavicle fractures, there is disagreement whether operative treatment results in improved clinical outcomes. Patients who undergo operative treatment sometimes require additional surgery for implant removal. Nonoperative treatment may fail so that delayed surgical intervention is ultimately required. The duration for which the clinical benefits of operative treatment remain superior to those of nonoperative treatment has not been well established in the literature. Considering these uncertainties, surgeons are faced with a difficult decision regarding whether operative treatment of a midshaft clavicle fracture will be cost-effective. The purpose of this study was to identify the most cost-effective strategy by considering these uncertain parameters with use of decision-analysis techniques. METHODS: An expected-value decision tree was built to estimate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for operative and nonoperative treatment of substantially displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. Values for parameters in the decision model were derived from the literature. Medical costs were obtained from the Medicare database. A Markov model was used to calculate the QALYs for the duration of life expectancy. The decision model was used to analyze the duration for which the clinical results of operative treatment were superior to those of nonoperative treatment during the first 5 years after the operation and during a lifetime. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which parameters have the most influence on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Operative treatment was more cost-effective than nonoperative treatment in 54% and 68% of the Monte Carlo trials in the 5-year and lifetime analyses, respectively. The cost per QALY with operative management was <$38,000 and <$8,000 in the 5-year and lifetime analyses, respectively. This is below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. For operative treatment to remain cost-effective, its clinical benefits must persist for at least 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment is more cost-effective than nonoperative treatment for substantially displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. The clinical benefits derived with operative treatment must persist for at least 3 years for operative treatment to remain cost-effective. This research should not be used to conclude that all clavicle fractures should be treated surgically.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The use of resources, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed in the trial at six months and one year. Results were extrapolated to two years after randomization. Differences between treatment arms, based on the intention-to-treat principle, were adjusted for covariates and missing data were handled using multiple imputation. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, with uncertainty around the values estimated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Cumulative mean QALYs/mean costs of health care service use and surgery per patient from baseline to 12 months were estimated as 0.640 (standard error (se) 0.024)/ pound3147 (se 166) in the decompression arm, 0.656 (se 0.020)/ pound2830 (se 183) in the arthroscopy only arm and 0.522 (se 0.029)/ pound1451 (se 151) in the no treatment arm. Statistically significant differences in cumulative QALYs and costs were found at six and 12 months for the decompression versus no treatment comparison only. The probabilities of decompression being cost-effective compared with no treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per QALY were close to 0% at six months and approximately 50% at one year, with this probability potentially increasing for the extrapolation to two years.

RESULTS: Cumulative mean QALYs/mean costs of health care service use and surgery per patient from baseline to 12 months were estimated as 0.640 (standard error (se) 0.024)/ pound3147 (se 166) in the decompression arm, 0.656 (se 0.020)/ pound2830 (se 183) in the arthroscopy only arm and 0.522 (se 0.029)/ pound1451 (se 151) in the no treatment arm. Statistically significant differences in cumulative QALYs and costs were found at six and 12 months for the decompression versus no treatment comparison only. The probabilities of decompression being cost-effective compared with no treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per QALY were close to 0% at six months and approximately 50% at one year, with this probability potentially increasing for the extrapolation to two years.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The use of resources, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed in the trial at six months and one year. Results were extrapolated to two years after randomization. Differences between treatment arms, based on the intention-to-treat principle, were adjusted for covariates and missing data were handled using multiple imputation.

21523,An economic evaluation of a telephone outcall intervention for informal carers of cancer patients in Australia: An assessment of costs and quality-adjusted-life-years,"OBJECTIVE: Carers of people with cancer provide uncompensated care that is often physically, emotionally, and financially demanding, which results in neglect of their own health. This study''s objective was to conduct an economic evaluation following a randomised control trial (RCT) involving a proactive telephone outcall intervention aimed at improving health outcomes among carers of cancer patients. METHODS: The trial was a single-blind, multicentre, RCT conducted across four Australian health services, comprising three outcalls from trained Cancer Council 131120 (Cancer Council telephone and information support services) nurses compared with three phone call reminders of the availability of 131120 services (control group). Outcalls consisted of telephone contacts to the caregivers initiated by the Cancer Council nurses. The primary trial outcome was reduced carer burden. Health care resource use was measured using a resource use questionnaire (RUQ), and costs were presented in 2013 $(AUS). Quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) were also used as health outcomes. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, with bootstrapping used to quantify sampling variability. A $50 000 per QALY-gained willingness-to-pay threshold was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Results showed that the total mean QALYs-gained were higher (0.02 QALYs, P = 0.01) in the control group, and total mean costs were lower in the control group ($477, P < 0.001) over the trial duration.

21525,Cost-Effectiveness of Alirocumab: A Just-in-Time Analysis Based on the ODYSSEY Outcomes Trial,"Background: The ODYSSEY Outcomes (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial included participants with a recent acute coronary syndrome. Compared with participants receiving statins alone, those receiving a statin plus alirocumab had lower rates of a composite outcome including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death. Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of alirocumab in these circumstances. Design: Decision analysis using the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model. Data Sources: Data sources representative of the United States combined with data from the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial. Target Population: U.S. adults with a recent first MI and a baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 1.81 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or greater. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: U.S. health system. Intervention: Alirocumab or ezetimibe added to statin therapy. Outcome Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in 2018 U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Compared with a statin alone, the addition of ezetimibe cost $81 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], $51 000 to $215 000) per QALY. Compared with a statin alone, the addition of alirocumab cost $308 000 (UI, $197 000 to $678 000) per QALY. Compared with the combination of statin and ezetimibe, replacing ezetimibe with alirocumab cost $997 000 (UI, $254 000 to dominated) per QALY. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: The price of alirocumab would have to decrease from its original cost of $14 560 to $1974 annually to be cost-effective relative to ezetimibe. Limitation: Effectiveness estimates were based on a single randomized trial with a median follow-up of 2.8 years and should not be extrapolated to patients with stable coronary heart disease. Conclusion: The price of alirocumab would have to be reduced considerably to be cost-effective.

21528,Assessing the Value of Sarilumab Monotherapy for Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a societal burden greater than $39 billion annually. Novel treatments, known as targeted immune modulators (TIMs), are expensive but effective, producing improvements in response rates compared with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs). Sarilumab, a TIM approved in 2017, shows superior improvements compared with cDMARDs and produced significantly greater likelihood of achieving response and improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index than adalimumab monotherapy. Although sarilumab monotherapy has shown improvements over cDMARDs and the TIM market leader adalimumab, treatment with sarilumab is costly, with an annual wholesale acquisition cost of $39,000. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of starting treatment with sarilumab monotherapy for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to cDMARDs. METHODS: A sequential treatment cohort model followed a hypothetical cohort from initiation of sarilumab monotherapy until death. The model allowed patients to switch therapies up to 3 times due to effectiveness or adverse events. The first switch was to a TIM within the same treatment category; the second switch was to a TIM within a different treatment category; and the third switch was to a cDMARD. Sarilumab monotherapy was compared with a cDMARD (methotrexate) and the TIM market leader (adalimumab monotherapy). Key risk and benefit evidence came from clinical studies and network meta-analyses of data on radiographic progression and response. We used a lifetime time horizon and the U.S. health sector payer perspective assuming therapy net pricing. We also incorporated loss of productivity to reflect a restricted societal perspective. RESULTS: Over a lifetime time horizon, a treatment pathway starting with sarilumab resulted in 17.16 life-years and 13.66 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Treatment pathways starting with the cDMARD resulted in 16.54 life-years and 11.77 QALYs; treatment pathways starting with adalimumab resulted in 17.05 life-years and 13.35 QALYs. Total costs for sarilumab ($492,000 for payer perspective, $634,000 for societal perspective) were less than total costs for adalimumab ($536,000 for payer perspective, $689,000 for societal perspective) but higher than total costs for the cDMARD ($63,000 for payer perspective, $272,000 for societal perspective). When compared with cDMARD therapy, sarilumab resulted in a cost-effectiveness estimate of $227,000 per QALY gained from the payer perspective and $191,000 per QALYs gained from the societal perspective. When compared with adalimumab, sarilumab was dominant from both perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: Sarilumab resulted in better health outcomes than conventional therapy alone. However, its additional cost with assumed class-level net prices led to cost-effectiveness estimates above commonly cited thresholds. When compared with the market leader, sarilumab achieved favorable value. This evaluation informs stakeholders of the value of sarilumab and its alternatives to promote high value practices in health care.

Key risk and benefit evidence came from clinical studies and network meta-analyses of data on radiographic progression and response. We used a lifetime time horizon and the U.S. health sector payer perspective assuming therapy net pricing. We also incorporated loss of productivity to reflect a restricted societal perspective. RESULTS: Over a lifetime time horizon, a treatment pathway starting with sarilumab resulted in 17.16 life-years and 13.66 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Treatment pathways starting with the cDMARD resulted in 16.54 life-years and 11.77 QALYs; treatment pathways starting with adalimumab resulted in 17.05 life-years and 13.35 QALYs. Total costs for sarilumab ($492,000 for payer perspective, $634,000 for societal perspective) were less than total costs for adalimumab ($536,000 for payer perspective, $689,000 for societal perspective) but higher than total costs for the cDMARD ($63,000 for payer perspective, $272,000 for societal perspective). When compared with cDMARD therapy, sarilumab resulted in a cost-effectiveness estimate of $227,000 per QALY gained from the payer perspective and $191,000 per QALYs gained from the societal perspective. When compared with adalimumab, sarilumab was dominant from both perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: Sarilumab resulted in better health outcomes than conventional therapy alone. However, its additional cost with assumed class-level net prices led to cost-effectiveness estimates above commonly cited thresholds. When compared with the market leader, sarilumab achieved favorable value.

21531,Assessing the Value of Sarilumab Monotherapy for Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a societal burden greater than $39 billion annually. Novel treatments, known as targeted immune modulators (TIMs), are expensive but effective, producing improvements in response rates compared with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs). Sarilumab, a TIM approved in 2017, shows superior improvements compared with cDMARDs and produced significantly greater likelihood of achieving response and improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index than adalimumab monotherapy. Although sarilumab monotherapy has shown improvements over cDMARDs and the TIM market leader adalimumab, treatment with sarilumab is costly, with an annual wholesale acquisition cost of $39,000. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of starting treatment with sarilumab monotherapy for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to cDMARDs. METHODS: A sequential treatment cohort model followed a hypothetical cohort from initiation of sarilumab monotherapy until death. The model allowed patients to switch therapies up to 3 times due to effectiveness or adverse events.

21534,Cost-Effectiveness of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis at Intermediate Risk,"BACKGROUND: In patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) at intermediate surgical risk, treatment with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) results in similar rates of death or stroke at 2 years. Whether TAVR is cost-effective compared with SAVR for intermediate-risk patients remains uncertain. METHODS: Between 2011 and 2014, 3110 intermediate-risk AS patients were treated with TAVR or SAVR in the PARTNER 2 trial (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 2). A total of 2032 patients were randomized to receive TAVR using the SAPIEN XT valve (XT-TAVR) or SAVR in the PARTNER 2A trial, whereas the PARTNER S3i registry included an additional 1078 patients treated with TAVR using the SAPIEN 3 valve (S3-TAVR), which offers a lower delivery profile and sealing skirt designed to reduce paravalvular regurgitation compared with XT-TAVR. Procedural costs were estimated using measured resource utilization. Other in-trial costs were assessed by linkage of trial data with Medicare claims (n=2333) or by linear regression models for unlinked patients (n=682). Health utilities were estimated using the EQ-5D at baseline and 1, 12, and 24 months. Using a Markov model informed by in-trial costs, utilities, and survival data, lifetime cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the US healthcare system was estimated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: Although procedural costs were approximately $20 000 higher with TAVR than SAVR, total cost differences for the index hospitalization were only $2888 higher with XT-TAVR ( P=0.014) and were $4155 lower with S3-TAVR ( P<0.001) owing to reductions in length of stay with TAVR. Follow-up costs were significantly lower with XT-TAVR (Delta=-$9304; P<0.001) and S3-TAVR (Delta=-$11 377; P<0.001) than with SAVR. Over a lifetime horizon, TAVR was projected to lower total costs by $8000 to $10 000 and to increase quality-adjusted survival by 0.15 to 0.27 years. XT-TAVR and S3-TAVR were found to be economically dominant compared with SAVR in 84% and 97% of bootstrap replicates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among intermediate-risk AS patients, TAVR is projected to be economically dominant from the perspective of the US healthcare system by providing both greater quality-adjusted life expectancy and lower long-term costs than SAVR. If long-term data demonstrate comparable late mortality with TAVR and SAVR, these findings suggest that TAVR might be the preferred treatment strategy for intermediate-risk AS patients based on both clinical and economic considerations.

21535,Analysis of Value-Based Costs of Undesignated School Stock Epinephrine Policies for Peanut Anaphylaxis,"Importance: Children experiencing anaphylaxis at school may lack access to a personal epinephrine device, prompting recent legislation permitting undesignated (eg, non-student specific) stock epinephrine autoinjector units at school. However, epinephrine device costs vary, and the cost-effectiveness of undesignated school stock epinephrine is uncharacterized to date. Objective: To define value-based strategies for undesignated school stock epinephrine programs. Design, Setting, and Participants: Markov simulations of the Chicago Public Schools system were used over extended time horizons to model 2 school stock epinephrine autoinjector policies to provide access for at-risk students. The dates of the data used in the analysis were September 2017 to June 2018 (the 2017-2018 school year). Main Outcomes and Measures: This study compared the following 3 strategies: no school undesignated epinephrine supply, school undesignated supplemental epinephrine supply (supplemental model), and school undesignated universal epinephrine supply (universal model). The base-case model assumed a 10-fold reduced fatality risk with having undesignated stock epinephrine units available vs not having undesignated stock epinephrine units available. Costs of school stock epinephrine units available for acquisition by schools were evaluated from a societal perspective. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total epinephrine acquisition expenses were calculated. Results: Based on Markov simulations of the Chicago Public Schools system (371 382 students), the cost was $107816 (95% CI, $107382-$108250) for no school undesignated epinephrine supply compared with $108160 (95% CI, $107725-$108595) for the supplemental model and $100397 (95% CI, $99979-$100815) for the universal model. Undesignated stock epinephrine improved outcomes, with 26.869 (95% CI, 26.841-26.897) QALYs accrued as the model concluded compared with 26.867 (95% CI, 26.839-26.896) QALYs for the strategy without undesignated stock epinephrine. When comparing supplemental model stock epinephrine to the strategy without undesignated devices, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was high at $268811 per QALY in the base-case simulation. However, the cost of the supplemental model fell below $100000 per QALY when the annual undesignated epinephrine acquisition costs did not exceed $338 per school (compared with stock epinephrine unavailability). The universal model dominated all others and was associated with significant cost savings ($7419 per student at risk who would otherwise be prescribed an individual school epinephrine supply).

21537,Is the Cost-Effectiveness of Stroke Thrombolysis Affected by Proportion of Stroke Mimics?,"Background and Purpose- Differentiating ischemic stroke patients from stroke mimics (SM), nonvascular conditions which simulate stroke, can be challenging in the acute setting. We sought to model the cost-effectiveness of treating suspected acute ischemic stroke patients before a definitive diagnosis could be made. We hypothesized that we would identify threshold proportions of SM among suspected stroke patients arriving to an emergency department above which administration of intravenous thrombolysis was no longer cost-effective. Methods- We constructed a decision-analytic model to examine various emergency department thrombolytic treatment scenarios. The main variables were proportion of SM to true stroke patients, time from symptom onset to treatment, and complication rates. Costs, reimbursement rates, and expected clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke and SM patients were estimated from published data. We report the 90-day incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of administering intravenous thrombolysis compared with no acute treatment from a healthcare sector perspective, as well as the cost-reimbursement ratio from a hospital-level perspective. Cost-effectiveness was defined as a willingness to pay <$100 000 USD per quality adjusted life year gained and high cost-reimbursement ratio was defined as >1.5. Results- There was an increase in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as the proportion of SM cases increased in the 3-hour time window. The threshold proportion of SM above which the decision to administer thrombolysis was no longer cost-effective was 30%. The threshold proportion of SM above which the decision to administer thrombolysis resulted in high cost-reimbursement ratio was 75%. Results were similar for patients arriving within 0 to 90 minutes of symptom onset as compared with 91 to 180 minutes but were significantly affected by cost of alteplase in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions- We identified thresholds of SM above which thrombolysis was no longer cost-effective from 2 analytic perspectives.

In this analysis, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ustekinumab, infliximab, or adalimumab for the treatment of moderate-severe Crohn''s disease in patients who failed conventional therapy (i.e., corticosteroids and immunomodulators) but were naive to tumor necrosis factor antagonists (i.e., biologic drugs). DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a hybrid model structure (decision tree and Markov model). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A decision tree simulated biologic induction, and a Markov model simulated biologic and conventional therapy maintenance. Cycle length was 2 weeks with a discounted 5-year time horizon and a limited U.S. societal perspective in the base case; results from a payer perspective are also reported. Transition probabilities, direct costs, indirect costs, and utilities were obtained from the literature. To measure relative treatment value (i.e., order of treatment cost-effectiveness), net monetary benefits were reported for a $150,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life-year in the base case. Infliximab dominated both adalimumab and ustekinumab, with a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $9943 and $29,798, respectively, in the base case. Adalimumab dominated ustekinumab, with an NMB of $19,855. All biologics yielded similar quality-adjusted life-years (~3.5), whereas costs varied substantially ($50,510, $54,985, and $72,921 for infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab, respectively).

Whereas recent systematic reviews and randomized trials have suggested that TEA and ORIF result in similar functional outcome scores, no previous study has assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness between TEA and distal humeral ORIF in this specific demographic. METHODS: A Markov model was created with the highest-level data available from the literature depicting transitioning health states based on treatment strategies. To populate the quality-of-life data points in the model lacking in the literature, a survey was conducted of patients at 2 referral institutions who underwent TEA or ORIF for acute, intra-articular distal humeral fractures via the European Quality of Life, 5 Domains (EQ-5D) questionnaire at least 2 years postoperatively. Cost data from 2016 for each strategy were used to calculate the comparative cost-effectiveness of TEA versus ORIF. RESULTS: For patients aged 65 years, the total cost of TEA was $19,407 compared with $20,669 for ORIF. The effectiveness of TEA and ORIF was 8.17 and 7.72, respectively. Overall, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of TEA ($2375.76/quality-adjusted life-year) was favored more than ORIF ($2677.26/quality-adjusted life-year).

21546,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Silicone versus Saline Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction Using the BREAST-Q,"BACKGROUND: The most common type of breast reconstruction is implant-based breast reconstruction. Implant-based reconstruction has been reported to impact quality-of-life outcomes. Therefore, the authors sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of saline versus silicone implants. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data from patients who underwent breast reconstruction with saline or silicone implants at their institution. This included type of procedure, acellular dermal matrix use, complications, and number of revisions. Costs were estimated using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services physician fee schedule and hospital costs. Effectiveness was measured using BREAST-Q-adjusted life-years, a measure of years of perfect breast health, based on BREAST-Q data collected before mastectomy and reconstruction and at 12 months after final reconstruction. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was obtained for silicone and saline reconstruction. RESULTS: The authors identified 134 women, among which 77 (57 percent) underwent silicone and 57 (43 percent) underwent saline breast reconstruction. The cost of saline reconstruction was $1288.23 less compared with silicone. BREAST-Q-adjusted life-years were 28.11 for saline and 23.57 for silicone, demonstrating higher cost-effectiveness for saline. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for saline was -$283.48, or $283.48 less per year of perfect breast-related health postreconstruction than silicone. CONCLUSIONS: The authors'' results indicate that saline breast reconstruction may be more cost-effective compared with silicone at 12 months after final reconstruction. Silicone was both more expensive and less effective than saline.

21547,"Cost-Effectiveness of Niraparib Versus Routine Surveillance, Olaparib and Rucaparib for the Maintenance Treatment of Patients with Ovarian Cancer in the United States","OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of niraparib compared with routine surveillance (RS), olaparib and rucaparib for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (OC). METHODS: A decision-analytic model estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for niraparib versus RS, olaparib, and rucaparib from a US payer perspective. The model considered recurrent OC patients with or without germline BRCA mutations (gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut), who were responsive to their last platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Model health states were: progression-free disease, progressed disease and dead. Mean progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated using parametric survival distributions based on ENGOT-OV16/NOVA (niraparib phase III trial), ARIEL3 (rucaparib phase III trial) and Study 19 (olaparib phase II trial). Mean overall survival (OS) benefit was estimated as double the mean PFS benefit based on the relationship between PFS and OS observed in Study 19. Costs included: drug, chemotherapy, monitoring, adverse events, and terminal care. EQ-5D utilities were estimated from trial data. RESULTS: Compared to RS, niraparib was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$68,287/QALY and US$108,287/QALY for gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut, respectively.

21553,Economic Evaluation of Talimogene Laherparepvec Plus Ipilimumab Combination Therapy vs Ipilimumab Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Unresectable Melanoma,"Importance: A phase 2 trial comparing talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab vs ipilimumab monotherapy in patients with advanced unresectable melanoma found no differential benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) but noted objective response rates (ORRs) of 38.8% (38 of 98 patients) vs 18.0% (18 of 100 patients), respectively. Objective: To perform an economic evaluation of talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab combination therapy vs ipilimumab monotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: For PFS, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using a 2-state Markov model (PFS vs progression or death) was performed. For ORRs, cost-effectiveness analysis of the incremental cost of 1 additional patient achieving objective response was performed. In this setting based on a US payer perspective (2017 US dollars), participants were patients with advanced unresectable melanoma. Main Outcomes and Measures: The PFS life-years and PFS quality-adjusted life-years were determined, and the associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were estimated. Also estimated was the ICER per 1 additional patient (out of 100 treated patients) achieving objective response. Base-case analyses were validated by sensitivity analyses. Results: In PFS analyses, the cost of talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab ($494983) exceeded the cost of ipilimumab monotherapy ($132950) by $362033. The ICER was $2129606 per PFS life-years, and the ICUR was $2262706 per PFS quality-adjusted life-year gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses yielded an ICER of $1481208 per PFS life-year gained and an ICUR of $1683191 per PFS quality-adjusted life-year gained. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, the PFS hazard ratio and the utility of response were the most influential parameters. Talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab has a 50% likelihood of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1683191 per PFS quality-adjusted life-year gained. In ORR analyses, talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab ($474904) vs ipilimumab alone ($132810), a $342094 difference, yielded an ICER of $1629019 per additional patient achieving objective response. In subgroup analyses by disease stage and BRAFV600E mutation status, ICERs ranged from $1069044 to $17104700 per 1 additional patient achieving objective response. Conclusions and Relevance: The cost to gain 1 additional progression-free quality-adjusted life-year, 1 additional progression-free life-year, or to have 1 additional patient attain objective response is about $1.6 million. This amount may be beyond what payers typically are willing to pay. Combination therapy of talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab does not offer an economically beneficial treatment option relative to ipilimumab monotherapy at the population level. This should not preclude treatment for individual patients for whom this regimen may be indicated.",2019-01-30784,30477000,JAMA Dermatol,Abdulaali R Almutairi,2019,155 / 1,22-28,No,30477000,"Abdulaali R Almutairi; Nimer S Alkhatib; Mok Oh; Clara Curiel-Lewandrowski; Hani M Babiker; Lee D Cranmer; Ali McBride; Ivo Abraham; Economic Evaluation of Talimogene Laherparepvec Plus Ipilimumab Combination Therapy vs Ipilimumab Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Unresectable Melanoma, JAMA Dermatol, 2019 Jan 1; 155(1):2168-6084; 22-28",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Talimogene Laherparepvec + Ipilimumab vs. Ipilimumab,Advanced Unresectable Melanoma,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2262706,United States,2017,2389087.8
21554,Cost-Utility Analysis of Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Thoracic Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis OBJECTIVE.: To compare the cost utility of operative versus nonoperative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and identity factors that influence cost-utility estimates. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: AIS affects 1% to 3% of children aged 10 to 16 years. When the major coronal curve reaches 50 degrees , operative treatment may be considered. The cost utility of operative treatment of AIS is unknown. METHODS: A decision-analysis model comparing operative versus nonoperative treatment was developed for a hypothetical 15-year-old skeletally mature girl with a 55 degrees right thoracic (Lenke 1) curve. The AIS literature was reviewed to estimate the probability, health utility, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each event. For the conservative model, we assumed that operative treatment did not result directly in any QALYs gained, and the health utility in AIS patients was the same as the age-matched US population mean. Costs were inflation-adjusted at 3.22% per year to 2015 US dollars. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using mixed first-order and second-order Monte Carlo simulations. Incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) and incremental net monetary benefit were calculated. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed by varying cost, probability, and QALY estimates. RESULTS: Operative treatment was favored in 98.5% of simulations, with a median ICUR of $20,600/QALY (95% confidence interval, $20,500-$21,900) below the societal willingness-to-pay threshold (WTPT) of $50,000/QALY. The median incremental net monetary benefit associated with operative treatment was $15,100 (95% confidence interval, $14,800-$15,700). Operative treatment produced net monetary benefit across various WTPTs. Factors that most affected the ICUR were net costs associated with uncomplicated operative treatment, undergoing surgery during adulthood, and development of pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: Cost-utility analysis suggests that operative treatment of AIS is favored over nonoperative treatment and falls below the $50,000/QALY WTPT for patients with Lenke 1 curves.

The lifetime costs of both a weight reduction program and pioglitazone were less than usual care, while vitamin E was $3050 (95% CrI 2354, 3650). The weight reduction program dominated all other treatment options. The probability of being cost-effective in Thailand''s willingness-to-pay threshold ($4546/QALY gained) was 76% for the weight reduction program, 22% for pioglitazone, 2% for usual care, and 0% for vitamin E. CONCLUSIONS: A weight reduction program can prevent cirrhosis and HCC occurrences, and dominates all other treatment options.

21558,Prophylactic Fixation Can Be Cost-effective in Preventing a Contralateral Bisphosphonate-associated Femur Fracture,"BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fractures associated with osteoporosis but increase the risk of atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures. After unilateral atypical femur fracture, there is risk of contralateral fracture, but the indications for prophylactic fixation are controversial. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study is to use Markov modeling to determine whether contralateral prophylactic femur fracture fixation is cost-effective after a bisphosphonate-associated atypical femur fracture and, if so, what patient-related factors may influence that determination. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of contralateral prophylactic fixation after an initial atypical femur fracture. Simulated patients aged 60 to 90 years were included and separated into standard and high fracture risk cohorts. Patients with standard fracture risk were defined as those presenting with one atypical femur fracture but without symptoms or findings in the contralateral femur, whereas patients with high fracture risk were typified as those with more than one risk factor, including Asian ethnicity, prodromal pain, femoral geometry changes, or radiographic findings in the contralateral femur. Outcome probabilities and utilities were derived from studies matching to patient characteristics, and fragility fracture literature was used when atypical femur fracture data were not available. Associated costs were largely derived from Medicare 2015 reimbursement rates. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all model parameters within defined ranges. RESULTS: Prophylactic fixation for a 70-year-old patient with standard risk for fracture costs USD 131,300/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and for high-risk patients costs USD 22,400/QALY. Sensitivity analysis revealed that prophylaxis for high-risk patients is cost-effective at USD 100,000/QALY when the cost of prophylaxis was less than USD 29,400, the probability of prophylaxis complications was less than 21%, or if the patient was younger than 89 years old. The parameters to which the model was most sensitive were the cost of prophylaxis, patient age, and probability of prophylaxis-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic fixation of the contralateral side after unilateral atypical femur fracture is not cost-effective for standard-risk patients but is cost-effective among high-risk patients between 60 and 89 years of age with a high risk for an atypical femur fracture defined by patients with more than one risk factor such as Asian ethnicity, prodromal pain, varus proximal femur geometry, femoral bowing, or radiographic changes such as periosteal beaking and a transverse radiolucent line. However, our findings are based on several key assumptions for modeling such as the probability of fractures and complications, the costs associated for each health state, and the risks of surgical treatment.

METHODS: Total costs (US$) in 2017 and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated over 20 years using a Markov model. A base-case analysis was conducted under a societal perspective, which included direct healthcare, non-healthcare and indirect costs in Thailand. Clinical events for warfarin and utilities were obtained from Thai patients whenever possible. The efficacy of direct-acting oral anticoagulants was derived from trial-based East Asian subgroups and adjusted for time in the target international normalized ratio range of warfarin. RESULTS: In the base case, use of apixaban instead of warfarin incurred an additional cost of US$20,763 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Substituting apixaban with rivaroxaban and rivaroxaban with high-dose edoxaban would incur an additional cost per quality-adjusted life-year by US$507 and US$434, respectively. Compared with warfarin, high-dose edoxaban had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$9704/quality-adjusted life-year, followed by high-dose dabigatran (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio US$11,155/quality-adjusted life-year). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on a payer perspective were similar. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was below Thailand''s cost-effectiveness threshold when high-dose dabigatran and edoxaban prices were reduced by 50%.

21566,Cost Effectiveness of Midostaurin in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed FLT3-Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of midostaurin + cytarabine + daunorubicin (midostaurin arm) versus placebo + cytarabine + daunorubicin (placebo arm) in the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are eligible for standard cytarabine + daunorubicin chemotherapy, from a US third-party payer perspective. METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model with four health states (active disease, complete remission [CR], relapse, and death) was constructed. Efficacy inputs (time to CR or death, time to relapse or death, and overall survival) were estimated using data from the RATIFY trial (NCT00651261). Costs (inflated to 2016 US dollars) included treatment, drug monitoring, stem cell transplantation (SCT), adverse events costs, and medical costs associated with health states. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) gained were estimated. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (and PSA) were performed to assess model robustness. RESULTS: In the base case, patients in the midostaurin arm incurred higher total direct costs over a lifetime compared with the placebo arm ($4,043,470 vs. $3,959,741), resulting in an incremental cost of $83,729; however, the midostaurin arm had better effectiveness, with 1.59 more LYs and 1.37 more QALYs. These led to a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $52,596 per LY, or $61,167 per QALY. Results were robust in the DSA. In the PSA, the probability of the midostaurin arm being cost-effective compared with the placebo arm was 65.9%, at a willingness to pay of $150,000/QALY.

21567,Early cost-utility estimation of the surgical correction of pectus excavatum with the Nuss bar,"OBJECTIVES: The surgical correction of pectus excavatum (PE) with a Nuss bar provides satisfactory outcomes, but its cost-effectiveness is yet unproven. We prospectively analysed early outcomes and costs for Nuss bar placement. METHODS: Fifty-four patients aged 16 years or older (6 females and 48 males; mean age, 17.9 years; range 16.0-29.4 years) with a PE filled out a Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-6D) preoperatively and 1 year after a Nuss procedure. Costs included professional fees and fees for the operating room, materials and hospital care. Changes in the responses to the SF-36 or its domains were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the utility test results were calculated preoperatively and postoperatively from the SF-6D. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the results of these tests. RESULTS: Significant improvements in physical functioning, social functioning, mental health and health transition (all P < 0.05) were noted. The other SF-36 subgroups showed improvement; however, the improvement was not significant. The SF-6D utility showed improvement from 0.76 preoperatively to 0.79 at the 1-year follow-up (P = 0.096). The mean direct costs were euro8805. The 1-year discounted QALY gain was 0.03. The estimated cost-utility ratio was euro293 500 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant improvement in many domains of the SF-36, the results of the SF-6D cost-utility analysis showed only a small improvement in cost-effectiveness (> euro80 000/QALY) for patients with PE 1 year after Nuss bar placement.

21568,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Combined Dual Motor Nerve Transfers versus Alternative Surgical and Nonsurgical Management Strategies to Restore Shoulder Function Following Upper Brachial Plexus Injury,"BACKGROUND: Restoration of shoulder function is an important treatment goal in upper brachial plexus injury (UBPI). Combined dual motor nerve transfer (CDNT) of spinal accessory to suprascapular and radial to axillary nerves demonstrates good functional recovery with minimal risk of perioperative complications. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CDNT vs alternative operative and nonoperative treatments for UBPI. METHODS: A decision model was constructed to evaluate costs ($, third-party payer) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of CDNT compared to glenohumeral arthrodesis (GA), conservative management, and nontreatment strategies. Estimates for branch probabilities, costs, and QALYs were derived from published studies. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, $/QALY) were calculated to compare the competing strategies. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses with 100 000 iterations were performed to account for effects of uncertainty in model inputs. RESULTS: Base case model demonstrated CDNT effectiveness, yielding an expected 21.04 lifetime QALYs, compared to 20.89 QALYs with GA, 19.68 QALYs with conservative management, and 19.15 QALYs with no treatment. The ICERs for CDNT, GA, and conservative management vs nontreatment were $5776.73/QALY, $10 483.52/QALY, and $882.47/QALY, respectively. Adjusting for potential income associated with increased likelihood of returning to work after clinical recovery demonstrated CDNT as the dominant strategy, with ICER = -$56 459.54/QALY relative to nontreatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed CDNT cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY in 78.47% and 81.97% of trials with and without income adjustment, respectively.

21572,Economic Evaluation of Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"OBJECTIVES: Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is increasingly being used to support patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. We assessed the cost-utility of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults compared with standard lung protective ventilation from the perspective of the healthcare system. DESIGN: We conducted a cost-utility analysis with a cohort state transition decision model using a lifetime time horizon, 1.5% discount rate, and outcomes reported as cost per quality-adjusted life year. Literature reviews were conducted to inform the model variables. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty in the model. SETTING: Canadian publicly funded healthcare system. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohort of adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or standard lung protective ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In our model, the use of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with lung protective ventilation resulted in a gain of 5.2 life years and 4.05 quality-adjusted life years, at an additional lifetime cost of $145,697 Canadian dollars. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $36,001/quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analyses show that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is sensitive to the efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy and costs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current data, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is cost-effective for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additional evidence on the efficacy of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome and in different subgroups of patients will allow for greater certainty in its cost-effectiveness.",2019-01-30817,30312186,Crit Care Med,Kali A Barrett,2019,47 / 2,186-193,No,30312186,"Kali A Barrett; Neil Hawkins; Eddy Fan; Economic Evaluation of Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Crit Care Med, 2019 Feb; 47(2):0090-3493; 186-193",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Surgical,Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation vs. Standard/Usual Care- lung protective ventilation + tidal volumes predicted body weight,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,36001,Canada,2016,29341.71

Treatment regimens for LTBI include self-administered daily isoniazid for 6 (6H) or 9 (9H) months, self-administered daily rifampicin plus isoniazid for 3 months (3RH), self-administered daily rifampicin for 4 months (4R) and weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months self-administered (3HP-SAT) or administered by a healthcare worker as directly observed therapy (3HP-DOT). Data on the relative cost-effectiveness of these regimens are needed to assist policymakers and clinicians in selecting an LTBI regimen. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of all regimens for treating LTBI. Methods: We developed a Markov model to investigate the cost-effectiveness of 3HP-DOT, 3HP-SAT, 4R, 3RH, 9H and 6H for LTBI treatment in a cohort of 10000 adults with LTBI.

Results: Compared with no preventive treatment, 3HP-DOT, 3HP-SAT, 4R, 3RH, 9H and 6H prevented 496, 470, 442, 418, 370 and 276 additional cases of active TB per 10000 patients, respectively. All regimens reduced costs and increased QALYs compared with no preventive treatment. 3HP was more cost-effective under DOT than under SAT at a cost of US$27948 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Three months of weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid is more cost-effective than other regimens. Greater recognition of the benefits of short-course regimens can contribute to the scale-up of prevention and achieving the ''End TB'' targets.",2019-01-30820,30295760,J Antimicrob Chemother,Tan N Doan,2019,74 / 1,218-227,No,30295760,"Tan N Doan; Greg J Fox; Michael T Meehan; Nick Scott; Romain Ragonnet; Kerri Viney; James M Trauer; Emma S McBryde; Cost-effectiveness of 3 months of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid compared with other standard treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection: a decision analysis study, J Antimicrob Chemother, 2019 Jan 1; 74(1):0305-7453; 218-227",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical",Serial surveillance without preventive treatment vs. Weekly Rifapentine + Isoniazid for 3 months adminstered by a healthcare worker,Not Stated,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-4406.98,United States,2018,-4542.18
21579,Ibrutinib for Treating Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal,"As part of its Single Technology Appraisal process, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of ibrutinib (Janssen) to submit evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of ibrutinib for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Assessment Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company''s submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence for ibrutinib included one randomised controlled trial comparing ibrutinib and temsirolimus and two single-arm studies. The company''s indirect comparison of ibrutinib versus rituximab plus chemotherapy (R-chemo) produced a hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) of 0.28. The ERG''s random effects network meta-analysis (NMA) indicated that the treatment effect on PFS was highly uncertain (HR 0.27; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.06-1.26). The company''s Markov model assessed the cost effectiveness of ibrutinib versus R-chemo for the treatment of R/R MCL from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. Based on a re-run of the company''s model by the ERG, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ibrutinib versus R-chemo [including the company''s original patient access scheme (PAS)] was expected to be pound76,014 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The ERG had several concerns regarding the company''s model structure and the evidence used to inform its parameters. The ERG''s preferred analysis, which used the ERG''s NMA and the observed Kaplan-Meier curve for time to ibrutinib discontinuation and excluded long-term disutilities for R-chemo, produced ICERs of pound63,340 per QALY gained for the overall R/R MCL population and of pound44,711 per QALY gained for patients with one prior treatment. Following an updated PAS and consideration of evidence from a later data-cut of the RAY trial, the appraisal committee concluded that the most plausible ICER for the one prior treatment subgroup was likely to be lower than the company''s estimate of pound49,848 per QALY gained. The company''s ICER for the overall R/R MCL population was higher, at pound62,650 per QALY gained.

21581,Cost-effectiveness and Cost-utility of the Adherence Improving Self-management Strategy in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Care: A Trial-based Economic Evaluation,"Background: Several promising human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment adherence interventions have been identified, but data about their cost-effectiveness are lacking. This study examines the trial-based cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the proven-effective Adherence Improving Self-Management Strategy (AIMS), from a societal perspective, with a 15-month time horizon. Methods: Treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients at risk for viral rebound were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) or AIMS in a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands. AIMS is a nurse-led, 1-on-1 self-management intervention incorporating feedback from electronic medication monitors, delivered during routine clinical visits. Main outcomes were costs per reduction in log10 viral load, treatment failure (2 consecutive detectable viral loads), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Two hundred twenty-three patients were randomized. From a societal perspective, AIMS was slightly more expensive than TAU but also more effective, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro549 per reduction in log10 viral load and euro1659 per percentage decrease in treatment failure. In terms of QALYs, AIMS resulted in higher costs but more QALYs compared to TAU, which resulted in an ICER of euro27759 per QALY gained. From a healthcare perspective, AIMS dominated TAU. Additional sensitivity analyses addressing key limitations of the base case analyses also suggested that AIMS dominates TAU. Conclusions: Base case analyses suggests that over a period of 15 months, AIMS may be costlier, but also more effective than TAU. All additional analyses suggest that AIMS is cheaper and more effective than TAU. This trial-based economic evaluation confirms and complements a model-based economic evaluation with a lifetime horizon showing that AIMS is cost-effective.

21582,Cost-Effectiveness of Three Doses of a Behavioral Intervention to Prevent or Delay Type 2 Diabetes in Rural Areas,"BACKGROUND: Rural Americans have higher prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) than urban populations and more limited access to behavioral programs to promote healthy lifestyle habits. Descriptive evidence from the Rural Lifestyle Intervention Treatment Effectiveness trial delivered through local cooperative extension service offices in rural areas previously identified that behavioral modification with both nutrition education and coaching resulted in a lower program delivery cost per kilogram of weight loss maintained at 2-years compared with an education-only comparator intervention. OBJECTIVE: This analysis extended earlier Rural Lifestyle Intervention Treatment Effectiveness trial research regarding weight loss outcomes to assess whether nutrition education with behavioral coaching delivered through cooperative extension service offices is cost-effective relative to nutrition education only in reducing T2D cases in rural areas. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was conducted. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Trial participants (n=317) from June 2008 through June 2014 were adults residing in rural Florida counties with a baseline body mass index between 30 and 45, but otherwise identified as healthy. INTERVENTION: Trial participants were randomly assigned to low, moderate, or high doses of behavioral coaching with nutrition education (ie, 16, 32, or 48 sessions over 24 months) or a comparator intervention that included 16 sessions of nutrition education without coaching. Participant glycated hemoglobin level was measured at baseline and the end of the trial to assess T2D status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: T2D categories by treatment arm were used to estimate participants'' expected annual health care expenditures and expected health-related utility measured as quality adjusted life years (ie, QALYs) over a 5-year time horizon. Discounted incremental costs and QALYs were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each behavioral coaching intervention dose relative to the education-only comparator. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Using a third-party payer perspective, Markov transition matrices were used to model participant transitions between T2D states. Replications of the individual participant behavior were conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: All three doses of the behavioral coaching intervention had lower expected total costs and higher estimated QALYs than the education-only comparator. The moderate dose behavioral coaching intervention was associated with higher estimated QALYs but was costlier than the low dose; the moderate dose was favored over the low dose with willingness to pay thresholds over $107,895/QALY. The low dose behavioral coaching intervention was otherwise favored.

METHODS: A cohort Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was undertaken extrapolating to up to 30 years from cost and outcome data collected from a primary study involving a real-life Australian cohort. In this study, noncirrhotic patients treated for HCV from 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2017 at four major public hospitals and liaising sites in South Australia were studied retrospectively. The MOC were classified depending on the person providing patient workup, treatment and monitoring into MOC1 (specialist), MOC2 (mixed specialist and hepatitis nurse), MOC3 (hepatitis nurse) and MOC4 (general practitioner, GP). Incremental costs were estimated from the Medicare perspective. Incremental outcomes were estimated based on the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained by achieving a sustained virological response. A cost-effectiveness threshold of Australian dollar 50 000 per QALY gained, the implicit criterion used for assessing the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals and medical services in Australia was assumed. Net monetary benefit (NMB) estimates based on this threshold were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1373 patients, 64% males, mean age 50 (SD +/-11) years, were studied.

In the CEA, MOC4 and MOC2 clearly dominated MOC1 over 30 years with lower costs and higher QALYs. Similarly, NMB was the highest in MOC4, followed by MOC2.

21589,Preexposure prophylaxis for men who have sex with men in the Netherlands: impact on HIV and Neisseria gonorrhoeae transmission and cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programme for high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM), which includes gonorrhoea testing and treatment, on the transmission of HIV and N. gonorrhoeae among MSM in the Netherlands and the cost-effectiveness of such programme with and without risk compensation (in the form of reduced condom use). METHODS: We developed a stochastic agent-based transmission model of HIV and gonorrhoea. We simulated a capped (max 2.5% of MSM) and uncapped (5.5% of MSM in 2018 declining to 3% in 2027) daily PrEP programme for high-risk MSM, with three-monthly HIV and gonorrhoea testing, with and without risk compensation. Epidemiological outcomes were calculated from the transmission model and used in an economic model to calculate costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), over 2018-2027, taking a healthcare payer perspective. RESULTS: Without risk compensation, PrEP can lead to a reduction of 61% or 49% in the total number of new HIV infections in 2018-2027, if the programme is uncapped or capped to 2.5% of MSM, respectively. With risk compensation, this reduction can be 63% or 46% in the uncapped and capped programmes, respectively. In all scenarios, gonorrhoea prevalence decreased after introducing PrEP. Without risk compensation, 92% of simulations were cost-effective (of which 52% cost-saving). With risk compensation, 73% of simulations were cost-effective (of which 23% was cost-saving).

Ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a fixed-dose antibiotic approved in Europe and the United States for treating (in combination with metronidazole) cIAI in adult hospitalised patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. The approval was based on the results of RECLAIM, a Phase III, parallel-group, comparative study (RECLAIM 1 [NCT01499290] and RECLAIM 2 [NCT01500239]). The objective of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole compared with 1) ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole and 2) meropenem, as an empiric treatment for the management of cIAI in Italy. Methods: A sequential, patient-level simulation model, with a 5-year time horizon and 3% annual discount rate (applied to both costs and health benefits), was developed using Microsoft Excel(R) to demonstrate the clinical course of the disease. The impact of resistant pathogens was included as an additional factor. Results: In the base-case analysis, the CAZ-AVI sequence (CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole followed by a colistin + tigecycline + high-dose meropenem combination after treatment failure), when compared to sequences for ceftolozane/tazobactam (ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole followed by colistin + tigecycline + high-dose meropenem after treatment failure) and meropenem (meropenem followed by colistin + tigecycline + high-dose meropenem after treatment failure), had better clinical outcomes with higher cure rates (93.04% vs. 91.52%; 92.98% vs. 90.24%, respectively), shorter hospital stays ( = - 0.38 and = - 1.24 days per patient, respectively), and higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient (4.021 vs. 3.982; 4.019 vs. 3.960, respectively). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio in the CAZ-AVI sequence was euro4099 and euro15,574 per QALY gained versus each comparator sequence, respectively, well below the willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000 per QALY accepted in Italy.

21595,Cost-effectiveness of continuing pneumococcal conjugate vaccination at age 65 in the context of indirect effects from the childhood immunization program,"The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official positon of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. BACKGROUND: Continued indirect effects provided by the childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]) program in the United States have decreased disease in the adult population, reducing the potential direct effects of vaccinating older adults. OBJECTIVE: We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuing to recommend PCV13 in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at age 65 compared to a strategy that only included a recommendation for PPSV23 at age 65. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model following a cohort of 65 year olds in 2019. We used vaccination coverage and disease incidence estimates for healthy adults and adults with chronic medical conditions. We incorporated continued indirect effects from the childhood PCV13 program on adult disease incidence. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, continuing to recommend PCV13 at age 65 cost $561,682 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In a scenario where PPSV23 provided modest protection against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, costs increased to $2.3 million per QALY. These estimates are larger than our prior estimates for cost-effectiveness of this recommendation in the context of predicted indirect effects due to new data indicating PCV13 provided limited impact on serotype 3, the major cause of the remaining PCV13-type disease. Under our prior assumptions about PCV13 effectiveness against serotype 3 disease, the cost of continuing the recommendation is $207,607 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Indirect effects from the childhood PCV13 program have dramatically increased the cost per QALY of continuing to recommend PCV13 at age 65 after only a few years.",2019-01-30894,31889609,Vaccine,Charles Stoecker,2019,/,,Yes,31889609,"Charles Stoecker; Kika Anyiwe; Marina Richardson; Jason Brophy; Beate Sander; Cost-effectiveness of continuing pneumococcal conjugate vaccination at age 65 in the context of indirect effects from the childhood immunization program, Vaccine, 2019 Jan 30; ():1873-2518",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Immunization,pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vs. PPSV23,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,561682,United States,2017,593054.34
21596,Assessing adolescent immunization options for pertussis in Canada: A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) immunization helps prevent pertussis infection. Timing of Tdap receipt represents an important facet of successful adolescent pertussis immunization. Potential strategies for timing of vaccine administration are each associated with different benefits - including disease prevention - and costs. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-utility of adolescent pertussis immunization strategies in Canada. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a pertussis disease history-simulating Markov model, with adolescents (beginning at age 10 years) as the cohort of interest. The model assessed three Tdap vaccination strategies: (1) immunization of 10 year olds, (2) removal of adolescent vaccination, and (3) immunization of 14 year olds (status quo). The analysis was conducted from a healthcare payer perspective and used a lifetime time horizon. Primary outcomes included life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health system costs, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs and outcomes were discounted at 1.5 percent annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The current recommended adolescent immunization strategy (at age 14) resulted in an average of 40.4432 expected QALYs and $26.28 per individual. This strategy was dominated by immunization at 10 years and no immunization. Compared to no immunization, immunizing adolescents at age 10 had an ICER of $74,899 per QALY. Results were most sensitive to the incidence of pertussis and the utility of moderate or severe pertussis. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY, removal of adolescent vaccination represented the most cost-effective strategy in 78% of simulations. CONCLUSION: Analysis assumes a policy context where immunization of pregnant women is recommended.

21598,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a physician deployment program to improve access to healthcare in rural and underserved areas in the Philippines,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to explore the cost-effectiveness of Doctor to the Barrios (DTTB), a physician deployment program in the Philippines. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using decision tree models with a lifetime time horizon and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. SETTING: Societal and healthcare perspectives. POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of children under 5 years in two provinces (Aklan and Nueva Ecija) and in a representative rural municipality. PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: DTTB''s impact on paediatric pneumonia and diarrhoea outcomes compared with a scenario without DTTB. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, effectiveness (in terms of lives saved and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: DTTB is cost-effective in the two provinces that were included in the study from societal and healthcare perspectives. Looking at a representative rural municipality, base case analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggest that DTTB has an ICER of 27 192 per QALY gained from a societal perspective. From a healthcare perspective, the base case ICER of DTTB is Philippine pesos (PHP) 71 839 per QALY gained and PHP 2 064 167 per life saved, and 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations produced similar average estimates. The cost per QALY of DTTB from a healthcare perspective is lower than the WHO recommended willingness-to-pay threshold of 100% of the country''s per-capita gross domestic product. CONCLUSIONS: DTTB can be a cost-effective intervention, but its value varies by setting and the conditions of the municipality where it is implemented. By focusing on a narrow set of paediatric outcomes, this study has likely underestimated the health benefits of DTTB. Additional research is needed to understand the full extent of DTTB''s impact on the health of communities in rural and remote areas. Future cost-effectiveness analysis should empirically estimate various parameters and include other health conditions in addition to pneumonia and diarrhoea in children.",2019-01-30896,31888937,BMJ Open,Anton L V Avancena,2019,9 / 12,e033455,No,31888937,"Anton L V Avancena; Helen Marshall; Mark McMillan; Bing Wang; Robert Booy; Hossein Afzali; Jim Buttery; Christopher C Blyth; Peter Richmond; David Shaw; David Gordon; Belinda Barton; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a physician deployment program to improve access to healthcare in rural and underserved areas in the Philippines, BMJ Open , 2019 Dec 31; 9(12):2044-6055; e033455",QALY,Philippines,Not Stated,Care Delivery,doctors to the barrios program vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,27192,Philippines,2017,569.78
21599,The cost-utility of school-based first permanent molar sealants programs: a Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Evidence of the cost-effectiveness of school-based first permanent molar sealants programs is not yet fully conclusive. The aim of this study was to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of school-based prevention programs for the application of sealants in molars of schoolchildren compared with non-intervention. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis based on a Markov model was carried out using probability distribution. The utility was measured in quality-adjusted tooth years (QATY). The assessment was carried out from the public payer''s perspective with a six-year time horizon. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per year. Only direct costs were evaluated, expressed in Chilean pesos (CLP) at 7th May at 2019 values (exchange rate USD = CLP 681.09). Univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic analysis were carried out. RESULTS: After a six-year follow up, the cost of sealing all first permanent molars was found to be higher than non-intervention, with a mean cost difference of USD 1.28 (CLP 875) per molar treated. The ""seal all"" strategy was more effective than non-intervention, generating 0.2 quality-adjusted tooth years more than non-intervention. The ICUR of the ""seal all"" strategy compared to non-intervention was USD 6.48 (CLP 4,412) per quality-adjusted tooth years. The sensitivity analysis showed that the increase in caries was the variable which most influenced the ICUR. CONCLUSIONS: A school-based sealant program is a cost-effective measure in populations with a high prevalence of caries.",2019-01-30899,31888582,BMC Oral Health,Gerardo Espinoza-Espinoza,2019,19 / 1,293,No,31888582,"Gerardo Espinoza-Espinoza; Paolo Angelo Cortesi; Giancarlo Castaman; Gianluca Trifiro; Simona Serao Creazzola; Giovanni Improta; Giampiero Mazzaglia; Angelo Claudio Molinari; Lorenzo Giovanni Mantovani; The cost-utility of school-based first permanent molar sealants programs: a Markov model, BMC Oral Health, 2019 Jul 1; 19(1):1472-6831; 293",QALY,Chile,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,sealant on molars vs. None,Not Stated,12 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Years,3.00,3.00,6.48,Chile,2019,0.01
21600,Cost-Effectiveness of Postoperative Drug Rehabilitation for Injection Drug Users,"BACKGROUND: With the opioid crisis showing no sign of abating, strategies are needed to facilitate postoperative care for injection drug use (IDU)-related endocarditis. The current standard, six weeks of intravenous antibiotics, yields frequent reoperation and IDU relapse. We examined the cost-effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation postoperatively to optimize outcomes and costs. METHODS: Two postoperative strategies were assessed: hospital-only care (HC) versus HC plus inpatient drug rehabilitation (DR). Monte-Carlo simulation evaluated effectiveness in quality adjusted life-years (QALY) and cost/patient calculated over a 20-year time horizon in 100,000 iterations. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) was set to $100,000/QALY. To determine probabilities of continued postoperative IDU, recurrent infection, and mortality, best available evidence was combined with institutional data from IDU patients. Baseline probability of postoperative IDU was set to 35% after DR vs 60% after HC, and the cost of inpatient rehabilitation to $30,000. RESULTS: Addition of inpatient drug rehabilitation to standard hospital care is the favorable strategy, with incremental per-patient cost of $36,920 and 0.93 QALYs gained over 20 years. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates DR is within our WTP of $100,000/QALY if post-operative IDU is reduced by at least 7% (from 60% to 53%). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of postoperative inpatient drug rehabilitation for IDU-related endocarditis is cost-effective even if only a modest reduction in IDU is achieved. Collaboration between hospitals and payors to launch pilot programs that provide postoperative addiction treatment and intravenous antibiotics after cardiac surgery could dramatically improve endocarditis care.
