21801,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Influenza Vaccination Coverage and Timing in Tropical and Subtropical Climate Settings: A Modeling Study,"BACKGROUND: The lack of seasonality in influenza epidemics in the tropics makes the application of well-established temperate zone national vaccination plans challenging. OBJECTIVES: We developed an individual-based simulation model to study optimal vaccination scheduling and assess cost-effectiveness of these vaccination schedules in scenarios of no influenza seasonality and the seasonality regimes of Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo. METHODS: The simulation models heterogeneities in human contact networks, levels of protective antibodies following infection, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, and seasonality. Using a no intervention baseline, we consider 3 alternative vaccination strategies: (1) annual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, (2) biannual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, and (3) annual vaccination for all elderly and a fraction of the remaining population. We considered 5 vaccination uptake rates for each strategy and modeled the estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), indicating the cost-effectiveness of each scenario. RESULTS: In Singapore, annual vaccination for a proportion of elderly is largely cost-effective. However, with fixed uptake rates, partial biannual vaccination for the elderly yields a higher ICER than partial annual vaccination for the elderly, resulting in a cost-ineffective ICER. The most optimal strategy is the total vaccination of all the elderly and a proportion of individuals from other age groups, which results in a cost-saving ICER. This finding is consistent across different seasonality regimes. CONCLUSIONS: Tropical countries like Singapore can have comparably cost-effective vaccination strategies as found in countries with winter epidemics. The vaccination of all the elderly and a proportion of other age groups is the most cost-effective strategy, supporting the need for an extensive national influenza vaccination program.",2019-01-31132,31806190,Value Health,Mu Yue,2019,22 / 12,1345-1354,Yes,31806190,"Mu Yue; Dipak Kotecha; Simrat K Gill; Marcus D Flather; Jane Holmes; Milton Packer; Giuseppe Rosano; Michael Bohm; John J V McMurray; John Wikstrand; Stefan D Anker; Dirk J van Veldhuisen; Luis Manzano; Thomas G von Lueder; Alan S Rigby; Bert Andersson; John Kjekshus; Hans Wedel; Frank Ruschitzka; John G F Cleland; Kevin Damman; Josep Redon; Andrew J S Coats; Beta-Blockers in Heart Failure C; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Influenza Vaccination Coverage and Timing in Tropical and Subtropical Climate Settings: A Modeling Study, Value Health, 2019 Dec; 22(12):1098-3015; 1345-1354",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Immunization,annual influenza vaccination with 100% coverage and tokyo seasonality vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3,3,-46782.45,United States,2018,-48217.74
21802,A cost-effectiveness analysis of trastuzumab-containing treatment sequences for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients in Taiwan,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment options for HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients have expanded markedly since trastuzumab approval in 1998. Several other regimens are now available, including pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, T-DM1, capecitabine plus lapatinib, and trastuzumab plus lapatinib. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of four treatment sequences for HER-2-positive mBC according to the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Administration (TNHIA). METHODS: Costs (U.S. Dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years) of four treatment sequences for HER-2-positive mBC patients were examined using a Markov model over a lifetime horizon. Transition probabilities, disease progression, and probability of adverse events and survival were derived from clinical trial data. Costs and health utilities were estimated from TNHIA, Taipei Medical University Hospital, and the literature. Deterministic, probabilistic sensitivity analyses and a scenario analysis examined parameter uncertainty and accounted for drug wastage in dosage and cost calculations. RESULTS: Sequence 3 (1st line: trastuzumab plus docetaxel; 2nd line: T-DM1; 3rd line: trastuzumab plus lapatinib) was the most cost-effective sequence followed by sequence 1 (1st line: pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel; 2nd line: T-DM1; 3rd line: capecitabine plus lapatinib), and sequence 4 (1st line: trastuzumab plus docetaxel; 2nd line: trastuzumab plus lapatinib; 3rd line: trastuzumab plus capecitabine), respectively. The model was sensitive to costs and transition probabilities, but not particularly sensitive to the wastage assumption. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the TNHIA, trastuzumab plus docetaxel as 1st line followed by T-DM1 and trastuzumab plus lapatinib as 2nd and 3rd line represents the most cost-effective strategy among the four sequences considered for treating HER-2-positive mBC patients.",2019-01-31137,31805500,Breast,Vakaramoko Diaby,2019,49 /,141-148,No,31805500,"Vakaramoko Diaby; Astarekegn Bekele; Kedir Teji Roba; Gudina Egata; Berhe Gebremichael; A cost-effectiveness analysis of trastuzumab-containing treatment sequences for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients in Taiwan, Breast, 2019 Nov 26; 49():0960-9776; 141-148",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"trastuzumab and docetaxel, trastuzumab and lapatinib, trastuzumab and capecitabine vs. Trastuzumab and docetaxel, Ado-trastuzumab emtansine, Trastuzumab and lapatinib",HER2-positive,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,5,5,63887.71,United States,2018,65847.79

21805,Cost-Utility Analysis of Electroconvulsive Therapy and Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression in Ontario,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and combining both treatments in a stepped care pathway for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in Ontario. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis evaluated the lifetime costs and benefits to society of rTMS and ECT as first-line treatments for TRD using a Markov model, which simulates the costs and health benefits of patients over their lifetime. Health states included acute treatment, maintenance treatment, remission, and severe depression. Treatment efficacy and health utility data were extracted and synthesized from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses evaluating these techniques. Direct costing data were obtained from national and provincial costing databases. Indirect costs were derived from government records. Scenario, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of the results. RESULTS: rTMS dominated ECT, as it was less costly and produced better health outcomes, measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), in the base case scenario. rTMS patients gained an average of 0.96 additional QALYs (equivalent to approximately 1 year in perfect health) over their lifetime with costs that were $46,094 less than ECT. rTMS remained dominant in the majority of scenario and threshold analyses. However, results from scenarios in which the model''s maximum lifetime allowance of rTMS treatment courses was substantially limited, the dominance of rTMS over ECT was attenuated. The scenario that showed the highest QALY gain (1.19) and the greatest cost-savings ($46,614) was when rTMS nonresponders switched to ECT. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective utilizing a lifetime horizon, rTMS is a cost-effective first-line treatment option for TRD relative to ECT, as it is less expensive and produces better health outcomes. The reduced side effect profile and greater patient acceptability of rTMS that allow it to be administered more times than ECT in a patient''s lifetime may contribute to its cost-effectiveness.",2019-01-31150,31801363,Can J Psychiatry,Kyle P Fitzgibbon,2019,/,706743719890167,No,31801363,"Kyle P Fitzgibbon; Viswanathan Mohan; Natarajan Kalpana; Nagarajan Lakshmipriya; Purushothaman Anitha; Rajagopal Gayathri; Parthasarthy Vijayalakshmi; Kamala Krishnaswamy; Ranjit Unnikrishnan; Ranjit Mohan Anjana; Sudha Vasudevan; Cost-Utility Analysis of Electroconvulsive Therapy and Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression in Ontario, Can J Psychiatry, 2019 Jul 1; ():0706-7437; 706743719890167",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Procedure",repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation vs. Electroconvulsive therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.5,1.5,-48014.58,Canada,2018,-38194.59
21806,Cost-effectiveness of prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies for Down syndrome: A microsimulation modeling analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequently occurring fetal chromosomal abnormality and different prenatal screening strategies are used for determining risk of DS worldwide. New non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which uses cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood can provide benefits due to its higher sensitivity and specificity in comparison to conventional screening tests. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of using population-level NIPT in fetal aneuploidy screening for DS. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation decision-analytic model to perform a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies for DS. The model followed individual simulated pregnant women through the pregnancy pathway. The comparators were serum-only screening, contingent NIPT (i.e., NIPT as a second-tier screening test) and universal NIPT (i.e., NIPT as a first-tier screening test). To address uncertainty around the model parameters, the expected values of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the base case and all scenario analyses were obtained through probabilistic analysis from a Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Base case and scenario analyses were conducted by repeating the micro-simulation 1,000 times for a sample of 45,605 pregnant women per the population of British Columbia, Canada (N = 4.8 million). Preliminary results of the sequential CEAs showed that contingent NIPT was a dominant strategy compared to serum-only screening. Compared with contingent NIPT, universal NIPT at the current test price was not cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over $100,000/QALY. Contingent NIPT also had the lowest cost per DS case detected among these three strategies. CONCLUSION: Including NIPT in existing prenatal screening for DS is shown to be beneficial over conventional testing.

METHODS: We compared screening tailored to predicted risk vs. uniform screening in a validated decision analytic model, considering the average risk population''s actual CRC risk distribution, and a risk-prediction tool''s discriminatory ability and cost. Low, moderate, and high risk tiers were identified as CRC risk after age 50 of <=3%, >3 to <12%, and >=12%, respectively, based on threshold analyses with willingness-to-pay <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

RESULTS: Assuming no CRC risk misclassification or risk-prediction tool costs, tailored screening was preferred over uniform screening. Tailored colonoscopy was minimally less effective than uniform colonoscopy, but saved $90,200-$889,000/QALY; tailored FIT/colonoscopy yielded more QALYs/person than annual FIT at $10,600-$60,000/QALY gained.

Tailored colonoscopy (once at 60 for low risk, every 10 years for moderate risk, every 5 years for high risk) was compared to colonoscopy every 10 years for all. Tailored fecal immunochemical testing [FIT]/colonoscopy (annual FIT for low and moderate risk, colonoscopy every 5 years for high risk) was compared to annual FIT for all. RESULTS: Assuming no CRC risk misclassification or risk-prediction tool costs, tailored screening was preferred over uniform screening. Tailored colonoscopy was minimally less effective than uniform colonoscopy, but saved $90,200-$889,000/QALY; tailored FIT/colonoscopy yielded more QALYs/person than annual FIT at $10,600-$60,000/QALY gained.

21818,Iron deficiency screening for children at 18 months: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: The peak prevalence of iron deficiency is in children 6 months to 3 years of age, a sensitive period for neurodevelopment. Our study objective was to examine the cost-utility of a proposed iron deficiency screening program for 18-month-old children. METHODS: We used a decision tree model to estimate the costs in 2019 Canadian dollars and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with 3 iron deficiency screening strategies: no screening, universal screening and targeted screening for a high-risk population. We used a societal perspective and assessed lifetime QALY gains. We derived outcomes from the literature and prospectively collected data. We performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The incremental costs to society of universal and targeted screening programs compared to no screening were $2286.06/QALY and $1676.94/QALY, respectively. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY, both programs were cost-effective. Compared to a targeted screening program, a universal screening program would cost an additional $2965.96 to gain 1 QALY, which renders it a cost-effective option. The study findings were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses.

21821,The impact of localized implementation: determining the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention and care interventions across six United States cities,"OBJECTIVE: Effective interventions to reduce the public health burden of HIV/AIDS can vary in their ability to deliver value at different levels of scale and in different epidemiological contexts. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV microepidemics. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC''s Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities. Targeted preexposure prophylaxis for high-risk MSM was cost-saving in Miami and cost-effective in Atlanta ($6123/QALY), Baltimore ($18 333/QALY) and Los Angeles ($86 117/QALY).

Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV microepidemics. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC''s Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities. Targeted preexposure prophylaxis for high-risk MSM was cost-saving in Miami and cost-effective in Atlanta ($6123/QALY), Baltimore ($18 333/QALY) and Los Angeles ($86 117/QALY).

Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV microepidemics. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC''s Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities.

Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV microepidemics. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC''s Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities. Targeted preexposure prophylaxis for high-risk MSM was cost-saving in Miami and cost-effective in Atlanta ($6123/QALY), Baltimore ($18 333/QALY) and Los Angeles ($86 117/QALY).

Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV microepidemics. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC''s Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities.

21877,The impact of localized implementation: determining the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention and care interventions across six United States cities,"OBJECTIVE: Effective interventions to reduce the public health burden of HIV/AIDS can vary in their ability to deliver value at different levels of scale and in different epidemiological contexts. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV microepidemics. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC''s Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities. Targeted preexposure prophylaxis for high-risk MSM was cost-saving in Miami and cost-effective in Atlanta ($6123/QALY), Baltimore ($18 333/QALY) and Los Angeles ($86 117/QALY). Interventions designed to improve antiretroviral therapy initiation provided greater value than other treatment engagement interventions.

21890,The impact of localized implementation: determining the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention and care interventions across six United States cities,"OBJECTIVE: Effective interventions to reduce the public health burden of HIV/AIDS can vary in their ability to deliver value at different levels of scale and in different epidemiological contexts. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV microepidemics. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC''s Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities. Targeted preexposure prophylaxis for high-risk MSM was cost-saving in Miami and cost-effective in Atlanta ($6123/QALY), Baltimore ($18 333/QALY) and Los Angeles ($86 117/QALY). Interventions designed to improve antiretroviral therapy initiation provided greater value than other treatment engagement interventions. No single intervention was projected to reduce HIV incidence by more than 10.1% in any city.
