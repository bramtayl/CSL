19701,The cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors - The Australian healthcare perspective,"BACKGROUND: For patients in whom statins are not tolerated or effective as monotherapy, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) represent a new class of lipid lowering therapies that may reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by up to 50% and lower cardiovascular events. While an important treatment option, the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9i in Australia remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9i compared to placebo in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was developed in Microsoft Excel. A hypothetical sample of 1000 individuals based on subjects in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial populated the model. With each five-yearcycle, model subjects could have non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction and/or stroke), or die from CVD or other causes. Follow-up was simulated for 25years. CVD risk reduction, cost and utility data were gathered from published sources. At current acquisition prices (AU$8174 per person per year), the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was AU$308,558 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Acquisition prices would need to be reduced to approximately AU$1500 per person per annum for PCSK9i to reach the arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold of AU$50,000 per QALY saved. CONCLUSION(S): PCSK9i are an effective alternative for those with existing CVD or at high risk of CVD in whom statin therapy alone is ineffective, but are not cost-effective to the Australian healthcare system based on current prices.",2018-01-27265,29731350,Int J Cardiol,Radya Kumar,2018,267 /,183-187,No,29731350,"Radya Kumar; Andrew Tonkin; Danny Liew; Ella Zomer; The cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors - The Australian healthcare perspective, Int J Cardiol, 2018 Sep 15; 267():0167-5273; 183-187",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) vs. Placebo,Patients with elevated LDL-C and/or non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) despite being on an optimized regimen of lipid-lowering therapy,85 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,5.00,5.00,308558,Australia,2017,249827.3
19702,Cost-Effectiveness of Self-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Intermediate-Risk Patients,"BACKGROUND: A recent clinical trial showed that self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was non-inferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, the cost-effectiveness of self-expandable TAVR in the intermediate-risk population remains unknown. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from the Canadian health care system payer''s perspective was undertaken to compare self-expandable TAVR with SAVR. A fully probabilistic Markov model over the patient''s lifetime was constructed to estimate differences in costs (2016 Canadian dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), discounted at 1.5% per annum. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Efficacy inputs were obtained from the Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation trial, and costs were primarily obtained from the Canadian Institute of Health Information. Probabilistic analysis (PA) and one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted around key point estimates to address uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, with discounting, the total lifetime costs (mean +/- standard deviation) in the TAVR and SAVR arms were $44,299 +/- $7,260 and $32,994 +/- $13,434, respectively, whereas total effectiveness values were 6.42 +/- 1.33 QALYs and 6.28 +/- 1.32 QALYs, respectively. This yielded an incremental cost of $11,305 and incremental effectiveness of 0.15 QALYs when TAVR was compared with SAVR for an ICER of $76,736/QALY. In the PA, there was moderate uncertainty, with 52.8% and 57.2% of simulations less than willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively. In the sensitivity analysis, when the cost of TAVR valve system was priced at $17,397 (base case $22,000 Canadian dollars), TAVR was found to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Self-expandable TAVR was found to be cost-effective; however, there was moderate uncertainty, reflecting the non-inferiority nature of the data.",2018-01-27273,29730344,Ann Thorac Surg,Derrick Y Tam,2018,106 / 3,676-683,No,29730344,"Derrick Y Tam; Avery Hughes; Harindra C Wijeysundera; Stephen E Fremes; Cost-Effectiveness of Self-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Intermediate-Risk Patients, Ann Thorac Surg, 2018 Sep; 106(3):0003-4975; 676-683",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Surgical",Transcatheter aortic valve replacement vs. Surgical aortic valve replacement,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,76736,Canada,2016,62541.74
19703,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Renin-Angiotensin Aldosterone System Blockade in Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade in the progression of chronic kidney disease using Thai clinical data in 2014. METHODS: A Markov model for cost-effectiveness analysis was applied to estimate from a societal perspective the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of RAAS versus non-RAAS used in preventing the progression of end-stage renal disease and death stratified by diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Input parameters related to clinical outcomes were obtained from a cohort study of treatment effectiveness, whereas costs were retrieved from the Ramathibodi Hospital electronic database in 2015 and the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program in Thailand. One-way analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate uncertainty surrounding model parameters. RESULTS: From the model, using RAAS improved QALY from 2.41 to 3.16 years and from 2.37 to 3.20 years in diabetic and nondiabetic groups, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for these groups were 78,250 baht (US $2,353.39) and 66,674 baht (US $2,005.22), respectively.

19705,Nivolumab in the Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab improves overall survival and health-related quality of life compared with everolimus in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). This study assesses the cost-utility of nivolumab from the Canadian health care payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the cost-utility of nivolumab, a Markov cohort model that incorporated data from the phase 3 CheckMate-025 trial and other sources was developed. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life month (QALM) gained for nivolumab was calculated. A lifetime horizon was used in the base-case with costs and outcomes discounted 3% annually. The probabilities of progression and death from cancer and utility values were captured from the CheckMate-025 trial. Expected costs were based on Ontario fees and other sources. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared with everolimus, nivolumab provided an additional 4.2 QALM at an incremental cost of $34,153. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $8138/QALM gained. Assuming a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $4167/QALM ($50,000/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]), nivolumab was not cost-effective. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, nivolumab cost, median overall survival, and median treatment duration were sensitive to changes. Furthermore, the results were sensitive to the WTP threshold and nivolumab became a cost-effective strategy with a WTP of $8333/QALM ($100,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with everolimus, nivolumab is unlikely to be cost-effective for the treatment of mRCC from a Canadian health care perspective with its current price assuming a WTP of $50,000/QALY. Although mRCC patients derive a meaningful clinical benefit from nivolumab, considerations should be given to avoid drug wastage and increase the WTP threshold to render this strategy more affordable.",2018-01-27280,29727313,Am J Clin Oncol,Jacques Raphael,2018,/,,No,29727313,"Jacques Raphael; Zhuolu Sun; Georg A Bjarnason; Joelle Helou; Beate Sander; David M Naimark; Nivolumab in the Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Cost-Utility Analysis, Am J Clin Oncol, 2018 May 4; ():1537-453X",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Nivolumab vs. Everolimus,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,97580,Canada,2016,79530.12
19706,Cost-Effectiveness Benefits of a Disease Management Program:The REMADHE Trial Results,"BACKGROUND: Published studies have generated mixed, controversial results regarding the cost-effectiveness of heart failure disease management programs (HF-DMPs). This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of an HF-DMP in ambulatory patients compared with usual care (UC). METHODS: In the prospective randomized REMADHE trial, we evaluated incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) gained as effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a study period of 2.47 +/- 1.75years. RESULTS: The REMADHE HF-DMP was more effective and less costly than UC in terms of both QALYs and LYs (95% and 55% chance of dominance, respectively). Average saving was US$7345 (2.5%-97.5% bootstrapped confidence interval -16,573 to +921). The chance of DMP being cost-effective at a willingness to pay US$10,000 per QALY or LY was 99% and 96%, respectively. Cost-effectiveness of HF-DMP was highest in subgroups with left ventricular ejection fraction <35%, age >50years, male sex, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class >/=III, and ischemic etiology. The chance of DMP being cost-effective at a willingness to pay US$10,000 per QALY was >/=90% in all subgroups apart from NYHA functional class I-II, where it was 70%. Even when the intervention costs increased by 500% or when excluding outliers in costs, DMP had a high chance of being cost-effective (87%-99%).

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of an HF-DMP in ambulatory patients compared with usual care (UC). METHODS: In the prospective randomized REMADHE trial, we evaluated incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) gained as effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a study period of 2.47 +/- 1.75years. RESULTS: The REMADHE HF-DMP was more effective and less costly than UC in terms of both QALYs and LYs (95% and 55% chance of dominance, respectively). Average saving was US$7345 (2.5%-97.5% bootstrapped confidence interval -16,573 to +921). The chance of DMP being cost-effective at a willingness to pay US$10,000 per QALY or LY was 99% and 96%, respectively.

The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases recommends revaccination for older adults who received primary vaccination >/=5 years earlier. The cost-effectiveness of adding revaccination and/or continuing catch-up vaccination in the NIP was evaluated from the public payer perspective in Japan. METHODS: The Markov model included five health states: no pneumococcal disease, invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP), post-meningitis sequelae, and death. Cohorts of adults aged 65-95 were followed until age 100 or death: 2014 cohort (aged 65-95, vaccinated: 2014); 2019 cohort (aged 65: 2019); and 2019 catch-up cohort (aged 70-100: 2019, unvaccinated: 2014). Strategies included: (1) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts; (2) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts and revaccinate both; (3) strategy 1 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; (4) strategy 2 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; and (5) strategy 4 and revaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort.

19726,Cost-Effectiveness of Patent Foramen Ovale Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Secondary Stroke Prevention,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO closure) plus antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone in carefully selected patients after cryptogenic stroke presumed to be from paradoxical embolism. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of PFO closure after cryptogenic stroke compared with conservative medical management from a US healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model estimated the 15-year cost and outcomes associated with the additional benefit of PFO closure compared with medical management alone. Model inputs were obtained from published literature, national databases, and a meta-analysis of 5 published randomized clinical trials on PFO closure. Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Cost-effectiveness used the incremental cost per QALY gained, whereas the net monetary benefit assumed a willingness to pay of $150 000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses estimated the uncertainty of model results. RESULTS: At 15 years, PFO closure compared with medical therapy alone improved QALY by 0.33 at a cost saving of $3568, representing an incremental net monetary benefit of $52 761 (95% interval -$8284 to $158 910). When the meta-analysis hazard ratio for stroke was increased to the 95% interval''s upper bound of 0.77, one-way sensitivity analyses suggested that PFO closure''s cost-effectiveness was $458 558 per additional QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested cost-effectiveness in 90% of simulation runs. CONCLUSIONS: PFO closure for cryptogenic strokes in the right setting is cost-effective, producing benefit in QALYs gained and potential cost savings. However, patient selection remains vitally important as marginal declines in treatment effectiveness can dramatically affect cost-effectiveness.",2018-01-27291,29720435,Stroke,Michelle H Leppert,2018,49 / 6,1443-1450,No,29720435,"Michelle H Leppert; Sharon N Poisson; John D Carroll; David E Thaler; Chong H Kim; Karen D Orjuela; P Michael Ho; James F Burke; Jonathan D Campbell; Cost-Effectiveness of Patent Foramen Ovale Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Secondary Stroke Prevention, Stroke, 2018 Jun; 49(6):1524-4628; 1443-1450",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Surgical","Patent Foramen Ovale Closure vs. Medical therapy alone (ie, antiplatelet, anticoagulation, or both)",Previous cryptogenic stroke,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,-8920,United States,2017,-9418.22

19753,DEVOTE 5: Evaluating the Short-Term Cost-Utility of Insulin Degludec Versus Insulin Glargine U100 in Basal-Bolus Regimens for Type 2 Diabetes in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term cost-utility of insulin degludec (degludec) versus insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the basal-bolus subgroup of the head-to-head cardiovascular (CV) outcome trial, DEVOTE. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted over a 2-year time horizon using a decision analytic model to compare costs in patients receiving once daily degludec or glargine U100, both as part of a basal-bolus regimen, in addition to standard care. Clinical outcomes and patient characteristics were taken exclusively from DEVOTE, whilst health-related quality of life utilities and UK-specific costs (expressed in 2016 GBP) were obtained from the literature. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service. RESULTS: Degludec was associated with mean cost savings of GBP 28.78 per patient relative to glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes at high CV risk. Cost savings were driven by the reduction in risk of diabetes-related complications with degludec, which offset the higher treatment costs relative to glargine U100. Degludec was associated with a mean improvement of 0.0064 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with glargine U100, with improvements driven predominantly by lower rates of severe hypoglycemia with degludec versus glargine U100. Improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy combined with cost neutrality resulted in degludec being dominant over glargine U100. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the incremental cost-utility ratio was stable to variations in the majority of model inputs. CONCLUSION: The present short-term modeling analysis found that for the basal-bolus subgroup of patients in DEVOTE, with a high risk of CV events, degludec was cost neutral (no additional costs) compared with glargine U100 over a 2-year time horizon in the UK setting. Furthermore, there were QALY gains with degludec, particularly due to the reduction in the risk of severe hypoglycemia. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk A/S.

19754,Is the Venner-PneuX Endotracheal Tube System a Cost-Effective Option for Post Cardiac Surgery Care?,"BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is common and costly. In a recent randomized controlled trial, the Venner-PneuX (VPX) endotracheal tube system (Qualitech Healthcare Limited, Maidenhead, United Kingdom) was found to be superior to standard endotracheal tubes (SET) in preventing VAP. However, VPX is considerably more expensive. We evaluated the costs and benefits of VPX to determine whether replacing SET with VPX is a cost-effective option for intensive care units. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to compare intubation with VPX or SET for patients requiring mechanical ventilation after cardiac operations. The model was populated with existing evidence on costs, effectiveness, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were conducted from a National Health Service hospital perspective. Uncertainty was assessed through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with SET, VPX is associated with an expected cost saving of pound738 per patient. VPX led to a small increase in quality-adjusted life years, indicating that the device is overall less costly and more effective than SET. The probability of VPX being cost-effective at pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life year is 97%. VPX would cease to be cost-effective if (1) it led to a risk reduction smaller than 0.02 compared with SET, (2) the acquisition cost of VPX was as high as pound890, or (3) the cost of treating a case of VAP was lower than pound1,450. CONCLUSIONS: VPX resulted in improved outcomes and savings that far offset the cost of the device, suggesting that replacing SET with VPX is overall beneficial.

19755,Cost-effectiveness of switching from trivalent to quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines for the at-risk population in Italy,"Seasonal influenza is caused by two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B. Although trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) contain both circulating A strains, they contain only a single B-lineage strain. This can lead to mismatches between the vaccine and predominant circulating B lineages, a concern especially for at-risk populations. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) containing a strain from both B lineages have been developed to improve protection against influenza. Here, we used a cost-utility model to examine whether switching from TIV to QIV would be cost-effective for the at-risk population in Italy. Costs were estimated from the payer and societal perspectives. The discount rate for outcomes was 3.0%. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the effects of variations in parameters. Switching from TIV to QIV in Italy was estimated to increase quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and produce cost savings, including euro1.6 million for hospitalization and approximately euro2 million in productivity. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro23,426 per QALY from a payer perspective and euro21,096 per QALY from a societal perspective.

Although the efficacy of these therapies has been shown in recent studies, cost-effectiveness has not yet been determined in Japan. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of second-line endocrine therapies for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR + and HER2 - mBC. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the therapies over a 15-year time horizon from a public healthcare payer''s perspective. The efficacy and utility parameters were determined via a systematic search of the literature. Direct medical care costs were used. A discount rate of 2% was applied for costs and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed for non-visceral metastasis. A series of sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and threshold analysis were performed. RESULTS: Base-case analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 3 million and 6 million Japanese yen (JPY)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for TOR and FUL 500 mg relative to EXE, respectively. FUL 250 mg and EXE + EVE were dominated. The overall survival (OS) highly influenced the ICER. With a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY, the probability of TOR being cost-effective was the highest. Subgroup analysis in non-visceral metastasis revealed 0.4 and 10% reduction in ICER from the base-case results of FUL5 500 mg versus EXE and TOR versus EXE, respectively, while threshold analysis indicated EVE and FUL prices should be reduced 73 and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION: As a second-line therapy for postmenopausal women with HR +/HER2 - mBC, TOR may be cost-effective relative to other alternatives and seems to be the most favorable choice, based on a WTP threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY. FUL 250 mg is expected to be as costly and effective as EXE. The cost-effectiveness of EXE + EVE and FUL 500 mg could be improved by a large price reduction.

19770,Cost-Effectiveness of Second-Line Endocrine Therapies in Postmenopausal Women with Hormone Receptor-positive and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Exemestane (EXE), exemestane + everolimus (EXE + EVE), toremifene (TOR), and fulvestrant (FUL) are second-line endocrine therapies for postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive (HR +)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2 -) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in Japan. Although the efficacy of these therapies has been shown in recent studies, cost-effectiveness has not yet been determined in Japan. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of second-line endocrine therapies for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR + and HER2 - mBC. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the therapies over a 15-year time horizon from a public healthcare payer''s perspective. The efficacy and utility parameters were determined via a systematic search of the literature. Direct medical care costs were used. A discount rate of 2% was applied for costs and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed for non-visceral metastasis. A series of sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and threshold analysis were performed. RESULTS: Base-case analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 3 million and 6 million Japanese yen (JPY)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for TOR and FUL 500 mg relative to EXE, respectively. FUL 250 mg and EXE + EVE were dominated. The overall survival (OS) highly influenced the ICER. With a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY, the probability of TOR being cost-effective was the highest. Subgroup analysis in non-visceral metastasis revealed 0.4 and 10% reduction in ICER from the base-case results of FUL5 500 mg versus EXE and TOR versus EXE, respectively, while threshold analysis indicated EVE and FUL prices should be reduced 73 and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION: As a second-line therapy for postmenopausal women with HR +/HER2 - mBC, TOR may be cost-effective relative to other alternatives and seems to be the most favorable choice, based on a WTP threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY.

DESIGN: A lifetime Markov model provided the framework for the analysis. SETTING: Data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England and Wales primarily informed the analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Propensity score matched patients in the NJR who received either a UKR or TKR. INTERVENTIONS: UKR is a less invasive alternative to TKR, where only the compartment affected by osteoarthritis is replaced. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare system costs. RESULTS: The provision of UKR is expected to lead to a gain in QALYs compared with TKR for all age and gender subgroups (male: <60 years: 0.12, 60-75 years: 0.20, 75+ years: 0.19; female: <60 years: 0.10, 60-75 years: 0.28, 75+ years: 0.44) and a reduction in costs (male: <60: pound-1223, 60-75 years: pound-1355, 75+ years: pound-2005; female: <60 years: pound-601, 60-75 years: pound-935, 75+ years: pound-1102 per patient over the lifetime).

Regardless of surgeon usage, costs associated with UKR are expected to be lower than those of TKR (<10%: pound-127, >/=10%: pound-758).

RESULTS: The provision of UKR is expected to lead to a gain in QALYs compared with TKR for all age and gender subgroups (male: <60 years: 0.12, 60-75 years: 0.20, 75+ years: 0.19; female: <60 years: 0.10, 60-75 years: 0.28, 75+ years: 0.44) and a reduction in costs (male: <60: pound-1223, 60-75 years: pound-1355, 75+ years: pound-2005; female: <60 years: pound-601, 60-75 years: pound-935, 75+ years: pound-1102 per patient over the lifetime). UKR is expected to lead to a reduction in QALYs compared with TKR when performed by surgeons with low UKR utilisation but an increase among those with high utilisation (<10%, median 6%: -0.04, >/=10%, median 27%: 0.26). Regardless of surgeon usage, costs associated with UKR are expected to be lower than those of TKR (<10%: pound-127, >/=10%: pound-758). CONCLUSIONS: UKR can be expected to generate better health outcomes and lower lifetime costs than TKR.

19783,Cost-effectiveness analysis of stereotactic body radiotherapy and surgery for medically operable early stage non small cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Projections estimate an increase of 50% of the incidence of lung cancer by 2030. Early-stage non-small cell lung cancer represented 19% of NSCLC cases diagnosed in the US between 2005 and 2011. There is rising evidence in favour of lung cancer screening, which will reduce the occurrence of later-stage lung cancers while raising the incidence of early-stage NSCLC. Current guidelines state that for early-stage NSCLC, surgical resection should be performed, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an option for patients who are non-medically operable. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of SBRT with lobectomy in medically operable patients. METHODS: We developed a Markov model based on the survival results of two randomized studies comparing SBRT and video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy in early-stage NSCLC, to describe survival and treatment related complications of patients treated for early-stage NSCLC. This analysis was conducted from the French payer perspective on a lifetime perspective. Utility values, recurrence risks, and costs were adapted from the literature. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of the assumptions made. RESULTS: The Markov model developed was consistent with survival data reported in the pool analysis of the randomized studies. SBRT and lobectomy total costs were 9,234.15euro and 10,726.98euro, respectively, and the quality-adjusted life expectancies were 16.35 and 15.80 QALYs, respectively. The DSA, run on every assumption made, revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was mainly sensitive to the decrement of utility caused by treatment related complications and initial cost of both surgery and SBRT. The PSA showed that SBRT had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness compared to lobectomy. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first medico-economic study evaluating SBRT and lobectomy in stage I NSCLC based on randomized studies, and our analyses suggest that SBRT is dominant over lobectomy in operable early-stage NSCLC treatment. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed that this result was robust and that it was not modified by the assumptions made in the Markov model building.",2018-01-27339,29706462,Radiother Oncol,Adrien Paix,2018,128 / 3,534-540,No,29706462,"Adrien Paix; Georges Noel; Pierre-Emmanuel Falcoz; Pierre Levy; Cost-effectiveness analysis of stereotactic body radiotherapy and surgery for medically operable early stage non small cell lung cancer, Radiother Oncol, 2018 Sep; 128(3):0167-8140; 534-540",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",Stereotactic body radiotherapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Lobectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,67 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,-2714.24,Euro,2017,-3238.54
19784,Economic evaluation of human urinary kallindinogenase for patients with acute ischemic stroke in China,"OBJECTIVES: In China, both human urinary kallindinogenase (HUK) and 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) are recommended for clinical use to improve cerebral blood circulation during an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The objective was to evaluate the economic value of HUK vs NBP for patients with AIS from a Chinese payer''s perspective. METHODS: An economic evaluation based on data of patients who have been treated with either HUK (n = 488) or NBP (n = 885) from a prospective, phase IV, multi-center, clinical registry study (Chinese Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Outcome Registry, CASTOR) was conducted to analyze the cost and effectiveness of HUK vs NBP for AIS in China. Before the analysis, the patients were matched using propensity score. Both a cost-minimization analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis were conducted to compare the matched pairs. A bootstrapping exercise was conducted for the matched arms to demonstrate the probability of one intervention being cost-effective over another for a given willingness-to-pay for an extra quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 463 pairs were matched. The overall medical cost in the HUK arm is USD 2,701.20, while the NBP arm is USD 3,436.83, indicating HUK is preferred with cost-minimization analysis. Although the QALY gained in the HUK arm (0.77176) compared with the NBP arm (0.76831) is statistically insignificant (p = .4862), the cost-effectiveness analysis as exploratory analysis found that, compared with NBP, HUK is a cost-saving strategy with the lower costs of USD 735.63 and greater QALYs gained of 0.00345. Among the 5,000 bootstrapping replications, 100% indicates that HUK is cost-effective compared with NBP under a 1-time-GDP threshold; and 97.12% indicates the same under a 3-time-GDP threshold. CONCLUSION: This economic evaluation study indicates that administrating HUK is a cost-saving therapy compared with NBP for managing blood flow during AIS in the Chinese setting.",2018-01-27342,29706099,J Med Econ,Ziyi Lin,2018,21 / 8,778-783,Yes,29706099,"Ziyi Lin; Xiuqin Rao; Zhijun Zhang; Jianwei Xuan; Economic evaluation of human urinary kallindinogenase for patients with acute ischemic stroke in China, J Med Econ, 2018 Aug; 21(8):1369-6998; 778-783",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Human urinary kallindinogenase vs. 3-n-butylphthalide,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-213226.09,United States,2017,-225135.68
19785,Cost-effectiveness of circumferential fusion for lumbar spondylolisthesis: propensity-matched comparison of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with anterior-posterior fusion,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and dual-approach anteroposterior (AP) are common techniques to achieve circumferential fusion for lumbar spondylolisthesis. It is unclear which approach is more cost-effective. PURPOSE: Our goal was to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) by calculating the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for each approach. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This study is a propensity-matched cost-effectiveness comparison. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis undergoing single-level AP fusion or TLIF and enrolled in a prospective observational surgical database were included in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures in this study were the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Short Form-6D (SF-6D). METHODS: From a prospective surgical database, patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis undergoing single-level AP fusion were propensity matched to a TLIF cohort based on age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, workers compensation, preoperative ODI, and back and leg pain numeric scores. Quality-adjusted life years gained were determined using baseline and 1- and 2-yearpostoperative SF-6D scores. Cost was calculated from actual, direct hospital costs and included subsequent postsurgical costs (epidural spinal injections, spine-related emergency department visits, readmissions, and revision surgery). RESULTS: Thirty-one cases of AP fusions were identified and propensity matched to 31 TLIF patients. Patients undergoing TLIF had a shorter mean operative time (270 vs. 328 minutes, p=.039) but no difference in estimated blood loss (526 vs. 548 cc, p=.804) or hospital length of stay (4.5 vs. 6.1 days, p=.146). Quality-adjusted life years gained at 2 years were also similar (0.140 vs. 0.130, p=.672). The mean index surgery and the total 2-year costs were lower for TLIF compared with AP (index: $29,428 vs. $31,466; final: $30,684 vs. $331,880). As overall costs were lower and QALYs gained were similar for TLIF compared with AP fusion, TLIF was the dominant intervention with an ICER of $116,327. CONCLUSIONS: Under our study parameters, surgical treatment of lumbar spondylolisthesis with TLIF is more cost-effective compared with AP fusion. Because of the short-term follow-up, the longevity of this should be further investigated.",2018-01-27345,29705337,Spine J,Ehsan Jazini,2018,/,,No,29705337,"Ehsan Jazini; Jeffrey L Gum; Steven D Glassman; Charles H 3rd Crawford; Mladen Djurasovic; Roge Kirk 2nd Owens; John R 2nd Dimar; Katlyn E McGraw; Leah Y Carreon; Cost-effectiveness of circumferential fusion for lumbar spondylolisthesis: propensity-matched comparison of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with anterior-posterior fusion, Spine J, 2018 Feb 27; ():1529-9430",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Surgical,Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion vs. Anterior interbody fusion,Low-grade spondylolisthesis; no prior spine surgery,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-119600,United States,2016,-128970.39
19786,Cost-Effectiveness of Sorafenib Monotherapy and Selected Combination Therapy with Sorafenib in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib treatment in combination with other therapies versus sorafenib monotherapy among patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are enrolled in Taiwan''s National Health Insurance. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate treatment outcomes and direct medical costs of sorafenib combination therapy and monotherapy from the perspective of the healthcare payer in Taiwan. Both life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used to measure treatment outcomes, and all costs were expressed in 2014 New Taiwan dollars (NT$). Model parameters were acquired primarily using data from population-based administrative databases: the Cancer Registry, National Health Insurance Research Database, and the Death Registry. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at three times the per capita gross domestic product at NT$2,133,930. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: For advanced HCC patients, sorafenib combined with other treatments might not be a cost-effective option when compared with sorafenib therapy alone. In the base-case analysis, combination treatment with sorafenib was estimated to increase costs by NT$434,788 compared with monotherapy, with a gain of 0.1595 QALYs. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was NT$2,725,943 per QALY gained. Results were sensitive to health utility values and monthly costs accrued in the progression-free survival state of the combination therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence from Taiwan demonstrated that while sorafenib in combination with other therapeutic approaches might improve treatment outcome when compared with sorafenib monotherapy, its ICER exceeded the WTP threshold and was considered not cost-effective.",2018-01-27347,29704658,Value Health Reg Issues,Jung-Chen Ho,2018,15 /,120-126,No,29704658,"Jung-Chen Ho; Meng-Lun Hsieh; Po-Heng Chuang; Vivian Chia-Rong Hsieh; Cost-Effectiveness of Sorafenib Monotherapy and Selected Combination Therapy with Sorafenib in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Value Health Reg Issues, 2018 May; 15():2212-1099; 120-126",QALY,China,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",Combination therapy (Sorafenib with other treatment) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Monotherapy (Sorafenib alone),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,2725943,Taiwan,2014,98379.15
19787,Heart rate variability testing: could it change spending for rheumatoid arthritis patients in the United States? An exploratory economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) testing with heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown in early research to predict 52-week outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). HRV testing could be combined with putative ANS biologic pathways to improve treatment response for RA patients. This study explored potential costs and health outcomes of introducing HRV testing into RA treatment, without and with ANS optimization. METHODS: A decision tree exploratory economic model compared HRV testing to standard care in moderate-to-severe biologic-eligible patients over a 10-year time horizon. HRV data was derived from an observational study of RA patients (n = 33). Patients were stratified into treatment groups based on HRV test scores indicating ""low probability of response"" and ""moderate to high probability of response"". This study explored adding ANS optimization based on HRV score followed by clinically-appropriate treatment. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the US population were estimated. RESULTS: HRV testing in biologic-eligible patients decreased non-effective biologic use, reducing US healthcare costs by $34.6 billion over 10 years with QALYs unchanged. When combined with ANS optimization in biologic-eligible patients, HRV testing could increase costs by $3.6 billion over 10 years but save over 350,000 QALYs. Among all RA patients, HRV testing with ANS optimization could save over $8 billion and over 100,000 QALYs over 10 years, depending on the positive predictive value (PPV) of the HRV test.

19789,A comparison of the cost-effectiveness of intramedullary nail fixation and locking plate fixation in the treatment of adult patients with an extra-articular fracture of the distal tibia,"Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of intramedullary nail fixation and ''locking'' plate fixation in the treatment of extra-articular fractures of the distal tibia. Patients and Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS), based on evidence from the Fixation of Distal Tibia Fractures (UK FixDT) multicentre parallel trial. Data from 321 patients were available for analysis. Costs were collected prospectively over the 12-month follow-up period using trial case report forms and participant-completed questionnaires. Cost-effectiveness was reported in terms of incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and net monetary benefit. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates. Results: Mean NHS and PSS costs were significantly lower for patients treated with an intramedullary nail than for those treated with a locking plate (- pound970, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1685 to -256; p = 0.05). There was a small increase in QALYs gained in the nail fixation group (0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06; p = 0.52). The probability of cost-effectiveness for nail fixation exceeded 90% at cost-effectiveness thresholds as low as pound15 000 per additional QALY.

Patients and Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS), based on evidence from the Fixation of Distal Tibia Fractures (UK FixDT) multicentre parallel trial. Data from 321 patients were available for analysis. Costs were collected prospectively over the 12-month follow-up period using trial case report forms and participant-completed questionnaires. Cost-effectiveness was reported in terms of incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and net monetary benefit. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates. Results: Mean NHS and PSS costs were significantly lower for patients treated with an intramedullary nail than for those treated with a locking plate (- pound970, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1685 to -256; p = 0.05). There was a small increase in QALYs gained in the nail fixation group (0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06; p = 0.52). The probability of cost-effectiveness for nail fixation exceeded 90% at cost-effectiveness thresholds as low as pound15 000 per additional QALY.

19794,Cost-Effectiveness of Insulin Degludec Versus Insulin Glargine U100 in Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Serbia,"INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Serbia. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis, implementing a simple short-term model, was used to compare treatment costs and outcomes with degludec versus glargine U100 in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Cost-effectiveness was analysed in a 1-year setting, based on data from clinical trials. Costs were estimated from the healthcare payer perspective, the Serbian Health Insurance Fund (RFZO). The outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) or cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Degludec is highly cost-effective compared with glargine U100 for people with T1DM and T2DM in Serbia. The ICERs are estimated at 417,586 RSD/QALY gained in T1DM, 558,811 RSD/QALY gained in T2DM on basal oral therapy (T2DMBOT) and 1,200,141 RSD/QALY gained in T2DM on basal-bolus therapy (T2DMB/B). All ICERs fall below the commonly accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness in Serbia (1,785,642 RSD/QALY gained). In all three patient groups, insulin costs are higher with degludec than with glargine U100, but these costs are partially offset by savings from a lower daily insulin dose in T1DM and T2DMBOT, a reduction in hypoglycaemic events in all three patient groups and reduced costs of SMBG testing in the T2DM groups with degludec versus glargine U100. CONCLUSION: Degludec is a cost-effective alternative to glargine U100 for patients with T1DM and T2DM in Serbia. Degludec may particularly benefit those suffering from hypoglycaemia or where the patient would benefit from the option of flexible dosing.

New generation of direct-active antiviral medications is an epoch-making turning point in the management of HCV infections. OBJECTIVE: Conducing a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the combination of elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin for the management of all HCV patients (even those in the initial stages of fibrosis). METHODS: A Markov model was built on the natural history of the disease to assess the efficacy of the alternatives. The outcomes are expressed in terms of quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and result in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). RESULTS: Elbasvir/grazoprevir implies an expenditure of euro21,104,253.74 with a gain of 19,287.90 QALYs and sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin implies an expenditure of euro31,904,410.11 with a gain of 18,855.96 QALYs. Elbasvir/grazoprevir is thus a dominant strategy.

19798,Cost-effectiveness analysis of surgical versus non-surgical management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures,"PURPOSE: An Achilles tendon rupture is a common injury that typically affects people in the middle of their working lives. The injury has a negative impact in terms of both morbidity for the individual and the risk of substantial sick leave. The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of surgical compared with non-surgical management in patients with an acute Achilles tendon rupture. METHODS: One hundred patients (86 men, 14 women; mean age, 40 years) with an acute Achilles tendon rupture were randomised (1:1) to either surgical treatment or non-surgical treatment, both with an accelerated rehabilitation protocol (surgical n = 49, non-surgical n = 51). One of the surgical patients was excluded due to a partial re-rupture and five surgical patients were lost to the 1-year economic follow-up. One patient was excluded due to incorrect inclusion and one was lost to the 1-year follow-up in the non-surgical group. The cost was divided into direct and indirect costs. The direct cost is the actual cost of health care, whereas the indirect cost is the production loss related to the impact of the patient''s injury in terms of lost ability to work. The health benefits were assessed using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sampling uncertainty was assessed by means of non-parametric boot-strapping. RESULTS: Pre-injury, the groups were comparable in terms of demographic data and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The mean cost of surgical management was euro7332 compared with euro6008 for non-surgical management (p = 0.024). The mean number of QALYs during the 1-year time period was 0.89 and 0.86 in the surgical and non-surgical groups respectively. The (incremental) cost-effectiveness ratio was euro45,855. Based on bootstrapping, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows that the surgical treatment is 57% likely to be cost-effective at a threshold value of euro50,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment was more expensive compared with non-surgical management. The cost-effectiveness results give a weak support (57% likelihood) for the surgical treatment to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay per QALY threshold of euro50,000. This is support for surgical treatment; however, additionally cost-effectiveness studies alongside RCTs are important to clarify which treatment option is preferred from a cost-effectiveness perspective.

19799,Cost-effectiveness of population-based vascular disease screening and intervention in men from the Viborg Vascular (VIVA) trial,"BACKGROUND: Population-based screening and intervention for abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease and hypertension was recently reported to reduce the relative risk of mortality among Danish men by 7 per cent. The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of vascular screening versus usual care (ad hoc primary care-based risk assessment) from a national health service perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness evaluation was conducted alongside an RCT involving all men from a region in Denmark (50 156) who were allocated to screening (25 078) or no screening (25 078) and followed for up to 5 years. Mobile nurse teams provided screening locally and, for individuals with positive test results, referrals were made to general practices or hospital-based specialized centres for vascular surgery. Intention-to-treat-based, censoring-adjusted incremental costs (2014 euros), life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using Lin''s average estimator method. Incremental net benefit was estimated using Willan''s estimator and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The cost of screening was estimated at euro148 (95 per cent c.i. 126 to 169), and the effectiveness at 0.022 (95 per cent c.i. 0.006 to 0.038) life-years and 0.069 (0.054 to 0.083) QALYs, generating average costs of euro6872 per life-year and euro2148 per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro40 000 per QALY, the probabilities of cost-effectiveness were 98 and 99 per cent respectively. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 71 per cent when all the sensitivity analyses were combined into one conservative scenario.

19800,Estimating the Cost-Effectiveness of Lung Cancer Screening with Low-Dose Computed Tomography for High-Risk Smokers in Australia,"INTRODUCTION: Health economic evaluations of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) that are underpinned by clinical outcomes are relatively few. METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of LDCT lung screening in Australia by applying Australian cost and survival data to the outcomes observed in the U.S. National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), in which a 20% lung cancer mortality benefit was demonstrated for three rounds of annual screening among high-risk smokers age 55 to 74 years. Screening-related costs were estimated from Medicare Benefits Schedule reimbursement rates (2015), lung cancer diagnosis and treatment costs from a 2012 Australian hospital-based study, lung cancer survival rates from the New South Wales Cancer Registry (2005-2009), and other-cause mortality from Australian life tables weighted by smoking status. The health utility outcomes, screening participation rates, and lung cancer rates were those observed in the NLST. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of LDCT lung screening was estimated at AU$138,000 (80% confidence interval: AU$84,700-AU$353,000)/life-year gained and AU$233,000 (80% confidence interval: AU$128,000-AU$1,110,000)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The ICER was more favorable when LDCT screening impact on all-cause mortality was considered, even when the costs of incidental findings were also estimated in sensitivity analyses: AU$157,000/QALY gained. This can be compared to an indicative willingness-to-pay threshold in Australia of AU$30,000 to AU$50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: LDCT lung screening using NLST selection and implementation criteria is unlikely to be cost-effective in Australia. Future economic evaluations should consider alternative screening eligibility criteria, intervals, nodule management, the impact and cost of new therapies, investigations of incidental findings, and incorporation of smoking cessation interventions.",2018-01-27387,29689434,J Thorac Oncol,Stephen Wade,2018,13 / 8,1094-1105,No,29689434,"Stephen Wade; Marianne Weber; Michael Caruana; Yoon-Jung Kang; Henry Marshall; Renee Manser; Shalini Vinod; Nicole Rankin; Kwun Fong; Karen Canfell; Estimating the Cost-Effectiveness of Lung Cancer Screening with Low-Dose Computed Tomography for High-Risk Smokers in Australia, J Thorac Oncol, 2018 Aug; 13(8):1556-1380; 1094-1105",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Screening,Low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer vs. None,Smoking history of 30 or more pack-years and 15 years or less since quitting,74 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,233000,Australia,2015,191373.25
