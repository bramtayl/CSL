3001,Management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: how cost-effective are glycoprotein IIb/IIIA antagonists in the UK National Health Service?,"BACKGROUND: The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (GPAs) represent a new class of drugs to prevent platelet aggregation in the acute treatment of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). Systematic reviews have identified serious limitations in published cost-effectiveness analyses, including a lack of UK-specific studies and an absence of studies comparing different protocols for the use of GPAs. METHODS: A model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of a variety of protocols employing GPAs for patients presenting with NSTE-ACS in the UK. The perspective of the UK National Health Service was adopted, with outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Four treatment strategies were evaluated: GPAs as part of initial medical management (Strategy 1); GPAs in patients with planned percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs; Strategy 2); GPAs as an adjunct to the PCI procedure (Strategy 3); and no GPAs (Strategy 4). Baseline event rates and costs were taken from a UK observational study of ACS patients and relative risk reductions from GPAs were taken from a meta analysis of trials. Long-term costs and QALYs were estimated using data from a UK longitudinal study. RESULTS: The most cost-effective use of GPAs is likely to be Strategy 1, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of between pound4605 to pound10,343. Focusing this use of GPAs only on the subgroup of patients at high risk appears to represent the most cost-effective use of NHS resources. CONCLUSIONS: Medical management of patients with NSTE-ACS using GPAs is the most cost-effective use of resources, particularly if targeted to higher risk subgroups.",2005-01-01445,15823630,Int J Cardiol,Stephen Palmer,2005,100 / 2,229-40,No,15823630,"Stephen Palmer; Mark Sculpher; Zoe Philips; Mike Robinson; Laura Ginnelly; Ameet Bakhai; Keith Abrams; Nicola Cooper; Chris Packham; Khaled Alfakih; Alistair Hall; David Gray; Management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: how cost-effective are glycoprotein IIb/IIIA antagonists in the UK National Health Service?, Int J Cardiol, 2005-Apr-20; 100(2):0167-5273; 229-40",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Glycoprotein antagonists (GPAs) as adjunct to percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) vs. No GPAs, standard therapy",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,6.00,2.00,25555.56,United Kingdom,2001,53765.76
3002,Minimizing complications from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs: cost-effectiveness of competing strategies in varying risk groups,"OBJECTIVE: To appraise the cost-effectiveness of competing therapeutic strategies in patient cohorts eligible for aspirin prophylaxis with varying degrees of gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed to evaluate 3 competing strategies for the management of chronic arthritis: 1) a generic nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID(NS)) alone; 2) NSAID(NS) plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI); and 3) a cyclooxygenase 2-selective inhibitor (coxib) alone. Cost estimates were from a third-party payer perspective. The outcomes were incremental cost per ulcer complication avoided and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of varying patient GI risks and aspirin use. RESULTS: In average-risk patients, the NSAID(NS) + PPI strategy costs an incremental 45,350 US dollars per additional ulcer complication avoided and 309,666 US dollars per QALY gained compared with the NSAID(NS) strategy. The coxib strategy was less effective and more expensive than the NSAID(NS) + PPI strategy. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the NSAID(NS) + PPI strategy became the dominant approach in patients at high risk for an NSAID adverse event (i.e., patients taking aspirin with > or =1 risk factor for a GI complication). CONCLUSION: Generic nonselective NSAIDs are most cost-effective in patients at low risk for an adverse event.

3004,Consequences of eliminating HLA-B in deceased donor kidney allocation to increase minority transplantation,"HLA matching contributes to the disparity in Caucasian compared to minority kidney transplantation. HLA-B locus matching was eliminated from kidney allocation to shift a projected 166 organs from Caucasians to minorities annually. This study estimated the economic and quality-of-life impact of this policy. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov model. Data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) were used to estimate race-specific outcomes, patient and graft survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and medical costs in U.S. dollars. The greatest benefit is expected in African Americans, with expected savings of US 7.5 million dollars and 243 QALYs. Smaller cost and QALY benefits are seen in other minority groups. In Caucasians, a loss of 7.0 million dollars and a decrease of 967 QALYs are expected with the shift of organs. Overall, this policy is expected to save US 5400 dollars for each QALY that is lost. The same increase in minority transplantation would be expected from increasing Caucasian donation rates by 5.5%, or African-American donation by 29.0%, each producing large cost savings and QALY gains. Policies to increase minority transplants by increasing donation rates may prove more cost effective than the elimination of HLA-B matching from deceased donor kidney allocation.",2005-01-01448,15816891,Am J Transplant,Nzisa Mutinga,2005,5 / 5,1090-8,No,15816891,"Nzisa Mutinga; Daniel C Brennan; Mark A Schnitzler; Consequences of eliminating HLA-B in deceased donor kidney allocation to increase minority transplantation, Am J Transplant, 2005-May; 5(5):1600-6135; 1090-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,No human leukocyte antigen-B (HLA-B) matching in donor kidney allocation schema vs. HLA-B matching,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,2000,Not Stated
3005,Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in heart failure--a model to assess the economic value of this new medical technology,"OBJECTIVES: This article describes the framework of a comprehensive European model developed to assess clinical and economic outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) versus optimal pharmacological therapy (OPT) alone in patients with heart failure. METHODS: The model structure is based on information obtained from the literature, expert opinion, and a European CRT Steering Committee. The decision-analysis tool allows a consideration of direct medical and indirect costs, and computes outcomes for distinctive periods of time up to 5 years. Qualitative data can also be entered for cost-utility analysis. Model input data for a preliminary economic appraisal of the economic value of CRT in Germany were obtained from clinical trials, experts, health statistics, and medical tariff lists. RESULTS: The model offers comprehensive analysis capabilities and high flexibility so that it can easily be adapted to any European country or special setting. The illustrative analysis for Germany indicates that CRT is a cost-effective intervention. Although CRT is associated with average direct medical net costs of Euro 5880 per patient, this finding means that 22% of its upfront implantation cost is recouped already within 1 year because of significantly decreased hospitalizations. With 36,600 Euros the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is below the euro equivalent (41,300 Euros, 1 Euro = US1.21 dollars) of the commonly used threshold level of US50,000 dollars considered to represent cost-effectiveness. The sensitivity analysis showed these preliminary results to be fairly robust towards changes in key assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: The European CRT model is an important tool to assess the economic value of CRT in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. In the light of the planned introduction of Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) based reimbursement in various European countries, the economic data generated by the model can play an important role in the decision-making process.",2005-01-01452,15804321,Value Health,Kurt Banz,2005,8 / 2,128-39,Yes,15804321,"Kurt Banz; Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in heart failure--a model to assess the economic value of this new medical technology, Value Health, 2005 Mar-Apr; 8(2):1098-3015; 128-39",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) plus optimal pharmaceutical therapy (OPT) vs. OPT alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,36600,Euro,2002,49778.42
3006,Cost-effectiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin for reducing red blood cells transfusions in critically ill patients,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of using recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to reduce red blood cells (RBC) transfusions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: Decision analysis examining costs and effectiveness of using rHuEPO versus not using rHuEPO in a simulated adult medical/surgical/trauma (mixed) ICU. Two independent cost-effectiveness models were created based on the results of two multicenter studies that investigated the use of rHuEPO. Base case assumptions and estimates of effectiveness were obtained from these two studies. Mean cumulative doses of rHuEPO were 190,900 units and 102,400 units for studies 1 and 2, respectively. The models accounted for the deferral rate for allogeneic RBC transfusions, rHuEPO efficacy (the reduction in allogeneic RBC use), and adverse effects of rHuEPO and allogeneic RBC transfusions. Model estimates were obtained from published sources. Costs were expressed in 2002 US dollar (dollars) and effectiveness was measured using discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A 3% discount rate was used. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using second-order Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Incremental costs of using rHuEPO to reduce RBC transfusions amounted to 1918 dollars and 1439 dollars; incremental effectiveness values were 0.0563 QALYs and 0.0305 QALYs; and the cost-effectiveness ratios were 34,088 dollars and 47,149 dollars per QALY for studies 1 and 2, respectively. The model was most sensitive to the attributable risk of nosocomial bacterial infections per RBC unit. rHuEPO was cost-effective in 52.0% of the Monte Carlo simulations for a willingness to pay of 50,000 dollars/QALY.

3008,The cost-effectiveness of candesartan-based antihypertensive treatment for the prevention of nonfatal stroke: results from the Study on COgnition and Prognosis in the Elderly,"Patients who survive a first stroke are often left with permanent disabilities, and have significant needs for rehabilitation and long-term care. Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of candesartan-based antihypertensive treatment for the prevention of nonfatal stroke. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on data from Study on COgnition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE), where patients were randomly assigned to receive the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan or placebo, with open-label active antihypertensive treatment added as needed. The analysis was carried out using a Markov model, which combined clinical and resource utilization data from SCOPE with Swedish retail prices for drugs and unit costs for in-patient stays, and outpatient visits. The cost per patient was 1949 EUR in the candesartan group and 1578 EUR in the control group. The largest share of the cost was attributed to antihypertensive treatment in the candesartan group and to the long-term cost of stroke in the control group. Candesartan-based antihypertensive treatment was associated with 0.0289 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient and an incremental cost per QALY gained of approximately 13,000 EUR. Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were fairly stable. In conclusion, the cost per QALY gained with candesartan-based antihypertensive treatment lies within the range of society's willingness to pay for health gains. The results indicate that candesartan-based antihypertensive treatment is cost-effective for the prevention of nonfatal stroke.",2005-01-01454,15800664,J Hum Hypertens,J Lundkvist,2005,19 / 7,569-76,No,15800664,"J Lundkvist; M Ekman; B Kartman; J Carlsson; L Jönsson; H Lithell; The cost-effectiveness of candesartan-based antihypertensive treatment for the prevention of nonfatal stroke: results from the Study on COgnition and Prognosis in the Elderly, J Hum Hypertens, 2005-Jul; 19(7):0950-9240; 569-76",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Candasarten based treatment vs. Usual antihypertensive therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,13000,Euro,2001,17007.03
3009,Potential cost-effectiveness of maternal and infant antiretroviral interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission during breast-feeding,"INTRODUCTION: One-third of maternal-to-child HIV transmission occurs during breast-feeding (BF). Several trials are currently evaluating the efficacy of postpartum antiretrovirals to reduce BF transmission. METHODS: This study used Markov modeling to define the circumstances under which the following interventions would be cost-effective: BF for 6 months with daily infant nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis; maternal combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and for 6 months of BF; and maternal combination ART only for women who meet CD4 criteria. Each was compared to: BF for 12 months; BF for 6 months; and formula feeding for 12 months. Strategies were evaluated for a hypothetical cohort of 40,000 pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, in the context of available voluntary counseling and testing in antenatal care. Model estimates were derived from the literature and local sources. Sensitivity analyses were performed on uncertain estimates. The perspective used was that of a government health district. RESULTS: Using base case estimates, BF for 6 months was the economically preferred strategy: it cost 806,995 dollars and generated 446,208 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Providing daily infant NVP cost an additional 93,638 dollars and generated 1183 additional QALYs, but its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 79 dollars/QALY exceeded the standard willingness to pay (64 dollars/QALY) for most resource-poor settings. Maternal combination ART was potentially very effective but too costly for most resource-poor settings (ICER: 87 dollars/QALY). In order for daily infant NVP during BF to be preferred, it must have >/=44% relative efficacy or cost </=5.00 dollars/mo. If NVP were donated, it would only have to be minimally effective to be the economically preferred strategy.

3013,Potential cost-effectiveness of maternal and infant antiretroviral interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission during breast-feeding,"INTRODUCTION: One-third of maternal-to-child HIV transmission occurs during breast-feeding (BF). Several trials are currently evaluating the efficacy of postpartum antiretrovirals to reduce BF transmission. METHODS: This study used Markov modeling to define the circumstances under which the following interventions would be cost-effective: BF for 6 months with daily infant nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis; maternal combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and for 6 months of BF; and maternal combination ART only for women who meet CD4 criteria. Each was compared to: BF for 12 months; BF for 6 months; and formula feeding for 12 months. Strategies were evaluated for a hypothetical cohort of 40,000 pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, in the context of available voluntary counseling and testing in antenatal care. Model estimates were derived from the literature and local sources. Sensitivity analyses were performed on uncertain estimates. The perspective used was that of a government health district. RESULTS: Using base case estimates, BF for 6 months was the economically preferred strategy: it cost 806,995 dollars and generated 446,208 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Providing daily infant NVP cost an additional 93,638 dollars and generated 1183 additional QALYs, but its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 79 dollars/QALY exceeded the standard willingness to pay (64 dollars/QALY) for most resource-poor settings. Maternal combination ART was potentially very effective but too costly for most resource-poor settings (ICER: 87 dollars/QALY). In order for daily infant NVP during BF to be preferred, it must have >/=44% relative efficacy or cost </=5.00 dollars/mo. If NVP were donated, it would only have to be minimally effective to be the economically preferred strategy. If ART cost </=34.50 dollars/mo, ART to all mothers would become the preferred strategy under our assumption of 82% efficacy.

3014,Is expanding Medicare coverage cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND: Proposals to expand Medicare coverage tend to be expensive, but the value of services purchased is not known. This study evaluates the efficiency of the average private supplemental insurance plan for Medicare recipients. METHODS: Data from the National Health Interview Survey, the National Death Index, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were analyzed to estimate the costs, changes in life expectancy, and health-related quality of life gains associated with providing private supplemental insurance coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. Model inputs included socio-demographic, health, and health behavior characteristics. Parameter estimates from regression models were used to predict quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs associated with private supplemental insurance relative to Medicare only. Markov decision analysis modeling was then employed to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Medicare supplemental insurance is associated with increased health care utilization, but the additional costs associated with this utilization are offset by gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy. The incremental cost-effectiveness of private supplemental insurance is approximately $24,000 per QALY gained relative to Medicare alone. CONCLUSION: Supplemental insurance for Medicare beneficiaries is a good value, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparable to medical interventions commonly deemed worthwhile.",2005-01-01474,15766380,BMC Health Serv Res,Peter Franks,2005,5 / 1,23,Yes,15766380,"Peter Franks; Peter Muennig; Marthe Gold; Is expanding Medicare coverage cost-effective?, BMC Health Serv Res, 2005-Mar-14; 5(1):1472-6963; 23",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Supplemental insurance vs. Medicare only,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,24000,United States,1999,37283.7
3015,A comparison of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 3 intervention strategies for AIDS wasting,"OBJECTIVE: To compare oxandrolone (OX) or strength training with nutrition alone (NA) for AIDS wasting. SUBJECTS: Fifty patients with AIDS; 47 completing the study. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to (1) NA with placebo pills, (2) nutrition with 10 mg of OX administered orally twice a day, or (3) nutrition with progressive resistance training (PRT) for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Midthigh cross-sectional muscle area (CSMA), physical functioning (PF), costs, and cost-effectiveness in dollars/quality-adjusted life-years (dollars/QALYs). RESULTS: The OX and PRT subjects had increases in CSMA (7.0% +/- 2.5%, P = 0.01; 5.0% +/- 2.0%, P = 0.04, respectively), although these increases did not differ significantly from the NA arm (NA: 1.0% +/- 1.0%; OX vs. NA: P = 0.09; PRT vs. NA: P = 0.26). Only PRT caused significant improvements in PF (mean +/- SE: 10.4 +/- 3.8 points on a 100-point scale) and 7 measures of strength (P values: 0.04 to <0.001). There were no overall differences between groups in PF change. Among patients with impaired baseline PF, however, OX was significantly less effective than NA and PRT was significantly better than NA. All treatments led to increases in protein intake and performance; NA and PRT also increased caloric intake. The institutional costs per subject in this trial were 983 dollars for NA, 3772 dollars for OX, and 3189 dollars for PRT. At a community-based level of intensity, the institutional costs per QALY were 45,000 dollars (range: 42,000 dollars-64,000 dollars) for NA, 147,000 dollars (range: 147,000 dollars-163,000 dollars) for OX, and 31,000 dollars (range: 21,000 dollars-44,000 dollars) for PRT.

3017,Economic analysis of an early discharge rehabilitation service for older people,"OBJECTIVE: to measure the cost-effectiveness of an early discharge and rehabilitation service (EDRS) in Nottingham, UK. DESIGN: data were collected during a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: cost and cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from the perspective of service providers (health and social services) over a period of 12 months. Resource variables included were the EDRS intervention, the initial acute hospital admission (from randomisation), readmission to hospital, hospital outpatient visits, stays in nursing and residential homes, general practitioner contact, community health services and social services. The effectiveness measure was the EuroQol EQ-5D score, from which quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were calculated. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: at 12 months the mean untransformed total cost for the EDRS was 8,361 pound sterling compared to 10,088 pound sterling for usual care, a saving of 1,727 pound sterling (P = 0.05). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed a high probability that the EDRS was cost effective across a range of monetary values for a QALY.

3018,"Cost utility in the United States of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone for the treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","BACKGROUND: Findings from the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Adultes LNH 98-5 study showed that rituximab added to combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival in adults age >/= 60 years with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL). The current study was conducted to investigate the incremental cost utility of the addition of rituximab to CHOP (R-CHOP) compared with CHOP alone. METHODS: Clinical prognosis of the time to disease progression and death was estimated using published evidence from the LNH 98-5 study (n = 399 patients) that was linked mathematically to published long-term outcome data on patients with DLBCL. Drug-acquisition costs were based on published data from formulary pricing sources, and the costs of cancer surveillance and end-of-life care were based on published literature sources. The authors assessed cost utility as the difference in costs between R-CHOP and CHOP divided by the increase in expected overall survival adjusted for quality of life. RESULTS: Over 5 years, it was projected that R-CHOP would prolong overall survival by 1.04 years. The mean cumulative cost of CHOP was 3358 dollars, and the mean cost of R-CHOP was 17,225 dollars, resulting in a cumulative net increase of 13,867 dollars. The posttreatment cancer surveillance cost for CHOP was 3950 dollars, compared with 5202 dollars for R-CHOP. It was estimated that R-CHOP would have a cost-utility ratio of 19,297 dollars per year of life gained compared with CHOP when adjusted for quality of life. R-CHOP remained cost effective over wide ranges of variables in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CHOP alone, it was predicted that R-CHOP would be cost effective in elderly patients with DLBCL.",2005-01-01479,15756658,Cancer,John C Hornberger,2005,103 / 8,1644-51,No,15756658,"John C Hornberger; Jennie H Best; Cost utility in the United States of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone for the treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Cancer, 2005-Apr-15; 103(8):0008-543X; 1644-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) plus rituximab vs. CHOP alone",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,19297,United States,2003,27142.8
3019,Immunotherapy with autologous tumor cell-BCG vaccine in patients with colon cancer: a prospective study of medical and economic benefits,"We have completed a multicenter, randomized controlled phase III clinical trial in Stages II and III colon cancer patients with active specific immunotherapy (ASI) using autologous tumor cells with an immunomodulating adjuvant bacillus Callmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (OncoVAX) in an adjuvant setting. In this study, patients were randomized to receive either OncoVAX therapy or no therapy after surgical resection of the primary tumor and stratified by stage of disease. Since the biologic essence of the effective tumor immunotherapy is the presence in the vaccine of a minimum number of viable, metabolically active, autologous tumor cells, the processing of the vaccine product, occurred within 48 h after surgery. Analysis of prognostic benefit in the pivotal phase III trial, with a 5.8 year median follow-up, showed that a beneficial effect of OncoVAX is statistically significant for all endpoints including recurrence-free interval, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival in Stage II colon cancer patients. Surgery alone cures approximately 65% of Stage II (Dukes B2, B3) colon cancer patients. In the remaining patients, OncoVAX in an adjuvant setting, significantly prolongs recurrence-free interval (57.1% relative risk reduction) and significantly improves 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival. No statistically significant prognostic benefits were achieved in Stage III (Duke's C1-C3) patients. A health economics assessment was performed on these results in Stage II colon cancer patients using disease-free survival and overall survival (for the entire intent-to-treat population). Cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and sensitivity analysis were applied with, cost of life years, recurrence-free life years and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as the primary endpoints to this analysis. The perspective of the economic analysis was the current direct medical cost established by the health care providers. The introduction of new technologies often leads to additional costs. This report verified that the use of OncoVAX for patients with Stage II colon cancer not only has significant prognostic benefit and positive clinical outcomes, but also showed that OncoVAX therapy yields impressive health economics benefits.",2005-01-01480,15755632,Vaccine,C A Uyl-de Groot,2005,23 / 17-18,2379-87,Yes,15755632,"C A Uyl-de Groot; J B Vermorken; M G Hanna; P Verboom; M T Groot; G J Bonsel; C J L M Meijer; H M Pinedo; Immunotherapy with autologous tumor cell-BCG vaccine in patients with colon cancer: a prospective study of medical and economic benefits, Vaccine, 2005-Mar-18; 23(17-18):1873-2518; 2379-87",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oncovax vaccination vs. Surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,8 Years,4.00,4.00,22461.63,United States,2003,31594.11

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a German university hospital. PATIENTS: Three hundred and three consecutive patients with predominantly cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders admitted between November 1997 and February 1998 with an intensive care unit length of stay >24 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System, and individual intensive care unit and hospital costs were prospectively recorded. Primary outcomes included 5-yr survival, functional status, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcome Short Form, SF-36), effective costs per survivor, and costs per life year and per quality-adjusted life year gained.Of 303 patients, 44 (14.5%) died in the hospital. Among the remaining 259 patients, 190 (73%) survived the 5-yr follow up and 173 patients (91%) completed the questionnaire. Baseline demographics including gender, age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System, and admission diagnosis were similar between hospital and long-term survivors (p > .05 for all). The health status index of those patients surviving the 5-yr follow-up was 0.88, independent of patients' severity of illness. The average effective costs per survivor were 8.827 for intensive care unit costs and 14.130 for intensive care unit and hospital costs. Mean costs per life year and per quality-adjusted life year gained amounted to 19.330 and 21.922 , respectively. Increasing severity of illness was associated with higher costs.

3021,Cost-effectiveness of radiation therapy following conservative surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed for a theoretical cohort of 55-year-old women with DCIS over a life-time horizon. Probability estimates for local noninvasive (N-INV), local invasive (INV), and distant recurrences were obtained from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-17. Utilities for eight nonmetastatic health states were collected from both healthy women and DCIS patients. Direct medical (2002 Medicare fee schedule) and nonmedical costs (time and transportation) of RT were ascertained. RESULTS: For BCS + RT vs. BCS alone, the estimated N-INV and INV rates at 12 years were 9% and 8% vs. 16% and 18%, respectively. The incremental cost of adding RT was 3300 US dollars despite an initial RT cost of 8700 US dollars due to higher local recurrence-related salvage costs incurred with the BCS alone strategy. An increase of 0.09 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) primarily reflected the lower risk of INV with RT, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 36,700 US dollars/QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed the ICER to be affected by baseline probability of a local recurrence, relative efficacy of RT in preventing INV, negative impact of an INV on quality of life, and cost of initial RT. Cost of salvage BCS + RT and source of utilities (healthy women vs. DCIS patients) influenced the ICER albeit to a lesser degree.

OBJECTIVE: To determine optimal CD4 cell count and HIV RNA monitoring frequency in HIV-infected patients prior to antiretroviral therapy initiation. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis using an HIV simulation model incorporating CD4 cell count and HIV RNA as immunological and virological predictors of clinical outcomes. SETTING: Hypothetical clinical setting. PATIENTS: Simulated cohort based on initial clinical presentation of HIV-infected patients in the US. Intervention: CD4 cell count and HIV RNA monitoring at frequencies ranging from every 2 to 24 months prior to antiretroviral initiation, as well as accelerated monitoring frequencies as CD4 cell counts approach a specified treatment threshold. Outcome measures: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs. RESULTS: For patients presenting with median CD4 cell count 546/mm3 and median HIV RNA 4.8 log10 copies/ml, incremental CE ratios ranged from US$37800/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for a constant testing frequency of every 18 months compared with every 24 months, to US$303300/QALY gained for a constant testing frequency of every 2 months compared with every 4 months when starting treatment at a CD4 cell count of 350/mm3.

3027,Cost effectiveness of treating low HDL-cholesterol in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease,"BACKGROUND: A low serum level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Fibrates, particularly gemfibrozil, have been shown to raise HDL-cholesterol levels and reduce the incidence of CHD. The literature on fibrate cost effectiveness is quite limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis is to determine the cost effectiveness of the fibrates gemfibrozil and fenofibrate in the primary prevention of CHD. The target population includes patients with low levels of HDL-cholesterol, but without pre-existing CHD or other CHD risk factors sufficiently elevated to indicate drug therapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From a societal perspective, a lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness model was developed to calculate baseline and treatment costs, life-years gained and QALYs gained. Model parameter values were taken from existing literature. In this 'backward induction' model, the expected costs and outcomes for each 5-year time-interval are utilised in subsequent 5-year time period calculations over the patient's entire lifetime. The study population consisted of a hypothetical cohort of males and females in the US aged 45-74 years, with low levels of HDL-cholesterol and no prior history of CHD. The base-case CHD risk factors for this population were obtained from the VA-HIT (Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial) population baseline characteristics, but assuming no prior CHD history. Estimates for the reduction in CHD risk associated with fibrate therapy reduction are also taken from the VA-HIT study. RESULTS: Using a societal cost-effectiveness threshold of US$50, 000 per QALY, primary prevention of CHD in patients with low HDL-cholesterol levels using generic gemfibrozil therapy is cost effective for all age and sex categories, in contrast to fenofibrate therapy, which is cost effective for males, but not for females at baseline risks levels. In the base-case scenario, because of their higher CHD lifetime risk, it is more cost effective to treat males than females with either gemfibrozil or fenofibrate. For males and females the cost per QALY decreases with age for most age intervals. Gemfibrozil is more cost effective than fenofibrate for all age-sex categories because of the assumed equal efficacy and the higher fenofibrate drug cost. In the comparison scenario, generic lovastatin was more cost effective than gemfibrozil for men except at age 45 years and women at all ages, and more cost effective than fenofibrate for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that fibrate therapy, particularly with generic gemfibrozil, is cost effective in the primary prevention of CHD in individuals with low HDL-cholesterol levels, with or without elevated triglyceride levels. Certain patient subgroups, such as those with elevated triglyceride levels, smokers and those with diabetes mellitus are likely to achieve both CHD risk reduction and overall savings in net expected medical care costs. Comparable cost-effectiveness results are also shown for lovastatin therapy in the target patient population.

Certain patient subgroups, such as those with elevated triglyceride levels, smokers and those with diabetes mellitus are likely to achieve both CHD risk reduction and overall savings in net expected medical care costs. Comparable cost-effectiveness results are also shown for lovastatin therapy in the target patient population. Gemfibrozil dominates fenofibrate because of the lower cost of therapy (direct and indirect costs). These conclusions are robust to reasonable changes in model parameter values.",2005-01-01486,15748088,Pharmacoeconomics,Joel W Hay,2005,23 / 2,133-41,Yes,15748088,"Joel W Hay; Kimberly L Sterling; Cost effectiveness of treating low HDL-cholesterol in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(2):1179-2027; 133-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lovastatina treatment for low HDL vs. No treatment,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,17541,United States,2004,24032.84
3033,Routine human immunodeficiency virus testing: an economic evaluation of current guidelines,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counseling, testing, and referral for all patients in hospitals with an HIV prevalence of >or=1%. The 1% screening threshold has not been critically examined since HIV became effectively treatable in 1995. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical effect and cost-effectiveness of current guidelines and of alternate HIV prevalence thresholds. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a computer simulation model of HIV screening and disease as applied to inpatients in U.S. hospitals. RESULTS: At an undiagnosed inpatient HIV prevalence of 1% and an overall participation rate of 33%, HIV screening increased mean quality-adjusted life expectancy by 6.13 years per 1000 inpatients, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of 35,400 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Expansion of screening to settings with a prevalence as low as 0.1% increased the ratio to 64,500 dollars per QALY gained. Increasing counseling and testing costs from 53 dollars to 103 dollars per person still yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio below 100,000 dollars per QALY gained at a prevalence of undiagnosed infection of 0.1%. CONCLUSION: Routine inpatient HIV screening programs are not only cost-effective but would likely remain so at a prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection 10 times lower than recommended thresholds. The current HIV counseling, testing, and referral guidelines should now be implemented nationwide as a way of linking infected patients to life-sustaining care.",2005-01-01490,15745728,Am J Med,Rochelle P Walensky,2005,118 / 3,292-300,No,15745728,"Rochelle P Walensky; Milton C Weinstein; April D Kimmel; George R Seage; Elena Losina; Paul E Sax; Hong Zhang; Heather E Smith; Kenneth A Freedberg; A David Paltiel; Routine human immunodeficiency virus testing: an economic evaluation of current guidelines, Am J Med, 2005-Mar; 118(3):0002-9343; 292-300",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Screening, counseling, and referral for HIV vs. No screening",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,35400,United States,2001,51732.97
3034,Cost-effectiveness of fluvastatin following successful first percutaneous coronary intervention,"BACKGROUND: In the LIPS (Lescol Intervention Prevention Study), fluvastatin 80 mg/day reduced the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) by 22% versus placebo (p = 0.01) following successful first percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with stable or unstable angina or silent ischemia. The cost-effectiveness of such therapy is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fluvastatin following successful first PCI from a US healthcare system perspective. METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate expected outcomes and costs of 2 alternative treatment strategies following successful first PCI in patients with stable or unstable angina or silent ischemia: (1) diet/lifestyle counseling plus immediate fluvastatin 80 mg/day; and (2) diet/lifestyle counseling only, with initiation of fluvastatin 80 mg/day following occurrence of future nonfatal MACE. The model was estimated with data from LIPS and other published sources. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the ratio of the difference in expected medical-care costs to the expected difference in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) alternatively. RESULTS: Treatment with fluvastatin following successful first PCI was found to increase life expectancy by 0.78 years (QALYs 0.68). Cost-effectiveness of fluvastatin following successful first PCI is 13 505 dollars per LY (15 454 dollar per QALY) saved. Ratios are lower for patients with diabetes (9396 dollar per LY; 10 718 dollar per QALY) and those with multivessel disease (9662 dollar per LY; 11 076 dollar per QALY). Findings were robust with respect to changes in key model parameters and assumptions.

3035,Using recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone for the diagnosis of recurrent thyroid cancer,"BACKGROUND: Recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) has been suggested as a diagnostic agent in the diagnosis of recurrent thyroid cancer, instead of the current practice of thyroid hormone (THT) withdrawal. METHODS: An evidenced-based literature review was used as the basis for a cost-utility, decision-analytic model. Outcome measures were safety, efficacy (diagnostic performance and quality of life) and cost effectiveness of rhTSH. RESULTS: The literature search identified six comparative studies of rhTSH versus THT withdrawal. The most common adverse events associated with the use of rhTSH were headache (3.5-11.1%) and nausea (7.7-17%). When used as a diagnostic agent, the unadjusted sensitivity and specificity for rhTSH were 87% and 95%, respectively. Thus the use of rhTSH instead of THT withdrawal would result in a reduction in diagnostic accuracy, with 11% of patients' disease status being misclassified. Use of rhTSH resulted in a higher quality of life in the period prior to diagnostic testing than THT withdrawal (P < 0.001). When the impact of diagnostic performance, patient compliance to follow-up and modified quality of life were modelled over a 5 year time-frame, the incremental cost per QALY of rhTSH relative to THT withdrawal was $51 344.42.

METHODS: Data from seven randomized controlled clinical trials of orlistat in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes were pooled. A subgroup analysis involving patients who achieved a response (defined as a weight loss of >/=5% after 12 weeks of treatment) was conducted. The outcomes of the pooled analysis were then used to construct a Markov health economic model covering an 11-y period. The incidences of diabetes-related micro- and macrovascular complications were derived from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. The effects of changes in body mass index, and the impact of micro- and macrovascular complications on utilities were derived from published sources. Publicly available cost data were used and are presented here in 2001 Euros. Discounting of 3% was applied. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of results. RESULTS: A total of 1249 patients treated with orlistat and 1230 given placebo were eligible for the intent-to-treat analysis. At the end of the study period, 23% of orlistat patients achieved a weight reduction of >/=5%. These patients showed a mean decrease in HbA1C of 1.16%, a weight reduction of 8.6 kg, a reduction in total cholesterol of 5.3% and a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 5.2 mmHg. The base-case economic analysis revealed costs per quality-adjusted life year gained of euro14 000 in Sweden and euro13 600 in Switzerland.

3038,The cost-effectiveness of lifestyle modification or metformin in preventing type 2 diabetes in adults with impaired glucose tolerance,"BACKGROUND: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that interventions can delay or prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime cost-utility of the DPP interventions. DESIGN: Markov simulation model to estimate progression of disease, costs, and quality of life. DATA SOURCES: The DPP and published reports. TARGET POPULATION: Members of the DPP cohort 25 years of age or older with impaired glucose tolerance. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVES: Health system and societal. INTERVENTIONS: Intensive lifestyle, metformin, and placebo interventions as implemented in the DPP. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of diabetes, microvascular and neuropathic complications, cardiovascular complications, survival, direct medical and direct nonmedical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost per QALY. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with the placebo intervention, the lifestyle and metformin interventions were estimated to delay the development of type 2 diabetes by 11 and 3 years, respectively, and to reduce the absolute incidence of diabetes by 20% and 8%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of microvascular, neuropathic, and cardiovascular complications were reduced and survival was improved by 0.5 and 0.2 years. Compared with the placebo intervention, the cost per QALY was approximately 1100 dollars for the lifestyle intervention and $31 300 for the metformin intervention. From a societal perspective, the interventions cost approximately 8800 dollars and 29,900 dollars per QALY, respectively. From both perspectives, the lifestyle intervention dominated the metformin intervention. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness improved when the interventions were implemented as they might be in routine clinical practice. The lifestyle intervention was cost-effective in all age groups. The metformin intervention did not represent good use of resources for persons older than 65 years of age.

3041,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of initial combination therapy with interferon/peginterferon plus ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C in Germany: a health technology assessment commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Health and Social Security,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this health technology assessment (HTA), commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Health and Social Security, was to systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antiviral treatment (AVT) with interferon (INF) or peginterferon (PegIFN) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and to apply these data in the context of the German health-care system. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of AVT and summarized results using meta-analysis and evidence tables. We applied the German Hepatitis C Model (GEHMO), a decision-analytic Markov model, to determine long-term clinical effectiveness, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of the examined treatment strategies. Model parameters were derived from German databases, published international randomized clinical trials (RCT), and a Cochrane Review. RESULTS: Overall, nine RCTs, two HTA reports, one Cochrane review, two meta-analyses, and seven economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. These studies indicate that PegIFN + RBV achieved the highest sustained virological response rates (SVR) (54-61 percent), followed by IFN + RBV (38-54 percent) and IFN monotherapy (11-21 percent). Based on our meta-analysis, PegIFN + RBV reduced cases without SVR by 17 percent compared with INF + RBV. International cost-effectiveness studies indicate that INF+ RBV is cost-effective when compared with INF monotherapy. For PegIFN + RBV, our decision analysis yielded an ICER of 9,800 Euros per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: This HTA suggests that initial combination therapy prolongs life, improves quality of life, and is cost-effective in patients with CHC.

3044,Clinical- and cost-effectiveness of pegylated interferon alfa in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pegylated interferon alfa (2a and 2b) combined with ribavirin in previously untreated patients with moderate to severe chronic hepatitis C, compared with the current standard treatment, which is nonpegylated interferon alfa combined with ribavirin. METHODS: Systematic review and economic evaluation. A sensitive search strategy was applied to several electronic bibliographic databases. Relevant studies were critically appraised and meta-analyzed. A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients entered a Markov model and were followed up for a more than 30-year period to predict natural history, duration spent in each health state, and treatment costs. RESULTS: Two fully published Phase III randomized controlled trials were included. Methodological quality was generally good. Dual therapy with pegylated interferon was significantly more effective than nonpegylated dual therapy with a pooled sustained virological response rate (SVR) of 55 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 52-58 percent) compared with 46 percent (95 percent CI, 43-49 percent). The pooled relative risk of remaining infected was 0.83 (95 percent CI, 0.76-0.91 percent). Genotype was the strongest predictor of outcome, with SVRs in patients with the more responsive genotypes 2 and 3 reaching up to 80 percent. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for pegylated dual therapy compared with nonpegylated dual therapy was 12,123 pounds sterling. The cost per QALY remained under 30,000 pounds sterling for most patient subgroups and in sensitivity analyses.

3045,Hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment-options,"BACKGROUND: During 2001, over 32,000 patients in the United Kingdom received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Approximately half had a functioning transplant, with the remainder receiving dialysis therapy. The main form of dialysis is hemodialysis (HD), which is provided to 37.1 percent of the RRT population. HD is provided in three main settings: hospital (24.5 percent), satellite (10.9 percent), or home (1.7 percent). The objective of this study is to explore the cost-effectiveness of these different modalities. METHODS: By using clinical and cost data from a systematic review, a Markov model was developed to assess the costs and benefits of the three different modalities. The model included direct health service costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Satellite HD has lower costs 46,000 pounds sterling and 62,050 pounds sterling at 5 and 10 years than home HD 47,660 pounds sterling and 63,540 pounds sterling. The total effectiveness of home HD was slightly greater than for satellite HD, so the incremental cost per QALY of home versus satellite HD was modest at 6,665 pounds sterling at 5 years and 3,943 pounds sterling at 10 years. Both modalities dominated hospital HD. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the study reveal that satellite HD was less costly than home HD, and home HD was less costly than hospital HD.

3047,Cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin for secondary prophylaxis of cancer-related venous thromboembolism,"Although extended secondary prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin was recently shown to be more effective than warfarin for cancer-related venous thromboembolism, its cost-effectiveness compared to traditional prophylaxis with warfarin is uncertain. We built a decision analytic model to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of a 6-month course of low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin therapy in 65-year-old patients with cancer-related venous thromboembolism. We used probability estimates and utilities reported in the literature and published cost data. Using a US societal perspective, we compared strategies based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lifetime costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of low-molecular-weight heparin compared with warfarin was 149,865 dollars/QALY. Low-molecular-weight heparin yielded a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.097 QALYs at the cost of 15,329 dollars. Overall, 46% (7108 dollars) of the total costs associated with low-molecular-weight heparin were attributable to pharmacy costs. Although the low-molecular-weigh heparin strategy achieved a higher incremental quality-adjusted life expectancy than the warfarin strategy (difference of 0.051 QALYs), this clinical benefit was offset by a substantial cost increment of 7,609 dollars. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to variation of the early mortality risks associated with low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin and the pharmacy costs for low-molecular-weight heparin. Based on the best available evidence, secondary prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective than warfarin for cancer-related venous thromboembolism. However, because of the substantial pharmacy costs of extended low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis in the US, this treatment is relatively expensive compared with warfarin.",2005-01-01503,15735815,Thromb Haemost,Drahomir Aujesky,2005,93 / 3,592-9,No,15735815,"Drahomir Aujesky; Kenneth J Smith; Jacques Cornuz; Mark S Roberts; Cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin for secondary prophylaxis of cancer-related venous thromboembolism, Thromb Haemost, 2005-Mar; 93(3):0340-6245; 592-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin vs. Warfarin (6 months) with low molecular weight heparin (first 5 days),Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,149865,United States,2002,215601.5

METHOD: The evaluation was carried out alongside a clinical trial investigating the use of PACs in intensive care units (ICUs) in the UK. It was conducted from the perspective of the UK NHS, in which PACs are an established intervention. Treating patients without using a PAC was characterised as the new intervention.The primary outcome measure was QALYs. The secondary outcome measure was hospital mortality. NHS costs per patient were calculated for the financial year 2002/03.The bootstrap method was used to characterise the uncertainty of the results and to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The cost per QALY and per life gained from the withdrawal of PACs were pound2892 and pound21 164, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that withdrawal of PACs from routine clinical use in ICUs within the NHS would be considered cost effective in the current decision-making climate.",2005-01-01546,16466277,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Katherine Stevens,2005,4 / 4,257-64,Yes,16466277,"Katherine Stevens; Christopher McCabe; Carys Jones; Joanne Ashcroft; Sheila Harvey; Kathy Rowan; The incremental cost effectiveness of withdrawing pulmonary artery catheters from routine use in critical care, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2005; 4(4):1179-1896; 257-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Managing without pulmonary artery catheters,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,2892,United Kingdom,2003,6649.51
3049,Determining Priority for Liver Transplantation: A Comparison of Cost per QALY and Discrete Choice Experiment-Generated Public Preferences,"OBJECTIVE: A comparison of the implications of the application of the principles of equity and efficiency as two desirable but competing attributes of the organ allocation system. Efficiency is defined in economic terms as the standard cost per QALY model and equity considerations are included in a model based on public preferences generated from a discrete choice experiment in determining priority for donor liver graft allocation. METHODS: A survey of the general public (n = 303) using a discrete choice experiment was undertaken. The results enabled estimation of the relative weights attached to several key factors which might be used to prioritise patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation. These weights were then used to develop a patient-specific index (PSI) for all patients diagnosed with one of three main chronic liver diseases who had received a liver transplant during an 18-month period at all Department of Health designated liver transplant centres in England and Wales (n = 207). The cost per QALY model comprised net total costs from assessment to 27 months following assessment as the numerator of the ratio. Net survival over the same time period, adjusted for HR-QOL using population values for the EQ-5D descriptive system, formed the denominator. RESULTS: Priority for liver transplantation differed markedly according to whether patients were ranked according to efficiency (net cost per QALY) or equity considerations (PSI) and the differences in ranks were found to be statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasises that the priorities of the general public may not accord with those arising from a pure efficiency objective and quantifies the extent of the efficiency loss in terms of lost QALYs and increased net programme costs associated with the incorporation of equity concerns as reflected in public preferences for the allocation of donor livers for transplantation.",2005-01-01547,16466276,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Julie Ratcliffe,2005,4 / 4,249-55,Yes,16466276,"Julie Ratcliffe; Martin Buxton; Tracey Young; Louise Longworth; Determining Priority for Liver Transplantation: A Comparison of Cost per QALY and Discrete Choice Experiment-Generated Public Preferences, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2005; 4(4):1179-1896; 249-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Public preferences determined priority vs. Cost/QALY approach,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,27 Months,3.50,3.50,18664,United Kingdom,2003,42913.71
3051,Costs and effects of long-acting risperidone compared with oral atypical and conventional depot formulations in Germany,"Schizophrenia is one of the most expensive psychiatric conditions because of high direct and indirect costs associated with the nature of the illness, its resistance to treatment and the consequences of relapse. Long-acting risperidone is a new formulation of an atypical antipsychotic drug that also offers the improvements in compliance associated with haloperidol depot. The aim of this simulation study was to compare the benefits and costs of three pharmacological treatment strategies comprising first-line treatment with long-acting risperidone injection, a haloperidol depot or an oral atypical antipsychotic agent, over a 5-year period in Germany. A discrete event simulation model was developed to compare three treatment scenarios from the perspective of major third-party payers (sickness funds and social security 'Sozialversicherung'). The scenarios comprised first-line treatment with haloperidol depot (scenario 1), long-acting risperidone (scenario 2) and oral olanzapine (scenario 3). Switches to second or third-line options were allowed when side-effects occurred or a patient suffered more than a fixed number of relapses. The model accounted for fixed patient characteristics, and on the basis of these, simulated patient histories according to several time-dependent variables. The time horizon for this model was limited to 5 years, and in accordance with German guidelines, costs and effects were discounted by between 3 and 10%. Direct costs included medication, type of physician visits and treatment location. Indirect costs were not included. Information on treatment alternatives, transition probabilities, model structure and healthcare utilization were derived from the literature and an expert panel. Outcomes were expressed in terms of the number and duration of psychotic episodes, cumulative symptom scores, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Univariate sensitivity analyses were carried out, as were subgroup analyses based on disease severity and for patients at high risk of being non-compliant. The long-acting risperidone strategy was calculated to avoid 0.23 and 0.33 relapses per patient, decrease the cumulative symptom score by 25 and 33 points, and decrease the costs by 2017 Euro and 6096 Euro per patient (1608 Euro and 5422 Euro discounted), compared with the haloperidol depot and olanzapine strategies, respectively, over a 5-year period (year of costing 2004). Among high-risk non-compliant patients, long-acting risperidone was estimated to avoid 0.23 and 0.47 relapses and save 4822 Euro and 10,646 Euro per patient (4107 Euro and 9490 Euro discounted), compared with the haloperidol depot and olanzapine strategies, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust and mainly sensitive to changes in the reported relative effectiveness of atypical and conventional formulations for preventing symptom recurrence, and in the relative compliance with oral and long-acting formulations. In this model, long-acting risperidone is a dominant strategy compared with a haloperidol depot or oral atypical antipsychotic agent, being both more effective and less costly over a 5-year period.

3057,Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of sirolimus versus cyclosporin for immunosuppression after renal transplantation in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sirolimus compared with cyclosporin for the postsurgical management of renal transplant recipients, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and the Personal Social Service. METHODS: A discrete event stochastic simulation model was developed to evaluate both cost-effectiveness and cost utility over 10 and 20 years after transplant using historical data on 937 renal transplant recipients from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, United Kingdom. The simulation was designed to forecast the incidence of acute rejection events, graft failure, retransplant, frequency of hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), and death. Cox proportional hazard models were derived from historical transplant data, in which 1-, 2-, and 3-year post-transplant serum creatinine levels were used as the key drivers for predicting graft success and survival. Costs were reported as year-2003 UK pounds sterling (1 UK pound = US $1.76). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted and results reported with particular attention to 2 threshold values, 30,000/QALY and 20,000/QALY RESULTS: Over a 10-year time horizon, treatment with sirolimus was projected to produce a gain of 0.60 discounted year of functioning graft with a cost savings of 276 UK pounds per patient. Over a 20-year time horizon these benefits increased to 1.59 discounted years of functioning graft and a cost savings of 7405 UK pounds per patient. Using sensitivity analysis of the 10-year model, the only factors found to cause the probability of exceeding a 30,000 ceiling to be >5% were the proportion of subjects maintaining continuous graft function and the use of low-dose cyclosporin.

3058,Long-term clinical and cost outcomes of treatment with biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 versus insulin glargine in insulin naïve type 2 diabetes patients: cost-effectiveness analysis in the UK setting,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term clinical and cost outcomes associated with biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30/70, premixed 30% soluble and 70% protaminated insulin aspart in one injection) compared to insulin glargine treatment in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes patients failing oral antidiabetic agents in the UK, based on findings recently reported from the INITIATE clinical trial. METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model, a published, peer-reviewed and validated model of diabetes, was used to evaluate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative incidence of complications and direct medical costs over patient lifetimes. The model simulates the range of diabetic complications and disease progression within a series of sub-models (cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, renal and eye disease) based on published data. Baseline cohort characteristics (54.5% male, mean age 52.45 years, mean diabetes duration 9 years, mean HbA(1c) 9.77%) and treatment effects were based on INITIATE. Costs were derived from published UK sources. The analysis was run over a 35-year time horizon (patient lifetime) from a third party payer perspective. Costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: BIAsp 30/70 was associated with projected improvements in discounted life expectancy (0.19 +/- 0.20 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.19 +/- 0.14 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), as well as a reduced incidence of retinopathy and nephropathy complications, versus glargine. Total lifetime direct costs were 1319 pounds higher with BIAsp 30/70 than with glargine leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 6951 pounds per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to address the long-term health economic implications of treating type 2 diabetes patients failing oral anti-diabetics with a biphasic insulin mix versus long-acting insulin. Our projections indicate that improved HbA1c levels with BIAsp 30/70 treatment are associated with improvements in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy, and that BIAsp 30/70 represents excellent value for money compared to insulin glargine in the UK.",2005-01-01559,16368057,Curr Med Res Opin,William J Valentine,2005,21 / 12,2063-71,No,16368057,"William J Valentine; Andrew J Palmer; Morten Lammert; Lars Nicklasson; Volker Foos; Stéphane Roze; Andrew J Palmer; Morten Lammert; Lars Nicklasson; Volker Foos; Stéphane Roze; Long-term clinical and cost outcomes of treatment with biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 versus insulin glargine in insulin naïve type 2 diabetes patients: cost-effectiveness analysis in the UK setting, Curr Med Res Opin, 2005-Dec; 21(12):0300-7995; 2063-71",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 vs. Insulin glargine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.50,3.50,6951,United Kingdom,2004,17456.63
3059,A cost-utility analysis of low-dose hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost utility of one year's treatment with a low-dose conjugated estrogen/medroxyprogesterone acetate (CE/MPA low dose) preparation (Premique Low Dose [Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Maidenhead, UK]), compared with a higher-dose preparation (Premique; CE/MPA [Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Maidenhead, UK]), in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. The evaluation captured the resource implications associated with the difference in treatment discontinuation and adverse event driven consultations in patients receiving either the low- or higher-dose preparation. This economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the NHS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A health economic model was developed to calculate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from treatment with a lower-dose CE/MPA combination, compared with a higher-dose CE/MPA preparation. Cohorts of 100 patients were assumed to receive either CE/MPA low dose or CE/MPA for one year. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to explore whether the base case model was robust to the assumptions employed. Neither costs nor consequences were discounted because of the one year timeframe. RESULTS: In the base case, CE/MPA low dose dominates, i.e. it showed a greater health gain at a reduced cost, in both mild and severe symptom populations. These results were repeated in the sensitivity analysis, with the cost-effectiveness planes for both mild and severe symptom populations showing a greater utility at a reduced cost. CONCLUSIONS: CE/MPA low dose has been demonstrated to be a cost-effective treatment of estrogen-deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. It has great potential for increasing the number of patients benefiting from relief of menopausal symptoms while also reducing the resource utilisation associated with managing the adverse effects associated with higher-dose HRT.",2005-01-01560,16368056,Curr Med Res Opin,James A Swift,2005,21 / 12,2051-61,No,16368056,"James A Swift; Peter Conway; David W Purdie; Peter Conway; David W Purdie; A cost-utility analysis of low-dose hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, Curr Med Res Opin, 2005-Dec; 21(12):0300-7995; 2051-61",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treament with low dose hormone therapy vs. Higher dose hormone therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2329.6,United Kingdom,2004,-5850.52
3061,"Cost effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in the Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure (COMPANION) trial","OBJECTIVES: The analysis goal was to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure (COMPANION) trial patients who received cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) via pacemaker (CRT-P) or pacemaker-defibrillator (CRT-D) in combination with optimal pharmacological therapy (OPT) relative to patients with OPT alone. BACKGROUND: In the COMPANION trial, CRT-P and CRT-D reduced the combined risk of all-cause mortality or first hospitalization among patients with advanced heart failure and intraventricular conduction delays, but the cost effectiveness of the therapy remains unknown. METHODS: In this analysis, intent-to-treat trial data were modeled to estimate the cost effectiveness of CRT-D and CRT-P relative to OPT over a base-case seven-year treatment episode. Exponential survival curves were derived from trial data and adjusted by quality-of-life trial results to yield quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). For the first two years, follow-up hospitalizations were based on trial data. The model assumed equalized hospitalization rates beyond two years. Initial implantation and follow-up hospitalization costs were estimated using Medicare data. RESULTS: Over two years, follow-up hospitalization costs were reduced by 29% for CRT-D and 37% for CRT-P. Extending the cost-effectiveness analysis to a seven-year base-case time period, the ICER for CRT-P was 19,600 dollars per QALY and the ICER for CRT-D was 43,000 dollars per QALY relative to OPT. CONCLUSIONS: For the COMPANION trial patients, the use of CRT-P and CRT-D was associated with a cost-effectiveness ratio below generally accepted benchmarks for therapeutic interventions of 50,000 dollars per QALY to 100,000 dollars per QALY.

3064,Modelling the cost effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors in the management of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness (from the UK NHS and personal social services perspective) of the cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine compared with usual care in the treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. Patients had a mean age of 74 years, a mean disease duration of 1 year and a mean Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale score of 24. METHODS: A pharmacoeconomic model was used to predict long-term outcomes over a 5-year time horizon and to estimate the cost effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors for the management of Alzheimer's disease. The model structure is informed by a systematic review of the literature on the clinical and cost effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors and a review of the literature on the costs and outcomes associated with treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The main outcome measure used was the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. All healthcare costs (excluding cholinesterase inhibitor costs) were indexed to pounds sterling (2003 values). Drug costs are 2005 values. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis were undertaken to assess uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: The clinical benefits on cognition from treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors resulted in an incremental cost per QALY gained ranging from 53,780 pounds sterling to 74,735 pounds sterling, over 5 years (vs usual care). Uncertainty analysis suggests that the probability of any of these treatments having an incremental cost per QALY of < 30,000 pounds sterling is < 21%. The key determinants of cost effectiveness were the effectiveness of treatment, the mean treatment cost and the cost savings associated with an expected delay in disease progression.

3067,Pramipexole and levodopa in early Parkinson's disease: dynamic changes in cost effectiveness,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In chronic disease, treatment effects and costs accumulate over time; hence, the choice of time horizon in cost-effectiveness analysis can be particularly important. In this article we analyse the dynamic changes in cumulative costs, effects and incremental cost effectiveness of two competing drug strategies in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Three hundred and one subjects with PD were randomised to initial pramipexole or levodopa and followed every 3 months over a 4-year period. Healthcare resource use was recorded in patient diaries and valued using a variety of sources at year 2002 US dollar values. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the EuroQoL EQ-5D. The study was conducted from a US societal perspective. Missing data were imputed using a multivariate fixed-effects model. Additional quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained by using pramipexole compared with levodopa were estimated as the area between the normalised treatment HRQoL profiles. The QALYs and costs for each treatment arm were calculated for various study horizons.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the net monetary benefit (NB) [using 50,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars and 150,000 US dollars as the value of a QALY] were estimated, and were bootstrapped to calculate the standard errors. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) were built to estimate the probability that pramipexole was cost effective given different societal values of QALY, for various study horizons.We conducted sensitivity analyses on the ICER and the NB to test their robustness to various assumptions about missing data, for various subpopulations and under changes in the drug prices. RESULTS: Under the base-case assumptions, the ICER for pramipexole was 42,989 US dollars per QALY. Using the CEAC approach, the probability that pramipexole was cost effective relative to levodopa over the first 4 years was 0.57, 0.77 and 0.82 when a QALY was valued at 50,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and 150,000 US dollars, respectively. Over time, the ICER for pramipexole improved and uncertainty around the ICER decreased. If, after treatment withdrawal, HRQoL improved in pramipexole subjects and declined in levodopa subjects (best-case scenario for pramipexole), the probability of pramipexole being cost effective increased to 0.88, 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. Factors that improved the ICER of pramipexole were a decrease in the relative price of pramipexole and having low HRQoL or depression at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of pramipexole compared with levodopa in the treatment of early PD increased as the time horizon of the clinical trial extended from 2 to 4 years. Our results suggest that pramipexole is more cost effective for patients with depression and low baseline HRQoL than in other patient subgroups.",2005-01-01576,16336019,Pharmacoeconomics,Katia Noyes,2005,23 / 12,1257-70,Yes,16336019,"Katia Noyes; Andrew W Dick; Robert G Holloway; Andrew W Dick; Robert G Holloway; Pramipexole and levodopa in early Parkinson's disease: dynamic changes in cost effectiveness, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(12):1179-2027; 1257-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Parmipexole vs. Levodopa,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Years,3.00,3.00,42989,United States,2002,61845.61

3071,Proton therapy of cancer: potential clinical advantages and cost-effectiveness,"Proton therapy may offer potential clinical advantages compared with conventional radiation therapy for many cancer patients. Due to the large investment costs for building a proton therapy facility, however, the treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than with conventional radiation. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to motivate the higher costs. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of four different cancers: left-sided breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, and childhood medulloblastoma. A Markov cohort simulation model was created for each cancer type and used to simulate the life of patients treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were used as primary outcome measures. The results indicated that proton therapy was cost-effective if appropriate risk groups were chosen.

3072,Presidential guest address: the Swedish Hip Registry: increasing the sensitivity by patient outcome data,"The Swedish Hip Register was initiated in 1979. The mission of the register is to improve the outcome of THA. The hypothesis is that feedback of data stimulates participating clinics to reflect and improve. In addition to revision surgery, patient-based outcome measures and radiographic results are included to improve sensitivity. All patients who have a total hip arthroplasty answer a questionnaire preoperatively and again after 1, 6, and 10 years postoperatively. The questionnaire includes the Charnley classification, EQ-5D and visual analog scales concerning pain and overall satisfaction and is used by 31 of 81 units. Average costs for the procedure ($11,000) are obtained from a national database. The mean gain in the EQ-5D index after 1 year for 3900 patients was 0.37, giving a low cost of $3000 per quality adjusted life year. Patient satisfaction and pain amelioration generally was high. The national average 7-year survival (revision as endpoint), has improved from 93.5% (+/- 0.15) to 95.8 (+/- 0.15) between the two periods 1979 to 1991 and 1992 to 2003.

3073,Cost-effectiveness of improving primary care treatment of late-life depression,"CONTEXT: Depression is a leading cause of functional impairment in elderly individuals and is associated with high medical costs, but there are large gaps in quality of treatment in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the Improving Mood Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) collaborative care management program for late-life depression. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with recruitment from July 1999 to August 2001. SETTING: Eighteen primary care clinics from 8 health care organizations in 5 states. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1801 patients 60 years or older with major depression (17%), dysthymic disorder (30%), or both (53%). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to the IMPACT intervention (n = 906) or to usual primary care (n = 895). Intervention patients were provided access to a depression care manager supervised by a psychiatrist and primary care physician. Depression care managers offered education, support of antidepressant medications prescribed in primary care, and problem-solving treatment in primary care (a brief psychotherapy). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total outpatient costs, depression-free days, and quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: Relative to usual care, intervention patients experienced 107 (95% confidence interval [CI], 86 to 128) more depression-free days over 24 months. Total outpatient costs were USD $295 (95% CI, -$525 to $1115) higher during this period. The incremental outpatient cost per depression-free day was USD $2.76 (95% CI, -$4.95 to $10.47) and incremental outpatient costs per quality-adjusted life-year ranged from USD $2519 (95% CI, -$4517 to $9554) to USD $5037 (95% CI, -$9034 to $19 108). Results of a bootstrap analysis suggested a 25% probability that the IMPACT intervention was ""dominant"" (ie, lower costs and greater effectiveness).

3074,Cost-effectiveness analysis of hypertension guidelines in South Africa: absolute risk versus blood pressure level,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cardiovascular risk factor. Guidelines based on blood pressure level for initiation of treatment of hypertension may be too costly compared with an approach based on absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, especially in developing countries. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a Markov CVD model, we compared 6 strategies for initiation of drug treatment--2 different blood pressure levels (160/95 and 140/90 mm Hg) and 4 different levels of absolute CVD risk over 10 years (40%, 30%, 20%, and 15%)--with one of no treatment. We modeled a hypothetical cohort of all adults without CVD in South Africa, a multiethnic developing country, over 10 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for treating those with 10-year absolute risk for CVD >40%, 30%, 20%, and 15% were 700 dollars, 1600 dollars, 4900 dollars, and 11,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. Strategies based on a target blood pressure level were both more expensive and less effective than treatment decisions based on the strategy that used absolute CVD risk of >15%.

3080,Economic evaluation of a randomized trial comparing Helicobacter pylori test-and-treat and prompt endoscopy strategies for managing dyspepsia in a primary-care setting,"BACKGROUND: In western European countries, most dyspeptic patients are initially managed by their general practitioners (GPs), who use a range of strategies to manage dyspepsia. We performed an economic analysis of a Helicobacter pylori test-and-treat strategy versus a prompt endoscopy approach in a primary care setting. METHODS: Data were used from the Strategy: Endoscopy versus Serology (SENSE) study, performed in The Netherlands from 1998 to 2001. Patients were randomized to a prompt endoscopy (n = 105) or test-and-treat (n = 118) group. Follow-up lasted 1 year. Adverse events were not recorded in the SENSE study. Health care costs were based on the total amount of dyspepsia-related drugs used, the number of dyspepsia-related GP visits, the number of diagnostic tests, and the number of dyspepsia-related referrals to specialists. The use of medical resources was calculated as standardized costs for 1999, recorded as euros. (On December 31, 1999, 1.00 Euro = 1.00 US dollar.) Quality of life was measured at inclusion and 1 year later, using the RAND-36 questionnaire. To calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), we transformed the individual scores of the RAND-36 into 1 overall score, the Health Utilities Index Mark 2, which introduced a limitation to the study. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. The 95% confidence limits were calculated using a parametric bootstrap method with angular transformation. All cost data were analyzed from a third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: The total costs per patient were 511 Euros, with 0.037 QALY gained per patient, in the test-and-treat group, and 748 Euros, with 0.032 QALY gained per patient, in the endoscopy group (between groups, P < 0.001 and P = NS, respectively). The point estimate of the ICER indicated that the test-and-treat strategy yielded cost savings and QALYs gained. Parametric bootstrap confidence limits indicated cost savings per QALY gained in 75.7% of the bootstrap simulations. CONCLUSION: This analysis of data from the SENSE1026 study suggests that the H pylori test-and-treat strategy was more cost-effective than prompt endoscopy in the initial management of dyspepsia in general practice, from the perspective of a third-party payer.",2005-01-01582,16330302,Clin Ther,Rogier M Klok,2005,27 / 10,1647-57,Yes,16330302,"Rogier M Klok; Nicolaas L A Arents; Robin de Vries; Jacob C Thijs; Jacobus R B J Brouwers; Jan H Kleibeuker; Maarten J Postma; Nicolaas L A Arents; Robin de Vries; Jacob C Thijs; Jacobus R B J Brouwers; Jan H Kleibeuker; Maarten J Postma; Economic evaluation of a randomized trial comparing Helicobacter pylori test-and-treat and prompt endoscopy strategies for managing dyspepsia in a primary-care setting, Clin Ther, 2005-Oct; 27(10):1879-114X; 1647-57",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Helicobacter pylori test followed by treatment vs. Endoscopy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-47412,Euro,1999,-78462.15

DESIGN: We used a Markov state-transition decision-analytic model for an hypothetical cohort of 55-year-old women to compare with a lifetime horizon costs and effectiveness of bilateral neck exploration (BNE), unilateral neck exploration (UNE), video-assisted parathyroidectomy (VAP) and lifelong medical follow-up shifting for either BNE or UNE in case of disease progression. METHODS: Data on localization tests, complications and treatment efficacies were derived from a systematic review of the literature. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Costs (2002 Euro) discounted at 3% yearly were estimated from the health care system perspective. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, VAP strategy (VAPS) was the most effective and BNE strategy (BNES) was the least costly.

3083,Surgery versus medical follow-up in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: a decision analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of strategies for management of primary asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism: surgical strategies and medical follow-up versus surgery. DESIGN: We used a Markov state-transition decision-analytic model for an hypothetical cohort of 55-year-old women to compare with a lifetime horizon costs and effectiveness of bilateral neck exploration (BNE), unilateral neck exploration (UNE), video-assisted parathyroidectomy (VAP) and lifelong medical follow-up shifting for either BNE or UNE in case of disease progression. METHODS: Data on localization tests, complications and treatment efficacies were derived from a systematic review of the literature. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Costs (2002 Euro) discounted at 3% yearly were estimated from the health care system perspective. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, VAP strategy (VAPS) was the most effective and BNE strategy (BNES) was the least costly. UNE strategy (UNES) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2688 Euro/QALY versus BNES and VAPS of 17,250 Euro/QALY in comparison with UNES. Surgical management was more effective than medical follow-up with acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. VAPS became less effective than UNES over 71 years. Differences between UNES and VAPS were sensitive to success and complication rates, quality-of-life weights and procedural costs. Medical follow-up strategies became the most effective if quality-of-life weight for this condition was higher than 0.99.

3084,Closing the youth access gap: the projected health benefits and cost savings of a national policy to raise the legal smoking age to 21 in the United States,"Current youth access laws, even if strictly enforced, do not prevent teenagers from obtaining cigarettes through social sources. To reduce the number of legal buyers a typical teenager routinely encounters, and to lessen ambiguity for vendors determining if a teen is of legal purchasing age, legislation raising the minimum legal purchase age (MLPA) for cigarettes to 21 has been discussed in several states. To estimate how a national law raising the smoking age to 21 would impact smoking prevalence, net costs (in terms of compliance enforcement, ID checking, and medical care) and health benefits (in terms of life years and QALYs) to the population over time, a dynamic computer simulation model was developed using publicly available secondary data. The model simulations were carried out for several scenarios assuming varying impacts of the policy change on smoking initiation probability over a 50-year period. One scenario assumes that smoking initiation probabilities for individuals under 21 shift by 3 years so a 18-year old in the simulation, for example, is as likely to initiate smoking as an 15-year old in the status quo. Under this assumption, raising the smoking age would reduce smoking prevalence for adults (age 18+) from the status quo level of 22.1-15.4% after 50 years. Prevalence would drop from 20 to 6.6% for 14-17-year olds, from 26.9 to 12.2% for 18-20-year olds, and from 21.8 to 15.5% for the 21+ group.

3086,A cost-effectiveness analysis of fluvastatin in patients with diabetes after successful percutaneous coronary intervention,"BACKGROUND: The Lescol Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS) was a multinational randomized controlled trial that showed a 47% reduction in the relative risk of cardiac death and a 22% reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) from the routine use of fluvastatin, compared with controls, in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, defined as angioplasty with or without stents). In this study, MACEs included cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and subsequent PCI and coronary artery bypass graft. Diabetes was the greatest risk factor for MACEs. OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of fluvastatin when used for secondary prevention of MACEs after PCI in people with diabetes. METHODS: A post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes from the LIPS was used to estimate the effectiveness of fluvastatin in reducing myocardial infarction, revascularization, and cardiac death. A probabilistic Markov model was developed using United Kingdom resource and cost data to estimate the additional costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained over 10 years from the perspective of the British National Health Service. The model contained 6 health states, and the transition probabilities were derived from the LIPS data. Crossover from fluvastatin to other lipid-lowering drugs, withdrawal from fluvastatin, and the use of lipid-lowering drugs in the control group were included. RESULTS: In the subgroup of 202 patients with diabetes in the LIPS trial, 18 (15.0%) of 120 fluastatin patients and 21 (25.6%) of 82 control participants were insulin dependent (P = NS). Compared with the control group, patients treated with fluvastatin can expect to gain an additional mean (SD) of 0.196 (0.139) QALY per patient over 10 years (P < 0.001) and will cost the health service an additional mean (SD) of 10 pounds ( 448 pounds) (P = NS) (mean [SD] US $16 [$689]). The additional cost per QALY gained was 51 pounds (US $78). The key determinants of cost-effectiveness included the probabilities of repeat interventions, cardiac death, the cost of fluvastatin, and the time horizon used for the evaluation.

3092,Cost-effectiveness of a low-carbohydrate diet and a standard diet in severe obesity,"OBJECTIVE: Low-carbohydrate diets have become a popular alternative to standard diets for weight loss. Our aim was to compare the cost-effectiveness of these two diets. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The patient population included 129 severely obese subjects (BMI = 42.9) from a randomized trial; participants had a high prevalence of diabetes or metabolic syndrome. We compared within-trial costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) for the two study groups. We imputed missing values for QALYs. The CER was bootstrapped to derive 95% confidence intervals and to define acceptability cut-offs. We took a societal perspective for our analysis. RESULTS: Total costs during the one year of the trial were 6742 dollars +/- 6675 and 6249 dollars +/- 5100 for the low-carbohydrate and standard groups, respectively (p = 0.78). Participants experienced 0.64 +/- 0.02 and 0.61 +/- 0.02 QALYs during the one year of the study, respectively (p = 0.17 for difference). The point estimate of the incremental CER was -1225 dollars/QALY (i.e., the low-carbohydrate diet dominated the standard diet). However, in the bootstrap analysis, the wide spread of CERs caused the 95% confidence interval to be undefined. The probabilities that the low-carbohydrate diet was acceptable, using cut-offs of 50,000 dollars/QALY, 100,000 dollars/QALY, and 150,000 dollars/QALY, were 72.4% 78.6%, and 79.8%, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and incremental cost per life year gained of CRT plus medical therapy compared to medical therapy alone. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective analysis based on intention to treat data from all patients enrolled in the CARE-HF trial at 82 clinical centres in 12 European countries. A total of 813 patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and cardiac dyssynchrony were randomized to CRT plus medical therapy (n = 409) vs. medical therapy alone (n = 404). During a mean follow-up of 29.4 months CRT was associated with increased costs (4316, 95% CI: 1327-7485), survival (0.10 years, 95% CI: -0.01-0.21), and QALYs (0.22, 95% CI: 0.13-0.32). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 19 319 per QALY gained (95% CI: 5482-45 402) and 43 596 per life-year gained (95% CI: -146 236-223 849).

3094,Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to prevent depression in at-risk teens,"CONTACT: Depression is common in adolescent offspring of depressed parents and can be prevented, but adoption of prevention programs is dependent on the balance of their incremental costs and benefits. OBJECTIVE: To examine the incremental cost-effectiveness of a group cognitive behavioral intervention to prevent depression in adolescent offspring of depressed parents. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a recent randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northwest, a large health maintenance organization. PARTICIPANTS: Teens 13 to 18 years old at risk for depression. INTERVENTIONS: Usual care (n = 49) or usual care plus a 15-session group cognitive therapy prevention program (n = 45). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were converted to depression-free days and quality-adjusted life-years. Total health maintenance organization costs, costs of services received in other sectors, and family costs were combined with clinical outcomes in a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the intervention with usual care for 1 year after the intervention. RESULTS: Average cost of the intervention was $1632, and total direct and indirect costs increased by $610 in the intervention group. However, the result was not statistically significant, suggesting a possible cost offset. Estimated incremental cost per depression-free day in the base-case analysis was $10 (95% confidence interval, -$13 to $52) or $9275 per quality-adjusted life-year (95% confidence interval, -$12 148 to $45 641).

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective using a decision model based on published data. SETTING: Physician's office during an influenza A epidemic. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical children aged 2, 7, and 15 years. INTERVENTIONS: Rapid testing or clinical diagnosis followed by treatment with amantadine hydrochloride or oseltamivir phosphate compared with no antiviral therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS: Empirical therapy with antiviral medication resulted in the greatest quality-adjusted life expectancy in all age groups. Compared with not treating, antiviral therapy improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.003 quality-adjusted life-year by shortening the duration of illness and preventing otitis media. In young children it saved up to USD 121 per child mostly by avoiding parental work loss. Excluding work loss, antiviral therapy improved quality-adjusted life expectancy at a cost of USD 800 to 1800 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Compared with amantadine, oseltamivir was not cost-effective when influenza A predominated. The incremental cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir fell below USD 50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved when the proportion of influenza B exceeded 14% for a 2-year-old, 27% for a 7-year-old, or 43% for a 15-year-old. Rapid testing was cost-effective only when the probability of influenza was 60% or less. CONCLUSIONS: For children presenting with influenza symptoms during a local influenza outbreak, treatment with antiviral therapy appears to offer the best outcome and often saves money.

3096,A systematic review and economic analysis of drug-eluting coronary stents available in Australia,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting coronary stents used in Australia with bare-metal stents and determine whether the benefits are greater for high-risk subgroups. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Pre-Medline, EMBASE, Current Contents, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library database were searched to identify eligible randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in English between January 1966 and June 2004. STUDY SELECTION: Seven randomised controlled trials that assessed polymer-based paclitaxel- or sirolimus-eluting stents versus bare-metal stents in patients with coronary atherosclerosis and reported on stent thrombosis, mortality, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting or target lesion revascularisation. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers appraised eligible studies and extracted data. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated for each outcome and pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel method. DATA SYNTHESIS: Rates of stent thrombosis, mortality, myocardial infarction and bypass grafts did not differ by stent type. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) resulted in a 71%-80% lower risk of revascularisation at 12 months (RR 0.29 [95% CI, 0.20-0.43] for paclitaxel-eluting stents [n = 1593 patients]; RR 0.20 [95% CI, 0.13-0.29] for sirolimus-eluting stents [n = 1296 patients]). Similar benefits were seen in several high-risk subgroups of patients: those with diabetes, lesion length > 20 mm and target-vessel diameter < or = 2.5 mm. The benefits of DESs in these high-risk groups over lower-risk groups were inconclusive because of low numbers. The cost per revascularisation avoided by using DESs was 3,750-6,100 Australian dollars, with an estimated cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained of 46,829-76,467 Australian dollars. In sensitivity analyses, estimates varied from DESs being cost-saving to costing an additional 314,385 Australian dollars per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: DESs are effective in reducing revascularisation. Estimates of cost-effectiveness are very sensitive to changes in estimates of their true effects in clinical practice, market price and the number of stents used per patient. Decisions to limit DESs to only patients at the highest risk of restenosis may improve their cost-effectiveness but will need to be reassessed when evidence is available to compare absolute benefits between patient groups.",2005-01-01624,16274347,Med J Aust,Sarah J Lord,2005,183 / 9,464-71,No,16274347,"Sarah J Lord; Kirsten Howard; Felicity Allen; Luke Marinovich; David C Burgess; Richard King; John J Atherton; Kirsten Howard; Felicity Allen; Luke Marinovich; David C Burgess; Richard King; John J Atherton; A systematic review and economic analysis of drug-eluting coronary stents available in Australia, Med J Aust, 2005-Nov-07; 183(9):0025-729X; 464-71",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Paclitaxel-eluting stents vs. Bare-metal stents,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,76467,Australia,2003,70167.1

3098,Cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation after an acute coronary event: a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental effects on cost and quality of life of cardiac rehabilitation after an acute coronary syndrome. DESIGN: Open randomised controlled trial with 1 year's follow-up. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. SETTING: Two tertiary hospitals in Sydney. INTERVENTION: 18 sessions of comprehensive exercise-based outpatient cardiac rehabilitation or conventional care as provided by the treating doctor. PARTICIPANTS: 113 patients aged 41-75 years who were self-caring and literate in English. Patients with uncompensated heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmias, severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis or physical impairment were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (hospitalisations, medication use, outpatient visits, investigations, and personal expenses); and measures of quality of life. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved at 1 year (this estimate combines within-study utility effects with reported 1-year risk of survival and treatment effects of rehabilitation on mortality). Sensitivity analyses around a base case estimate included alternative assumptions of no treatment effect on survival, 3 years of treatment effect on survival and variations in utility. RESULTS: The estimated incremental cost per QALY saved for rehabilitation relative to standard care was 42,535 US dollars when modelling included the reported treatment effect on survival. This increased to 70,580 US dollars per QALY saved if treatment effect on survival was not included. The results were sensitive to variations in utility and ranged from 19,685 US dollars per QALY saved to rehabilitation not being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The effects on quality of life tend to reinforce treatment advantages on survival for patients having postdischarge rehabilitation after an acute coronary syndrome. The estimated base case incremental cost per QALY saved is consistent with those historically accepted by decision making authorities such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.",2005-01-01625,16274344,Med J Aust,Tom G Briffa,2005,183 / 9,450-5,No,16274344,"Tom G Briffa; Simon D Eckermann; Alison D Griffiths; Phillip J Harris; M Rose Heath; Saul B Freedman; Lana T Donaldson; N Kathryn Briffa; Anthony C Keech; Simon D Eckermann; Alison D Griffiths; Phillip J Harris; M Rose Heath; Saul B Freedman; Lana T Donaldson; N Kathryn Briffa; Anthony C Keech; Cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation after an acute coronary event: a randomised controlled trial, Med J Aust, 2005-Nov-07; 183(9):0025-729X; 450-5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Conprehensive exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation vs. Conventional rehabilitation,Not Stated,75 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,42535,Australia,1998,42488.71
3099,A model for cost-effectiveness analyses of smoking cessation interventions applied to a Quit-and-Win contest for mothers of small children,"AIMS: The first aim of this study was to develop a model that predicts health and economic consequences of smoking cessation in Sweden, striving to follow the methodological recommendations to reflect the societal perspective and to use the health measure quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The second aim was to apply the model estimates to a smoking cessation intervention. METHODS: A Markov cost-effectiveness model was developed on smoking-related lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease. Swedish primary data on medical treatment costs and quality-of-life weights were used, supplemented with secondary data on other societal effects and the disease and death risks. The model simulations were applied to a ""Quit-and-Win"" contest for mothers of pre-school children. In total, 238 women participated, with 34 sustained tobacco-free at 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness model estimates a gain of 0.34 to 0.55 QALYs (discounted 3%), and cost savings of SEK 20-35,000 per female quitter in the age range 15 to 49 years. The cost-effectiveness analyses of the intervention showed intervention costs per quitter of SEK 7,850, and intervention costs per life-years saved (YLS) (discounted 3%) of SEK 13,200. The cost-utility analysis demonstrated cost savings and a gain of 16 QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-utility analysis estimated health gains and cost savings resulting from the ""Quit-and-Win"" contest. As the model estimates on the differences in societal cost between smokers and quitters are considerable, many tobacco control programmes would result in cost savings.

3100,Reassessment of the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in Sweden: results based on the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to reassess the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) based on new medical evidence found in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Within a model framework using an individual state transition model, the cost-effectiveness of 50- to 60-year-old women with menopausal symptoms is assessed based on a societal perspective in Sweden. METHODS: The model has a 50-year time horizon divided into a cycle length of 1 year. The model consists of the following disease states: coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolic events, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, vertebral fracture, and wrist fracture. An intervention is modeled by its impact on the disease risks during and after the cessation of therapy. The model calculates costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with and without intervention. The resulting cost per QALY gained is compared with the value of a QALY gained, which is set to SEK 600,000. The model requires data on clinical effects, risks, mortality rates, quality of life weights, and costs valid for Sweden. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratios are estimated at approximately SEK 10,000, which is below the threshold value of cost-effectiveness. On the condition that HRT increases the quality of life weight more than 0.013 units, the therapy is cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, given the new evidence in WHI, there is still a high probability that HRT is a cost-effective strategy for women with menopausal symptoms.",2005-01-01634,16262965,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Niklas Zethraeus,2005,21 / 4,433-41,No,16262965,"Niklas Zethraeus; Fredrik Borgström; Bengt Jönsson; John Kanis; Fredrik Borgström; Bengt Jönsson; John Kanis; Reassessment of the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in Sweden: results based on the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2005; 21(4):0266-4623; 433-41",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combination hormone replacement therapy vs. No therapy,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,12807,Sweden,2003,2235.57
