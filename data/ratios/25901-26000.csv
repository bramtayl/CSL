25901,Reducing the global burden of depression: population-level analysis of intervention cost-effectiveness in 14 world regions,"BACKGROUND: International evidence on the cost and effects of interventions for reducing the global burden of depression remain scarce. Aims To estimate the population-level cost-effectiveness of evidence-based depression interventions and their contribution towards reducing current burden. METHOD: Primary-care-based depression interventions were modelled at the level of whole populations in 14 epidemiological subregions of the world. Total population-level costs (in international dollars or I$) and effectiveness (disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted) were combined to form average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Evaluated interventions have the potential to reduce the current burden of depression by 10-30%. Pharmacotherapy with older antidepressant drugs, with or without proactive collaborative care, are currently more cost-effective strategies than those using newer antidepressants, particularly in lower-income subregions. CONCLUSIONS: Even in resource-poor regions, each DALYaverted by efficient depression treatments in primary care costs less than 1 year of average per capita income, making such interventions a cost-effective use of health resources. However, current levels of burden can only be reduced significantly if there is a substantial increase substantial increase in treatment coverage.",2004-99-00329,15123502,Br J Psychiatry,Dan Chisholm,2004,184 /,393-403,No,15123502,"Dan Chisholm; Kristy Sanderson; Jose Luis Ayuso-Mateos; Shekhar Saxena; Kristy Sanderson; Jose Luis Ayuso-Mateos; Shekhar Saxena; Reducing the global burden of depression: population-level analysis of intervention cost-effectiveness in 14 world regions, Br J Psychiatry, 2004-May; 184():0007-1250; 393-403",DALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical","Newer antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, e.g. fluoxetine)) plus brief psychotherapy ((brief cognitive therapy or problem-solving treatment)) vs. None",Not Stated,Not Stated,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3,3,2507,United States,2000,3767.94

Total population-level costs (in international dollars or I$) and effectiveness (disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted) were combined to form average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Evaluated interventions have the potential to reduce the current burden of depression by 10-30%. Pharmacotherapy with older antidepressant drugs, with or without proactive collaborative care, are currently more cost-effective strategies than those using newer antidepressants, particularly in lower-income subregions. CONCLUSIONS: Even in resource-poor regions, each DALYaverted by efficient depression treatments in primary care costs less than 1 year of average per capita income, making such interventions a cost-effective use of health resources.

We assumed that full immunization would require two doses at prices of US$ 0.50 and US$ 10 per dose in the public and private sectors, respectively. The gross cost per 1000 population (of all ages) of the vaccination program would be US$ 154. Due to projected savings in dengue treatment, the net cost per capita would be only US$ 17 (89% below the gross cost). The cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved by a pediatric vaccine would be US$ 50, making the potential vaccine highly cost-effective.

25977,The cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Australia,"Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 7 valent (PCV7) is the most costly vaccine yet considered for publicly funded programs. In mid 2001, Australia funded PCV7 for high-risk groups only (indigenous children and children with certain underlying medical conditions). World wide, non-industry-funded studies and studies using cost-utility measures are sparse. We undertook an independent economic analysis of PCV7 compared with no vaccination in the non high-risk Australian childhood population using cost-utility and cost-effectiveness measures. Methods: The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), non-bacteraemic pneumonia and otitis media was estimated using representative urban Australian data, or by extrapolation from comparable industrialised countries. A decision-analytic model was developed for a hypothetical birth cohort using the age-specific vaccine coverage from the Californian randomised controlled trial of PCV7. Health outcomes were measured by life-years saved and deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. In line with government guidelines, only direct costs were considered in 1997-1998 Australian dollars. Results: For a birth cohort of 250,000, the gross cost of vaccination is $ 78.6 million. Subtracting treatment cost savings, the net cost (discounted) is $ 61.7 million. In undiscounted terms, vaccination prevents 13.7 deaths, 11.2 (82%) from IPD and the remainder from non-bacteraemic pneumonia. The discounted cost per death avoided is $ 5.0 million, per life-year saved $ 230,130 and per DALY averted $ 121,100, giving a break-even vaccine price of $ 15.40 per dose. These estimates are most sensitive to the unit cost per dose of vaccine, estimates of incidence and vaccine efficacy against non-bacteraemic pneumonia and the discount rate. The cost per DALY reduced to $ 81,000 with a discount rate of 3% rather than 5% and to $ 90,000 with the most favourable assumptions concerning pneumonia reduction. Discussion: With a vaccine price of $ 90 per dose, mid-range estimates of impact against non-bacteraemic pneumonia, and discount rate of 5%, a PCV7 program for infants not at high risk of IPD is at the upper limit of cost per DALY previously approved under Australian pharmaceutical funding guidelines. The impact of PCV7 against non-bacteraemic pneumonia is poorly defined, but its importance to cost-effectiveness in resource rich and resource poor settings warrants further studies or analysis to give greater precision to this outcome.",2004-99-00402,15003641,Vaccine,James R G Butler,2004,22 / 9-10,1138-49,Yes,15003641,"James R G Butler; Peter McIntyre; C Raina MacIntyre; Robin Gilmour; Ann L Howarth; Beate Sander; Peter McIntyre; C Raina MacIntyre; Robin Gilmour; Ann L Howarth; Beate Sander; The cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Australia, Vaccine, 2004-Mar-12; 22(9-10):1873-2518; 1138-49",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Immunization,Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,5,5,121100,Australia,1998,120968.22
25978,"The Victorian Active Script Programme: promising signs for general practitioners, population health, and the promotion of physical activity","BACKGROUND: The Active Script Programme (ASP) aimed to increase the number of general practitioners (GPs) in Victoria, Australia who deliver appropriate, consistent, and effective advice on physical activity to patients. To maximise GP participation, a capacity building strategy within Divisions of General Practice (DGPs) was used. The objectives of the programme were to (a) train and support GPs in advising sedentary patients, and (b) develop tools and resources to assist GPs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the ASP. METHODS: A systems approach was used to promote capacity in Victorian general practice. Economic analyses were incorporated into the programme""s evaluation. Participants were selected DGPs and their GP members. The programme worked with DGPs to train GPs and provide relevant resources. The main outcome measures were (a) changes in GP knowledge and behaviour and (b) cost effectiveness, based on modelled estimates of numbers of patients advised and adopting physical activity and gaining the associated health benefits. RESULTS: GP awareness and provision of physical activity advice increased. Although the programme""s reach was modest, based on actual GP involvement, the cost effectiveness figures (138 Australian dollars per patient to become sufficiently active to gain health benefits, and 3647 Australian dollars per disability adjusted life year saved) are persuasive. CONCLUSIONS: The ASP increased DGPs"" capacity to support GPs to promote physical activity. There is a strong economic argument for governments to invest in such programmes. However, caution is warranted about the maintenance of patients"" activity levels. Programme refinement to encourage GPs to use community supports more effectively will guide future development. Further research on long term patient adherence through a multisectorial approach is warranted.",2004-XX-00449,14751940,Br J Sports Med,J Sims,2004,38 / 1,19-25,No,14751940,"J Sims; N Huang; J Pietsch; L Naccarella; N Huang; J Pietsch; L Naccarella; The Victorian Active Script Programme: promising signs for general practitioners, population health, and the promotion of physical activity, Br J Sports Med, 2004-Feb; 38(1):0306-3674; 19-25",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",Active Script Programme vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3,3,3647,Australia,1996,4709.39

To date, expected costs (expressed in international dollars) and effects (measured in terms of disability adjusted life years, DALYs) of key pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have been modelled for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and panic disorder. The results of this analysis indicate that the most efficient interventions for common mental disorders (depression and panic disorder) can be considered very cost-effective (each DALY averted costs less than one year of average per capita income), while community-based interventions for more severe mental disorders using older antipsychotic and mood stabilising drugs meet the criterion for being cost-effective (each DALY averted costs less than three times the average annual income). These findings provide relevant new information to health policy makers regarding the relative value of investing in psychiatric care, and in so doing may help to remove one of many remaining barriers to a more appropriate public health response to the burden of these conditions.",2005-99-01544,16633504,World Psychiatry,Dan Chisholm,2005,4 / 1,37-44,No,16633504,"Dan Chisholm; Choosing cost-effective interventions in psychiatry: results from the CHOICE programme of the World Health Organization, World Psychiatry, 2005-Feb; 4(1):1723-8617; 37-44",DALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical",Valproate plus psychosocial treatment vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3,3,4520,United States,2003,6357.75
