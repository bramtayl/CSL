28401,Intervention strategies to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases in Mexico: cost effectiveness analysis,"To inform decision making regarding intervention strategies against non-communicable diseases in Mexico, in the context of health reform.Cost effectiveness analysis based on epidemiological modelling.101 intervention strategies relating to nine major clusters of non-communicable disease: depression, heavy alcohol use, tobacco use, cataracts, breast cancer, cervical cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.Mexican data sources were used for most key input parameters, including administrative registries; disease burden and population estimates; household surveys; and drug price databases. These sources were supplemented as needed with estimates for Mexico from the WHO-CHOICE unit cost database or with estimates extrapolated from the published literature.Population health outcomes, measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs); costs in 2005 international dollars ($Int); and costs per DALY.Across 101 intervention strategies examined in this study, average yearly costs at the population level would range from around =$Int1m (such as for cataract surgeries) to >$Int1bn for certain strategies for primary prevention in cardiovascular disease. Wide variation also appeared in total population health benefits, from <1000 DALYs averted a year (for some components of cancer treatments or aspirin for acute ischaemic stroke) to >300,000 averted DALYs (for aggressive combinations of interventions to deal with alcohol use or cardiovascular risks). Interventions in this study spanned a wide range of average cost effectiveness ratios, differing by more than three orders of magnitude between the lowest and highest ratios. Overall, community and public health interventions such as non-personal interventions for alcohol use, tobacco use, and cardiovascular risks tended to have lower cost effectiveness ratios than many clinical interventions (of varying complexity). Even within the community and public health interventions, however, there was a 200-fold difference between the most and least cost effective strategies examined. Likewise, several clinical interventions appeared among the strategies with the lowest average cost effectiveness ratios-for example, cataract surgeries.Wide variations in costs and effects exist within and across intervention categories. For every major disease area examined, at least some strategies provided excellent value for money, including both population based and personal interventions.",2012-99-08799,22389335,BMJ,Joshua A Salomon,2012,344 /,e355,No,22389335,"Joshua A Salomon; Natalie Carvalho; Cristina Guti?rrez-Delgado; Ricardo Orozco; Anna Mancuso; Daniel R Hogan; Diana Lee; Yuki Murakami; Lakshmi Sridharan; Mar?a Elena Medina-Mora; Eduardo Gonz?lez-Pier; Intervention strategies to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases in Mexico: cost effectiveness analysis, BMJ, ; 344 ():0959-8138; e355",DALY,Mexico,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Diagnostic, Environmental, Health Education or Behavior, Immunization, Legislation / Regulation, Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical, Screening, Surgical",Inhaled bronchodilator and corticosteroid vs. None,stage III & IV,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,24687.5,United States,2005,32715.8

This study uses cost-effective analysis to evaluate increasing the threshold to minimize false-positive results and recall rates.Cost of screening, diagnosis and treatment, education, and care of mentally retarded patients were gathered from the Ministry of Health State Welfare Organization and Department of Education in Tehran. Screening data were obtained from 34,007 neonates in the Central Health Laboratory of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2009. Sensitivity analysis and calculation of confidence interval for incremental costs and effects (gained disability adjusted life years - DALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were performed by Monte Carlo simulation with Ersatz software.ICER for screening programs with different TSH cut-off points versus no screening was similar, and approximately -4.5 ? 0.2 thousand US dollars per gained DALY.

28445,Potential cost-effectiveness of universal access to modern contraceptives in Uganda,"Over two thirds of women who need contraception in Uganda lack access to modern effective methods. This study was conducted to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of achieving universal access to modern contraceptives in Uganda by implementing a hypothetical new contraceptive program (NCP) from both societal and governmental (Ministry of Health (MoH)) perspectives.A Markov model was developed to compare the NCP to the status quo or current contraceptive program (CCP). The model followed a hypothetical cohort of 15-year old girls over a lifetime horizon. Data were obtained from the Uganda National Demographic and Health Survey and from published and unpublished sources. Costs, life expectancy, disability-adjusted life expectancy, pregnancies, fertility and incremental cost-effectiveness measured as cost per life-year (LY) gained, cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, cost per pregnancy averted and cost per unit of fertility reduction were calculated. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of results. Mean discounted life expectancy and disability-adjusted life expectancy (DALE) were higher under the NCP vs. CCP (28.74 vs. 28.65 years and 27.38 vs. 27.01 respectively). Mean pregnancies and live births per woman were lower under the NCP (9.51 vs. 7.90 and 6.92 vs. 5.79 respectively). Mean lifetime societal costs per woman were lower for the NCP from the societal perspective ($1,949 vs. $1,987) and the MoH perspective ($636 vs. $685). In the incremental analysis, the NCP dominated the CCP, i.e. it was both less costly and more effective. The results were robust to univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Universal access to modern contraceptives in Uganda appears to be highly cost-effective.

28455,Expanding ART for treatment and prevention of HIV in South Africa: estimated cost and cost-effectiveness 2011-2050,"Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) significantly reduces HIV transmission. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of expanded ART in South Africa.We model a best case scenario of 90% annual HIV testing coverage in adults 15-49 years old and four ART eligibility scenarios: CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) (current practice), CD4 count <350, CD4 count <500, all CD4 levels. 2011-2050 outcomes include deaths, disability adjusted life years (DALYs), HIV infections, cost, and cost per DALY averted. Service and ART costs reflect South African data and international generic prices. ART reduces transmission by 92%. We conducted sensitivity analyses.Expanding ART to CD4 count <350 cells/mm(3) prevents an estimated 265,000 (17%) and 1.3 million (15%) new HIV infections over 5 and 40 years, respectively. Cumulative deaths decline 15%, from 12.5 to 10.6 million; DALYs by 14% from 109 to 93 million over 40 years. Costs drop $504 million over 5 years and $3.9 billion over 40 years with breakeven by 2013. Compared with the current scenario, expanding to <500 prevents an additional 585,000 and 3 million new HIV infections over 5 and 40 years, respectively. Expanding to all CD4 levels decreases HIV infections by 3.3 million (45%) and costs by $10 billion over 40 years, with breakeven by 2023. By 2050, using higher ART and monitoring costs, all CD4 levels saves $0.6 billion versus current; other ART scenarios cost $9-194 per DALY averted. If ART reduces transmission by 99%, savings from all CD4 levels reach $17.5 billion. Sensitivity analyses suggest that poor retention and predominant acute phase transmission reduce DALYs averted by 26% and savings by 7%.Increasing the provision of ART to <350 cells/mm3 may significantly reduce costs while reducing the HIV burden.

28456,"Integrated HIV testing, malaria, and diarrhea prevention campaign in Kenya: modeled health impact and cost-effectiveness","Efficiently delivered interventions to reduce HIV, malaria, and diarrhea are essential to accelerating global health efforts. A 2008 community integrated prevention campaign in Western Province, Kenya, reached 47,000 individuals over 7 days, providing HIV testing and counseling, water filters, insecticide-treated bed nets, condoms, and for HIV-infected individuals cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and referral for ongoing care. We modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of a scaled-up integrated prevention campaign.We estimated averted deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) based on published data on baseline mortality and morbidity and on the protective effect of interventions, including antiretroviral therapy. We incorporate a previously estimated scaled-up campaign cost. We used published costs of medical care to estimate savings from averted illness (for all three diseases) and the added costs of initiating treatment earlier in the course of HIV disease.Per 1000 participants, projected reductions in cases of diarrhea, malaria, and HIV infection avert an estimated 16.3 deaths, 359 DALYs and $85,113 in medical care costs. Earlier care for HIV-infected persons adds an estimated 82 DALYs averted (to a total of 442), at a cost of $37,097 (reducing total averted costs to $48,015). Accounting for the estimated campaign cost of $32,000, the campaign saves an estimated $16,015 per 1000 participants. In multivariate sensitivity analyses, 83% of simulations result in net savings, and 93% in a cost per DALY averted of less than $20.A mass, rapidly implemented campaign for HIV testing, safe water, and malaria control appears economically attractive.",2012-99-08741,22347462,PLoS One,James G Kahn,2012,7 /,e31316,No,22347462,"James G Kahn; Nicholas Muraguri; Brian Harris; Eric Lugada; Thomas Clasen; Mark Grabowsky; Jonathan Mermin; Shahnaaz Shariff; Integrated HIV testing, malaria, and diarrhea prevention campaign in Kenya: modeled health impact and cost-effectiveness, PLoS One , ; 7 ():1932-6203; e31316",DALY,Kenya,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Diagnostic, Environmental, Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Screening","Integrated HIV testing, malaria, and diarrhea prevention campaign vs. None",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,-36.25,United States,2008,-43.57
28457,Evaluation of cost-effectiveness of live oral pentavalent reassortant rotavirus vaccine introduction in Ghana,"Globally, rotavirus gastroenteritis is the most common identifiable cause of severe diarrhea in children under 5. Recently introduced rotavirus vaccines from Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Efficacy results in Ghana suggest Merck & Co.'s live oral pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq(?)) prevents 65.0% of severe gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection in children under 5. The announcement by Merck and GSK to make their rotavirus vaccines available for developing nations at reduced prices provides Ghana with the opportunity to introduce rotavirus vaccines into the national immunization program after investigation of the medical, economic and political implications.We estimated the average costs of treating children with diarrhea in the Ashanti region of Ghana as inpatients and outpatients. Using these results, data from rotavirus surveillance studies, and recent rotavirus vaccine efficacy evaluation, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of introducing RotaTeq in Ghana.Based on our prospective calculations, we estimated an average inpatient and outpatient costs of $233.97 and $17.09, respectively, for treating childhood diarrhea. Using the 2003 birth cohort, RotaTeq introduction could save 1554 lives and avert 93,109 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) annually. At a market price of $5 per dose, introducing RotaTeq would have a base-case cost of $62.26 per DALY averted, at a market price of $3.50 per dose, a base-case cost of $39.59 per DALY averted and at market cost of $1 per dose, a base-case cost of $1.81 per DALY averted. All three values are below the 2009 Ghana per capita GDP. Thus, RotaTeq introduction into Ghana will be very cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses suggest these results are robust.RotaTeq vaccination for children under five in Ghana would be a highly cost-effective public health intervention. Ghanaian health officials should seek GAVI funding and evaluate how to maximize RotaTeq access.",2012-99-08701,22321664,Vaccine,Collette Abbott,2012,30 /,2582-7,Yes,22321664,"Collette Abbott; Benjamin Tiede; George Armah; Adel Mahmoud; Evaluation of cost-effectiveness of live oral pentavalent reassortant rotavirus vaccine introduction in Ghana, Vaccine, ; 30 ():1873-2518; 2582-7",DALY,Ghana,Not Stated,Immunization,Live oral pentavalent reassortant rotavirus vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,62.26,United States,2009,75.11
28458,The population cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent childhood depression,"Depression in childhood and adolescence is common and often persists into adulthood. This study assessed the population-level cost-effectiveness of a preventive intervention that screens children and adolescents for symptoms of depression in schools and the subsequent provision of a psychological intervention to those showing elevated signs of depression. The target population for screening comprised 11- to 17-year-old children and adolescents in the 2003 Australian population.Economic modeling techniques were used to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with no intervention. The perspective was that of the health sector, and outcomes were measured by using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Multivariate probabilistic and univariate sensitivity testing was applied to quantify variations in the model parameters.The modeled psychological intervention had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5400 per DALY averted, with just 2% of iterations falling above a $50?000 per DALY value-for-money threshold. Results were robust to model assumptions.After school screening, screening and the psychological intervention represent good value-for-money. Such an intervention needs to be seriously considered in any national package of preventive health services. Acceptability issues, particularly to intervention providers, including schools and mental health professionals, need to be considered before wide-scale adoption.",2012-99-08684,22312000,Pediatrics,Cathrine Mihalopoulos,2012,129 /,e723-30,No,22312000,"Cathrine Mihalopoulos; Theo Vos; Jane Pirkis; Rob Carter; The population cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent childhood depression, Pediatrics, ; 129 ():1098-4275; e723-30",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Screening, Other",Childhood depression prevention- screens children & adolescents in schools followed by psychological intervention vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,5400,Australia,2003,4955.11

28473,Would vaccination against nicotine be a cost-effective way to prevent smoking uptake in adolescents?,"Aims We used epidemiological modelling to assess whether nicotine vaccines would be a cost-effective way of preventing smoking uptake in adolescents. Design, Setting, Participants and Measurements We built an epidemiological model using Australian data on age-specific smoking prevalence; smoking cessation and relapse rates; life-time sex-specific disability-adjusted life years lived for cohorts of 100 000 smokers and non-smokers; government data on the costs of delivering a vaccination programme by general practitioners; and a range of plausible and optimistic estimates of vaccine cost, efficacy and immune response rates based on clinical trial results. We first estimated the smoking uptake rates for Australians aged 12-19 years. We then used these estimates to predict the expected smoking prevalence in a birth cohort aged 12 in 2003 by age 20 under (i) current policy and (ii) different vaccination scenarios that varied in cost, initial vaccination uptake, yearly re-vaccination rates, efficacy and a favourable vaccine immune response rate. Findings Under the most optimistic assumptions, the cost to avert a smoker at age 20 was $44 431 [95% confidence interval (CI) $40 023-49 250]. This increased to $296 019 (95% CI $252 307-$355 930) under more plausible scenarios. The vaccine programme was not cost-effective under any scenario. Conclusions A preventive nicotine vaccination programme is unlikely to be cost-effective. The total cost of a universal vaccination programme would be high and its impact on population smoking prevalence negligible. For these reasons, such a programme is unlikely to be publicly funded in Australia or any other developed country.",2012-99-08295,22084967,Addiction,Coral E Gartner,2011,/,,No,22084967,"Coral E Gartner; Jan J Barendregt; Angela Wallace; Wayne D Hall; Would vaccination against nicotine be a cost-effective way to prevent smoking uptake in adolescents?, Addiction, ; ():0965-2140",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Immunization,Nicotine vaccination program vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,40 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,215872,Australia,2009,206426.93

28483,Cost-effectiveness of tobacco control policies in Vietnam: the case of personal smoking cessation support.,"Aims: To examine the cost-effectiveness of personal smoking cessation support in Vietnam. Design, setting and participants: We followed up the population aged 15 and over in 2006 to model the costs and health gains associated with five interventions: physician brief advice; nicotine replacement therapy (patch and gum); Bupropion; and Varenicline. Threshold analysis was undertaken to determine the price levels of pharmaceuticals for the interventions to be cost-effective. A multi-state life table model was constructed such that the interventions affect the smoking cessation behaviour of the age cohorts, and the resulting smoking prevalence defines their health outcomes. A healthcare perspective was employed. Measurements: Cost-effectiveness is measured in 2006 Vietnamese Dong (VND) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. We adopted the WHO thresholds of being ""cost-effective"" if less than 3 times GDP per capita (VND 34,600,000) and ""very cost-effective"" if less than GDP per capita (VND 11,500,000). Findings: The cost-effectiveness result of physician brief advice was VND 1,583,000 per DALY averted (Int. $493), which was ""very cost-effective"". Varenicline dominated Bupropion and nicotine-replacement therapies, although it did not fall within the range of being ""cost-effective"" under different scenarios. The threshold analysis revealed that prices of pharmaceuticals must be substantially lower than the levels from other countries if pharmacological therapies are to be cost-effective in Vietnam.

28495,The Impact and Cost-effectiveness of Strategies to Detect Drug Resistant Tuberculosis.,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a serious emerging problem in many low resource countries. TB control programs are uncertain which drug susceptibility tests (DST) to use and when to test patients. We predicted the potential cost-effectiveness of different DST strategies, in settings with varying prevalence of drug resistance. Using decision analysis, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of conventional and rapid DST for already diagnosed smear positive TB cases. Five different time points were considered for administering DST. Different initial drug resistance and HIV scenarios were also considered. All DST scenarios in the wide range of settings considered were found to be cost-effective.
