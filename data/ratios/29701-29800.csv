29701,Health and Economic Implications of National Treatment Coverage for Cardiovascular Disease in India: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Whether to cover cardiovascular disease costs is an increasingly pressing question for low- and middle-income countries. We sought to identify the impact of expanding national insurance to cover primary prevention, secondary prevention, and tertiary treatment for cardiovascular disease in India. METHODS AND RESULTS: We incorporated data from coverage experiments into a validated microsimulation model of myocardial infarction and stroke in India to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternate coverage strategies. Coverage of primary prevention alone saved 3.6 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) per annum at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $469 per DALY averted when compared with the status quo of no coverage. Coverage of primary and secondary preventions was dominated by a strategy of covering primary prevention and tertiary treatment, which prevented 6.6 million DALYs at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2241 per DALY averted, when compared with that of primary prevention alone. The combination of all 3 categories yielded the greatest impact at an incremental cost per DALY averted of $5588 when compared with coverage of primary prevention plus tertiary treatment. When compared with the status quo of no coverage, coverage of all 3 categories of prevention/treatment yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1331 per DALY averted. In sensitivity analyses, coverage of primary preventive treatments remained cost-effective even if adherence and access to therapy were low, but tertiary coverage would require avoiding unnecessary procedures to remain cost-effective.

29703,Assessing the promise of biofortification: A case study of high provitamin A maize in Zambia,"Introduction: Biofortification is the breeding of new varieties of staple foods for increased micronutrient content. It is seen primarily as a complementary, rural-targeted strategy for better reaching remote populations. This paper presents an ex ante analysis of HarvestPlus' provitamin A maize (PVAM) in Zambia and highlights an empirical approach based on the Zambian 2005/06 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS). Because more than 115 countries regularly conduct a Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES), the approach developed in this LCMS-based study can be applied in many other countries to analyze varietal adoption and conduct ex ante studies. Methods: Data from the LCMS and health statistics were used to characterize baseline indicators of vitamin A intake and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost. The introduction and scaling up of PVAM was modeled based on program plans, expert opinion and data on key adoption parameters. An adoption function was specified and expressed in terms of the percent of farmers expected to adopt PVAM over the next 30 years. A logistic regression adoption function was estimated and used to identify the specific LCMS households adopting, producing and consuming PVAM each year. Information from the IFPRI International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) of yearly maize production and demand were used to produce annual estimates of PVAM planted, harvested and consumed. Taking into account an LCMS-empirically-informed, specified market structure, individuals' additional vitamin A intake was calculated. The number of DALYs saved were estimated using the change in vitamin A intake. Combining these estimates with cost data, the cost-effectiveness of PVAM was calculated. Results: Assuming an adoption ceiling of 20% over 30 years, implementation of PVAM will result in average additional intake of 12% of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), a 3 percentage, point reduction in the prevalence of inadequate intake, and savings of 23% of total DALYs. Impacts are concentrated among farming households that have adopted PVAM and consume it from their own production. Their consumption will result in an average additional vitamin A intake, of 172 mu g/day, more than 3 times the additional 54 mu g/day among the entire population. Among this group, the reduction in the prevalence of inadequate intake will be more than 5 times the national average (17.5 percentage points). Valuing a DALY at $1000, PVAM's cumulative value of DALYs saved comes to exceed its cumulative total costs starting in 2019. Over 30 years the cost-effectiveness of PVAM in Zambia was estimated to be $24 per DALY saved, making it very cost-effective. Conclusion: The methodologies employed in this study provide insights and inputs that can be used to target farmers who are most likely to adopt, to measure their vitamin A intake and to craft messages to promote adoption. PVAM is a long term investment that shows great promise in becoming a highly cost-effective addition to the public health arsenal for combatting micronutrient deficiencies if the 20% adoption rate can be achieved and maintained. Doing so will require effective marketing strategies, including efforts to couple this nutrition-sensitive intervention with nutrition-specific activities, such as targeted nutrition messaging and education, in order to increase the likelihood that adopting farmers will prioritize production for home consumption.

29704,Decreasing the burden of type 2 diabetes in South Africa: The impact of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages,"Introduction Type 2 diabetes poses an increasing public health burden in South Africa (SA) with obesity as the main driver of the epidemic. Consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) is linked to weight gain and reducing SSB consumption may significantly impact the prevalence of obesity and related diseases. We estimated the effect of a 20% SSB tax on the burden of diabetes in SA. Methods and Findings We constructed a life table-based model in Microsoft Excel (2010). Consumption data from the 2012 SA National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, previously published own- and cross-price elasticities of SSBs and energy balance equations were used to estimate changes in daily energy intake and its projected impact on BMI arising from increased SSB prices. Diabetes relative risk and prevalent years lived with disability estimates fromthe Global Burden of Disease Study andmodelled disease epidemiology estimates from a previous study were used to estimate the effect of the BMI changes on diabetes burden. Diabetes cost estimates were obtained from the South African Council forMedical Schemes. Over 20 years, a 20% SSB tax could reduce diabetes incident cases by 106 000 in women (95%uncertainty interval (UI) 70 000-142 000) and by 54 000 inmen (95%UI: 33 000-80 000); and prevalence in all adults by 4.0% (95% UI: 2.7%-5.3%). Cumulatively over twenty years, approximately 21 000 (95%UI: 14 000-29 000) adult T2DM-related deaths, 374 000 DALYs attributed to T2DM (95%UI: 299 000-463 000) and over ZAR10 billion T2DM healthcare costs (95%UI: ZAR6.8-14.0 billion) equivalent to USD860 million (95%UI: USD570 million-USD1.2 billion) may be averted.

29718,Health and economic benefits of public financing of epilepsy treatment in India: An agent-based simulation model,"OBJECTIVE: An estimated 6-10 million people in India live with active epilepsy, and less than half are treated. We analyze the health and economic benefits of three scenarios of publicly financed national epilepsy programs that provide: (1) first-line antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs), (2) first- and second-line AEDs, and (3) first- and second-line AEDs and surgery. METHODS: We model the prevalence and distribution of epilepsy in India using IndiaSim, an agent-based, simulation model of the Indian population. Agents in the model are disease-free or in one of three disease states: untreated with seizures, treated with seizures, and treated without seizures. Outcome measures include the proportion of the population that has epilepsy and is untreated, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and cost per DALY averted. Economic benefit measures estimated include out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure averted and money-metric value of insurance. RESULTS: All three scenarios represent a cost-effective use of resources and would avert 800,000-1 million DALYs per year in India relative to the current scenario. However, especially in poor regions and populations, scenario 1 (which publicly finances only first-line therapy) does not decrease the OOP expenditure or provide financial risk protection if we include care-seeking costs. The OOP expenditure averted increases from scenarios 1 through 3, and the money-metric value of insurance follows a similar trend between scenarios and typically decreases with wealth. In the first 10 years of scenarios 2 and 3, households avert on average over US$80 million per year in medical expenditure. SIGNIFICANCE: Expanding and publicly financing epilepsy treatment in India averts substantial disease burden.

High blood pressure is a leading CVD risk factor. We sought to compare 3 strategies for treating blood pressure in China and India: a treat-to-target (TTT) strategy emphasizing lowering blood pressure to a target, a benefit-based tailored treatment (BTT) strategy emphasizing lowering CVD risk, or a hybrid strategy currently recommended by the World Health Organization. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a microsimulation model of adults aged 30 to 70 years in China and in India to compare the 2 treatment approaches across a 10-year policy-planning horizon.

The hybrid strategy in the current World Health Organization guidelines produced no substantial benefits over TTT. BTT was more cost-effective at $205 to $272/disability-adjusted life-year averted, which was $142 to $182 less per disability-adjusted life-year than TTT or hybrid strategies. The comparative effectiveness of BTT was robust to uncertainties in CVD risk estimation and to variations in the age range analyzed, the BTT treatment threshold, or rates of treatment access, adherence, or concurrent statin therapy.

29734,"Cost Effectiveness of Implementing Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses Program in District Faridabad, India","INTRODUCTION: Despite the evidence for preventing childhood morbidity and mortality, financial resources are cited as a constraint for Governments to scale up the key health interventions in some countries. We evaluate the cost effectiveness of implementing IMNCI program in India from a health system and societal perspective. METHODS: We parameterized a decision analytic model to assess incremental cost effectiveness of IMNCI program as against routine child health services for infant population at district level in India. Using a 15-years time horizon from 2007 to 2022, we populated the model using data on costs and effects as found from a cluster-randomized trial to assess effectiveness of IMNCI program in Haryana state. Effectiveness was estimated as reduction in infant illness episodes, deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALY). Incremental cost per DALY averted was used to estimate cost effectiveness of IMNCI. Future costs and effects were discounted at a rate of 3%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to estimate the probability of IMNCI to be cost effective at varying willingness to pay thresholds. RESULTS: Implementation of IMNCI results in a cumulative reduction of 57,384 illness episodes, 2369 deaths and 76,158 DALYs among infants at district level from 2007 to 2022. Overall, from a health system perspective, IMNCI program incurs an incremental cost of USD 34.5 (INR 1554) per DALY averted, USD 34.5 (INR 1554) per life year gained, USD 1110 (INR 49,963) per infant death averted. There is 90% probability for ICER to be cost effective at INR 2300 willingness to pay, which is 5.5% of India's GDP per capita. From a societal perspective, IMNCI program incurs an additional cost of USD 24.1 (INR 1082) per DALY averted, USD 773 (INR 34799) per infant death averted and USD 26.3 (INR 1183) per illness averted in during infancy. CONCLUSION: IMNCI program in Indian context is very cost effective and should be scaled-up as a major child survival strategy.",2016-XX-20388,26727369,PLoS One,Shankar Prinja,2016,11 / 1,e0145043,No,26727369,"Shankar Prinja; Pankaj Bahuguna; Pavitra Mohan; Sarmila Mazumder; Sunita Taneja; Nita Bhandari; Henri van den Hombergh; Rajesh Kumar; Cost Effectiveness of Implementing Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses Program in District Faridabad, India, PLoS One , 2016; 11(1):1932-6203; e0145043",DALY,India,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical","Integrated management of neonatal and childhood illness program includes training, home care visits, medication availability, and access to medical facilities vs. Standard/Usual Care",Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,", Lifetime",3.00,3.00,1554,India,2009,38.82
29735,Cost-utility analysis of dengue vaccination in a country with heterogeneous risk of dengue transmission,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is one of the most important vector-borne diseases worldwide, and annually, nearly 390 million people are infected and 500,000 patients are hospitalized for severe dengue. Argentina has great variability in the risk of dengue transmission due to eco-climatic reasons. Currently no vaccines are available for dengue even though several vaccines are under development. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a dengue vaccine in a country with heterogeneous risk of dengue transmission like Argentina. METHODS: The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective using a Markov model that included both vaccine and disease parameters. Utility was measured as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the vaccination was expressed in 2014 American dollars (US$) per DALY averted. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainty in model outcomes, and a threshold analysis was conducted to estimate the highest possible price of the vaccine. RESULTS: The ICER of the vaccination program was found to be US$ 5714 per DALY averted. This value is lower than 3 times the per capita GDP of Argentina (US$ 38,619 in 2014); 54.9% of the simulations were below this value. If a vaccination program would be implemented the maximum vaccine price per dose has to be US$1.49 for a vaccination at national level or US$28.72 for a targeted vaccination in high transmission areas. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that vaccination against dengue would be cost-effective in Argentina, especially if carried out in predetermined regions at high risk of dengue transmission. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there was considerable uncertainty around the ICER value.

The cost-effectiveness of IPT for HIV-infected pregnant women in India is unknown. DESIGN: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antepartum IPT among HIV-infected women in India using a decision-analytic model. We compared current practice (no IPT) with: Intervention 1 (IPT regardless of CD4 count) and Intervention 2 (IPT for those with CD4 count 200 cells/mul). We modeled IPT irrespective of tuberculin skin test (TST) status and TST-driven strategies. Primary outcomes were anticipated costs, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and TB cases. RESULTS: Both IPT interventions are highly cost-effective compared to no IPT at current willingness-to-pay thresholds (respectively US$178.00 and US$201.00 per DALY averted for Interventions 1 and 2). However, providing IPT irrespective of CD4 count results in the greatest health benefits (21 TB cases averted/1000 patients) compared to current practice. IPT irrespective of TST status was also highly cost-effective compared to TST-driven IPT (respectively US$1027.00 and US$1154.00/DALY averted for Interventions 1 and 2).

29738,Cost-Effectiveness and Quality of Care of a Comprehensive ART Program in Malawi,"The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a holistic, comprehensive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment Program in Malawi.Comprehensive cost data for the year 2010 have been collected at 30 facilities from the public network of health centers providing antiretroviral treatment (ART) throughout the country; two of these facilities were operated by the Disease Relief through Excellent and Advanced Means (DREAM) program.The outcomes analysis was carried out over five years comparing two cohorts of patients on treatment: 1) 2387 patients who started ART in the two DREAM centers during 2008, 2) patients who started ART in Malawi in the same year under the Ministry of Health program.Assuming the 2010 cost as constant over the five years the cost-effective analysis was undertaken from a health sector and national perspective; a sensitivity analysis included two hypothesis of ART impact on patients'' income.The total cost per patient per year (PPPY) was $314.5 for the DREAM protocol and $188.8 for the other Malawi ART sites, with 737 disability adjusted life years (DALY) saved among the DREAM program patients compared with the others. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was $1640 per DALY saved; it ranged between $896-1268 for national and health sector perspective respectively. The cost per DALY saved remained under $2154 that is the AFR-E-WHO regional gross domestic product per capita threshold for a program to be considered very cost-effective.HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome comprehensive treatment program that joins ART with laboratory monitoring, treatment adherence reinforcing and Malnutrition control can be very cost-effective in the sub-Saharan African setting.",2016-99-19373,27227921,Medicine (Baltimore),Stefano Orlando,2016,95 / 21,e3610,No,27227921,"Stefano Orlando; Samantha Diamond; Leonardo Palombi; Maaya Sundaram; Lauren Shear Zimmer; Maria Cristina Marazzi; Sandro Mancinelli; Giuseppe Liotta; Cost-Effectiveness and Quality of Care of a Comprehensive ART Program in Malawi, Medicine (Baltimore), 2016 May; 95(21):1536-5964; e3610",DALY,Malawi,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Other",Disease Relief through Excellent and Advanced Means vs. Standard/Usual Care- Current Malawi national program,Clinical stage 3-4 or with a CD4 count <250 cells/microliter,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,1640,United States,2010,1946.52

DESIGN: Forecasting study from 2014 to 2023 using the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a Markov model. SETTING: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PARTICIPANTS: U.S. adults aged 60-94 stratified into fast walking, slow walking, and poor functioning (noncompleters) based on measured gait speed. MEASUREMENTS: Lowering SBP to a target of 140 or 150 mmHg was modeled in persons with (secondary prevention) and without (primary prevention) a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. Based on clinical trials and observational studies, it was projected that slow-walking and poor-functioning participants would have greater noncardiovascular mortality. Myocardial infarctions (MIs), strokes, deaths, cost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were measured. RESULTS: Regardless of gait speed, it was projected that secondary prevention to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg would prevent more events and save more money than secondary prevention to 150 mmHg. Similarly, primary prevention to 140 mmHg in fast-walking adults was projected to prevent events and save money. In slow-walking adults, primary prevention to 150 mmHg was projected to prevent MIs and strokes and save DALYs but was cost saving only in men; intensification to 140 mmHg is of uncertain benefit in slow-walking individuals. Primary prevention in poor-functioning adults to a target of 140 or 150 mmHg SBP is projected to decrease DALYs. CONCLUSION: The most cost-effective SBP target varies according to history of cardiovascular disease and gait speed in persons aged 60-94.

DESIGN: Forecasting study from 2014 to 2023 using the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a Markov model. SETTING: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PARTICIPANTS: U.S. adults aged 60-94 stratified into fast walking, slow walking, and poor functioning (noncompleters) based on measured gait speed. MEASUREMENTS: Lowering SBP to a target of 140 or 150 mmHg was modeled in persons with (secondary prevention) and without (primary prevention) a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. Based on clinical trials and observational studies, it was projected that slow-walking and poor-functioning participants would have greater noncardiovascular mortality. Myocardial infarctions (MIs), strokes, deaths, cost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were measured. RESULTS: Regardless of gait speed, it was projected that secondary prevention to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg would prevent more events and save more money than secondary prevention to 150 mmHg.

Based on clinical trials and observational studies, it was projected that slow-walking and poor-functioning participants would have greater noncardiovascular mortality. Myocardial infarctions (MIs), strokes, deaths, cost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were measured. RESULTS: Regardless of gait speed, it was projected that secondary prevention to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg would prevent more events and save more money than secondary prevention to 150 mmHg. Similarly, primary prevention to 140 mmHg in fast-walking adults was projected to prevent events and save money. In slow-walking adults, primary prevention to 150 mmHg was projected to prevent MIs and strokes and save DALYs but was cost saving only in men; intensification to 140 mmHg is of uncertain benefit in slow-walking individuals. Primary prevention in poor-functioning adults to a target of 140 or 150 mmHg SBP is projected to decrease DALYs. CONCLUSION: The most cost-effective SBP target varies according to history of cardiovascular disease and gait speed in persons aged 60-94.

We aim to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of medical interventions for primary prevention of CVD using the World Health Organization''s (WHO) absolute risk approach for four risk levels. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective using two Markov decision models: CVD risk without diabetes and CVD risk with diabetes. Primary provider and patient costs were estimated using the ingredients approach and step-down methodologies. Epidemiological data and efficacy inputs were derived from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We used disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) averted as the outcome measure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: For CVD low-risk patients without diabetes, medical management is not cost-effective unless willingness to pay (WTP) is higher than US$1327 per DALY averted. For moderate-risk patients, WTP must exceed US$164 per DALY before a combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and diuretic (Diu) becomes cost-effective, while for high-risk and very high-risk patients the thresholds are US$349 (ACEI, calcium channel blocker (CCB) and Diu) and US$498 per DALY (ACEI, CCB, Diu and Aspirin (ASA)) respectively. For patients with CVD risk with diabetes, a combination of sulfonylureas (Sulf), ACEI and CCB for low and moderate risk (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) US$608 and US$115 per DALY respectively), is the most cost-effective, while adding biguanide (Big) to this combination yielded the most favourable ICERs of US$309 and US$350 per DALY for high and very high risk respectively.

METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective using two Markov decision models: CVD risk without diabetes and CVD risk with diabetes. Primary provider and patient costs were estimated using the ingredients approach and step-down methodologies. Epidemiological data and efficacy inputs were derived from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We used disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) averted as the outcome measure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: For CVD low-risk patients without diabetes, medical management is not cost-effective unless willingness to pay (WTP) is higher than US$1327 per DALY averted. For moderate-risk patients, WTP must exceed US$164 per DALY before a combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and diuretic (Diu) becomes cost-effective, while for high-risk and very high-risk patients the thresholds are US$349 (ACEI, calcium channel blocker (CCB) and Diu) and US$498 per DALY (ACEI, CCB, Diu and Aspirin (ASA)) respectively. For patients with CVD risk with diabetes, a combination of sulfonylureas (Sulf), ACEI and CCB for low and moderate risk (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) US$608 and US$115 per DALY respectively), is the most cost-effective, while adding biguanide (Big) to this combination yielded the most favourable ICERs of US$309 and US$350 per DALY for high and very high risk respectively.

For patients with CVD risk with diabetes, a combination of sulfonylureas (Sulf), ACEI and CCB for low and moderate risk (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) US$608 and US$115 per DALY respectively), is the most cost-effective, while adding biguanide (Big) to this combination yielded the most favourable ICERs of US$309 and US$350 per DALY for high and very high risk respectively.

29783,Cost-utility analysis of a nationwide vaccination programme against serogroup B meningococcal disease in Israel,"OBJECTIVES: Using cost-utility analysis, to evaluate whether or not to adopt a Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B vaccination programme for Israeli children. METHODS: Epidemiological, demographic, health service utilisation and economic data were integrated into a spreadsheet model to calculate the cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of the intervention. RESULTS: Assuming 78 % vaccine efficacy with no herd immunity, vaccination will prevent 223 cases and 22 deaths over a 100-year period. Based on vaccine price of $60 per dose, total intervention costs ($315,400,000) are partially offset by a $22,700,000 reduction in treatment and sequelae costs as a result of decreased morbidity. The intervention was not cost-effective since the net cost ($292,700,000) per averted DALY gained (1249 mostly due to decreased mortality) was $234,394. Additional two dose catch-up programmes vaccinating children in cohorts aged 1-2 to 1-13 were also not cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccination will become cost-effective if vaccine costs fall below $19.44 per dose.

We describe the health economic properties of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in relation to its impact on depressive relapse/recurrence over 2 years of follow-up. METHOD: Non-depressed adults with a history of three or more major depressive episodes were randomised to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy + depressive relapse active monitoring (n = 101) or control (depressive relapse active monitoring alone) (n = 102) and followed up for 2 years. Structured self-report instruments for service use and absenteeism provided cost data items for health economic analyses. Treatment utility, expressed as disability-adjusted life years, was calculated by adjusting the number of days an individual was depressed by the relevant International Classification of Diseases 12-month severity of depression disability weight from the Global Burden of Disease 2010. Intention-to-treat analysis assessed the incremental cost-utility ratios of the interventions across mental health care, all of health-care and whole-of-society perspectives.

29791,Cost-Effectiveness of Price Subsidies on Fortified Packaged Infant Cereals in Reducing Iron Deficiency Anemia in 6-23-Month-Old-Children in Urban India,"INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major public health problem in India and especially harmful in early childhood due to its impact on cognitive development and increased all-cause mortality. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of price subsidies on fortified packaged infant cereals (F-PICs) in reducing IDA in 6-23-monthold children in urban India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness is estimated by comparing the net social cost of price subsidies with the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted with price subsidies. The net social costs correspond to the cost of the subsidy minus the monetary costs saved by reducing IDA. The estimation proceeds in three steps: 1) the current lifetime costs of IDA are assessed with a health economic model combining the prevalence of anemia, derived from a large population survey, with information on the health consequences of IDA and their costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and DALYs. 2) The effects of price subsidies on the demand for F-PICs are assessed with a market survey among 4801 households in 12 large Indian cities. 3) The cost-effectiveness is calculated by combining the findings of the first two steps with the results of a systematic review on the effectiveness of F-PICs in reducing IDA. We compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions that differ in the level of the subsidy and in the socio-economic strata (SES) eligible for the subsidy. RESULTS: The lifetime social costs of IDA in 6-23-month-old children in large Indian cities amount to production losses of 3222 USD and to 726,000 DALYs. Poor households incur the highest costs, yet even wealthier households suffer substantial losses. The market survey reveals that few households currently buy F-PICs, with the share ranging from 14% to 36%. Wealthier households are generally more likely to buy FPICs. The costs of the subsidies per DALY averted range from 909 to 3649 USD. Interventions targeted at poorer households are most effective. Almost all interventions are cost saving from a societal perspective when taking into account the reduction of future production losses. Return per DALY averted ranges between gains of 1655 USD to a cost of 411 USD. CONCLUSION: Price subsidies on F-PICs are a cost-effective way to reduce the social costs of IDA in 6-23-month-old children in large Indian cities. Interventions targeting poorer households are especially cost-effective.",2016-99-19681,27073892,PLoS One,Rafael Plessow,2016,11 / 4,e0152800,No,27073892,"Rafael Plessow; Narendra Kumar Arora; Beatrice Brunner; Simon Wieser; Cost-Effectiveness of Price Subsidies on Fortified Packaged Infant Cereals in Reducing Iron Deficiency Anemia in 6-23-Month-Old-Children in Urban India, PLoS One , 2016; 11(4):1932-6203; e0152800",DALY,India,Not Stated,"Legislation / Regulation, Other",Price subsidy accounting for 50% of cost fortified packaged infant cereals; lowest income quintile families eligible vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2014,Not Stated
29792,The Impact of a Tax on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages on Health and Health Care Costs: A Modelling Study,"This paper aims to estimate the consequences of an additional 20% tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on health and health care expenditure. Participants were adult (aged > = 20) Australians alive in 2010, who were modelled over their remaining lifetime. We used lifetable-based epidemiological modelling to examine the potential impact of a 20% valoric tax on SSBs on total lifetime disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), incidence, prevalence, and mortality of obesity-related disease, and health care expenditure. Over the lifetime of adult Australian alive in 2010, seemingly modest estimated changes in average body mass as a result of the SSB tax translated to gains of 112,000 health-adjusted life years for men (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 73,000-155,000) and 56,000 (95% UI: 36,000-76,000) for women, and a reduction in overall health care expenditure of AUD609 million (95% UI: 368 million- 870 million). The tax is estimated to reduce the number of new type 2 diabetes cases by approximately 800 per year. Twenty-five years after the introduction of the tax, there would be 4,400 fewer prevalent cases of heart disease and 1,100 fewer persons living with the consequences of stroke, and an estimated 1606 extra people would be alive as a result of the tax. The tax would generate an estimated AUD400 million in revenue each year. Governments should consider increasing the tax on sugared drinks.

29793,Cost-Effectiveness of Monovalent Rotavirus Vaccination of Infants in Malawi: A Postintroduction Analysis Using Individual Patient-Level Costing Data,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccination reduces childhood hospitalization in Africa, but cost-effectiveness has not been determined using real-world effectiveness and costing data. We sought to determine monovalent rotavirus vaccine cost-effectiveness in Malawi, one of Africa''s poorest countries and the first Gavi-eligible country to report disease reduction following introduction in 2012. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of children with acute gastroenteritis at a rural primary health center, a rural first referral-level hospital and an urban regional referral hospital in Malawi. For each participant we itemized household costs of illness and direct medical expenditures incurred. We also collected Ministry of Health vaccine implementation costs. Using a standard tool (TRIVAC), we derived cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Between 1 January 2013 and 21 November 2014, we recruited 530 children aged <5 years with gastroenteritis. Costs did not differ by rotavirus test result, but were significantly higher for admitted children and those with increased severity on Vesikari scale. Adding rotavirus vaccine to the national schedule costs Malawi $0.42 per dose in system costs. Vaccine copayment is an additional $0.20. Over 20 years, the vaccine program will avert 1 026 000 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis, 78 000 inpatient admissions, 4300 deaths, and 136 000 disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs). For this year''s birth cohort, it will avert 54 000 cases of rotavirus and 281 deaths in children aged <5 years. The program will cost $10.5 million and save $8.0 million in averted healthcare costs. Societal cost per DALY averted was $10, and the cost per rotavirus case averted was $1. CONCLUSIONS: Gastroenteritis causes substantial economic burden to Malawi. The rotavirus vaccine program is highly cost-effective. Together with the demonstrated impact of rotavirus vaccine in reducing population hospitalization burden, its cost-effectiveness makes a strong argument for widespread utilization in other low-income, high-burden settings.",2016-99-19708,27059360,Clin Infect Dis,Naor Bar-Zeev,2016,62 Suppl 2 /,S220-8,No,27059360,"Naor Bar-Zeev; Jacqueline E Tate; Clint Pecenka; Jean Chikafa; Hazzie Mvula; Richard Wachepa; Charles Mwansambo; Themba Mhango; Geoffrey Chirwa; Amelia C Crampin; Umesh D Parashar; Anthony Costello; Robert S Heyderman; Neil French; Deborah Atherly; Nigel A Cunliffe; VACSURV Consortium; Cost-Effectiveness of Monovalent Rotavirus Vaccination of Infants in Malawi: A Postintroduction Analysis Using Individual Patient-Level Costing Data, Clin Infect Dis, 2016 May 1; 62 Suppl 2():1537-6591; S220-8",DALY,Malawi,Not Stated,Immunization,Monovalent Rotavirus Vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,10,United States,2014,10.93
29794,Cost-Effectiveness of Antivenoms for Snakebite Envenoming in 16 Countries in West Africa,"BACKGROUND: Snakebite poisoning is a significant medical problem in agricultural societies in Sub Saharan Africa. Antivenom (AV) is the standard treatment, and we assessed the cost-effectiveness of making it available in 16 countries in West Africa. METHODS: We determined the cost-effectiveness of AV based on a decision-tree model from a public payer perspective. Specific AVs included in the model were Antivipmyn, FAV Afrique, EchiTab-G and EchiTab-Plus. We derived inputs from the literature which included: type of snakes causing bites (carpet viper (Echis species)/non-carpet viper), AV effectiveness against death, mortality without AV, probability of Early Adverse Reactions (EAR), likelihood of death from EAR, average age at envenomation in years, anticipated remaining life span and likelihood of amputation. Costs incurred by the victims include: costs of confirming and evaluating envenomation, AV acquisition, routine care, AV transportation logistics, hospital admission and related transportation costs, management of AV EAR compared to the alternative of free snakebite care with ineffective or no AV. Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were assessed as the cost per death averted and the cost per Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALY) averted. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSA) using Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain 95% Confidence Intervals of ICERs. RESULTS: The cost/death averted for the 16 countries of interest ranged from $1,997 in Guinea Bissau to $6,205 for Liberia and Sierra Leone. The cost/DALY averted ranged from $83 (95% Confidence Interval: $36-$240) for Benin Republic to $281 ($159-457) for Sierra-Leone. In all cases, the base-case cost/DALY averted estimate fell below the commonly accepted threshold of one time per capita GDP, suggesting that AV is highly cost-effective for the treatment of snakebite in all 16 WA countries. The findings were consistent even with variations of inputs in 1-way sensitivity analyses. In addition, the PSA showed that in the majority of iterations ranging from 97.3% in Liberia to 100% in Cameroun, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal, our model results yielded an ICER that fell below the threshold of one time per capita GDP, thus, indicating a high degree of confidence in our results.
