16301,Cost-effectiveness analysis of left atrial appendage occlusion compared with pharmacological strategies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a promising therapy for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) but its cost-effectiveness remains understudied. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of LAAO for stroke prophylaxis in NVAF. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of LAAO with 7 pharmacological strategies: aspirin alone, clopidogrel plus aspirin, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Base-case data were derived from ACTIVE, RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL trials. One-way sensitivity analysis varied by CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons, and LAAO costs; and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: LAAO was considered cost-effective compared with aspirin, clopidogrel plus aspirin, and warfarin, with ICER of US$5,115, $2,447, and $6,298 per QALY gained, respectively. LAAO was dominant (i.e. less costly but more effective) compared to other strategies. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated favorable ICERs of LAAO against other strategies in varied CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons (5 to 15 years) and LAAO costs. LAAO was cost-effective in 86.24 % of 10,000 simulations using a threshold of US$50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter LAAO is cost-effective for prevention of stroke in NVAF compared with 7 pharmacological strategies. The transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is considered cost-effective against the standard 7 oral pharmacological strategies including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone, clopidogrel plus ASA, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation management.",2016-01-22231,27581874,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,Vivian Wing-Yan Lee,2016,16 / 1,167,No,27581874,"Vivian Wing-Yan Lee; Ronald Bing-Ching Tsai; Ines Hang-Iao Chow; Bryan Ping-Yen Yan; Mehmet Gungor Kaya; Jai-Wun Park; Yat-Yin Lam; Cost-effectiveness analysis of left atrial appendage occlusion compared with pharmacological strategies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, BMC Cardiovasc Disord, 2016; 16(1):1471-2261; 167",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Standard/Usual Care- Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occlusion,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5 Years, 10 Years, 15 Years",3.00,3.00,-9764.78,United States,2014,-10675.32

16305,Cost Effectiveness of Apixaban and Enoxaparin for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism After Total Knee Replacement in China,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Apixaban and enoxaparin are indicated for preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of apixaban versus enoxaparin for the prophylaxis of VTE and associated long-term complications in Chinese patients after total knee replacement (TKR). METHODS: A decision model, which included both acute VTE (represented as a decision tree) and the long-term complications of VTE (represented as a Markov model), was developed to assess the economic outcomes of the two prophylactic strategies for Chinese patients after TKR. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from published literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the uncertainty concerning the model parameters. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and direct medical costs were reported over a 5-year horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated. RESULTS: Thromboprophylaxis with apixaban was estimated to have a higher cost (US$68) and more health benefits (0.0006 QALYs) than thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin over a 5.5-year time horizon, resulting in an ICER of US$108,497 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses found that the cost of apixaban and the probability of pulmonary embolism when taking either apixaban or enoxaparin had a considerable impact on the model outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the analysis found that the use of enoxaparin in Chinese patients after TKR was likely to be more cost effective than the use of apixaban.",2016-01-22233,27581246,Clin Drug Investig,Xiaoyu Yan,2016,36 / 12,1001-1010,Yes,27581246,"Xiaoyu Yan; Xiaohua Gu; Lei Zhou; Houweng Lin; Bin Wu; Cost Effectiveness of Apixaban and Enoxaparin for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism After Total Knee Replacement in China, Clin Drug Investig, 2016 Dec; 36(12):1173-2563; 1001-1010",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Standard/Usual Care- Enoxaparin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,108497,United States,2015,118473.43
16306,Best cost-effectiveness and worker productivity with initial triple DMARD therapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy in early rheumatoid arthritis: cost-utility analysis of the tREACH trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate direct and indirect costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for different initial treatment strategies in very early RA. METHODS: The 1-year data of the treatment in the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort trial were used. Patients with a high probability (>70%) according to their likelihood of progressing to persistent arthritis, based on the prediction model of Visser, were randomized into one of following initial treatment strategies: (A) initial triple DMARD therapy (iTDT) with glucocorticoids (GCs) intramuscular (n = 91); (B) iTDT with an oral GC tapering scheme (n = 93); and (C) initial MTX monotherapy (iMM) with GCs similar to B (n = 97). Data on QALYs, measured with the Dutch EuroQol, and direct and indirect cost were used. Direct costs are costs of treatment and medical consumption, whereas indirect costs are costs due to loss of productivity. RESULTS: Average QALYs (sd) for A, B and C were, respectively, 0.75 (0.12), 0.75 (0.10) and 0.73 (0.13) for Dutch EuroQol. Highest total costs per QALY (sd) were, respectively, euro12748 (euro18767), euro10 380 (euro15 608) and euro17 408 (euro21 828) for strategy A, B and C (P = 0.012, B vs C). Direct as well as indirect costs were higher with iMM (strategy C) compared with iTDT (strategy B). Higher direct costs were due to approximately 40% more biologic usage over time. Higher indirect costs, on the other hand, were caused by more long-term sickness and reduction in contract hours. iTDT was >95% cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds compared with iMM.

16308,Surgical management of bilateral vocal fold paralysis: A cost-effectiveness comparison of two treatments,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Endoscopic management of bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) includes cordotomy and arytenoidectomy, and has become a well-accepted alternative to tracheostomy. However, the costs and quality-of-life benefits of endoscopic management have not been examined with formal economic analysis. This study undertakes a cost-effectiveness analysis of tracheostomy versus endoscopic management of BVFP. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A literature review identified a range of costs and outcomes associated with surgical options for BVFP. Additional costs were derived from Medicare reimbursement data; all were adjusted to 2014 dollars. Cost-effectiveness analysis evaluated both therapeutic strategies in short-term and long-term scenarios. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess confidence levels regarding the economic evaluation. RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for endoscopic management versus tracheostomy is $31,600.06 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), indicating that endoscopic management is the cost-effective short-term strategy at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY. The probability that endoscopic management is more cost-effective than tracheostomy at this WTP is 65.1%. Threshold analysis demonstrated that the model is sensitive to both utilities and cost in the short-term scenario. When costs of long-term care are included, tracheostomy is dominated by endoscopic management, indicating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic management at any WTP. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic management of BVFP appears to be more cost-effective than tracheostomy. Though endoscopic cordotomy and arytenoidectomy require expertise and specialized equipment, this model demonstrates utility gains and long-term cost advantages to an endoscopic strategy.

16310,Application of Bayesian Approach to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Antiviral Treatments in Chronic Hepatitis B,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major problem for public health; timely antiviral treatment can significantly prevent the progression of liver damage from HBV by slowing down or stopping the virus from reproducing. In the study we applied Bayesian approach to cost-effectiveness analysis, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods for the relevant evidence input into the model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of entecavir (ETV) and lamivudine (LVD) therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Jiangsu, China, thus providing information to the public health system in the CHB therapy. METHODS: Eight-stage Markov model was developed, a hypothetical cohort of 35-year-old HBeAg-positive patients with CHB was entered into the model. Treatment regimens were LVD100mg daily and ETV 0.5 mg daily. The transition parameters were derived either from systematic reviews of the literature or from previous economic studies. The outcome measures were life-years, quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs), and expected costs associated with the treatments and disease progression. For the Bayesian models all the analysis was implemented by using WinBUGS version 1.4. RESULTS: Expected cost, life expectancy, QALYs decreased with age. Cost-effectiveness increased with age. Expected cost of ETV was less than LVD, while life expectancy and QALYs were higher than that of LVD, ETV strategy was more cost-effective. Costs and benefits of the Monte Carlo simulation were very close to the results of exact form among the group, but standard deviation of each group indicated there was a big difference between individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with lamivudine, entecavir is the more cost-effective option. CHB patients should accept antiviral treatment as soon as possible as the lower age the more cost-effective.

16311,Cost Effectiveness of Implantable Cardiac Monitor-Guided Intermittent Anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation: An Analysis of the REACT.COM Pilot Study,"INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulation guidelines for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) disregard AF burden. A strategy of targeted anticoagulation with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) based on continuous rhythm assessment with an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) has recently been explored. We evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of this strategy versus projected outcomes with continuous anticoagulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a Markov model using data from the Rhythm Evaluation for AntiCoagulaTion With COntinuous Monitoring (REACT.COM) pilot study (N = 59) and prior NOAC trials to calculate the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with ICM-guided intermittent anticoagulation for AF versus standard care during a 3-year time horizon. Health state utilities were estimated from the pilot study population using the SF-12. Costs were based on current Medicare reimbursement. Over 14 +/- 4 months of follow-up, 18 of 59 patients had 35 AF episodes. The ICM-guided strategy resulted in a 94% reduction in anticoagulant use relative to continuous treatment. There were no strokes, 3 (5.1%) TIAs, 2 major bleeding events (on aspirin) and 3 minor bleeding events with the ICM-guided strategy. The projected total 3-year costs were $12,535 for the ICM-guided strategy versus $13,340 for continuous anticoagulation. Projected QALYs were 2.45 for both groups. CONCLUSION: Based on a pilot study, a strategy of ICM-guided anticoagulation with NOACs may be cost-saving relative to expected outcomes with continuous anticoagulation, with similar quality-adjusted survival.

16312,Cost-Effectiveness of Sacubitril-Valsartan in Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction,"Background: Sacubitril-valsartan therapy reduces cardiovascular mortality compared with enalapril therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril-valsartan versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. Design: Markov decision model. Data Sources: Clinical trials, observational analyses, reimbursement data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, drug pricing databases, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention life tables. Target Population: Patients at an average age of 64 years, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.40 or less. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Treatment with sacubitril-valsartan or lisinopril. Outcome Measures: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, heart failure hospitalizations, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results of Base-Case Analysis: The sacubitril-valsartan group experienced 0.08 fewer heart failure hospitalization, 0.69 additional life-year, 0.62 additional QALY, and $29 203 in incremental costs, equating to a cost per QALY gained of $47 053. The cost per QALY gained was $44 531 in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and $58 194 in those with class III or IV heart failure. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Sacubitril-valsartan treatment was most sensitive to the duration of improved outcomes, with a cost per QALY gained of $120 623 if the duration was limited to the length of the trial (median, 27 months). No variations in other parameters caused the cost to exceed $100 000 per QALY gained. Limitation: The benefit of sacubitril-valsartan is based on a single clinical trial.

16315,Cost-effectiveness of telehealth for patients with raised cardiovascular disease risk: evidence from the Healthlines randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention for primary care patients with raised cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. DESIGN: A prospective within-trial patient-level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Patients recruited through primary care, and intervention delivered via telehealth service. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a 10-year CVD risk >/=20%, as measured by the QRISK2 algorithm, with at least 1 modifiable risk factor. INTERVENTION: A series of up to 13 scripted, theory-led telehealth encounters with healthcare advisors, who supported participants to make behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. Participants in the control arm received usual care. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Productivity impacts, participant out-of-pocket expenditure and the clinical outcome were presented in a cost-consequences framework. RESULTS: 641 participants were randomised-325 to receive the telehealth intervention in addition to usual care and 316 to receive only usual care. 18% of participants had missing data on either costs, utilities or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base case results. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service (NHS) costs of pound138 (95% CI 66 to 211) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.012 (95% CI -0.001 to 0.026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound10 859. Net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000 per QALY was pound116 (95% CI -58 to 291), and the probability that the intervention was cost-effective at this threshold value was 0.77. Similar results were obtained from a complete case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that the Healthlines telehealth intervention was likely to be cost-effective at a threshold of pound20 000 per QALY.

METHODS: Decision tree models were constructed to compare two different strategies of management of patients with CM, wide excision of the primary lesion and SNB and wide excision only (WE). Tree models were created for every Breslow thickness over 1-, 5- and 10-year time horizons. Mean and total direct healthcare costs, life years saved (LYSs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost effectiveness ratio (CER), and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated. Every model was considered as a base case, and its results tested with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Base case analyses showed that the best results were obtained for intermediate CM over 10-year time horizon. In this case, ICER for SNB was 130,508euro/QALY, well over the threshold of acceptance (30,000euro/QALY). In patients with intermediate CM over 1 and 5 years, and for those with thick and thin CM at any time horizon, negative ICER values were estimated since SNB was proved to be more expensive and less effective than WE. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our results. CONCLUSIONS: SNB caused no improvement in health outcomes in terms of LYSs and QALYs in patients with thick and thin CM, and only a slight benefit in those with intermediate CM.

16319,Screening individuals with intracranial aneurysms for abdominal aortic aneurysms is cost-effective based on estimated coprevalence,"OBJECTIVE: Aneurysm rupture is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and evidence suggests shared risk for both abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and intracranial aneurysms (IAs). We hypothesized that screening for AAA in patients with known IA is cost-effective. METHODS: We used a decision tree model to compare costs and outcomes of AAA screening vs no screening in a hypothetical cohort of patients with IA. We measured expected outcomes using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We performed a Monte Carlo simulation and additional sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of ranging base case variables on model outcomes and identified thresholds where a decision alternative dominated the model (both less expensive and more effective than the alternative). RESULTS: In our base case analysis, screening for AAA provided an additional 0.17 QALY (2.5-97.5 percentile: 0.11-0.27 QALY) at a saving of $201 (2.5-97.5 percentile: $-127 to $896). This yielded an ICER of $-1150/QALY (2.5-97.5 percentile: $-4299 to $6374/QALY), that is, screening saves $1150 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, screening for AAA in individuals with IA is cost-effective at an ICER of $1150/QALY, well below accepted societal thresholds estimated at $60,000/QALY. Cost-effectiveness of cross-screening in these populations is sensitive to aneurysm coprevalence and risk of rupture.

METHODS: A Markov cohort model in which patients were administered a sequence of treatments was used to predict long-term outcomes associated with each treatment. The model was informed by data from the eltrombopag clinical trial program and the available literature. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, and a lifetime time horizon was used. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Eltrombopag dominated romiplostim (i.e., eltrombopag was as effective as but less costly than romiplostim) in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, assuming a class effect for the two treatments. Eltrombopag also dominated romiplostim in most deterministic sensitivity analyses with the exception of when indirect efficacy estimates were incorporated into the model. In this analysis, eltrombopag no longer dominated romiplostim but remained cost-effective versus romiplostim at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was a 99% and 92% chance of eltrombopag being cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, respectively.

16322,Cost-Utility Analysis of Long-Acting Beta Agonists versus Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists in Older Adults with Persistent Asthma Receiving Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroid Therapy,"BACKGROUND: Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are the major add-on treatments in older adults with persistent asthma when inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) fail to achieve adequate asthma control. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of ICS + LABA treatment compared with ICS + LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with ICS + LABA treatment versus ICS + LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma in the United States from the health system perspective. The HCUPnet 2010 national statistics were used to extract the costs associated with asthma and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and inpatient mortality associated with these events. Event probabilities were predicted using Medicare 2009-2010 claims for older adults with asthma. Treatment costs were estimated on the basis of average wholesale drug price listings, and utility estimates were extracted from the literature. To account for uncertainty, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: The model predicted that, compared with ICS + LTRA treatment, ICS + LABA treatment costs $5,823 more while gaining 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $209,090 per QALY.

16323,Cost-Utility Analysis of Long-Acting Beta Agonists versus Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists in Older Adults with Persistent Asthma Receiving Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroid Therapy,"BACKGROUND: Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are the major add-on treatments in older adults with persistent asthma when inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) fail to achieve adequate asthma control. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of ICS + LABA treatment compared with ICS + LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with ICS + LABA treatment versus ICS + LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma in the United States from the health system perspective. The HCUPnet 2010 national statistics were used to extract the costs associated with asthma and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and inpatient mortality associated with these events. Event probabilities were predicted using Medicare 2009-2010 claims for older adults with asthma. Treatment costs were estimated on the basis of average wholesale drug price listings, and utility estimates were extracted from the literature. To account for uncertainty, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: The model predicted that, compared with ICS + LTRA treatment, ICS + LABA treatment costs $5,823 more while gaining 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $209,090 per QALY. Hospitalization probabilities and posthospitalization utilities were the most influential parameters in the one-way sensitivity analysis. Probabilistic uncertainty analysis using Monte-Carlo simulations showed that the probabilities that ICS + LTRA treatment is cost-effective compared with ICS + LABA treatment are 77% and 62% at $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY gained willingness-to-pay thresholds, respectively.

16324,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Anticholinergics Versus Botox for Urgency Urinary Incontinence: Results From the Anticholinergic Versus Botox Comparison Randomized Trial,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of Botox and anticholinergic (AC) medications for the management of urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). METHODS: Cost and effectiveness data were analyzed from participants in the Anticholinergic versus Botox Comparison randomized trial of daily AC medication versus 100 U of intradetrusor Botox injection. Societal costs included the following: treatment costs, patient costs, and medical and nonmedical utilization during the 6-month trial. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated based on questionnaire-derived utility measures and annualized based on data collected at baseline through 6 months. We also estimated the average direct costs for each treatment through 9 months - the duration of time when approximately half the Botox participants maintained adequate symptom control. RESULTS: Data were analyzed on the 231 women who completed a 6-month follow-up in the Anticholinergic versus Botox Comparison trial (119 AC and 112 Botox). The mean reduction in UUI episodes per day was not significantly different per group. The cumulative mean direct costs through the first 6 months also were similar: $1339 for the AC group and $1266 for the Botox group with AC costs exceeding Botox costs after 5 months. Both groups had considerable QALY gains. Annualizing the 6-month trial results to a 12-month measure, the AC and Botox groups averaged 0.702 and 0.707 QALYs, respectively. Estimates through 9 months favored Botox, showing that AC participants incurred a higher cost per month of adequate symptoms control ($305) compared with Botox participants ($207). CONCLUSIONS: Botox and AC medications have similar costs and effectiveness in the first 6 months of UUI treatment. If costs and outcomes are considered through 9 months, Botox may have significantly lower costs but similar UUI symptom control as AC.",2016-01-22289,27564385,Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg,Anthony G Visco,2016,22 / 5,311-6,No,27564385,"Anthony G Visco; Halina Zyczynski; Linda Brubaker; Ingrid Nygaard; Xiao Xu; Emily S Lukacz; Marie Fidela Paraiso; Jerod Greer; David D Rahn; Susan F Meikle; Amanda A Honeycutt; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Anticholinergics Versus Botox for Urgency Urinary Incontinence: Results From the Anticholinergic Versus Botox Comparison Randomized Trial, Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg, 2016 Sep-Oct; 22(5):2151-8378; 311-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Anticholinergic (AC) therapy vs. Botox,Completed 6-month follow-up in the Anticholinergic versus Botox Comparison trial,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,16714.29,United States,2012,18841.26
16325,Prevention of progression to cirrhosis in hepatitis C with fibrosis: effectiveness and cost effectiveness of sequential therapy with new direct-acting anti-virals,"BACKGROUND: The new direct-acting anti-virals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection offer higher cure rates, but at a much higher cost than the standard interferon-based treatments. AIM: To identify the cost-effective treatment for patients with HCV infection with F3 liver fibrosis who are at high risk of progression to cirrhosis. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model compared the health benefits and costs of all currently licensed treatments as single treatments and in sequential therapy of up to three lines. Costs were expressed in pound sterling from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Health benefits were expressed in quality-adjusted life years. RESULTS: Treatment before progression to cirrhosis always offers the most health benefits for the least costs. Sequential therapy with multiple treatment lines cures over 89% of patients across all HCV genotypes while ensuring a cost-effective use of resources. Cost-effective regimes for HCV genotype 1 patients include first-line oral therapy with sofosbuvir-ledipasvir while peginterferon continues to have a role in other genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effective treatment for HCV can be established using decision analytic modelling comparing single and sequential therapies.

16329,Cost-effectiveness of pelvic exenteration for locally advanced malignancy,"BACKGROUND: The rising cost of healthcare is well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of pelvic exenteration (PE). METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for consideration of PE between 2008 and 2011 were recruited into a prospective non-randomized study that compared quality of life (QoL) between patients who did or did not undergo PE. Information on QoL and cost (in Australian dollars, AUD) was collected at baseline, during admission and up to 24 months after discharge. QoL data were converted into a utility-based measure. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated. Bottom-up costing was performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated per life-year saved and per QALY. RESULTS: There were 174 patients with sufficient data for analysis. Of these, 139 underwent PE. R0 was achieved in 78.4 per cent of patients. The survival rate at 24 months after PE was 74.8 per cent compared with 43 per cent in those without exenteration (P = 0.001). Treatment costs were significantly higher for patients who had PE compared with those who did not (mean AUD 137 407 versus 79 174; P < 0.001). The ICER was AUD 124 147 (95 per cent c.i. 71 585 to 261 876) per life-year saved and AUD 227 330 (109 974 to 1 100 449) per QALY. Curative PE (R0) was found to be more cost-effective than non-curative PE (R1/R2), with an ICER of AUD 101 518 (60 105 to 200 428) versus 390 712 (74 368 to 82 256 739) per life-year saved. CONCLUSION: Treatment of advanced pelvic cancers is expensive regardless of the treatment intent.

16330,A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Among Los Angeles County Men Who Have Sex With Men,"BACKGROUND: Substantial gaps remain in understanding the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of choosing alternative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention strategies, including test-and-treat (expanded HIV testing combined with immediate treatment) and PrEP (initiation of preexposure prophylaxis by high-risk uninfected individuals) strategies. METHODS: We develop a mathematical epidemiological model to simulate HIV incidence among men residing in Los Angeles County, California, aged 15-65 years, who have sex with men. We combine these incidence data with an economic model to estimate the discounted cost, effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of various HIV prevention strategies using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: PrEP and test-and-treat yield the largest reductions in HIV incidence, and are highly cost-effective ($27 863/QALY and $19 302/QALY, respectively) relative to status quo and at a US willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000/QALY saved. Status quo and 12 test-and-treat and PrEP strategies determine the frontier for efficient decisions. More aggressive strategies are costlier, but more effective, albeit with diminishing returns. The relative effectiveness of PrEP is sensitive to the initial HIV prevalence rate, PrEP and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and initiation rates, the probabilities of HIV transmission, and the rates of sexual partner mixing.

RESULTS: PrEP and test-and-treat yield the largest reductions in HIV incidence, and are highly cost-effective ($27 863/QALY and $19 302/QALY, respectively) relative to status quo and at a US willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000/QALY saved. Status quo and 12 test-and-treat and PrEP strategies determine the frontier for efficient decisions. More aggressive strategies are costlier, but more effective, albeit with diminishing returns. The relative effectiveness of PrEP is sensitive to the initial HIV prevalence rate, PrEP and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and initiation rates, the probabilities of HIV transmission, and the rates of sexual partner mixing.

16342,Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Transanal Irrigation in Patients with Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction,"BACKGROUND: People suffering from neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) and an ineffective bowel regimen often suffer from fecal incontinence (FI) and related symptoms, which have a huge impact on their quality of life. In these situations, transanal irrigation (TAI) has been shown to reduce these symptoms and improve quality of life. AIM: To investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of initiating TAI in patients with NBD who have failed standard bowel care (SBC). METHODS: A deterministic Markov decision model was developed to project the lifetime health economic outcomes, including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), episodes of FI, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and stoma surgery when initiating TAI relative to continuing SBC. A data set consisting of 227 patients with NBD due to spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis, spina bifida and cauda equina syndrome was used in the analysis. In the model a 30-year old individual with SCI was used as a base-case. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was applied to evaluate the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The model predicts that a 30-year old SCI patient with a life expectancy of 37 years initiating TAI will experience a 36% reduction in FI episodes, a 29% reduction in UTIs, a 35% reduction in likelihood of stoma surgery and a 0.4 improvement in QALYs, compared with patients continuing SBC. A lifetime cost-saving of pound21,768 per patient was estimated for TAI versus continuing SBC alone.

16343,Is Single-Stage Prosthetic Reconstruction Cost Effective? A Cost-Utility Analysis for the Use of Direct-to-Implant Breast Reconstruction Relative to Expander-Implant Reconstruction in Postmastectomy Patients,"BACKGROUND: Prosthetic breast reconstruction is most commonly performed using the two-stage (expander-implant) technique. However, with the advent of skin-sparing mastectomy and the use of acellular dermal matrices, one-stage prosthetic reconstruction has become more feasible. Prior studies have suggested that one-stage reconstruction has economic advantages relative to two-stage reconstruction despite a higher revision rate. This is the first cost-utility analysis to compare the cost and quality of life of both procedures to guide patient care. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to include studies directly comparing matched patient cohorts undergoing single-stage or staged prosthetic reconstruction. Six studies were selected examining 791 direct-to-implant reconstructions and 1142 expander-implant reconstructions. Costs were derived adopting both patient and third-party payer perspectives. Utilities were derived by surveying an expert panel. Probabilities of clinically relevant complications were combined with cost and utility estimates to fit into a decision tree analysis. RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 35 percent for single-stage reconstruction and 34 percent for expander-implant reconstruction. The authors'' baseline analysis using Medicare reimbursement revealed a cost decrease of $525.25 and a clinical benefit of 0.89 quality-adjusted life-year when performing single-stage reconstructions, yielding a negative incremental cost-utility ratio. When using national billing, the incremental cost-utility further decreased, indicating that direct-to-implant breast reconstruction was the dominant strategy. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the authors'' conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Direct-to-implant breast reconstruction is the dominant strategy when used appropriately.

16345,Cost-Effectiveness of Insulin Degludec/Insulin Aspart Versus Biphasic Insulin Aspart in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes from a Danish Health-Care Perspective,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the co-formulation insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) versus biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp 30), both administered twice daily, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using a short-term cost-effectiveness model. METHODS: Data from two phase 3a treat-to-target clinical trials were used to populate a simple and transparent short-term cost-effectiveness model. The costs and effects of treatment with IDegAsp versus BIAsp 30 were calculated over a 5-year period, from a Danish health-care cost perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the degree of uncertainty and robustness of the results. RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 81,507.91 Danish Kroner (DKK) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) demonstrates that IDegAsp is a cost-effective treatment compared with BIAsp 30, over a 5-year time horizon. One-way sensitivity analyses show that the ICERs remain within an acceptable range when the rates of hypoglycemia, unit cost of hypoglycemia, disutilities of hypoglycemic events, and the time horizon are varied, ranging from 71,012 DKK to 209,446 DKK. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the probability that IDegAsp is cost-effective relative to BIAsp 30 is 99.50%, assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of 250,000 DKK per QALY. CONCLUSION: This short-term cost-effectiveness model shows that IDegAsp is a cost-effective treatment compared with BIAsp 30 for patients with T2DM. This result is primarily driven by significant reductions in severe hypoglycemia and insulin dose observed with IDegAsp versus BIAsp 30. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of these results.

We present a cost-effectiveness analysis of elective neck dissection for the initial surgical management of early-stage oral cavity cancer. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate primary, adjuvant, and salvage therapy; disease recurrence; and survival in patients with T1/T2 clinically node-negative oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Transition probabilities were derived from clinical trial data; costs (in 2015 US dollars) and health utilities were estimated from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, expressed as dollar per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), were calculated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than $100,000/QALY considered cost effective. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to examine model uncertainty. RESULTS: Our base-case model found that over a lifetime the addition of elective neck dissection to primary surgery reduced overall costs by $6,000 and improved effectiveness by 0.42 QALYs compared with primary surgery alone. The decrease in overall cost despite the added neck dissection was a result of less use of salvage therapy. On one-way sensitivity analysis, the model was most sensitive to assumptions about disease recurrence, survival, and the health utility reduction from a neck dissection. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that treatment with elective neck dissection was cost effective 76% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: Our study found that the addition of elective neck dissection reduces costs and improves health outcomes, making this a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with early-stage oral cavity cancer.",2016-01-22314,27551113,J Clin Oncol,Joseph R Acevedo,2016,/,,No,27551113,"Joseph R Acevedo; Katherine E Fero; Bayard Wilson; Assuntina G Sacco; Loren K Mell; Charles S Coffey; James D Murphy; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Elective Neck Dissection in Patients With Clinically Node-Negative Oral Cavity Cancer, J Clin Oncol, 2016 Dec 05; ():0732-183X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Elective Neck Dissection in conjunction with primary resection surgery vs. Primary resection surgery alone followed by watchful waiting,"Early stage (T1/T2), Clinically Node-Negative (N0) oral cavity cancers",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-14285.71,United States,2015,-15599.3
16347,Tailoring Breast Cancer Screening Intervals by Breast Density and Risk for Women Aged 50 Years or Older: Collaborative Modeling of Screening Outcomes,"Background: Biennial screening is generally recommended for average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, but tailored screening may provide greater benefits. Objective: To estimate outcomes for various screening intervals after age 50 years based on breast density and risk for breast cancer. Design: Collaborative simulation modeling using national incidence, breast density, and screening performance data. Setting: United States. Patients: Women aged 50 years or older with various combinations of breast density and relative risk (RR) of 1.0, 1.3, 2.0, or 4.0. Intervention: Annual, biennial, or triennial digital mammography screening from ages 50 to 74 years (vs. no screening) and ages 65 to 74 years (vs. biennial digital mammography from ages 50 to 64 years). Measurements: Lifetime breast cancer deaths, life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), false-positive mammograms, benign biopsy results, overdiagnosis, cost-effectiveness, and ratio of false-positive results to breast cancer deaths averted. Results: Screening benefits and overdiagnosis increase with breast density and RR. False-positive mammograms and benign results on biopsy decrease with increasing risk. Among women with fatty breasts or scattered fibroglandular density and an RR of 1.0 or 1.3, breast cancer deaths averted were similar for triennial versus biennial screening for both age groups (50 to 74 years, median of 3.4 to 5.1 vs. 4.1 to 6.5 deaths averted; 65 to 74 years, median of 1.5 to 2.1 vs. 1.8 to 2.6 deaths averted). Breast cancer deaths averted increased with annual versus biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years at all levels of breast density and an RR of 4.0, and those aged 65 to 74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts and an RR of 4.0. However, harms were almost 2-fold higher. Triennial screening for the average-risk subgroup and annual screening for the highest-risk subgroup cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained. Limitation: Models did not consider women younger than 50 years, those with an RR less than 1, or other imaging methods. Conclusion: Average-risk women with low breast density undergoing triennial screening and higher-risk women with high breast density receiving annual screening will maintain a similar or better balance of benefits and harms than average-risk women receiving biennial screening.

Objective: To estimate outcomes for various screening intervals after age 50 years based on breast density and risk for breast cancer. Design: Collaborative simulation modeling using national incidence, breast density, and screening performance data. Setting: United States. Patients: Women aged 50 years or older with various combinations of breast density and relative risk (RR) of 1.0, 1.3, 2.0, or 4.0. Intervention: Annual, biennial, or triennial digital mammography screening from ages 50 to 74 years (vs. no screening) and ages 65 to 74 years (vs. biennial digital mammography from ages 50 to 64 years). Measurements: Lifetime breast cancer deaths, life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), false-positive mammograms, benign biopsy results, overdiagnosis, cost-effectiveness, and ratio of false-positive results to breast cancer deaths averted. Results: Screening benefits and overdiagnosis increase with breast density and RR. False-positive mammograms and benign results on biopsy decrease with increasing risk. Among women with fatty breasts or scattered fibroglandular density and an RR of 1.0 or 1.3, breast cancer deaths averted were similar for triennial versus biennial screening for both age groups (50 to 74 years, median of 3.4 to 5.1 vs. 4.1 to 6.5 deaths averted; 65 to 74 years, median of 1.5 to 2.1 vs. 1.8 to 2.6 deaths averted). Breast cancer deaths averted increased with annual versus biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years at all levels of breast density and an RR of 4.0, and those aged 65 to 74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts and an RR of 4.0. However, harms were almost 2-fold higher. Triennial screening for the average-risk subgroup and annual screening for the highest-risk subgroup cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained. Limitation: Models did not consider women younger than 50 years, those with an RR less than 1, or other imaging methods.

Among women with fatty breasts or scattered fibroglandular density and an RR of 1.0 or 1.3, breast cancer deaths averted were similar for triennial versus biennial screening for both age groups (50 to 74 years, median of 3.4 to 5.1 vs. 4.1 to 6.5 deaths averted; 65 to 74 years, median of 1.5 to 2.1 vs. 1.8 to 2.6 deaths averted). Breast cancer deaths averted increased with annual versus biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years at all levels of breast density and an RR of 4.0, and those aged 65 to 74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts and an RR of 4.0. However, harms were almost 2-fold higher. Triennial screening for the average-risk subgroup and annual screening for the highest-risk subgroup cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained. Limitation: Models did not consider women younger than 50 years, those with an RR less than 1, or other imaging methods. Conclusion: Average-risk women with low breast density undergoing triennial screening and higher-risk women with high breast density receiving annual screening will maintain a similar or better balance of benefits and harms than average-risk women receiving biennial screening.

16371,Cost-effectiveness analysis of low-molecular-weight heparin versus aspirin thromboprophylaxis in patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of low molecular weight heparin versus aspirin as primary thromboprophylaxis throughout chemotherapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients treated with protocols including thalidomide from the perspective of French health care providers. METHODS: We used a modeling approach combining data from the only randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of the two treatments and secondary sources for costs, and utility values. We performed a decision-tree analysis and our base case was a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients. A bootstrap resampling technique was used. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated using estimated quality-adjusted life years as the efficacy outcome. Incremental costs and effectiveness were estimated for each strategy and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The number of quality-adjusted life years was estimated to be 0.300 with aspirin and 0.299 with heparin. The estimated gain with aspirin was therefore approximately one day. Over 6months, the mean total cost was euro 1518 (SD=601) per patient in the heparin arm and euro 273 (SD=1019) in the aspirin arm. This resulted in an incremental cost of euro 1245 per patient treated with heparin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the aspirin versus heparin strategy was calculated to be - 687,398 euro (95% CI, -13,457,369 to -225,385). CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin rather than heparin thromboprophylaxis, during the first six months of chemotherapy for myeloma, is associated with significant cost savings per patient and also with an unexpected slight increase in quality of life.",2016-01-22339,27536894,Thromb Res,Emilie Chalayer,2016,145 /,119-25,No,27536894,"Emilie Chalayer; Aurelie Bourmaud; Fabien Tinquaut; Franck Chauvin; Bernard Tardy; Cost-effectiveness analysis of low-molecular-weight heparin versus aspirin thromboprophylaxis in patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma, Thromb Res, 2016 Sep; 145():1879-2472; 119-25",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aspirin Thromboprophylaxis vs. Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH),Newly diagnosed,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1245900,Euro,2013,-1838373.76
16372,Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib compared with sunitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Canada,"BACKGROUND: In Canada and elsewhere, pazopanib and sunitinib-tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors-are recommended as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc). A large randomized noninferiority trial of pazopanib versus sunitinib (comparz) demonstrated that the two drugs have similar efficacy; however, patients randomized to pazopanib experienced better health-related quality of life (hrqol) and nominally lower rates of non-study medical resource utilization. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of pazopanib compared with sunitinib for first-line treatment of mrcc from a Canadian health care system perspective was evaluated using a partitioned-survival model that incorporated data from comparz and other secondary sources. The time horizon of 5 years was based on the maximum duration of follow-up in the final analysis of overall survival from the comparz trial. Analyses were conducted first using list prices for pazopanib and sunitinib and then by assuming that the prices of sunitinib and pazopanib would be equivalent. RESULTS: Based on list prices, expected costs were CA$10,293 less with pazopanib than with sunitinib. Pazopanib was estimated to yield 0.059 more quality-adjusted life-years (qalys). Pazopanib was therefore dominant (more qalys and lower costs) compared with sunitinib in the base case. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, pazopanib was dominant in 79% of simulations and was cost-effective in 90%-100% of simulations at a threshold cost-effectiveness ratio of CA$100,000. Assuming equivalent pricing, pazopanib yielded CA$917 in savings in the base case, was dominant in 36% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis simulations, and was cost-effective in 89% of simulations at a threshold cost-effectiveness ratio of CA$100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with sunitinib, pazopanib is likely to be a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of mrcc from a Canadian health care perspective.",2016-01-22341,27536183,Curr Oncol,J Amdahl,2016,23 / 4,e340-54,No,27536183,"J Amdahl; J Diaz; J Park; H R Nakhaipour; T E Delea; Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib compared with sunitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Canada, Curr Oncol, 2016 Aug; 23(4):1198-0052; e340-54",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pazopanib vs. Sunitinib for first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma,Metastatic stages of disease; treatment-naïve patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,-174753.83,Canada,2014,-173082.05
16373,Cost-effectiveness of primary debulking surgery when compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of stage IIIC and IV epithelial ovarian cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of primary debulking surgery (PDS) when compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the management of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims (SEER-Medicare). METHODS: Using a Markov model, the cost-effectiveness of PDS was compared to that of NACT. We modeled cost and survival inputs using data from women in the SEER-Medicare database with ovarian cancer treated by either PDS or NACT between 1992 and 2009. Direct and indirect costs were discounted by an annual rate of 3%. Utility weights were obtained from published data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PDS compared to NACT was calculated. RESULTS: In our model, women with stage IIIC EOC had a higher mean adjusted treatment cost for PDS when compared to NACT ($31,945 vs $30,016) but yielded greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (1.79 vs 1.69). The ICER was $19,359/QALY gained. Women with stage IV EOC had a higher mean adjusted treatment cost following PDS when compared to NACT ($31,869 vs $27,338) but yielded greater QALYs (1.69 vs 1.66). The ICER was $130,083/QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis showed that for both PDS and NACT the ICER was sensitive to incremental changes in the utility weight.

16375,Cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 Inhibitor Therapy in Patients With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,"IMPORTANCE: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors were recently approved for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and have potential for broad ASCVD prevention. Their long-term cost-effectiveness and effect on total health care spending are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors and their potential effect on US health care spending. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a simulation model of US adults aged 35 to 94 years, was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe in heterozygous FH or ASCVD. The model incorporated 2015 annual PCSK9 inhibitor costs of $14,350 (based on mean wholesale acquisition costs of evolocumab and alirocumab); adopted a health-system perspective, lifetime horizon; and included probabilistic sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty. EXPOSURES: Statin therapy compared with addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke), incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and total effect on US health care spending over 5 years. RESULTS: Adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins in heterozygous FH was estimated to prevent 316,300 MACE at a cost of $503,000 per QALY gained compared with adding ezetimibe to statins (80% uncertainty interval [UI], $493,000-$1,737,000). In ASCVD, adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins was estimated to prevent 4.3 million MACE compared with adding ezetimibe at $414,000 per QALY (80% UI, $277,000-$1,539,000). Reducing annual drug costs to $4536 per patient or less would be needed for PCSK9 inhibitors to be cost-effective at less than $100,000 per QALY. At 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in all eligible patients was estimated to reduce cardiovascular care costs by $29 billion over 5 years, but drug costs increased by an estimated $592 billion (a 38% increase over 2015 prescription drug expenditures). In contrast, initiating statins in these high-risk populations in all statin-tolerant individuals who are not currently using statins was estimated to save $12 billion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assuming 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in patients with heterozygous FH or ASCVD did not meet generally acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness thresholds and was estimated to increase US health care costs substantially.

16379,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Lisdexamfetamine Versus Atomoxetine in the Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Inadequate Response to Methylphenidate,"BACKGROUND: An economic analysis from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS) evaluated the cost effectiveness of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) compared with atomoxetine in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who have had an inadequate response to methylphenidate. METHODS: A 1-year decision-analytic model was constructed, with the health outcomes ""response"", ""nonresponse"", and ""unable to tolerate"". Clinical data were taken from a head-to-head, randomized controlled trial in inadequate responders to methylphenidate. Response to treatment was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement subscale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates owing to adverse events. Utility weights were identified via a systematic literature review. Healthcare resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. Daily drug costs were derived from British National Formulary 2012 costs and mean doses reported in the trial. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed. RESULTS: The comparison of LDX with atomoxetine resulted in an estimate of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound1802 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The result was robust in a wide range of sensitivity analyses; results were most sensitive to changes in drug costs and efficacy. In the PSA, assuming a maximum willingness to pay of pound20,000 per QALY, LDX versus atomoxetine had an 86 % probability of being cost effective. In 38 % of PSA runs, LDX was more effective and less costly than atomoxetine.

16380,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention with cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stents versus bare metal stents: Results from a patient level meta-analysis of randomized trials,"BACKGROUND: Second-generation drug eluting stents (DES) may reduce costs and improve clinical outcomes compared to first-generation DES with improved cost-effectiveness when compared to bare metal stents (BMS). We aimed to conduct an economic evaluation of a cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stent (Co-Cr EES) compared with BMS in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of a cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stent (Co-Cr EES) versus BMS in PCI. METHODS: A Markov state transition model with a 2-year time horizon was applied from a US Medicare setting with patients undergoing PCI with Co-Cr EES or BMS. Baseline characteristics, treatment effects, and safety measures were taken from a patient level meta-analysis of 5 RCTs (n = 4,896). The base-case analysis evaluated stent-related outcomes; a secondary analysis considered the broader set of outcomes reported in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The base-case and secondary analyses reported an additional 0.018 and 0.013 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost savings of $236 and $288, respectively with Co-Cr EES versus BMS. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses and were most sensitive to the price of clopidogrel. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Co-Cr EES was associated with a greater than 99% chance of being cost saving or cost effective (at a cost per QALY threshold of $50,000) versus BMS. CONCLUSIONS: Using data from a recent patient level meta-analysis and contemporary cost data, this analysis found that PCI with Co-Cr EES is more effective and less costly than PCI with BMS.

16381,Testing and Treating Women after Unsuccessful Conservative Treatments for Overactive Bladder or Mixed Urinary Incontinence: A Model-Based Economic Evaluation Based on the BUS Study,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of bladder ultrasonography, clinical history, and urodynamic testing in guiding treatment decisions in a secondary care setting for women failing first line conservative treatment for overactive bladder or urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. DESIGN: Model-based economic evaluation from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective using data from the Bladder Ultrasound Study (BUS) and secondary sources. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree and a 5-year time horizon based on the outcomes of cost per woman successfully treated and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and a value of information analysis are also undertaken. RESULTS: Bladder ultrasonography is more costly and less effective test-treat strategy than clinical history and urodynamics. Treatment on the basis of clinical history alone has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound491,100 per woman successfully treated and an ICER of pound60,200 per QALY compared with the treatment of all women on the basis of urodynamics. Restricting the use of urodynamics to women with a clinical history of mixed urinary incontinence only is the optimal test-treat strategy on cost-effectiveness grounds with ICERs of pound19,500 per woman successfully treated and pound12,700 per QALY compared with the treatment of all women based upon urodynamics. Conclusions remained robust to sensitivity analyses, but subject to large uncertainties. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment based upon urodynamics can be seen as a cost-effective strategy, and particularly when targeted at women with clinical history of mixed urinary incontinence only.

16389,Cost-Effectiveness of Dual Antimicrobial Therapy for Gonococcal Infections Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: In response to the rising threat of resistance to first-line antibiotics for gonorrhea, international guidelines recommend dual antimicrobial therapy. However, some countries continue to recommend monotherapy. We assess the cost-effectiveness of dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin compared with monotherapy with ceftriaxone, for control of gonorrhea among men who have sex with men in the Netherlands. METHODS: We developed a transmission model and calculated the numbers of new gonorrhea infections, consultations at health care specialists, tests, and antibiotic doses. With these numbers, we calculated costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) with each treatment; and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of dual therapy compared to monotherapy. The impact of gonorrhea on human immunodeficiency virus transmission was not included in the model. RESULTS: In the absence of initial resistance, dual therapy can delay the spread of ceftriaxone resistance by at least 15 years, compared to monotherapy. In the beginning, when there is no resistance, dual therapy results in high additional costs, without any QALY gains. When resistance spreads over time, the additional costs of dual therapy decline, the gained QALYs increase, the ICER drops off and, after 50 years, falls below &OV0556;20,000 per QALY gained. If azithromycin resistance is initially prevalent, resistance to the first-line treatment rises almost equally fast with both treatment strategies and the ICER remains extremely high. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ceftriaxone monotherapy, dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin can considerably delay the spread of ceftriaxone resistance, but may only be cost-effective in the long run and in the absence of initial resistance.",2016-01-22367,27513379,Sex Transm Dis,Maria Xiridou,2016,43 / 9,542-8,No,27513379,"Maria Xiridou; Anna Lugner; Henry J C de Vries; Jan E A M van Bergen; Hannelore M Gotz; Birgit H B van Benthem; Jacco Wallinga; Marianne A B van der Sande; Cost-Effectiveness of Dual Antimicrobial Therapy for Gonococcal Infections Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in the Netherlands, Sex Transm Dis, 2016 Sep; 43(9):0148-5717; 542-8",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ceftriaxone and azithromycin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Ceftriaxone,Baseline (no azithromycin resistance at the beginning) 60 year horizon,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,"60 Years, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years",4.00,1.50,14866,Euro,2012,21548.39

16391,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pemetrexed and gemcitabine treatment for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer in Turkey,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of the chemotherapy medications that contain gemcitabine and pemetrexed, which are used in the treatment of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study evaluated the effectiveness and cost of platinum-based pemetrexed and gemcitabine treatments as the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with the use of the Markov model, and from the perspective of the Social Security Institution. NSCLC costs calculated on the basis of experts' opinions and the effectiveness values calculated by administering the EQ-5D questionnaire to the patients were analyzed. All direct medical costs were included in the model. RESULTS: While the life-long cost of gemcitabine/cisplatin treatment was determined to be 10,347.45 Turkish lira per patient, it was determined as 17,783.34 for pemetrexed/cisplatin treatment. The incremental cost of pemetrexed/cisplatin treatment is 220,754 per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION: Although there is no official threshold value in Turkey, due to the fact that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio exceeds the threshold value calculated on the basis of GDP per capita, it is understood that pemetrexed/cisplatin is not cost-effective in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.",2016-01-22371,27511349,Turk J Med Sci,Pinar Yalcin Balcik,2016,46 / 1,152-8,No,27511349,"Pinar Yalcin Balcik; Bayram Sahin; Cost-effectiveness analysis of pemetrexed and gemcitabine treatment for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer in Turkey, Turk J Med Sci, 2016 Jan 05; 46(1):1300-0144; 152-8",QALY,Turkey,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pemetrexed/cisplatin vs. Gemcitabine/cisplatin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,220754,Turkey,2015,88950.82
16392,Economic Analysis of the Impact of Overseas and Domestic Treatment and Screening Options for Intestinal Helminth Infection among US-Bound Refugees from Asia,"BACKGROUND: Many U.S.-bound refugees travel from countries where intestinal parasites (hookworm, Trichuris trichuria, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis) are endemic. These infections are rare in the United States and may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading to potentially serious consequences. This evaluation examined the costs and benefits of combinations of overseas presumptive treatment of parasitic diseases vs. domestic screening/treating vs. no program. METHODS: An economic decision tree model terminating in Markov processes was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 U.S.-bound Asian refugees: 1) ""No Program,"" 2) U.S. ""Domestic Screening and Treatment,"" 3) ""Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin"" presumptive treatment, and 4) ""Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides"". Markov transition state models were used to estimate long-term effects of parasitic infections. Health outcome measures (four parasites) included outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The ""No Program"" option is the least expensive ($165,923 per cohort) and least effective option (145 outpatient cases, 4.0 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths discounted over a 60-year period for a one-year cohort). The ""Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin"" option ($418,824) is less expensive than ""Domestic Screening and Treatment"" ($3,832,572) or ""Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides"" ($2,182,483). According to the model outcomes, the most effective treatment option is ""Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin,"" which reduces outpatient cases, deaths and hospitalization by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458,718 per death averted, or $2,219/$24,036 per QALY/life year gained relative to ""No Program"". DISCUSSION: Overseas presumptive treatment for U.S.-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs.

16394,Economic Analysis of the Impact of Overseas and Domestic Treatment and Screening Options for Intestinal Helminth Infection among US-Bound Refugees from Asia,"BACKGROUND: Many U.S.-bound refugees travel from countries where intestinal parasites (hookworm, Trichuris trichuria, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis) are endemic. These infections are rare in the United States and may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading to potentially serious consequences. This evaluation examined the costs and benefits of combinations of overseas presumptive treatment of parasitic diseases vs. domestic screening/treating vs. no program. METHODS: An economic decision tree model terminating in Markov processes was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 U.S.-bound Asian refugees: 1) ""No Program,"" 2) U.S. ""Domestic Screening and Treatment,"" 3) ""Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin"" presumptive treatment, and 4) ""Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides"". Markov transition state models were used to estimate long-term effects of parasitic infections. Health outcome measures (four parasites) included outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The ""No Program"" option is the least expensive ($165,923 per cohort) and least effective option (145 outpatient cases, 4.0 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths discounted over a 60-year period for a one-year cohort). The ""Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin"" option ($418,824) is less expensive than ""Domestic Screening and Treatment"" ($3,832,572) or ""Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides"" ($2,182,483). According to the model outcomes, the most effective treatment option is ""Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin,"" which reduces outpatient cases, deaths and hospitalization by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458,718 per death averted, or $2,219/$24,036 per QALY/life year gained relative to ""No Program"".

16395,Cost-effectiveness of neurostimulation in Parkinson's disease with early motor complications,"BACKGROUND: Recent research efforts have focused on the effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) for selected patients with mild-to-moderate PD experiencing motor complications. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the cost utility of subthalamic DBS compared with the best medical treatment for German patients below the age of 61 with early motor complications of PD. METHODS: We applied a previously published Markov model that integrated health utilities based on EuroQoL and direct costs over patients'' lifetime adjusted to the German health care payer perspective (year of costing: 2013). Effectiveness was evaluated using the Parkinson''s Disease Questionnaire 39 summary index. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-utility ratio for STN DBS compared to best medical treatment was 22,700 Euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. The time to, and costs for, battery exchange had a major effect on the incremental cost-utility ratios, but never exceeded a threshold of 50,000 Euros per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS: Our decision analysis supports the fact that STN DBS at earlier stages of the disease is cost-effective in patients below the age of 61 when compared with the best medical treatment in the German health care system. This finding was supported by detailed sensitivity analyses reporting robust results. Whereas the EARLYSTIM study has shown STN DBS to be superior to medical therapy with respect to quality of life for patients with early motor complications, this further analysis has shown its cost-effectiveness.

Given trastuzumab''s high cost, we aimed to estimate its cost-effectiveness by heterogeneity in age and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, which has previously been unexplored, to assist prioritisation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov macro-simulation model, with a lifetime horizon, comparing a 12-mo regimen of trastuzumab with chemotherapy alone using the latest (2014) effectiveness measures from landmark randomised trials. A New Zealand (NZ) health system perspective was adopted, employing high-quality national administrative data. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years for trastuzumab versus chemotherapy alone are two times higher (2.33 times for the age group 50-54 y; 95% CI 2.29-2.37) for the worst prognosis (ER-/PR-) subtype compared to the best prognosis (ER+/PR+) subtype, causing incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the former to be less than half those of the latter for the age groups from 25-29 to 90-94 y (0.44 times for the age group 50-54 y; 95% CI 0.43-0.45). If we were to strictly apply an arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold equal to the NZ gross domestic product per capita (2011 purchasing power parity [PPP]-adjusted: US$30,300; euro23,700; pound21,200), our study suggests that trastuzumab (2011 PPP-adjusted US$45,400/euro35,900/ pound21,900 for 1 y at formulary prices) may not be cost-effective for ER+ (which are 61% of all) node-positive HER2+ early breast cancer patients but cost-effective for ER-/PR- subtypes (37% of all cases) to age 69 y. Market entry of trastuzumab biosimilars will likely reduce the ICER to below this threshold for premenopausal ER+/PR- cancer but not for ER+/PR+ cancer. Sensitivity analysis using the best-case effectiveness measure for ER+ cancer had the same result. A key limitation was a lack of treatment-effect data by hormone receptor subtype. Heterogeneity was restricted to age and hormone receptor status; tumour size/grade heterogeneity could be explored in future work. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how cost-effectiveness can vary greatly by heterogeneity in age and hormone receptor subtype.
