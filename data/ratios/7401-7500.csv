7401,Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk North Americans: an economic evaluation,"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) fulfills the World Health Organization criteria for mass screening, but screening uptake is low in most countries. CRC screening is resource intensive, and it is unclear if an optimal strategy exists. The objective of this study was to perform an economic evaluation of CRC screening in average risk North American individuals considering all relevant screening modalities and current CRC treatment costs. Methods and findings: An incremental cost-utility analysis using a Markov model was performed comparing guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) annually, fecal DNA every 3 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy or computed tomographic colonography every 5 years, and colonoscopy every 10 years. All strategies were also compared to a no screening natural history arm. Given that different FIT assays and collection methods have been previously tested, three distinct FIT testing strategies were considered, on the basis of studies that have reported ""low,"" ""mid,"" and ""high"" test performance characteristics for detecting adenomas and CRC. Adenoma and CRC prevalence rates were based on a recent systematic review whereas screening adherence, test performance, and CRC treatment costs were based on publicly available data. The outcome measures included lifetime costs, number of cancers, cancer-related deaths, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and incremental cost-utility ratios. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed. Annual FIT, assuming mid-range testing characteristics, was more effective and less costly compared to all strategies (including no screening) except FIT-high. Among the lifetimes of 100,000 average-risk patients, the number of cancers could be reduced from 4,857 to 1,393 [corrected] and the number of CRC deaths from 1,782 [corrected] to 457, while saving CAN$68 per person. Although screening patients with FIT became more expensive than a strategy of no screening when the test performance of FIT was reduced, or the cost of managing CRC was lowered (e.g., for jurisdictions that do not fund expensive biologic chemotherapeutic regimens), CRC screening with FIT remained economically attractive. Conclusions: CRC screening with FIT reduces the risk of CRC and CRC-related deaths, and lowers health care costs in comparison to no screening and to other existing screening strategies. Health policy decision makers should consider prioritizing funding for CRC screening using FIT.",2010-01-06974,21124887,PLoS Med,SJ Heitman,2010,7 / 11,e1000370,No,21124887,"SJ Heitman; Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk North Americans: an economic evaluation, PLoS Med, 2010; 7(11):1549-1676; e1000370",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,No Screening vs. Mid performance fecal immunochemical tests (FIT),Not Stated,64 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-1511.11,Canada,2008,-1715.04

7405,Effect of integrated care for sick listed patients with chronic low back pain: economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial,"Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness, cost utility, and cost-benefit of an integrated care programme compared with usual care for sick listed patients with chronic low back pain. Design: Economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial with 12 months' follow-up. Setting: Primary care (10 physiotherapy practices, one occupational health service, one occupational therapy practice) and secondary care (five hospitals) in the Netherlands, 2005-9. Participants: 134 adults aged 18-65 sick listed because of chronic low back pain: 66 were randomised to integrated care and 68 to usual care. Interventions: Integrated care consisted of a workplace intervention based on participatory ergonomics, with involvement of a supervisor, and a graded activity programme based on cognitive behavioural principles. Usual care was provided by general practitioners and occupational physicians according to Dutch guidelines. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was duration until sustainable return to work. The secondary outcome was quality adjusted life years (QALYs), measured using EuroQol. Results: Total costs in the integrated care group (£13 165, SD £13 600) were significantly lower than in the usual care group (£18 475, SD £13 616). Cost effectiveness planes and acceptability curves showed that integrated care was cost effective compared with usual care for return to work and QALYs gained. The cost-benefit analyses showed that every £1 invested in integrated care would return an estimated £26. The net societal benefit of integrated care compared with usual care was £5744. Conclusions: Implementation of an integrated care programme for patients sick listed with chronic low back pain has a large potential to significantly reduce societal costs, increase effectiveness of care, improve quality of life, and improve function on a broad scale. Integrated care therefore has large gains for patients and society as well as for employers.",2010-01-06979,21118874,BMJ,LC Lambeek,2010,341 /,c6414,No,21118874,"LC Lambeek; Doug Coyle; Effect of integrated care for sick listed patients with chronic low back pain: economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial, BMJ, 2010; 341():0959-8138; c6414",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Integrated care programme vs. Usual care,Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-59000,United Kingdom,2007,-147438.62
7406,Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with asymptomatic to mild heart failure: insights from the European cohort of the REVERSE (Resynchronization Reverses remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction),"Aims To assess the cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) compared with optimal medical therapy in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) II heart failure (HF) or NYHA I with previous HF symptoms. Methods and results A proportion in state model with Monte Carlo simulation was developed to assess the costs, life years and quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) associated with CRT-ON and -OFF over a 10 year time period. Data from 262 patients in the European cohort of the REVERSE clinical trial (QRS = 120 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction = 40%, CRT-ON, n = 180, CRT-OFF, n = 82) were used to model all-cause mortality, change in NYHA class and resource use. EQ-5D preference weights were taken from a previous cost-effectiveness model of CRT and unit costs from national UK databases. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% p.a. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Compared with CRT-OFF, 0.94 life years or 0.80 QALYs were gained in the CRT ON group at an additional cost of €11 455, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €14.278 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. At a threshold of €33 000 (£30 000) per QALY gained, the probability that CRT is cost-effective is 79.6%. Cardiac resynchronization therapy becomes cost effective after ~4.5 years. Cardiac resynchronization therapy needs only to demonstrate a modest impact on all cause mortality (hazard ratio = 0.82) in order to demonstrate cost-effectiveness. The results are robust to changes in all other parameters. Conclusion Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a cost-effective intervention for patients with mildly symptomatic HF and for asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction and previous HF symptoms.",2010-01-06985,21112898,Eur Heart J,Cecilia Linde,2010,/,,No,21112898,"Cecilia Linde; Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with asymptomatic to mild heart failure: insights from the European cohort of the REVERSE (Resynchronization Reverses remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction), Eur Heart J, 2010-Nov-25; ():0195-668X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiac resynchronization in addition to optimal medical therapy vs. Optimal medical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,14278,Euro,2008,25273.94
7407,Cost-effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy and therapeutically designed meals for older adults with cardiovascular disease,"Background: Many older adults experience hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but there is little information about whether medical nutrition therapy (MNT) or therapeutic meals have independent or joint beneficial effects on older adults with these diagnoses. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of MNT and therapeutic meals for older adults with hyperlipidemia and/or hypertension. Design: A 1-year prospective four-arm controlled randomized community-based clinical trial. Subjects/setting: Participants were people ages 60 years or older residing in community settings who were medically diagnosed with either hypertension or hyperlipidemia. They were recruited through a number of venues beginning in May 2003. Intervention: The 321 eligible individuals were assigned to one of four arms: (a) a literature control group, (b) a therapeutic meal group that received seven diagnosis-appropriate therapeutic meals a week, (c) an MNT group, and (d) an MNT-plus-therapeutic meal group. Main outcome measure: The outcome measure was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs included both intervention and medical costs. Statistical analyses: Estimations of separate models of costs and QALYs facilitated the construction of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Net benefit analysis produced the probability that each intervention was cost-effective given different values for society's willingness to pay for a QALY. Results: Therapeutic meals are cost-effective. Using the net benefit approach and a willingness to pay of $109,000 per QALY, the probability that the therapeutic meal delivery program is cost-effective is 95% and for MNT the probability is 90%. However, the combination of MNT and therapeutic meals did not have an independent significant effect on QALYs. Conclusions: Results inform the debate about extending Medicare funding for MNT to individuals with hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

7410,A generally applicable cost-effectiveness model for the evaluation of vaccines against cervical cancer,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at evaluating the cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus virus (HPV) vaccination in France, using a generally applicable succinct cohort model. METHODS: A lifetime Markov cohort model, adapted to the French setting, simulate the natural history of oncogenic HPV infection towards cervical cancer (CC). Additional modules account for the effects of screening and vaccination. The girls' cohort is vaccinated at age 12 and follows current screening. Costs and outcomes (discounted at 3 and 1.5%, respectively) were compared with a cohort receiving screening alone. RESULTS: The model results agreed well with real-life data. Vaccination in addition to screening would substantially reduce the incidence of and mortality from CC, compared with screening alone, at an estimated cost-effectiveness of <euro>9,706 per quality-adjusted-life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that the discount rate and the parameters related to the disease history have the largest impact on the results. CONCLUSION: This succinct cohort model indicated that HPV vaccination would be a cost-effective policy option in France. It uses readily available data and should be generally applicable to the evaluation of HPV vaccination in a variety of countries and settings.",2010-01-06990,21110060,Int J Public Health,Nadia Demarteau,2010,/,,No,21110060,"Nadia Demarteau; A generally applicable cost-effectiveness model for the evaluation of vaccines against cervical cancer, Int J Public Health, 2010-Nov-26; ():1661-8556",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,HPV 16/18 vaccine plus screening vs. Screening only,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,9706,Euro,2007,16610.9
7411,An economic analysis of usual care and acupuncture collaborative treatment on chronic low back pain: A Markov model decision analysis,"Background: The collaborative treatment of acupuncture in addition to routine care as an approach for the management of low back pain (LBP) is receiving increasing recognition from both public and professional arenas. In 2010, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Family Affairs (MOHW) of South Korea approved the practice of doctors and Oriental medical doctors (acupuncture qualified) working together in the same facility and offering collaborative treatment at the same time for the same disease. However, there is little more than anecdotal evidence on the health and economic implications of this current practice. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness and costs of acupuncture in addition to routine care in the treatment of chronic LBP patients in South Korea. Methods: The Markov model was developed to synthesise evidence on both costs and outcomes for patients with chronic LBP. We conducted the base case analysis, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and also performed the value of information analysis for future researches. Model parameters were sourced from systematic review of both alternatives, simple bibliographic reviews of relevant articles published in English or Korean, and statistical analyses of the 2005 and 2007 Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey (KNHNS) data. The analyses were based on the societal perspective over a five year time horizon using a 5% discount rate. Results: In the base case, collaborative treatment resulted in better outcomes, but at a relatively high cost. Overall, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a collaborative practice was 3,421,394 KRW (Korean rate Won) per QALY (Quality adjusted life year) (2,895.80 USD per QALY). Univariate sensitivity analysis of indirect non-medical costs did not affect the preference order of the strategies. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that if the threshold was over 3,260,000 KRW per QALY (2,759.20 USD per QALY), the probability for cost-effectiveness of a collaborative practice would exceed 50%. At 20,000,000 KRW per QALY, which is recommended using per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as the threshold, the probability would be 72.3%. Conclusions: On the basis of our findings, acupuncture collaborative therapy for patients with chronic LBP may be cost-effective if the usual threshold is applied. Further empirical studies are required to overcome the limitations of uncertainties and improve the precision of the results.",2010-01-06996,21106108,BMC Complement Altern Med,N Kim,2010,10 /,74,No,21106108,"N Kim; An economic analysis of usual care and acupuncture collaborative treatment on chronic low back pain: A Markov model decision analysis, BMC Complement Altern Med, 2010; 10():1472-6882; 74",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Usual care and acupuncture collaboration vs. Usual care,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,3421394,South Korea,2009,3256.86

Methods: this study adopts a perspective of Department of Health in cost-effectiveness analysis to compare a no-screening strategy with nine different screening strategies. These strategies comprise three screening tools (Pap smear alone, HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage, and HPV DNA testing combined with Pap smear), and three screening intervals (annually, every 3 years, and every 5 years). Outcomes are life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. Results: when three times gross domestic product per capita is used as the decision threshold, all nine screening strategies were cost-effective compared with the no-screening strategy. Compared with the current screening strategy (an annual Pap smear), HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage every 5 years and every 3 years were cost-effective. Results of PSA also indicated that a HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage every 5 or every 3 years achieved the highest expected net benefits.

Methods: this study adopts a perspective of Department of Health in cost-effectiveness analysis to compare a no-screening strategy with nine different screening strategies. These strategies comprise three screening tools (Pap smear alone, HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage, and HPV DNA testing combined with Pap smear), and three screening intervals (annually, every 3 years, and every 5 years).

The objective of this study was to predict the long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of maraviroc in treatment-experienced adults with HIV/AIDS in Mexico. Methods: The AntiRetroviral Analysis by Monte Carlo Individual Simulation (ARAMIS) model was adapted to the Mexican context to predict clinical and economic outcomes of treating with optimized background therapy (OBT) versus testing for viral tropism status and treating with OBT ± maraviroc accordingly in treatment-experienced adults in Mexico. Baseline characteristics and efficacy were from the MOTIVATE trials' screening cohort. Costs and population mortality data were specific to Mexico. Results were reported from the perspective of health care payers in 2008 Mexican pesos (converted to 2008 US$ in parentheses). Results: Compared to treatment with OBT alone, treatment with OBT ± maraviroc contingent on tropism test result increased projected undiscounted life expectancy and discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy from 7.54 to 8.71 years and 4.42 to 4.92 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, at an incremental cost of $228,215 (US$21,329).

7438,To Supplement or Not to Supplement: A Cost-Utility Analysis of Calcium and Vitamin D Repletion in Patients After Thyroidectomy,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative hypocalcemia is the most common complication after thyroidectomy; prevention and treatment remain areas of ongoing debate. The purpose of this study was to determine the incremental cost utility of routine versus selective calcium and vitamin D supplementation after total or completion thyroidectomy. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov decision model was performed for a hypothetical cohort of adult patients after thyroidectomy. Routine or selective supplementation of oral calcium carbonate, vitamin D (calcitriol), and intravenous calcium gluconate, when required, was used. Selective supplementation was determined by serum intact parathyroid hormone levels. The incremental cost utility, measured in U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), was calculated. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the cost of routine supplementation was $102 versus $164 for selective supplementation. Patients in the routine arm gained 0.002 QALYs compared to patients in the selective arm (0.95936 QALYs vs. 0.95725 QALYs). At the population level, this translates into a savings of $29,365/QALY (95% confidence interval, -$66,650 to -$1,772) for routine supplementation. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to the utility of the hypocalcemic state, postoperative rates of hypocalcemia, and cost of serum parathyroid hormone testing. CONCLUSIONS: Routine oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation in patients after thyroidectomy seems to be less expensive and results in higher patient utility than selective supplementation.

7439,Pharmacoeconomic evaluation of tiotropium bromide in the long-term treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Italy,"The randomized, double-blind trial UPLIFT(®) demonstrated in 5,993 patients with moderate to very severe COPD that 4 years of tiotropium bromide therapy were associated with improvements in lung function, exacerbations, quality of life, and mortality compared with placebo. The pharmacoeconomic evaluation was performed through a probabilistic, patient-level simulation Markov model. Routine COPD care (RC) was compared with the inclusion of tiotropium bromide on it. The analysis was conducted over a lifetime horizon, with 1 year cycles and a 3.5% annual discount rate. Patients were characterized by gender, age, height, smoking status, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). FEV1 time trend was modeled according to the annual decline recorded in UPLIFT®. Mortality derived from that of the general Italian population was adjusted by smoking status and FEV1. Health utilities derived from published Italian observational studies and were varied in time according to UPLIFT® data. Exacerbation rates were derived from a published Italian observational prospective study. The cost perspective was that of the Italian National Health Service.

7443,The cost utility of autologous chondrocytes implantation using ChondroCelect® in symptomatic knee cartilage lesions in Belgium,"Background: Knee cartilage lesions increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis (OA), and may eventually result in a total knee replacement (TKR). There is currently no consensus on the optimal treatment of cartilage lesions. ChondroCelect® (CC) is a cell-based therapy approved for use in autologous chondrocytes implantation (ACI) to treat symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle. Its capacity to safely restore good-quality cartilage was demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) versus the surgical procedure microfracture (MFX). Objective: This study investigated the cost utility of CC used in ACI compared with MFX to treat symptomatic knee cartilage lesions in Belgium. Methods: A decision tree model comparing CC with MFX over a 40-year horizon was developed in TreeAge Pro™. The key timepoints of the model were (i) clinical assessment 5 years after initial intervention (success or no success, with or without re-operation); (ii) development of OA at 15 years (yes/no); (iii) need for TKR at 20 years (yes/no); and (iv) need for prosthesis revision at 35 years (yes/no). Clinical data provided by the RCT of CC versus MFX were the clinical success (response) rate based on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 36 months (82.9% vs 62.0%; p = 0.048) and the proportion of good structural repair/presence of hyaline cartilage based on International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS II) visual item at 12 months (44.9% vs 23.2%; p = 0.023). Utility scores by surgery outcome were derived from the SF-36 questionnaire responses collected in the RCT. Conservative assumptions related to the incidences of OA, TKR and prosthesis revision relied on a literature search. A patient chart review (n = 82) provided follow-up costs by surgery outcome. National tariffs were applied to direct medical resources used (healthcare payer perspective, year 2008 costs). Annual discounting was applied to costs (3%) and effects (1.5%) as recommended by the Belgian pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Results: The incremental cost per QALY gained for CC compared with MFX was €16,229, with a difference in costs of €20,802 and 1.282 QALYs gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the key model drivers were the proportion of patients with hyaline cartilage and the correlation between hyaline cartilage formation and later avoidance of OA. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed robustness of the results, with 80% of the simulations below the usual UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) threshold of €22,000 per QALY. Conclusions: Assuming a good correlation between high-quality cartilage repair and avoidance of OA at a later stage, the benefits of the cell therapy CC over MFX in terms of QALYs gained and OA-related costs avoided appear real. Further research is required to explore long-term effects of cartilage repair and reduce uncertainty on quality of life of patients with OA before and after joint replacement.",2010-01-07022,21080737,Pharmacoeconomics,L Gerlier,2010,28 / 12,1129-46,Yes,21080737,"L Gerlier; The cost utility of autologous chondrocytes implantation using ChondroCelect® in symptomatic knee cartilage lesions in Belgium, Pharmacoeconomics, 2010-Dec-01; 28(12):1179-2027; 1129-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous characterized cell therapy (ChondroCelect CC) vs. Surgical procedure microfracture (MFX),Not Stated,49 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,1.50,16229,Euro,2008,28727.47

METHODS:: After surgery, 86 patients were randomized to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation group (n = 44) or a conventional orthopedic care group (n = 42). Alongside the randomized controlled trial we estimated the costs of rehabilitation, healthcare resource use, and community support. Information about resource use was collected by means of a questionnaire together with data from hospital records. The primary outcome (effectiveness) measure was change in self-reported functional capacity and the secondary measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained during the 12-month follow-up. Cost-effectiveness (CE) was assessed from between-group differences in costs, change in functional capacity, and QALYs gained. RESULTS:: Both protocols of providing rehabilitation services turned out to be equally effective, but the conventional orthopedic care protocol was unequivocally cost-saving: the saving was €1,830 per patient (95% CI -548 - 3623) using the available direct cost data. CONCLUSIONS:: Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for unselected osteoarthritis patients in the subacute period of recovery after TKA is not a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

7445,"Outcomes and costs associated with PHiD-CV, a new protein D conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, in four countries","This study estimated the impact of routine vaccination of infants with a new 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) on health outcomes and costs across the entire population in Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Norway. A compartmental, static model with a 1-year time period for a steady-state population that allowed for the incorporation of direct and indirect (i.e., herd immunity and serotype replacement) vaccine effects across all age groups was used. Cases of disease prevented, deaths prevented, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and incremental costs in the steady-state year were calculated for PHiD-CV compared with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7). A short-term analysis was also conducted to estimate the incremental difference in disease and cost outcomes for the two vaccines within the first 10 years. All costs were in 2008 local currency. In all four countries, the model estimated that PHiD-CV prevented more cases of disease, prevented more deaths, and resulted in more life-years and quality-adjusted life-years compared with PCV-7 in both the short term and the steady-state year. Assuming price parity for the vaccines, the model projected that routine vaccination with PHiD-CV resulted in lower costs compared with PCV-7 in both the short term and the steady-state year.

7446,Economic assessment of cardiac resynchronization therapy,"Introduction and objectives: Cardiac resynchronization devices have been shown to be effective in treating heart failure. They reduce overall mortality, heart failure mortality and hospitalizations due to heart failure. The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with that of optimal drug therapy (ODT) by carrying out an economic assessment in the Spanish healthcare setting. Methods: An existing model was adapted for use in the Spanish healthcare setting. The effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy was determined from published systematic reviews. The costs of the various interventions were determined using a range of Spanish data sources. The model adopted the perspective of the public health system and the time horizon considered was the remainder of the patient's life. The outcome variables were life-years gained and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Results: Overall, ODT, CRT and CRT with a defibrillator resulted in gains of 2.11, 2.8 and 3.19 QALYs, respectively, at a cost of €11,722, €31,629 and €52,592, respectively. Consequently, each QALY gained with CRT relative to ODT involved the consumption of €28,612 of additional resources. Similarly, the use of CRT with a defibrillator cost an additional €53,547 per QALY relative to CRT without a defibrillator.

7448,Prolonged prophylaxis with valganciclovir is cost effective in reducing posttransplant cytomegalovirus disease within the United States,"Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in transplant patients is known to have a substantial clinical and economic burden, and its prevention is expected to have long-term benefits. Evidence from the Improved Protection Against CMV in Transplant trial proved that prolonged prophylaxis of 200 days with valganciclovir compared with 100 days significantly reduces the incidence of CMV in high-risk kidney transplant seropositive donors/seronegative recipients. The aim of this study was to develop a cost-effectiveness model to evaluate prolonged prophylaxis of 200 days with valganciclovir and its long-term economic impact. Methods: An economic model was designed to simulate long-term costs and outcomes of prolonged prophylaxis with valganciclovir (200 vs. 100 days) in a cohort of 10,000 high-risk renal transplant patients over 5 and 10 years. The first year of the model was based on the results of the Improved Protection Against CMV in Transplant trial and the extension to the long-term periods (5 and 10 years); and quality of life data were based on evidence retrieved through a systematic literature search. This analysis was conducted from the US healthcare payer perspective. Results: For the 5-year time horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US $14,859/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) suggests that 200-day valganciclovir prophylaxis is cost effective over the 100-day regimen considering a threshold of US $50,000/QALY. The 10-year analysis revealed the 200-day prophylaxis as cost saving with a 2380 QALY gain and simultaneously lower cost.

Design: Cost utility analysis of screening with estimated glomerular filtration rate alone compared with no screening (with allowance for incidental finding of cases of chronic kidney disease). Analyses were stratified by age, diabetes, and the presence or absence of proteinuria. Scenario and sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis, were performed. Costs were estimated in all adults and in subgroups defined by age, diabetes, and hypertension. Setting: Publicly funded Canadian healthcare system. Participants: Large population based laboratory cohort used to estimate mortality rates and incidence of end stage renal disease for patients with chronic kidney disease over a five year follow-up period. Patients had not previously undergone assessment of glomerular filtration rate. Main outcome measures: Lifetime costs, end stage renal disease, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost per QALY gained. Results: Compared with no screening, population based screening for chronic kidney disease was associated with an incremental cost of $C463 (Canadian dollars in 2009; equivalent to about £275, €308, US $382) and a gain of 0.0044 QALYs per patient overall, representing a cost per QALY gained of $C104 900.

7459,Cost effectiveness of disc prosthesis versus lumbar fusion in patients with chronic low back pain: randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up,"This randomized controlled health economic study assesses the cost-effectiveness of the concept of total disc replacement (TDR) (Charité/Prodisc/Maverick) when compared with the concept of instrumented lumbar fusion (FUS) [posterior lumbar fusion (PLF) /posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF)]. Social and healthcare perspectives after 2 years are reported. In all, 152 patients were randomized to either TDR (n = 80) or lumbar FUS (n = 72). Cost to society (total mean cost/patient, Swedish kronor = SEK, standard deviation) for TDR was SEK 599,560 (400,272), and for lumbar FUS SEK 685,919 (422,903) (ns). The difference was not significant: SEK 86,359 (-45,605 to 214,332). TDR was significantly less costly from a healthcare perspective, SEK 22,996 (1,202 to 43,055). Number of days on sick leave among those who returned to work was 185 (146) in the TDR group, and 252 (189) in the FUS group (ns). Using EQ-5D, the total gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over 2 years was 0.41 units for TDR and 0.40 units for FUS (ns). Based on EQ-5D, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of using TDR instead of FUS was difficult to analyze due to the ""non-difference"" in treatment outcome, which is why cost/QALY was not meaningful to define. Using cost-effectiveness probabilistic analysis, the net benefit (with CI) was found to be SEK 91,359 (-73,643 to 249,114) (ns). We used the currency of 2006 where 1 EURO = 9.26 SEK and 1 USD = 7.38 SEK. It was not possible to state whether TDR or FUS is more cost-effective after 2 years.

7460,Cost-effectiveness of hybrid PET/CT for staging of non-small cell lung cancer,"Although the diagnostic effectiveness of integrated PET/CT for staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has already been proven, it remains to be determined if tumor staging with combined metabolic and anatomic imaging is also cost-effective. The objective of this study was to evaluate from a payers' perspective the cost-effectiveness of staging NSCLC with CT alone (representing the mainstay diagnostic test) and with integrated PET/CT. Methods: The study is based on 172 NSCLC patients from a prospective clinical study who underwent diagnostic, contrast-enhanced helical CT and integrated PET/CT. Imaging was performed at the University Hospital Ulm between May 2002 and December 2004. To calculate treatment costs, we differentiated among cost for diagnosis, cost for nonsurgical treatment according to the clinical diagnosis, and cost for surgical procedures according to the clinical tumor stage. Results: The diagnostic effectiveness in terms of correct TNM staging was 40% (31/77) for CT alone and 60% (46/77) for PET/CT. For the assessment of resectability (tumor stages Ia-IIIa vs. IIIb-IV), 65 of 77 patients (84%) were staged correctly by PET/CT (CT alone, 70% [54/77]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per correctly staged patient were $3,508 for PET/CT versus CT alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life year gained were $79,878 for PET/CT vs. CT alone, decreasing to $69,563 assuming a reduced loss of utility (0.10 quality-adjusted life years) due to surgical morbidity. Conclusion: Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that costs for PET/CT are within the commonly accepted range for diagnostic tests or therapies.

High-risk populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM) might especially benefit from vaccination. I aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of MSM in the USA. Methods: I constructed decision-analytic models to estimate the direct health and economic outcomes of HPV vaccination (against types 6, 11, 16, and 18) for prevention of HPV-related anal cancer and genital warts. The model parameters that were varied were age at vaccination (12 years, 20 years, and 26 years), previous exposure to vaccine-targeted HPV types, and prevalence of HIV-1. I used the models to conduct sensitivity analyses, including duration of vaccine protection, vaccine cost, and burden of anal cancer and genital warts. Findings: In a scenario of HPV vaccination of MSM at 12 years of age without previous exposure to HPV, compared with no vaccination, vaccination cost US$15,290 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In scenarios where MSM are vaccinated at 20 years or 26 years of age, after exposure to HPV infections, the cost-effectiveness ratios worsened, but were less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year under most scenarios. For example, HPV vaccination of MSM at 26 years cost $37,830 per quality-adjusted life-year when previous exposure to all vaccine-targeted HPV types was assumed to be 50%.

7464,A UK-based cost-utility analysis of radiofrequency ablation or oesophagectomy for the management of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus,"Background: In the UK, oesophagectomy is the current recommendation for patients with persistent high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus. Radiofrequency ablation is an alternative new technology with promising early trial results. Aim: To undertake a cost-utility analysis comparing these two strategies. Methods: We constructed a Markov model to simulate the natural history of a cohort of patients with high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus undergoing one of two treatment options: (i) oesophagectomy or (ii) radiofrequency ablation followed by endoscopic surveillance with oesophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia recurrence or persistence. Results: In the base case analysis, radiofrequency ablation dominated as it generated 0.4 extra quality of life years at a cost saving of £1902. For oesophagectomy to be the most cost-effective option, it required a radiofrequency ablation treatment failure rate (high-grade dysplasia persistence or progression to cancer) of >44%, or an annual risk of high-grade dysplasia recurrence or progression to cancer in the ablated oesophagus of >15% per annum. There was an 85% probability that radiofrequency ablation remained cost-effective at the NICE willingness to pay threshold range of £20 000-30 000.

7465,"Surveillance after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness","Objective: To estimate outcomes and costs of surveillance strategies after treatment for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Methods: A hypothetical cohort of women was evaluated after treatment for CIN 2 or 3 using a Markov model incorporating data from a large study of women treated for CIN, systematic reviews of test accuracy, and individual preferences. Surveillance strategies included initial conventional or liquid-based cytology, human papillomavirus testing, or colposcopy 6 months after treatment, followed by annual or triennial cytology. Estimated outcomes included CIN, cervical cancer, cervical cancer deaths, life expectancy, costs, cost per life-year, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year. Results: Conventional cytology at 6 and 12 months, followed by triennial cytology, was least costly. Compared with triennial cytology, annual cytology follow-up reduced expected cervical cancer deaths by 73% to 77% and had an average incremental cost per life-year gained of $69,000 to $81,000. For colposcopy followed by annual cytology, the incremental cost per life-year gained ranged from $70,000 to more than $1 million, depending on risk. Between-strategy differences in mean additional life expectancy per woman were less than 4 days; differences in mean incremental costs per woman were as high as $822. In the cost-utility analysis, colposcopy at 6 months followed by annual cytology had an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of less than $5,500. Human papillomavirus testing or liquid-based cytology added little to no improvement to life-expectancy with higher costs. Conclusion: Annual conventional cytology surveillance reduced cervical cancers and cancer deaths compared with triennial cytology.

7473,"Cost effectiveness of imiquimod 5% cream compared with methyl aminolevulinate-based photodynamic therapy in the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic (solar) keratoses: a decision tree model","Background: Actinic keratosis (AK) is caused by chronic exposure to UV radiation (sunlight). First-line treatments are cryosurgery, topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and topical diclofenac. Where these are contraindicated or less appropriate, alternatives are imiquimod and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of imiquimod and methyl aminolevulinate-based PDT (MAL-PDT) from the perspective of the UK NHS. Methods: A decision tree model was populated with data from a literature review and used to estimate costs and QALYs gained and incremental cost effectiveness over 1 year. The model simulated patients who were in secondary care, who had four to nine AK lesions, and for whom cryosurgery, 5-FU and diclofenac were contraindicated or considered less appropriate. Results: Over 1 year, imiquimod cost £174 less than MAL-PDT (year 2006 values) but resulted in 0.005 fewer QALYs gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MAL-PDT over imiquimod was £34,576. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a 75% probability that imiquimod was cost effective compared with MAL-PDT at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained, falling to 73% at £30,000. Conclusions: Imiquimod may be the more cost-effective treatment at conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds.

7474,Economic evaluation of cinacalcet in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in Italy,"Background: Imbalanced levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorous (P) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and fracture in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet can attenuate the mineral and hormonal imbalances characteristic of SHPT and may improve outcomes in such patients. Here we describe a cost-utility analysis of cinacalcet for SHPT in dialysis patients in Italy. Methods: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to simulate the effect of cinacalcet on Ca, P and PTH levels in dialysis patients with SHPT, based on data from a European, multicentre, open-label study. The model then correlated these levels with mortality and morbidity (CV events, fractures and parathyroidectomies) using data from the literature, and incorporated Italian data for dialysis, drugs and management of events according to the national cost structure. The simulation horizon was patient lifetime; simulated treatment alternatives were standard treatment (mainly vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders) and cinacalcet + standard treatment. A 3.5% discount rate was applied to life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALE), costs and times below the upper ranges (time in range [TiR]) recommended by the National Kidney Foundation - Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality initiative for PTH, Ca, P and Ca × P. Utilities were derived from the published literature and took into account dialysis and the impairment of quality of life due to the occurrence of CV events and fractures. Costs were evaluated in year 2009 values from the perspective of the Italian National Healthcare System. Results: Baseline results were calculated with 10,000 iterations. Compared with standard treatment alone, addition of cinacalcet was associated with a mean (SD) increase in TiR of 5.26 (6.59), 3.63 (6.87), 1.70 (6.66) and 2.68 (5.55) discounted patient-years for PTH, Ca and P, respectively, and combined PTH, Ca, P and Ca × P. Cinacalcet increased LE by 1.20 (3.75) life-years (LYs) and QALE by 0.89 (2.59) QALYs.

7475,Economic evaluation of cinacalcet in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in Italy,"Background: Imbalanced levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorous (P) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and fracture in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet can attenuate the mineral and hormonal imbalances characteristic of SHPT and may improve outcomes in such patients. Here we describe a cost-utility analysis of cinacalcet for SHPT in dialysis patients in Italy. Methods: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to simulate the effect of cinacalcet on Ca, P and PTH levels in dialysis patients with SHPT, based on data from a European, multicentre, open-label study. The model then correlated these levels with mortality and morbidity (CV events, fractures and parathyroidectomies) using data from the literature, and incorporated Italian data for dialysis, drugs and management of events according to the national cost structure. The simulation horizon was patient lifetime; simulated treatment alternatives were standard treatment (mainly vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders) and cinacalcet + standard treatment. A 3.5% discount rate was applied to life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALE), costs and times below the upper ranges (time in range [TiR]) recommended by the National Kidney Foundation - Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality initiative for PTH, Ca, P and Ca × P. Utilities were derived from the published literature and took into account dialysis and the impairment of quality of life due to the occurrence of CV events and fractures. Costs were evaluated in year 2009 values from the perspective of the Italian National Healthcare System. Results: Baseline results were calculated with 10,000 iterations. Compared with standard treatment alone, addition of cinacalcet was associated with a mean (SD) increase in TiR of 5.26 (6.59), 3.63 (6.87), 1.70 (6.66) and 2.68 (5.55) discounted patient-years for PTH, Ca and P, respectively, and combined PTH, Ca, P and Ca × P. Cinacalcet increased LE by 1.20 (3.75) life-years (LYs) and QALE by 0.89 (2.59) QALYs. When including the cost for dialysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was €50,012 per LY and €67,361 per QALY, while, if dialysis costs were not included, the ICER was €23,473 per LY and €31,616 per QALY.

7476,The economic effect of screening orthopedic surgery patients preoperatively for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,"Background and objective: Patients undergoing orthopedic surgery are susceptible to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, which can result in increased morbidity, hospital lengths of stay, and medical costs. We sought to estimate the economic value of routine preoperative MRSA screening and decolonization of orthopedic surgery patients. Methods: A stochastic decision-analytic computer simulation model was used to evaluate the economic value of implementing this strategy (compared with no preoperative screening or decolonization) among orthopedic surgery patients from both the third-party payer and hospital perspectives. Sensitivity analyses explored the effects of varying MRSA colonization prevalence, the cost of screening and decolonization, and the probability of decolonization success. Results: Preoperative MRSA screening and decolonization was strongly cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than $6,000 per quality-adjusted life year) from the third-party payer perspective even when MRSA prevalence was as low as 1%, decolonization success was as low as 25%, and decolonization costs were as high as $300 per patient. In most scenarios this strategy was economically dominant (ie, less costly and more effective than no screening). From the hospital perspective, preoperative MRSA screening and decolonization was the economically dominant strategy for all scenarios explored. Conclusions: Routine preoperative screening and decolonization of orthopedic surgery patients may under many circumstances save hospitals and third-party payers money while providing health benefits.",2010-01-07074,20923285,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Bruce Y Lee,2010,31 / 11,1130-8,No,20923285,"Bruce Y Lee; The economic effect of screening orthopedic surgery patients preoperatively for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol, 2010-Nov; 31(11):0899-823X; 1130-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening and decolonization preoperatively for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) vs. None,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,3626,United States,2009,4374.3

7498,Cost effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a UK evaluation using discrete-event simulation,"Recommendations in the UK suggest restricting treatment of Alzheimer's disease with cholinesterase inhibitors, on cost-effectiveness grounds, to patients with moderate cognitive decline. As the economic analyses that informed these recommendations have been the subject of debate, we sought to address the potential limitations of existing models and produce estimates of donepezil treatment cost effectiveness in the UK using the most recent available data and simulation techniques. A discrete-event simulation was developed that predicts progression of Alzheimer's disease through correlated changes in cognition, behavioural disturbance and function. Patient-level data from seven randomized, placebo-controlled donepezil trials and a 7-year follow-up registry provided the basis for modeling longitudinal outcomes. Individuals in the simulation were assigned unique demographic and clinical characteristics and then followed for 10 years, with severity of disease tracked on continuous scales. Patient mix and costs were developed from UK-specific literature. Analyses were run for severity subgroups to evaluate outcomes for sub-populations with disease of mild versus moderate severity from both a healthcare payer and societal perspective. All costs are reported in pound, year 2007 values, and all outcomes are discounted at 3.5% per annum. Over 10 years, treatment of all patients with mild to moderate disease reduces overall direct medical costs by an average of over pound2300 per patient. When unpaid caregiver time is also taken into consideration, savings increase to over pound4700 per patient. Compared with untreated patients, patients receiving donepezil experience a discounted gain in QALYs averaging 0.11, with their caregivers gaining, on average, 0.01 QALYs. For the subset of patients starting treatment with more severe disease, savings are more modest, averaging about pound1600 and pound3750 from healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, donepezil dominated no treatment between 57% and 62% of replications when only medical costs were considered, and between 74% and 79% of replications when indirect costs were included, with results more favourable for treatment initiation in the mild versus moderate severity stages of the disease. Although the simulation results are not definitive, they suggest that donepezil leads to health benefits and cost savings when used to treat mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease in the UK.

Over 10 years, treatment of all patients with mild to moderate disease reduces overall direct medical costs by an average of over pound2300 per patient. When unpaid caregiver time is also taken into consideration, savings increase to over pound4700 per patient. Compared with untreated patients, patients receiving donepezil experience a discounted gain in QALYs averaging 0.11, with their caregivers gaining, on average, 0.01 QALYs. For the subset of patients starting treatment with more severe disease, savings are more modest, averaging about pound1600 and pound3750 from healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, donepezil dominated no treatment between 57% and 62% of replications when only medical costs were considered, and between 74% and 79% of replications when indirect costs were included, with results more favourable for treatment initiation in the mild versus moderate severity stages of the disease. Although the simulation results are not definitive, they suggest that donepezil leads to health benefits and cost savings when used to treat mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease in the UK. They also indicate that both benefits and savings may be greatest when treatment is started while patients are still in the mild stages of Alzheimer's disease.",2010-01-11786,20402542,Pharmacoeconomics,Denis Getsios,2010,28 / 5,411-27,Yes,20402542,"Denis Getsios; Steve Blume; K Jack Ishak; Grant D H Maclaine; Cost effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a UK evaluation using discrete-event simulation, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 28(5):1179-2027; 411-27",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Donepezil (10mg) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,-34550.46,United Kingdom,2007,-86340.21
