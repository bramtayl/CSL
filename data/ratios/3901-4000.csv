3901,"Cost effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets compared with atazanavir plus ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced patients in the UK, France, Italy and Spain","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Selection of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for antiretroviral-experienced patients should involve balancing multiple factors, including clinical efficacy, adverse-event risk, resistance concerns, cost effectiveness and expected budget impact. The efficacy of a regimen and its durability, as demonstrated in controlled clinical trials, must be considered in the light of short- and long-term economic impacts on the healthcare system. These impacts may vary based on drug costs, costs of reported adverse effects, the regimen's likelihood of contributing to viral resistance to second-line therapies and the marginal cost differences between other healthcare resources used over a patient's lifetime. Risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) may be of concern in the selection of ART, because differences in CHD risk factors have been reported for different regimens, and heart disease is both a deadly and costly condition. This study set out to estimate the long-term combined effects of HIV disease and antiretroviral-related risk for CHD on quality-adjusted survival and healthcare costs for antiretroviral-experienced patients in the UK, Spain, Italy and France. METHODS: A previously validated Markov model was updated with 2006 cost estimates for each of the four countries and supplemented with the Framingham CHD risk equation. In the model, the average patient was male, aged 37 years, with a baseline 10-year CHD risk of 4.6%. Patients started with either lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV+RTV) as the protease inhibitor (PI). Clinical trial results, local drug costs and AIDS and CHD cost estimates were used to estimate the differences between these two therapies. RESULTS: There was a significant advantage using LPV/r over ATV+RTV, which varied depending on the country's cost structure and assumptions related to drug efficacy. There was a comparative benefit for experienced patients in quality-adjusted life-months (QALM) of 4.6 (the net gain after subtracting quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] lost owing to CHD risk). In addition, there were 5- and 10-year overall cost savings of between euro947 and euro6594 per patient after 5 years, and an impact ranging from a cost increase of euro308 (for France) to a cost saving of euro7388 (for Spain) at year 10. The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from dominant for Spain to euro11 856/QALY for Italy. CONCLUSION: LPV/r was a highly cost-effective regimen relative to ATV+RTV for the treatment of HIV for each of the four countries examined in this study. The effect of LPV/r on long-term CHD risk was minimal compared with the increased risk of AIDS/death projected for a less efficacious PI-based regimen. The cost of lipid-lowering drugs and treatment for CHD was insignificant compared with the overall cost savings from LPV/r therapy. The choice of regimen for antiretroviral-experienced patients should be based on a regimen's expected efficacy and durability for countries with similar cost structure to those examined here.",2007-01-02963,18020538,Clin Drug Investig,Kit N Simpson,2007,27 / 12,807-17,Yes,18020538,"Kit N Simpson; Walter J Jones; Rukmini Rajagopalan; Birgitta Dietz; Cost effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets compared with atazanavir plus ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced patients in the UK, France, Italy and Spain, Clin Drug Investig, 2007; 27(12):1173-2563; 807-17",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tablets of lopinavir/ritonavir vs. Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,3034,Euro,2006,4893.26

3906,"Surgical strategies for faecal incontinence - a decision analysis between dynamic graciloplasty, artificial bowel sphincter and end stoma","Background Artificial bowel sphincter (ABS) and dynamic graciloplasty (DG) are surgical treatments for faecal incontinence (FI). FI may affect quality of life (QOL) so severely that patients are often willing to consider a permanent end stoma (ES). It is unclear which is the more cost-effective strategy. Method Probability estimates for patients with FI were obtained from published data (ABS, n = 319; DG, n = 301), supplemented by expert opinion. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from each strategy. Factors considered were the risk of failure of the primary and redo operation and the consequent risk of permanent stoma. Results were assessed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results Over the 5-year time horizon, ES gave a QALY gain of 3.45 for pound16 280, giving an ICER of pound4719/QALY. ABS produced a gain of 4.38 QALYs for pound23 569, giving an ICER of pound5387/QALY. DG produced a gain of 4.00 QALYs for pound25 035, giving an ICER of pound6257/QALY. With the willingness-to-pay threshold set at pound30 000/QALY, ES was the most cost-effective intervention. The ABS was most cost-effective after 10 years.

Aggregate health gains from switching to universal vaccination are modest (10-30 QALYs per year). However, a ""9+9"" strategy that replaces two doses of monovalent hepatitis B (HB) vaccine at 9/10 years (universally administered in most provinces) with two doses of bivalent HA/HB vaccine is cost-saving from the societal perspective. At a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, mean net benefit is +49.4 QALYs (S.D. 12.6) from the societal perspective and +3.8 QALYS (S.D. 3.0) from the payer perspective for the ""9+9"" strategy. Net benefit from the payer perspective is sensitive to the marginal cost of HA/HB vaccine relative to HB vaccine.

3912,The cost-effectiveness of improving diabetes care in U.S. federally qualified community health centers,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of improving diabetes care with the Health Disparities Collaborative (HDC), a national collaborative quality improvement (QI) program conducted in community health centers (HCs). DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data regarding the impact of the Diabetes HDC program came from a serial cross-sectional follow-up study (1998, 2000, 2002) of the program in 17 Midwestern HCs. Data inputs for the simulation model of diabetes came from the latest clinical trials and epidemiological studies. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a societal cost-effectiveness analysis, incorporating data from QI program evaluation into a Monte Carlo simulation model of diabetes. Data COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data on diabetes care processes and risk factor levels were extracted from medical charts of randomly selected patients. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From 1998 to 2002, multiple processes of care (e.g., glycosylated hemoglobin testing [HbA1C] [71-->92 percent] and ACE inhibitor prescribing [33-->55 percent]) and risk factor levels (e.g., 1998 mean HbA1C 8.53 percent, mean difference 0.45 percent [95 percent confidence intervals -0.72, -0.17]) improved significantly. With these improvements, the HDC was estimated to reduce the lifetime incidence of blindness (17-->15 percent), end-stage renal disease (18-->15 percent), and coronary artery disease (28-->24 percent). The average improvement in quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was 0.35 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $33,386/QALY.

3917,The value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in the diagnosis and management of angina and myocardial infarction: a probabilistic economic analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death in the United Kingdom, accounting for more than 120,000 deaths in 2001, among the highest rates in the world. This study reports an economic evaluation of single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT) for the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Strategies involving SPECT with and without stress electrocardiography (ECG) and coronary angiography (CA) were compared to diagnostic strategies not involving SPECT. The diagnosis decision was modeled with a decision tree model and long-term costs and consequences using a Markov model. Data to populate the models were obtained from a series of systematic reviews. Unlike earlier evaluations, a probabilistic analysis was included to assess the statistical imprecision of the results. The results are presented in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: At prevalence levels of CAD of 10.5%, SPECT-based strategies are cost-effective; ECG-CA is highly unlikely to be optimal. At a ceiling ratio of Pound 20,000 per QALY, SPECT-CA has a 90% likelihood of being optimal. Beyond this threshold, this strategy becomes less likely to be cost-effective. At more than Pound 75,000 per QALY, coronary angiography is most likely to be optimal. For higher levels of prevalence (around 50%) and more than a Pound 10,000 per QALY threshold, coronary angiography is the optimal decision. CONCLUSIONS: SPECT-based strategies are likely to be cost-effective when risk of CAD is modest (10.5%). Sensitivity analyses show these strategies dominated non-SPECT-based strategies for risk of CAD up to 4%. At higher levels of prevalence, invasive strategies may become worthwhile.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential value of zoster vaccine for society and payers. DESIGN, SETTING AND POPULATION: An age-specific decision analytic model was designed to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with HZ, PHN and other HZ-related complications for vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts aged >or=60 years. Clinical trial data, published literature and other primary studies were used to inform the model. Robustness of results to key model parameters was explored through a series of one-way, multivariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Both societal and payer perspectives were considered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: For a representative cohort of 1,000,000 U.S. vaccine recipients aged >or=60 years, use of the zoster vaccine was projected to eliminate 75,548-88,928HZ cases and over 20,000 PHN cases. Over 300,000 outpatient visits, 375,000 prescriptions, 9,700 ER visits and 10,000 hospitalizations were projected to be eliminated with the vaccine translating into savings of US$ 82 million to US$ 103 million in healthcare costs associated with the diagnosis and treatment of HZ, PHN and other HZ-related complications. Cost-effectiveness ratios range from US$ 16,229 to US$ 27,609 per QALY gained, depending on the input data source and analytic perspective. Results were most sensitive to PHN costs, duration of vaccine efficacy, vaccine efficacy against PHN and HZ, QALY loss associated with pain states and complication costs.

Over 300,000 outpatient visits, 375,000 prescriptions, 9,700 ER visits and 10,000 hospitalizations were projected to be eliminated with the vaccine translating into savings of US$ 82 million to US$ 103 million in healthcare costs associated with the diagnosis and treatment of HZ, PHN and other HZ-related complications. Cost-effectiveness ratios range from US$ 16,229 to US$ 27,609 per QALY gained, depending on the input data source and analytic perspective. Results were most sensitive to PHN costs, duration of vaccine efficacy, vaccine efficacy against PHN and HZ, QALY loss associated with pain states and complication costs. CONCLUSIONS: The zoster vaccine at a price of US$ 150 is likely to be cost-effective for a cohort of immunocompetent U.S. vaccine recipients aged >or=60 years using commonly cited thresholds for judging cost-effectiveness.

3923,Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness in the United States of a vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in older adults,"CONTEXT: A live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and the morbidity associated with incident HZ and its sequelae, has recently been approved for use in the United States (U.S.). OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential value of zoster vaccine for society and payers. DESIGN, SETTING AND POPULATION: An age-specific decision analytic model was designed to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with HZ, PHN and other HZ-related complications for vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts aged >or=60 years. Clinical trial data, published literature and other primary studies were used to inform the model. Robustness of results to key model parameters was explored through a series of one-way, multivariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Both societal and payer perspectives were considered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: For a representative cohort of 1,000,000 U.S. vaccine recipients aged >or=60 years, use of the zoster vaccine was projected to eliminate 75,548-88,928HZ cases and over 20,000 PHN cases.

METHODS: We did an 18-month cost-effectiveness analysis of the Basel Stent KostenEffektivitäts Trial (BASKET), which randomised 826 patients 2:1 to drug-eluting stents (n=545) or to bare-metal stents (281). We used non-parametric bootstrap techniques to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of drug-eluting versus bare-metal stents, to compare low-risk (> or =3.0 mm stents in native vessels; n=558, 68%) and high-risk patients (<3.0 mm stents/bypass graft stenting; n=268, 32%), and to do sensitivity analyses by altering costs and event rates in the whole study sample and in predefined subgroups. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed by EQ-5D questionnaire (available in 703/826 patients). FINDINGS: Overall costs were higher for patients with drug-eluting stents than in those with bare-metal stents (11,808 euros [SD 400] per patient with drug-eluting stents and 10,450 euros [592] per patient with bare-metal stents, mean difference 1358 euros [717], p<0.0001), due to higher stent costs. We calculated an ICER of 64,732 euros to prevent one major adverse cardiac event, and of 40,467 euros per QALY gained. Stent costs, number of events, and QALYs affected ICERs most, but unrealistic alterations would have been required to achieve acceptable cost-effectiveness. In low-risk patients, the probability of drug-eluting stents achieving an arbitrary ICER of 10,000 euros or less to prevent one major adverse cardiac event was 0.016; by contrast, it was 0.874 in high-risk patients.

3927,Cost-effectiveness of conventional and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: results of a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Two randomized trials have shown similar mid-term outcomes for survival and quality of life after endovascular and conventional open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). With reduced hospital and intensive care stay, endovascular repair has been hypothesized to be more efficient than open repair. The Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM) trial was undertaken to assess the balance of costs and effects of endovascular vs open aneurysm repair. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing endovascular repair with open repair in 351 patients with an AAA and studied costs, cost-effectiveness, and clinical outcome 1 year after surgery. In addition to clinical outcome, costs and quality of life were recorded up to 1 year in 170 patients in the endovascular repair group and in 170 in the open repair group. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for cost per life-year, event-free life-year, and quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Uncertainty regarding these outcomes was assessed using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Patients in the endovascular repair group experienced 0.72 QALY vs 0.73 in the open repair group (absolute difference, 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.038 to 0.058). Endovascular repair was associated with additional euro 4293 direct costs (euro 18,179 vs euro 13.886; 95% CI, euro 2,770 to euro 5,830). Most of the bootstrap estimates indicated that endovascular repair resulted in slightly longer overall and event-free survival associated with respective incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro76,100 and euro 171,500 per year gained. Open repair appeared the dominant strategy in costs per QALY. CONCLUSION: Presently, routine use of endovascular repair in patients also eligible for open repair does not result in a QALY gain at 1 year postoperatively, provides only a marginal overall survival benefit, and is associated with a substantial, if not prohibitive, increase in costs.",2007-01-02987,17980274,J Vasc Surg,Monique Prinssen,2007,46 / 5,883-890,No,17980274,"Monique Prinssen; Erik Buskens; Sjors E de Jong; Jacob Buth; Albert J Mackaay; Marc R van Sambeek; Marc R Sambeek; Jan D Blankensteijn; Cost-effectiveness of conventional and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: results of a randomized trial, J Vasc Surg, 2007-Nov; 46(5):0741-5214; 883-890",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular repair vs. Open surgical repair,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-429300,Euro,2003,-683587.71
3928,A Value-Based Medicine Analysis of Ranibizumab for the Treatment of Subfoveal Neovascular Macular Degeneration,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the conferred value and average cost-utility (cost-effectiveness) for intravitreal ranibizumab used to treat occult/minimally classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Value-based medicine cost-utility analysis. PARTICIPANTS: MARINA (Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD) Study patients utilizing published primary data. METHODS: Reference case, third-party insurer perspective, cost-utility analysis using 2006 United States dollars. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Conferred value in the forms of (1) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and (2) percent improvement in health-related quality of life. Cost-utility is expressed in terms of dollars expended per QALY gained. All outcomes are discounted at a 3% annual rate, as recommended by the Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Data are presented for the second-eye model, first-eye model, and combined model. RESULTS: Twenty-two intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab administered over a 2-year period confer 1.039 QALYs, or a 15.8% improvement in quality of life for the 12-year period of the second-eye model reference case of occult/minimally classic age-related subfoveal choroidal neovascularization. The reference case treatment cost is $52652, and the cost-utility for the second-eye model is $50691/QALY.

3931,The cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted navigation in total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty is one of the most clinically successful and cost-effective interventions in medicine. However, implant malalignment, especially in the coronal plane, is a common cause of early failure following total knee arthroplasty. Computer-assisted surgery has been employed during total knee arthroplasty to improve the precision of component alignment. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted surgery to determine whether the improved alignment achieved with computer navigation provides a sufficient decrease in failure rates and revisions to justify the added cost. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted surgery in total knee arthroplasty. Model inputs, including costs, effectiveness, and clinical outcome probabilities, were obtained from a review of the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of component-alignment precision with use of computer-assisted and mechanical alignment guides, total knee arthroplasty failure rates secondary to malalignment, and costs of computer-assisted surgery systems on the cost-effectiveness of computer navigation in total knee arthroplasty. RESULTS: Computer-assisted surgery is both more effective and more expensive than mechanical alignment systems. Given an additional cost of $1500 per operation, a 14% improvement in coronal alignment precision (within 3 degrees of neutral mechanical axis), and an elevenfold increase in revision rates at fifteen years with coronal malalignment (54% compared with 4.7%), the incremental cost of using computer-assisted surgery is $45,554 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-savings is achieved if the added cost of computer-assisted surgery is $629 or less per operation. Variability in published clinical outcomes, however, introduces uncertainty in determining the cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-assisted surgery is potentially a cost-effective or cost-saving addition to total knee arthroplasty. However, the cost-effectiveness is sensitive to variability in the costs of computer navigation systems, the accuracy of alignment achieved with computer navigation, and the probability of revision total knee arthroplasty with malalignment.",2007-01-02989,17974880,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Erik J Novak,2007,89 / 11,2389-97,No,17974880,"Erik J Novak; Marc D Silverstein; Kevin J Bozic; The cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted navigation in total knee arthroplasty, J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2007-Nov; 89(11):0021-9355; 2389-97",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Total knee arthroplasty with use of computer-assisted surgical navigation vs. Total knee arthroplasty with use of traditional mechanical alignment guides,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,45554,United States,2006,58481.53
3932,Economic evaluation of etoricoxib versus non-selective NSAIDs in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in the UK,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of etoricoxib, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor, versus non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of etoricoxib versus nsNSAIDs was evaluated from the UK National Health Service (NHS) and society perspective with a decision-analytic model. Patients stayed on initial therapy throughout 52 weeks unless they experienced an adverse event (AE) or lacked efficacy, in which case they switched to another nsNSAID or a tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist. Efficacy data were obtained from a 1-year etoricoxib clinical trial in AS. Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI) data were translated into Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) weights using a published data on the relation between BASFI and Short-form (SF) 36 Quality of life scores, as well as the relation between SF-36 and utility. Safety data were based on meta-analyses of etoricoxib trials. Information on treatment pathways, resource consumption, and absenteeism from work was obtained from literature and experts. Model outcomes included QALYs, perforations, ulcers, or bleeds, cardiovascular events, and costs. RESULTS: Etoricoxib was cost-effective compared to nsNSAIDs in terms of cost per QALY saved ( pound5611). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found a 77% probability of the incremental cost per QALY saved being within a threshold for cost-effectiveness of pound20 000. The expected direct costs over the 52-week period were pound1.23 (95% uncertainty distribution pound1.10; pound1.39) and pound1.13 per day ( pound0.78; pound1.55) for patients starting with etoricoxib and nsNSAIDs, respectively.

3933,Economic evaluation of etoricoxib versus non-selective NSAIDs in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in the UK,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of etoricoxib, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor, versus non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of etoricoxib versus nsNSAIDs was evaluated from the UK National Health Service (NHS) and society perspective with a decision-analytic model. Patients stayed on initial therapy throughout 52 weeks unless they experienced an adverse event (AE) or lacked efficacy, in which case they switched to another nsNSAID or a tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist. Efficacy data were obtained from a 1-year etoricoxib clinical trial in AS. Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI) data were translated into Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) weights using a published data on the relation between BASFI and Short-form (SF) 36 Quality of life scores, as well as the relation between SF-36 and utility. Safety data were based on meta-analyses of etoricoxib trials. Information on treatment pathways, resource consumption, and absenteeism from work was obtained from literature and experts. Model outcomes included QALYs, perforations, ulcers, or bleeds, cardiovascular events, and costs. RESULTS: Etoricoxib was cost-effective compared to nsNSAIDs in terms of cost per QALY saved ( pound5611). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found a 77% probability of the incremental cost per QALY saved being within a threshold for cost-effectiveness of pound20 000.

3934,Life expectancy gains and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter/defibrillators for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a devastating complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The optimal strategy for the primary prevention of SCD in HCM remains controversial. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we compared the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of 3 strategies for the primary prevention of SCD: implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) insertion, amiodarone therapy, or no therapy. We modeled hypothetical cohorts of 45-year-old patients with HCM with no history of cardiac arrest but at significant risk of SCD (3%/y). RESULTS: Over a lifetime, compared with no therapy, ICD therapy increased quality-adjusted survival by 4.7 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an additional cost of $142,800 ($30,000 per QALY), whereas amiodarone increased quality-adjusted survival by 2.8 QALYs at an additional cost of $104,900 ($37,300 per QALY). Compared with no therapy, ICD therapy would cost < $50,000 per QALY for patients (i) aged 25, with > or = 1 risk factors for SCD, and (ii) aged 45 or 65, with > or = 2 risk factors for SCD.

3940,Cost-effectiveness analysis of aprepitant in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in Belgium,"OBJECTIVES: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains a major adverse effect of cancer chemotherapy which may increase morbidity, reduce quality of life and threaten the success of cancer therapy. Aprepitant is effective in preventing CINV, achieving higher complete response (no emesis and no rescue therapy) compared to standard prevention, in patients receiving either highly (HEC) or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC; absolute reduction = 11 and 13%, respectively). We assessed the cost effectiveness of aprepitant-based vs standard prevention in these indications in Belgium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytical model was developed in MS Excel (Fig. 1). To estimate resource use, two approaches were used. The first is based on the preventive regimens applied in randomized controlled trials comparing aprepitant-based CINV prevention (for HEC: aprepitant days 1-3, ondansetron 32 mg i.v. day 1, oral placebo twice daily days 2-4, oral dexamethasone days 1-4; for MEC: aprepitant days 1-3, ondansetron 16 mg p.o. day 1, placebo on days 2-3, oral dexamethasone day 1), vs a standard regimen (for HEC: oral placebo days 1-3, ondansetron 32 mg i.v. day 1 and 16 mg p.o. days 2-4, oral dexamethasone days 1-4; for MEC: oral placebo, ondansetron 16 mg p.o. days 1-3, dexamethasone day 1) The second analysis is based on current real-world resource use in the Belgian setting in the prevention of CINV using a longitudinal Hospital Database. CINV-specific utility values were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Drug costs were obtained from official reimbursement listings. Treatment costs for CINV were obtained from a German study and adapted to Belgium. RESULTS: The aprepitant-based regimen is associated with 0.003 and 0.014 more QALYs in HEC and MEC, respectively and with per patient savings of <euro>66.84 (trial based) and <euro>74.62 (real-life based) for HEC and <euro>17.95 (trial based) and <euro>21.70 (real-life based) for MEC. Hence, aprepitant is both more effective and less expensive (=dominant). One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on treatment cost of emesis, the clinical benefit of aprepitant and the cost of ondansetron and showed that the results were robust on the first two parameters but sensitive on the decrease in cost of ondansetron for the moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.

3944,Modeling the impact of genetic screening technologies on healthcare: theoretical model for asthma in children,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on the potential impact of genetic screening technologies on healthcare. Genetic screening for asthma in children was chosen as a case study to explore the cost effectiveness of applying early genetic screening to infants, and preventive treatment to the population at risk. Early intervention could prevent progression and facilitate clinical management of the disease. From the elite group of genetic markers that have been associated with asthma-related phenotypes, ADAM33 was the first published candidate gene detected by a positional cloning approach, marking the entry of asthma research into the genomic era. The model was, therefore, initially set for an ex ante analysis of the cost effectiveness of applying the preventive program to an infant population at risk, i.e. infants presenting wheezing episodes during the first year of life, and the ADAM33 ST+7 genetic marker, with the idea of expanding to further markers and their combinations lat a later date. METHODS: In accordance with the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, four categories of asthma were considered. A Markov model was constructed, consisting of six mutually exclusive disease states (including healthy and dead states) with a simulation horizon of 100 years and a cycle length of 1 year. We define a scenario where early genetic screening was applied to infants presenting wheezing episodes during the first year of life and a preventive treatment to those children within this group who tested positive for selected ADAM33 polymorphism (ST+7). The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the third-party payer and patient perspective after year 6. We applied our model to a hypothetical cohort of 100 European infants. RESULTS: The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained during the 6 years was 1.483, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained was euro 10,100/QALY. A sensitivity analysis was carried out that varied the discount rate and cost of genetic testing, and considered two different transition matrices for the preventive program. Three main conclusions were drawn from the sensitivity analysis. Firstly, if the discount rate for both cost and health outcomes is increased by 2%, the cost effectiveness of the preventive program does not vary significantly. Discounting costs and benefits at 5%, the preventive program appears cost effective (euro 11,100/QALY). Secondly, if the cost of genetic testing is increased to euro 100, the cost effectiveness of the preventive program remains within the limits of cost effectiveness. Thirdly, the cost of genetic screening, together with transition probabilities between health states, will determine the cost effectiveness of applying a preventive program based on genetic information. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive treatment based on an early genetic screening of those children who present wheezing episodes during the first year of life, with treatment applied to those who test positive for the asthma-associated genetic marker ADAM33 ST+7, is theoretically cost effective. The model is a valuable tool for the ex ante assessment of the cost effectiveness of preventive schemes based on genetic screening.

3945,Cost effectiveness of entecavir versus lamivudine with adefovir salvage in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of treatment of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with entecavir compared with lamivudine with adefovir salvage, based primarily on the results of a recent 2-year, randomised, multicentre, clinical trial (n = 709). Previous economic analyses have been limited by the lack of comparative clinical data for entecavir and lamivudine beyond 1-year duration and for salvage therapy. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model from a US-payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon. The hypothetical cohort was 35-year-old patients with HBeAg-positive CHB. We evaluated 2 years of treatment with entecavir 0.5mg/day versus lamivudine 100mg/day, plus addition of adefovir 10mg/day for patients who developed virologic breakthrough due to resistance to either drug. In a scenario analysis, we considered adefovir plus lamivudine combination therapy for treatment-naive patients. Clinical and economic inputs ($US, year 2006 values) were derived from publicly available data, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: The estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of cirrhosis for patients initiated on entecavir was 2.3% lower than for those on lamivudine (20.5% vs 22.8%). The discounted incremental cost per QALY gained was $US7600 in the base-case analysis, and the 95% central range from probabilistic sensitivity analysis was $US2500-$US19 100. Combination therapy for treatment-naive patients led to an increase in costs without improvement in patient outcomes compared with entecavir monotherapy.

3946,Strategies for the management of suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare but serious complication of heparin therapy. The diagnosis of HIT is difficult because its signs are non-specific and the heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody test used to confirm the diagnosis is imprecise. Drugs used to treat HIT are costly and may carry an increased risk of bleeding. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness, from a societal perspective, of four treatment approaches for patients with suspected HIT within a US critical care setting. METHODS: A decision-tree was constructed for the management of a hypothetical cohort of critical care patients with possible evidence of HIT.The management strategies were: (i) no antibody testing, continue heparin (No Test and Wait); (ii) antibody testing, continue heparin while test results pending (Test and Wait); (iii) antibody testing and switch to a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) while test results pending (Test and Switch); and (iv) no antibody testing but switch to a DTI (No Test and Switch). We used argatroban as the DTI in our analysis.The outcomes were direct medical costs ($US; 2004 values), QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Assuming an HIT prevalence of 3%, relative to less costly strategies, ordering an antibody test and switching patients to argatroban if the result was positive (Test and Wait) had an ICER of $US163 396/QALY. Pre-emptive switching to argatroban without antibody testing (No Test and Switch) was the most effective strategy but had an ICER of >$US1 million/QALY relative to the Test and Switch option. These results were highly sensitive to HIT prevalence among patients presenting with thrombocytopenia.Assuming a willingness to pay of $US50 000 per QALY, the Test and Wait strategy became cost effective when the prior probability of HIT was 8%. At a prior probability of 12%, Test and Switch was cost effective, and at probabilities of HIT in the 60-75% range, No Test and Switch was cost effective. In two-way analysis, the probability of developing a thrombotic event was a key driver of treatment choice at specific HIT probabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for HIT in all typical critical care patients with thrombocytopenia is unlikely to represent a cost-effective management strategy.

3949,Intense cardiac troponin surveillance for long-term benefits is cost-effective in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic surgery: a decision analysis model,"BACKGROUND: Strategies to limit adverse cardiac events after vascular surgery continue to evolve. Early recognition and treatment of myocardial ischemia may be a key to improving postoperative survival rates. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) screening is an effective means of surveillance for postoperative myocardial ischemic injury and has long-term prognostic value. METHODS: We designed a Markov-based decision analysis model to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine surveillance with cTnI on postoperative Days 0, 1, 2, and 3, with an aim to institute tight heart rate control (60-65 bpm) with close monitoring and coronary care in the intensive care unit for 5 days in patients with cTnI >1.5 ng/mL. The key input variables obtained from published literature were as follows: probability of myocardial infarction, 0.049; cost of cTnI surveillance, $357; cost and efficacy of interventions, $13,145 and 0.55, respectively. The time horizon was lifetime and the target population being individuals aged 65 yr (median) undergoing elective open abdominal aortic surgery. The perspective for analysis was third-party payer. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for cTnI surveillance was $12,641 per quality-adjusted life year compared with standard care without cTnI surveillance. During one-way sensitivity analysis, probability of myocardial infarction and efficacy of interventions were found to influence the cost-effectiveness. Multivariate sensitivity analysis with second-order Monte Carlo simulation revealed that cTnI surveillance was favored in 90.75% of simulations at a commonly used threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year.

3950,The cost-effectiveness of etanercept and infliximab for the treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists have been shown to improve the outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). We assess the cost-effectiveness of two TNF antagonists and so-called 'palliative care' for the treatment of active PsA from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: Bayesian statistical methods were used to synthesize evidence from three Phase III trials, identified through a systematic review, and estimate the relative efficacy of etanercept, infliximab and palliative care. A probabilistic decision analytic model was then used to compare these treatments after the failure of at least two conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), following the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) guidelines for use. The primary outcome measure, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), was derived from utility values estimated as a function of disability measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The deterioration experienced in HAQ at treatment withdrawal (rebound) was incorporated using alternative scenarios to represent best- and worst-case assumptions. The model was extended beyond the trial duration to a 10-yr and lifetime horizon, using available evidence and expert opinion-based assumptions on disease progression. Resource utilization was based on literature, national databases and expert opinion. Prices were obtained from routine NHS sources and published literature. RESULTS: At a 10-yr time horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etanercept compared with palliative care was pound sterling26 361 per QALY gained for the best-case rebound scenario, which increased to pound sterling30 628 for the worst-case. The ICERs for infliximab compared with etanercept were pound sterling165 363 and pound sterling205 345 per QALY, respectively. These findings are mainly explained by the fact that infliximab has higher acquisition and administration costs without substantially superior effectiveness compared with etanercept. Results were sensitive to estimates of rebound assumptions at withdrawal and the time horizon.

3954,Cost-effectiveness of memantine compared with standard care in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer disease in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the addition of memantine to standard care (that is, without acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) with standard care alone in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer disease (AD) in Canada. METHODS: A 2-year Markov model estimated clinical effects in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and time in complete dependence as well as societal costs in four 6-month cycles. Health states were defined by AD severity assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (moderate = 10 to 19; severe < 10), by level of dependence in activities of daily living, and by death. Transition probabilities were estimated by combining data of patients with moderate-to-severe AD from all relevant clinical trials. QALYs were estimated from a UK epidemiologic study. The initial distribution and use of medical and support services for each health state was obtained from the Canadian Study on Health and Aging with current estimates of frequency of use and unit prices applied. RESULTS: Compared with standard care, the memantine strategy saved more than 1 month of complete dependence and produced 0.03 additional QALYs, with no additional cost. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses give an 83.3% chance that memantine treatment is cost-neutral, an 89.5% chance of its being cost-effective if the decision maker is willing to pay $20 000 for a QALY, and a 96.2% chance with a willingness to pay $100 000 per QALY. Robustness of results was confirmed through 1-way and scenario-based sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation found that memantine monotherapy produced relevant health benefit, compared with standard care alone, with no additional costs.

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. SETTING: Eighteen UK NHS hospital trusts. POPULATION OR SAMPLE Women who underwent UAE (n= 649; average follow up of 8.6 years) or hysterectomy (n= 459; average follow up of 4.6 years) for the treatments of symptomatic fibroids. METHODS: A probabilistic decision model was carried out based on data from a large comparative cohort and the literature. The two interventions were evaluated over the time horizon from the initial procedure to menopause. Extensive sensitivity analysis was carried out to test model assumptions and parameter uncertainties. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of procedures and complications and quality of life expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Overall, UAE was associated with lower mean cost (2536 pounds sterling versus 3282 pounds sterling) and a small reduction in quality of life (8.203 versus 8.241 QALYs) when compared with hysterectomy. However, when the quality of life associated with the conservation of the uterus was incorporated in the model, UAE was shown to be the dominant strategy--lower costs and greater QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: UAE is a less expensive option to the health service compared with hysterectomy, even when the costs of repeat procedures and associated complications are factored in. The quality of life implications in the short term are also predicted to favour UAE; however, this advantage may be eroded over time as women undergo additional procedures to deal with recurrent fibroids.

This is the first prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of FHTO and conventional ward procedures for standardized Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During 12/2004-7/2005, 47 patients with symptomatic gallstones were randomized to receive LC in the FHTO (28 patients) or in a conventional manner (19 patients) in a Finnish hospital setting. The 15D quality of life tool was administered at the baseline and 1 month after. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A stochastic approach over a month interval for hospital costs, length of postoperative stay, infection rate and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) was employed. RESULTS: Baseline group characteristics were similar. The mean health care costs with FHTO (1695 EUR) were significantly lower (p < 0.001) than in the conventional arm (2234 EUR). The number of patients discharged on the first postoperative day was 27 (96.4%) and 15 (78.9%) with two (7.1%) infections in the FHTO and four (21.1%) in the conventional arm.

3960,Economic evaluation of drug-eluting stents: a systematic literature review and model-based cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to systematically review economic analyses comparing drug-eluting stents (DES) to bare metal stents (BMS) in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention to form an overall view about cost-effectiveness of DES and to construct a simple decision analysis model to evaluate the cost-utility of DES. METHODS: Electronic databases searched from January 2004 to January 2006 were Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; DARE, HTA, EED (NHS CRD); MEDLINE(R) In-Process, Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE(R). References of the papers identified were checked. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT) or model-based cost-effectiveness analyses comparing DES to BMS in patients with coronary artery disease. The methodological quality of the papers was assessed by Drummond's criteria. Baseline characteristics and results of the studies were extracted and data synthesized descriptively. A decision tree model was constructed to evaluate the cost-utility of DES in comparison to BMS, where health-related quality of life was measured by the 15D. RESULTS: We identified thirteen good-quality economic evaluations. In two of these based on RCTs, DES was found cost-effective. In six studies, it was concluded that DES might probably be a cost-effective strategy in some circumstances, but not as a single strategy, and four studies concluded that DES is not cost-effective. One study did not draw a clear conclusion. In our analysis, the overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was Euros 98,827 per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Avoiding one revascularization with DES would cost Euros 4,794, when revascularization with BMS costs Euros 3,260. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is inconsistent of whether DES would be a cost-effective treatment compared with BMS in any healthcare system where evaluated. A marked restenosis risk reduction should be achieved before use of DES is justifiable at present prices.

3961,Economic evaluation of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery for the treatment of colorectal cancer. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to model cost-effectiveness over 25 years. Data on the clinical effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgery for colorectal cancer were obtained from a systematic review of the literature. Data on costs came from a systematic review of economic evaluations and from published sources. The outcomes of the model were presented as the incremental cost per life-year gained and using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to illustrate the likelihood that a treatment was cost-effective at various threshold values for society's willingness to pay for an additional life-year. RESULTS: Laparoscopic surgery was on average pounds 300 more costly and slightly less effective than open surgery and had a 30 percent chance of being cost-effective if society is willing to pay pounds 30,000 for a life-year. One interpretation of the available data suggests equal survival and disease-free survival. Making this assumption, laparoscopic surgery had a greater chance of being considered cost-effective. Presenting the results as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) made no difference to the results, as utility data were poor. Evidence suggests short-term benefits after laparoscopic repair. This benefit would have to be at least 0.01 of a QALY for laparoscopic surgery to be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery is likely to be associated with short-term quality of life benefits, similar long-term outcomes, and an additional pounds 300 per patient.

3962,A cost-effectiveness analysis of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to the Australian National Cervical Cancer Screening Program,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to the Australian National Cervical Screening Program compared to screening alone was examined. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection that incorporates screening and vaccination was developed. A vaccine that prevents 100% of HPV 16/18-associated disease, with a lifetime duration of efficacy and 80% coverage offered through a school program to girls aged 12 years, in conjunction with current screening was compared with screening alone using cost (in Australian dollars) per life-year (LY) saved and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Sensitivity analyses included determining the cost-effectiveness of offering a catch-up vaccination program to 14-26-year-olds and accounting for the benefits of herd immunity. RESULTS: Vaccination with screening compared with screening alone was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $51 103 per LY and $18 735 per QALY, assuming a cost per vaccine dose of $115. Results were sensitive to assumptions about the duration of vaccine efficacy, including the need for a booster ($68 158 per LY and $24 988 per QALY) to produce lifetime immunity. Accounting for herd immunity resulted in a more attractive ICER ($36 343 per LY and $13 316 per QALY) for girls only. The cost per LY of vaccinating boys and girls was $92 052 and the cost per QALY was $33 644. The cost per LY of implementing a catch-up vaccination program ranged from $45 652 ($16 727 per QALY) for extending vaccination to 14-year-olds to $78 702 ($34 536 per QALY) for 26-year-olds.

Alternatively, adalimumab can be used as a rescue therapy. AIM: To determine whether dose escalation of infliximab was a cost-effective strategy compared with adalimumab initiation after loss of response to 5 mg/kg of infliximab. METHODS: A decision-analysis model simulated two cohorts of Crohn's patients: (i) infliximab dose was escalated to 10 mg/kg and (ii) infliximab was discontinued and patients were started on adalimumab. The time horizon was 1 year. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The infliximab dose escalation strategy yielded more quality-adjusted life years (0.79) compared with the adalimumab strategy (0.76). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $332,032/quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model findings were robust. The most significant variables were the cost of infliximab and that of adalimumab, such that a reduction in the cost of infliximab by 1/3 resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below $80,000/quality-adjusted life year.

Markov models were constructed in order to estimate economic performance expressed as cost per QALY (quality adjusted life year) gained. Data from original clinical trial reports were used to populate the models, supplemented by the wider literature where required. Performance of the Mediterranean Diet and Intensive Lifestyle Change to Prevent Diabetes interventions could be estimated with most certainty and both were highly cost-effective interventions, at AU $1020 (US $760, 410 pounds) and AU $1880 (US $1410, 750 pounds) per QALY gained, respectively. The media campaign interventions appear highly cost-effective at AU $46 (US $34, 18 pounds) for '2 fruit 5 veg' and AU $5600 (US $4200, 2200 pounds) per QALY gained for FFFF, but are associated with considerable uncertainty, and may be dominated under certain assumptions. Several interventions were cost-saving under plausible sets of assumptions, whereas a small number were potentially dominated. All interventions subject to economic evaluation appeared cost-effective relative to societal norms.

3969,Economic evaluation of third-line treatment with alemtuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the potential economic efficiency of third-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with alemtuzumab versus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). METHODS: The target population for this study were patients with CLL who were able to tolerate third-line treatment with either FCR or alemtuzumab. The perspective used was that of the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC)/District Health Board. Health outcomes considered were survival time from commencement of treatment and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Average costs and outcomes and incremental cost per patient treated, per survival month and per QALY gained, were calculated. All costs were presented in 2006 New Zealand dollars. RESULTS: Base-case direct medical costs for alemtuzumab per treatment regimen per patient were $NZ15 303 lower than those for FCR. The average direct medical cost per survival month gained for alemtuzumab was $NZ3144 and for FCR was $NZ4101, and the average direct medical cost per QALY gained was $NZ46,016 and for FCR was $NZ60,012. CONCLUSION: Third-line treatment of eligible patients with alemtuzumab was found to be $NZ15,303 less costly than FCR per patient.",2007-01-03043,17914894,Clin Drug Investig,W Guy Scott,2007,27 / 11,755-64,Yes,17914894,"W Guy Scott; Helen M Scott; Economic evaluation of third-line treatment with alemtuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, Clin Drug Investig, 2007; 27(11):1173-2563; 755-64",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Third-line treatment with Alemtuzumab vs. Third-line treatment with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,New Zealand,2006,Not Stated
3970,Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: a cost-utility analysis of FEC-D vs. FEC 100,"Background Adjuvant 5-flurouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide-docetaxel (FEC-D) has been shown to improve disease-free and overall survival (DFS and OS), compared to FEC 100, for node-positive breast cancer. An economic evaluation was undertaken to examine the cost-utility (CU) of FEC-D relative to FEC 100 given possible differences in cost between the two regimens. Methods A Markov model was developed to calculate the cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained over a 10-year horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 women with node-positive breast cancer treated with FEC 100 or FEC-D. Event rates, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. Efficacy outcomes were based primarily on the hazard ratio of DFS for all patients, but separate analyses were also conducted according to age and menopausal status as per the PACS 01 subgroup analysis results. The model took a third-party direct payer perspective and reports results in 2006 Canadian dollars ($). Both costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Results FEC-D is associated with 0.156 QALY gain and a $2,280 incremental cost compared to FEC 100, with a CU of $14,612/QALY gained. Results were robust to model assumptions and input parameters in a sensitivity analysis but were marginal in pre-menopausal and younger women. Conclusions Adjuvant FEC-D is a cost-effective alternative to FEC 100, with a cost-effectiveness ratio well below commonly employed thresholds. The CU according to age and menopausal status should be considered in view of the potential differences in efficacy in these subgroups, if any.",2007-01-03044,17914669,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Tallal Younis,2007,/,,No,17914669,"Tallal Younis; Daniel Rayson; Marlene Sellon; Chris Skedgel; Daniel Rayson; Marlene Sellon; Chris Skedgel; Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: a cost-utility analysis of FEC-D vs. FEC 100, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2007-Oct-05; ():0167-6806",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Ajuvant 5-flurouracil , epirubicin and cyclophosphamide-docetaxel vs. Ajuvant 5-flurouracil , epirubicin at 100 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,14612,Canada,2006,16546.11
3971,Cost-effectiveness of quality improvement programs for patients with subthreshold depression or depressive disorder,"OBJECTIVE: This study explored the cost-effectiveness of quality-improvement interventions for depression in primary care, relative to usual care, among patients with subthreshold depression or depressive disorder. METHODS: A total of 746 primary care patients in managed care organizations with 12-month depressive disorder and 502 with current depressive symptoms but no disorder (subthreshold depression) participated in a group-level randomized controlled trial initiated between June 1996 and March 1997. Matched clinics were randomly assigned to enhanced usual care or one of two quality improvement interventions that provided education to manage depression over time and resources to facilitate access to medication management or psychotherapy for six to 12 months. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio for the pooled intervention groups versus usual care was $2,028 for patients with subthreshold depression (95% confidence interval [CI]=-$17,225 to $21,282) and $53,716 for those with depressive disorder (CI=$14,194 to $93,238), by using a measure of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) based on the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Similar results were obtained when alternative QALY measures were used. CONCLUSIONS: Although precision was limited, even the upper limit of the 95% CIs suggests that such interventions are as cost-effective for patients with subthreshold depression as are many widely used medical therapies.

3973,A clinical and economic evaluation of endoscopic ultrasound for patients at risk for familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Approximately 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is familial. Approximately 50% of 1st-degree relatives (FDRs) have endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings of chronic pancreatitis. We modeled the natural history of these patients to compare 4 management strategies. METHODS: We performed a systematic review, and created a Markov model for 45-year-old male FDRs, with findings of chronic pancreatitis on screening EUS. We compared 4 strategies: doing nothing, prophylactic total pancreatectomy (PTP), annual surveillance by EUS, and annual surveillance with EUS and fine needle aspiration (EUS/FNA). Outcomes incorporated mortality, quality of life, procedural complications, and costs. RESULTS: In the Do Nothing strategy, the lifetime risk of cancer was 20%. Doing nothing provided the greatest remaining years of life, the lowest cost, and the greatest remaining quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). PTP provided the fewest remaining years of life, and the fewest remaining QALYs. Screening with EUS provided nearly identical results to PTP, and screening with EUS/FNA provided intermediate results between PTP and doing nothing. PTP provided the longest life expectancy if the lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer was at least 46%, and provided the most QALYs if the risk was at least 68%.

3976,The cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in England and Wales,"BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody, which has demonstrated significant activity in metastatic colorectal cancer. The aim of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for patients with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of adding bevacizumab to irinotecan plus FU/LV (IFL) or 5-FU/LV alone. Effectiveness outcomes, health utilities and resource use data were derived from recent bevacizumab RCTs and from the literature. RESULTS: Adding bevacizumab to IFL costs approximately pound62,857 per QALY gained. Adding bevacizumab to 5-FU/LV costs approximately pound88,436 per QALY gained. The acquisition cost of bevacizumab is a key determinant of its cost-effectiveness.

3978,Cost-effectiveness of reduced follow-up in malignant melanoma,"Background: Considerable variability exists in the extent and frequency of follow- up examinations for melanoma patients between different countries, generating significantly different total costs and uncertain clinical benefits. Patients and Methods: We have analyzed the follow-up of melanoma patients under clinical and economic aspects based on the latest recommendations of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the German Dermatologic Society (DDG) in the Düsseldorf cohort of 526 patients (stage IIII) during a 5-year follow-up period. Outcome measures were frequency of metastasis detection, most effective detection method, costs per detected metastasis and cost per quality-adjusted life year. Results: Structured follow-up detected 17 recurrences in stages I-III. Physical examination and lymph node ultrasound were the only cost-effective methods at all stages, while laboratory studies were generally not cost-effective. The implementation of a reduced, yet medically adequate follow-up reducing chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasound examinations and eliminating blood tests in early stages yielded savings of more than 100,000 euro (120,000 $) annually at a tertiary care university hospital.

3979,Cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccinating Asian and Pacific Islander adults for hepatitis B,"BACKGROUND: As many as 10% of Asian and Pacific Islander adults in the United States are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and up to two thirds are unaware that they are infected. Without proper medical management and antiviral therapy, up to 25% of Asian and Pacific Islander persons with chronic HBV infection will die of liver disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 HBV screening and vaccination programs for Asian and Pacific Islander adults in the United States. DESIGN: Markov model with costs and benefits discounted at 3%. DATA SOURCES: Published literature and expert opinion. TARGET POPULATION: Asian and Pacific Islander adults (base-case age, 40 years; sensitivity analysis conducted on ages 20 to 60 years). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: U.S. societal. INTERVENTIONS: A universal vaccination strategy in which all individuals are given a 3-dose vaccination series; a screen-and-treat strategy, in which individuals are given blood tests to determine whether they are chronically infected, and infected persons are monitored and treated; a screen, treat, and ring vaccinate strategy, in which all individuals are tested for chronic HBV infection and close contacts of infected persons are screened and vaccinated if needed; and a screen, treat, and vaccinate strategy, in which all individuals are tested and then vaccinated with a 3-dose series if needed. In all cases, persons found to be chronically infected are monitored and treated if indicated. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (2006 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with the status quo, the screen-and-treat strategy has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,088 per QALY gained. The screen, treat, and ring vaccinate strategy gains more QALYs than the screen and treat strategy and incurs modest incremental costs, leading to incremental cost-effectiveness of $39,903 per QALY gained compared with the screen and treat strategy. The universal vaccination and screen, treat, and vaccinate strategies were weakly dominated by the other 2 strategies. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Over a wide range of variables, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the screen and treat and screen, treat, and ring vaccinate strategies were less than $50,000 per QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: Results depend on the accuracy of the underlying data and assumptions. The long-term effectiveness of new and future HBV treatments is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Screening programs for HBV among Asian and Pacific Islander adults are likely to be cost effective.

3983,Determining the cost-effectiveness of a computer-based smoking cessation intervention in primary care,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the incremental effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a staged-based, computerized smoking cessation intervention relative to standard care in an urban managed care network of primary care physicians. DESIGN: Decision-analytic model based on results of a randomized clinical trial. METHODOLOGY: Patient outcomes and cost estimates were derived from clinical trial data. Effectiveness was measured in terms of 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 6 months post-intervention. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness (CE) were calculated, with CE measured as cost per patient per life year saved and per quality-adjusted life years saved. CE estimates were adjusted to account for partial behavior change as measured in terms of progression in stage of readiness to quit. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of key model assumptions. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Intervention patients were 1.77 times more likely to be smoke-free at 6 months follow-up than those in standard care (p=.078). The intervention generated an additional 3.24 quitters per year. Annualized incremental costs were $5,570 per primary care practice, and $40.83 per smoker. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $1,174 per life year saved ($869 per QALY). When the intervention impact on progression in stage of readiness to quit was also considered, the mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio declined to $999 per life year saved ($739 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: From a physician's practice perspective, the stage-based computer tailored intervention was cost-effective relative to standard care.

METHODS: Alongside a clinical trial, we estimated the costs of usual primary care and participation in ESCAPE-knee pain delivered to individuals (Indiv-rehab) or groups of 8 participants (Grp-rehab). Information on resource use and informal care received was collected during face-to-face interviews. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility were assessed from between-group differences in costs, function (primary clinical outcome), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed to represent uncertainty around cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Rehabilitation (regardless of whether Indiv-rehab or Grp-rehab) cost 224 pounds (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 184 pounds, 262 pounds) more per person than usual primary care. The probability of rehabilitation being more cost-effective than usual primary care was 90% if decision makers were willing to pay 1,900 pounds for improvements in functioning. Indiv-rehab cost 314 pounds/person and Grp-rehab 125 pounds/person. Indiv-rehab cost 189 pounds (95% CI 168 pounds, 208 pounds) more per person than Grp-rehab. The probability of Indiv-rehab being more cost-effective than Grp-rehab increased as willingness to pay (WTP) increased, reaching 50% probability at WTP 5,500 pounds.

3988,Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in adults with severe asthma: results from the Asthma Policy Model,"BACKGROUND: Omalizumab (trade name Xolair) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. Given the high acquisition cost of omalizumab, its role and cost-effectiveness in disease management require definition. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the clinical and economic circumstances under which omalizumab might or might not be a cost-effective option by using a mathematic model. METHODS: We merged published data on clinical and economic outcomes (including acute event incidence, frequency/severity of hospitalizations, and health-related quality of life) to project 10-year costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness of treatment with omalizumab in addition to inhaled corticosteroids. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by using input data ranges from a variety of sources (published clinical trials and observational databases). RESULTS: For patients with baseline acute event rates, omalizumab conferred an additional 1.7 quality-adjusted months at an incremental cost of $131,000 over a 10-year planning horizon, implying a cost-effectiveness ratio of $821,000 per QALY gained. For patients with 5 times the baseline acute event rate, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $491,000 per QALY gained. The projected cost-effectiveness ratio could fall within a range of other programs that are widely considered to be cost-effective if the cost of omalizumab decreases to less than $200. CONCLUSION: Omalizumab is not cost-effective for most patients with severe asthma. The projected cost-effectiveness ratios could fall within a favorable range if the cost of omalizumab decreases significantly. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on the high cost of omalizumab, it is especially important that clinicians explore alternative medications for asthma before initiating omalizumab.",2007-01-03057,17904628,J Allergy Clin Immunol,Ann C Wu,2007,120 / 5,1146-52,No,17904628,"Ann C Wu; A David Paltiel; Karen M Kuntz; Scott T Weiss; Anne L Fuhlbrigge; Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in adults with severe asthma: results from the Asthma Policy Model, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2007-Nov; 120(5):0091-6749; 1146-52",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"ICSs, quick relievers and omalizumab vs. ICS therapy for long-term asthma control and quick relievers as-needed",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,821000,United States,2005,1087986.85
3989,Health and economic benefits of reducing the number of students per classroom in US primary schools,"OBJECTIVES: We estimated the costs associated with reducing class sizes in kindergarten through grade 3 as well as the effects of small class sizes on selected outcomes such as quality-adjusted life-years and future earnings. METHODS: We used multiple data sets to predict changes in the outcomes assessed according to level of educational attainment. We then used a Markov model to estimate future costs and benefits incurred and quality-adjusted life-years gained per additional high school graduate produced over time. RESULTS: From a societal perspective (incorporating earnings and health outcomes), class-size reductions would generate a net cost savings of approximately $168,000 and a net gain of 1.7 quality-adjusted life-years for each high school graduate produced by small classes.

3993,The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of competing therapies in hepatic encephalopathy - a decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options for hepatic encephalopathy have disparate risks and benefits. Non-absorbable disaccharides and neomycin are limited by uncertain efficacy and common dose-limiting side effects. In contrast, rifaximin is safe and effective in hepatic encephalopathy, but is more expensive. METHODS: We conducted a decision analysis to calculate the cost-effectiveness of six strategies in hepatic encephalopathy: (i) no hepatic encephalopathy treatment, (ii) lactulose monotherapy, (iii) lactitol monotherapy, (iv) neomycin monotherapy, (v) rifaximin monotherapy and (vi) up-front lactulose with crossover to rifaximin if poor response or intolerance of lactulose ('rifaximin salvage'). The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: Under base-case conditions, 'do nothing' was least effective and rifaximin salvage was most effective. Lactulose monotherapy was least expensive, and rifaximin monotherapy was most expensive. When balancing cost and effectiveness, lactulose monotherapy and rifaximin salvage dominated alternative strategies. Compared to lactulose monotherapy, rifaximin salvage cost an incremental US$2315 per quality-adjusted life-year-gained. The cost of rifaximin had to fall below US$1.03/tab in order for rifaximin monotherapy to dominate lactulose monotherapy.

3995,Cost-effectiveness of switching to exemestane after 2 to 3 years of therapy with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Data from the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) suggest that switching to the aromatase inhibitor, exemestane, after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen therapy prolongs disease-free survival versus continuing on tamoxifen therapy. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this management strategy. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict patients' transitions across various health states based on treatment strategy (continuing tamoxifen vs. switching to exemestane), breast cancer status (no recurrence, local or distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer), and other related health events (osteoporosis, endometrial cancer, death). Rates of disease-related events (recurrence and contralateral breast cancer) were estimated using data from the IES. Survival and lifetime medical-care costs by type of disease-related event were estimated using SEER-Medicare data. The model was used to estimate direct costs (in 2004 US dollars), life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Switching to exemestane versus continuing tamoxifen therapy was associated with increased disease-free survival (181 vs. 172 months), QALYs (12.21 vs. 11.89), and net discounted lifetime costs of cancer care ($12,124 vs. $7724 per patient). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of exemestane was $20,100 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval: $12,100, $59,000). Sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust to plausible variations in recurrence rates, costs, and utilities.

3997,Time from sexually transmitted infection acquisition to pelvic inflammatory disease development: influence on the cost-effectiveness of different screening intervals,"OBJECTIVES: To prevent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), some experts recommend screening for sexually transmitted infection (STI) every 12 months, with more frequent screening suggested in higher-risk women. Nevertheless, the time from STI acquisition to PID development, possibly an important factor to consider in screening interval choice, is unknown and its influence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening is unclear. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated PID cases averted and the incremental cost-effectiveness resulting from 6- or 12-month screening strategies for high-risk young women (6%/year infection risk, 2.8%/year PID risk with 12-month screening) while varying PID development time from 1 to 12 months after initial infection. Lower-risk women and alternative parameter values were examined in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Relative to 12-month screening, 6-month screening decreases PID cases from 6.0% (1 month development time)to 19.4% (12 months); the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with the other strategies varies from $16,600 (12 months development time) to $31,800 (1 month) for high-risk women. In lower-risk women, every 6-month screening is more economically unfavorable, with greater costs per QALY gained at shorter PID development time. CONCLUSION: From a cost-effectiveness standpoint, uncertainty about PID development time is not a significant factor in choosing a screening interval in high-risk women, but could be important in lower-risk groups. Significant increases in PID cases averted occur with more frequent screening when PID development time is lengthened, which may allow estimation of this interval through the use of more sophisticated modeling techniques.",2007-01-03071,17888100,Value Health,Kenneth J Smith,2007,10 / 5,358-66,Yes,17888100,"Kenneth J Smith; Robert L Cook; Mark S Roberts; Time from sexually transmitted infection acquisition to pelvic inflammatory disease development: influence on the cost-effectiveness of different screening intervals, Value Health, 2007 Sep-Oct; 10(5):1098-3015; 358-66",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"6-month screening for STIs vs. No screening, only treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease",Not Stated,28 Years,15 Years,Female,Full,4 Years,3.00,3.00,31800,United States,2004,43569.03

3999,The cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women based on individual long-term fracture risks,"OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analyses are routinely based on data from group averages, restricting its generalizibility to those with below- or above-average risk. A pharmaco-economic model that used individualized risks for fractures was developed in order to take into account patient heterogeneity. METHODS: Data were obtained from The Health Improvement Network research database of general practitioners, comprising a UK general population of women aged more than 50 years (N = 330,000). Mortality and hip, vertebral, and other osteoporotic fracture risks for each individual were estimated by age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and other clinical risk factors. Estimates on costs, EuroQol (EQ-5D) utilities, and treatment efficacy were obtained from a UK national report (the National Institute for Clinical Excellence) and outcomes were simulated over a 10-year period. RESULTS: It was found that the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was lower in elderly women and in women with fracture history. There was a large variability in the cost-effectiveness with baseline fracture risk and with clinical risk factors. Patients with low BMI (<20) had considerable better cost-effectiveness than patients with high BMI (>or=26). Using a cost-acceptability ratio of 30k pounds per QALY gained, bisphosphonate treatment became cost-effective for patients with a 5-year risk of 9.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0-10.5%) for osteoporotic fractures and of 2.1% (95% CI 1.5-2.7%) for hip fractures. Including bone mineral density in the risk assessment, the cost per QALY gained was 35k pounds in women at age 60 with a fracture history and a T-score of -2.5 (at age 80, this was 3k pounds).
