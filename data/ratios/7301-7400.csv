7301,Cost-effectiveness of adolescent pertussis vaccination for the Netherlands: using an individual-based dynamic model,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread immunization programs, a clear increase in pertussis incidence is apparent in many developed countries during the last decades. Consequently, additional immunization strategies are considered to reduce the burden of disease. The aim of this study is to design an individual-based stochastic dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population in order to predict the epidemiologic and economic consequences of the implementation of universal booster vaccination programs. Using this framework, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal adolescent pertussis booster vaccination at the age of 12 years in the Netherlands. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We designed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to predict the epidemiological and economic consequences of implementing universal adolescent booster vaccination. We used national age-specific notification data over the period 1996-2000--corrected for underreporting--to calibrate the model assuming a steady state situation. Subsequently, booster vaccination was introduced. Input parameters of the model were derived from literature, national data sources (e.g. costing data, incidence and hospitalization data) and expert opinions. As there is no consensus on the duration of immunity acquired by natural infection, we considered two scenarios for this duration of protection (i.e. 8 and 15 years). In both scenarios, total pertussis incidence decreased as a result of adolescent vaccination. From a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness was estimated at €4418/QALY (range: 3205-6364 € per QALY) and €6371/QALY (range: 4139-9549 € per QALY) for the 8- and 15-year protection scenarios, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the outcomes are most sensitive to the quality of life weights used for pertussis disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge we designed the first individual-based dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population. This study indicates that adolescent pertussis vaccination is likely to be a cost-effective intervention for The Netherlands. The model is suited to investigate further pertussis booster vaccination strategies.",2010-01-06838,20976213,PLoS One,R de Vries,2010,5 / 10,e13392,No,20976213,"R de Vries; Cost-effectiveness of adolescent pertussis vaccination for the Netherlands: using an individual-based dynamic model, PLoS One , 2010; 5(10):1932-6203; e13392",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal adolescent pertussis booster vaccination at age 12 years (15 year protection) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,4.00,1.50,6371,Euro,2008,11277.51
7302,Routine HIV screening in France: clinical impact and cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: In France, roughly 40,000 HIV-infected persons are unaware of their HIV infection. Although previous studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of routine HIV screening in the United States, differences in both the epidemiology of infection and HIV testing behaviors warrant a setting-specific analysis for France. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We estimated the life expectancy (LE), cost and cost-effectiveness of alternative HIV screening strategies in the French general population and high-risk sub-populations using a computer model of HIV detection and treatment, coupled with French national clinical and economic data. We compared risk-factor-based HIV testing (""current practice"") to universal routine, voluntary HIV screening in adults aged 18-69. Screening frequencies ranged from once to annually. Input data included mean age (42 years), undiagnosed HIV prevalence (0.10%), annual HIV incidence (0.01%), test acceptance (79%), linkage to care (75%) and cost/test (€43). We performed sensitivity analyses on HIV prevalence and incidence, cost estimates, and the transmission benefits of ART. ""Current practice"" produced LEs of 242.82 quality-adjusted life months (QALM) among HIV-infected persons and 268.77 QALM in the general population. Adding a one-time HIV screen increased LE by 0.01 QALM in the general population and increased costs by €50/person, for a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of €57,400 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). More frequent screening in the general population increased survival, costs and CERs. Among injection drug users (prevalence 6.17%; incidence 0.17%/year) and in French Guyana (prevalence 0.41%; incidence 0.35%/year), annual screening compared to every five years produced CERs of €51,200 and €46,500/QALY.

7308,Cost-effectiveness of elective induction of labor at 41 weeks in nulliparous women,"OBJECTIVE:: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of elective induction of labor at 41 weeks in nulliparous women. STUDY DESIGN:: A decision analytic model comparing induction of labor at 41 weeks vs expectant management with antenatal testing until 42 weeks in nulliparas was designed. Baseline assumptions were derived from the literature as well as from analysis of the National Birth Cohort dataset and included an intrauterine fetal demise rate of 0.12% in the 41st week and a cesarean rate of 27% in women induced at 41 weeks. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the findings. RESULTS:: Compared with expectant management, induction of labor is cost-effective with an incremental cost of $10,945 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Induction of labor at 41 weeks also resulted in a lower rate of adverse obstetric outcomes, including neonatal demise, shoulder dystocia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and severe perineal lacerations.

7309,Economic evaluation of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost and effectiveness of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) versus combined oral contraception (COC) and progestogens (PROG) in first-line treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) in Spain. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of LNG-IUS, COC and PROG was carried out using a Markov model based on clinical data from the literature and expert opinion. The population studied were women with a previous diagnosis of idiopathic heavy menstrual bleeding. The analysis was performed from the National Health System perspective, discounting both costs and future effects at 3%. In addition, a sensitivity analysis (univariate and probabilistic) was conducted. RESULTS: The results show that the greater efficacy of LNG-IUS translates into a gain of 1.92 and 3.89 symptom-free months (SFM) after six months of treatment versus COC and PROG, respectively (which represents an increase of 33% and 60% of symptom-free time). Regarding costs, LNG-IUS produces savings of € 174.2-309.95 and € 230.54-577.61 versus COC and PROG, respectively, after 6 months-5 years. Apart from cost savings and gains in SFM, quality-adjusted life months (QALM) are also favourable to LNG-IUS in all scenarios, with a range of gains between 1 and 2 QALM compared to COC and PROG. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that first-line use of the LNG-IUS is the dominant therapeutic option (less costly and more effective) in comparison with first-line use of COC or PROG for the treatment of DUB in Spain.

7313,Cost and mortality prediction using polymerase chain reaction pathogen detection in sepsis: evidence from three observational trials,"ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Delays in adequate antimicrobial treatment contribute to high cost and mortality in sepsis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are used alongside conventional cultures to accelerate the identification of microorganisms. We analyze the impact on medical outcomes and healthcare costs if improved adequacy of antimicrobial therapy is achieved by providing immediate coverage after positive PCR reports. METHODS: A mathematical prediction model describes the impact of PCR-based rapid adjustment of antimicrobial treatment. The model is applied to predict cost and medical outcomes for 221 sepsis episodes of 189 post-surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) sepsis patients with available PCR data from a prospective, observational trial of a multiplex PCR assay in five hospitals. While this trial demonstrated reduction of inadequate treatment days, data on outcomes associated with reduced inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment had to be obtained from two other, bigger, studies which involved 1147 (thereof 316 inadequately treated) medical or surgical ICU patients. Our results are reported with the (5%-95%) percentile ranges from Monte Carlo simulation in which the input parameters were randomly and independently varied according to their statistical characterization in the three underlying studies. The model allows predictions also for different patient groups or PCR assays. RESULTS: 13.1 % of PCR tests enabled earlier adequate treatment. We predict that cost for PCR testing (EUR 300 /test) can be fully recovered for patients above EUR 717 (EUR 605-1710) daily treatment cost. A 2.6 % (2.0-3.2 %) absolute reduction of mortality is expected. Cost per incremental survivor calculates to EUR 11477 (EUR 9321-14977) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to EUR 3107 (EUR 2523-4055) per quality-adjusted life-year. Generally, for ICU patients with >25% incidence of inadequate empiric antimicrobial treatment, and at least 15% with a positive blood culture, PCR represents a cost-neutral adjunct method. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid PCR identification of microorganisms has the potential to become a cost-effective component for managing sepsis. The prediction model tested with data from three observational trials should be utilized as a framework to deepen insights when integrating more complementary data associated with utilization of molecular assays in the management of sepsis.",2010-01-06860,20950442,Crit Care,LE Lehmann,2010,14 / 5,R186,No,20950442,"LE Lehmann; Cost and mortality prediction using polymerase chain reaction pathogen detection in sepsis: evidence from three observational trials, Crit Care, 2010-Oct-15; 14(5):1466-609X; R186",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Polymerase chain reaction alongside conventional cultures vs. Conventional cultures only,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,3107,Euro,2008,5499.8
7314,"Cost-effectiveness analyses of docetaxel versus paclitaxel once weekly in patients with metastatic breast cancer in progression following anthracycline chemotherapy, in Spain","OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of docetaxel versus weekly paclitaxel regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracycline from the Spanish National Health Service (NHS) perspective. METHODS: A Markov model with a 21-day cycle duration was developed to estimate total treatment-related costs and clinical benefits over 5 years of docetaxel (100 mg/m²) and weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m²). Patient data were obtained from the Randomized Phase III Study of Docetaxel Compared with Paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer (TAX- 311) and Anglo-Celtic IV trials. Utilities were obtained from literature, and unitary costs (€2009) from a Spanish health-cost database and the Catalogue of Medicines. Cost and benefits [life-years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Docetaxel yields higher health benefits (1.83 LYG; 1.08 QALY) than paclitaxel (1.46 LYG; 0.84 QALY). Global costs (treatment, concomitant medication, adverse events management, progression, best supportive care, and end of life phase) per patient were €20,052 and €9,982 with docetaxel and paclitaxel, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of docetaxel versus paclitaxel was €190/LYG and €295/QALY. Based on a €30,000/QALY threshold, docetaxel has 99% probability of being cost-effective. ICER was mostly sensitive to hazard ratio (HR) (when varied from 1.46 to 1.09; €3,517/ QALY), discount over the ex-lab price of Taxol® (75%; €6,396/QALY) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylactic treatment (when administered in 60% of cycles instead of 100%; cost saving). Variations in other inputs, such as time horizon (3-10 years), discount rate (0-5%), or adverse event cost (± 25%) were shown not to have relevant influence on the results.

STUDY DESIGN:: Cost-utility analysis. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:: Publicly funded health care system. Anemic patients with CKD, overall and stratified into dialysis-/non-dialysis-dependent subgroups. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME:: Decision analysis, health care payer, patient's lifetime. MAIN OUTCOME:: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS:: For dialysis patients, compared with anemia management without ESAs, using ESAs to target a low hemoglobin level is associated with a cost per QALY of $96,270. Given a lack of direct trials comparing low and intermediate targets, significant uncertainty exists between these strategies. Treatment to a high hemoglobin target was always associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher costs compared with a low hemoglobin target. Results were similar in non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD, with a cost per QALY for a low target compared with no ESA of $147,980.

7321,Cost-effectiveness of multimodal CT for evaluating acute stroke,"OBJECTIVE: Multimodal CT, including noncontrast CT (NCCT), CT with contrast, CT angiography (CTA), and perfusion CT (CTP), is increasingly used in acute stroke patients to identify candidates for endovascular therapy. Our goal is to explore the cost-effectiveness of multimodal CT as a diagnostic test. METHODS: A Markov model compared multimodal CT to NCCT in a hypothetical cohort of nonhemorrhagic stroke patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset who were potential IV tPA candidates. Patients who failed to improve after IV tPA or in whom IV tPA was contraindicated were candidates for endovascular therapy. Direct costs (2008 USD), outcomes, and probabilities were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: For the 3-month time horizon, multimodal CT had lower costs (-$1,716), had greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs, 0.004), and was the cost-effective choice 100% of the time for a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY (probabilistic sensitivity analysis). The number needed to screen with multimodal CT to avoid 1 diagnostic angiogram was 2. Over a lifetime, multimodal CT had lower costs (-$2,058), had greater QALYs (0.008), and was cost-effective, with a 90.1% likelihood, for a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal CT appears to be a cost-saving screening tool over the short term. However, additional data regarding clinical outcomes following multimodal CT-guided intra-arterial treatment are needed before the long-term cost-effectiveness can be suitably addressed.

7323,Cost-effectiveness of traditional and endovenous treatments for varicose veins,"BACKGROUND:: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of traditional and endovenous treatments for patients with primary great saphenous varicose veins. METHODS:: A Markov model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux. Eight popular treatment strategies were compared up to 5 years. Estimates for the effectiveness of treatments were obtained from published randomized studies and cost values were obtained from published National Health Service (NHS) healthcare resource group tariffs and device manufacturers. Parameter uncertainty was tested using sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS:: Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) had the lowest initial cost, but a higher requirement for further interventions. Day-case surgery (with concomitant treatment of varicosities), endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) performed in an outpatient or office setting (with staged treatment of varicosities) were likely to be cost-effective treatment strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for UGFS (versus conservative care), EVLA (versus UGFS) and RFA (versus EVLA) were £1366, £5799 and £17 350 per QALY respectively. The ICER for traditional surgery (performed on a day-case basis) was £19 012 compared with RFA. Other strategies were not cost-effective using the NHS threshold of £20 000 per QALY.

7325,Cost-effectiveness of traditional and endovenous treatments for varicose veins,"BACKGROUND:: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of traditional and endovenous treatments for patients with primary great saphenous varicose veins. METHODS:: A Markov model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux. Eight popular treatment strategies were compared up to 5 years. Estimates for the effectiveness of treatments were obtained from published randomized studies and cost values were obtained from published National Health Service (NHS) healthcare resource group tariffs and device manufacturers. Parameter uncertainty was tested using sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS:: Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) had the lowest initial cost, but a higher requirement for further interventions. Day-case surgery (with concomitant treatment of varicosities), endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) performed in an outpatient or office setting (with staged treatment of varicosities) were likely to be cost-effective treatment strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for UGFS (versus conservative care), EVLA (versus UGFS) and RFA (versus EVLA) were £1366, £5799 and £17 350 per QALY respectively.

7330,Effects of Adverse Events on the Projected Population Benefits and Cost-effectiveness of Using Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine in Children Aged 6 Months to 4 Years,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of adverse events associated with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children younger than 5 years on the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination. DESIGN: A decision analytic model was developed to predict costs and health effects of no vaccination, vaccination with LAIV, and vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Probabilities, costs, and quality adjustments for uncomplicated influenza, outpatient visits, hospitalizations, deaths, vaccination, and vaccine adverse events were based on primary and published data. The analysis included the possible increased incidence of adverse events following vaccination with LAIV for children younger than 5 years, including fever, wheezing, and hospitalization. A societal perspective was used. Sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis, were conducted. SETTING: Vaccination in the physician office setting in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of healthy children aged 6 months to 4 years. Intervention  Vaccination with LAIV or IIV. Main Outcome Measure  Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $20 000/QALY (age 6-23 months) to $33 000/QALY (age 3-4 years) for LAIV and from $21 000/QALY to $37 000/QALY for IIV for healthy children aged 6 months to 4 years. Inclusion of possible new adverse events for LAIV had varying effects on cost-effectiveness results.

7336,Cost-effectiveness of therapist-delivered online cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression: randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Therapist-delivered online cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective for depression in primary care. AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of online CBT compared with usual care. METHOD: Economic evaluation at 8 months alongside a randomised controlled trial. Cost to the National Health Service (NHS), personal costs, and the value of lost productivity, each compared with outcomes based on the Beck Depression Inventory and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental analysis indicated the NHS cost per QALY gain. RESULTS: Online CBT was more expensive than usual care, although the outcomes for the CBT group were better. Cost per QALY gain based on complete case data was £17,173, and £10,083 when missing data were imputed. CONCLUSIONS: Online CBT delivered by a therapist in real time is likely to be cost-effective compared with usual care if society is willing to pay at least £20,000 per QALY; it could be a useful alternative to face-to-face CBT.",2010-01-06892,20884953,Br J Psychiatry,Sandra Hollinghurst,2010,197 / 4,297-304,No,20884953,"Sandra Hollinghurst; Cost-effectiveness of therapist-delivered online cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression: randomised controlled trial, Br J Psychiatry, 2010-Oct; 197(4):0007-1250; 297-304",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) vs. Usual care,Not Stated,75 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,17173,United Kingdom,2007,42914.64

AIMS: To undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for depression contextualised to Chile. METHODS: Using data from studies in Chile, we developed a computer-based Markov cohort model of depression among Chilean women to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of usual care or improved stepped care. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of usual care was I$113 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, versus no treatment, whereas stepped care had an ICER of I$468 per QALY versus usual care. This compared favourably with Chile's per-capita GDP. Results were most sensitive to variation in recurrent episode coverage, marginally sensitive to cost of treatment, and insensitive to changes in health-state utility of depression and rate of recurrence.

RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of usual care was I$113 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, versus no treatment, whereas stepped care had an ICER of I$468 per QALY versus usual care. This compared favourably with Chile's per-capita GDP. Results were most sensitive to variation in recurrent episode coverage, marginally sensitive to cost of treatment, and insensitive to changes in health-state utility of depression and rate of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that treatments for depression in low- and middle-income countries may be more cost-effective than previously estimated.",2010-01-06893,20884952,Br J Psychiatry,Dan Siskind,2010,197 / 4,291-6,No,20884952,"Dan Siskind; Cost-effectiveness of improved primary care treatment of depression in women in Chile, Br J Psychiatry, 2010-Oct; 197(4):0007-1250; 291-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Stepped depression therapy (Usual care plus psychoeducational groups) vs. Usual depression care (primary care and psychiatry conconsult if necessary, psycopharmacology if necessary)",Not Stated,18 Years,18 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,288.89,United States,2003,406.35
7339,Cost-utility analysis of a three-month exercise programme vs usual care following multidisciplinary rehabilitation for chronic low back pain,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility of an exercise programme vs usual care after functional multidisciplinary rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS/PATIENTS: A total of 105 patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: Chronic low back pain patients completing a 3-week functional multidisciplinary rehabilitation were randomized to either a 3-month exercise programme (n = 56) or usual care (n = 49). The exercise programme consisted of 24 training sessions during 12 weeks. At the end of functional multidisciplinary rehabilitation and at 1-year follow-up quality of life was measured with the SF-36 questionnaire, converted into utilities and transformed into quality--adjusted life years. Direct and indirect monthly costs were measured using cost diaries. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the incremental cost of the exercise programme divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years between both groups. RESULTS: Quality of life improved significantly at 1-year follow-up in both groups. Similarly, both groups significantly reduced total monthly costs over time. No significant difference was observed between groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 79,270 euros. CONCLUSION: Adding an exercise programme after functional multidisciplinary rehabilitation compared with usual care does not offer significant long-term benefits in quality of life and direct and indirect costs.",2010-01-06894,20878045,J Rehabil Med,Y Henchoz,2010,42 / 9,846-52,No,20878045,"Y Henchoz; Cost-utility analysis of a three-month exercise programme vs usual care following multidisciplinary rehabilitation for chronic low back pain, J Rehabil Med, 2010-Oct; 42(9):1650-1977; 846-52",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Three-month exercise program vs. Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,7288.89,Euro,2008,12902.29
7340,Cost-effectiveness of using high-sensitivity C-reactive protein to identify intermediate- and low-cardiovascular-risk individuals for statin therapy,"BACKGROUND: Many myocardial infarctions and strokes occur in individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below recommended treatment thresholds. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) testing has been advocated to identify low- and intermediate-risk individuals who may benefit from statin therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision analytic Markov model was used to follow hypothetical cohorts of individuals with normal lipid levels but without coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or diabetes mellitus. The model compared current Adult Treatment Panel III practice guidelines, a strategy of hs-CRP screening in those without an indication for statin treatment by current practice guidelines followed by treatment only in those with elevated hs-CRP levels, and a strategy of statin therapy at specified predicted risk thresholds without hs-CRP testing. Risk-based treatment without hs-CRP testing was the most cost-effective strategy, assuming that statins were equally effective regardless of hs-CRP status. However, if normal hs-CRP levels identified a subgroup with little or no benefit from statin therapy (<20% relative risk reduction), then hs-CRP screening would be the optimal strategy. If harms from statin use were greater than generally recognized, then use of current clinical guidelines would be the optimal strategy.

7352,Cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for vascular event prevention in adults with elevated C-reactive protein: implications of JUPITER,"OBJECTIVES: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been explored for use in predicting cardiovascular risk. The recent Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study found that statin therapy reduced cardiovascular events in those with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below current treatment thresholds (=130 mg/dL, 3.4 = mmol/L), but with elevated hs-CRP levels (=2.0 mg/L). This study examines the cost-effectiveness of statin treatment for individuals with elevated hs-CRP but normal LDL cholesterol. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was conducted from the U.S. societal perspective. Data from JUPITER were used to estimate rates of myocardial infarction, angina and stroke. Statin costs were based on generic simvastatin 80 mg, equipotent to the rosuvastatin 20 mg dose used in JUPITER. Primary prevention was the focus and secondary prevention was not modeled explicitly. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using nationally representative preference-based utility weights. One-way sensitivity analyses and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis were used to explore uncertainty in model parameters as well as estimate the likelihood of cost-effectiveness when all event rates, costs and utilities were drawn randomly from distributions reflecting uncertainty. RESULTS: Statin therapy cost $10,889/QALY for vascular event prevention in this population. Results were sensitive to the cost of statin treatment. Based on 10,000 simulations, statin therapy was cost-effective in 99.5% of simulations, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY, and 100% of simulations using a threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with statins in patients with elevated hs-CRP but normal cholesterol appears to be cost-effective. Limitations of this study include the assumption that an equipotent dose of simvastatin resulted in the same risk reduction as rosuvastatin.

7355,Cost effectiveness of letrozole versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with HR+ early-stage breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: The Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 and Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trials demonstrated that, in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive (HR+) early-stage breast cancer, 5 years of initial adjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole or anastrozole is superior to tamoxifen. With expected generic availability of anastrozole in July 2010 and letrozole in June 2011, there may be financial pressures prior to letrozole's generic availability to start treatment-naïve patients on anastrozole vs. letrozole or to switch patients already receiving letrozole to anastrozole. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with letrozole vs. anastrozole from the US healthcare system perspective. Cost effectiveness was examined separately in treatment-naïve patients and in patients already receiving letrozole. For the latter, cost effectiveness of continued letrozole vs. therapeutic substitution (TS) to generic anastrozole was evaluated separately in cohorts defined on years of endocrine therapy remaining. TS to generic anastrozole was assumed to result in an additional 5% of patients discontinuing endocrine therapy. Probabilities of distant recurrence and death were taken from reports of BIG 1-98, ATAC, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analysis of tamoxifen, and other published sources. Carry-over effects of aromatase inhibitors were assumed to be proportional to treatment duration. Costs of aromatase inhibitors were assumed to decline by 75% with generic availability. RESULTS: In treatment-naïve patients, total expected lifetime costs are $3916 greater with letrozole vs. anastrozole. However, initiation of treatment with letrozole results in a gain of 0.15 QALYs. Cost per QALY gained with letrozole vs. anastrozole is $25,846. In patients already receiving letrozole, the increase in total expected lifetime costs with continued letrozole vs. TS to anastrozole is between $4200 and $4500 in all cohorts. QALYs gained with letrozole range from 0.21 in those with 4 years of endocrine therapy remaining to 0.13 in those with 1 year of therapy remaining. Cost per QALY gained ranges from $20,276 to $34,356. CONCLUSION: For postmenopausal women with HR+ early-stage breast cancer, letrozole is more likely to be cost effective vs. anastrozole in treatment-naïve patients and in patients already receiving letrozole.

7356,One-Year Outcomes and a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Smokers Accessing Group-Based and Pharmacy-Led Cessation Services,"INTRODUCTION: An observational study examining 1-year follow-up of clients of two National Health Service smoking cessation services in Glasgow was used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis. One service involved 7 weeks of group-based support (n = 411) and the other consisted of up to 12 weeks of one-to-one counseling with pharmacists (n = 1,374). Pharmacological aids to quitting (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy) were available to all clients. METHODS: Quit rates were calculated for each service at 52 weeks after the quit date, and these were used for an economic evaluation of both the annual and the lifetime cost-effectiveness of the pharmacy- and group-based interventions in comparison with a baseline ""self-quit"" scenario. The annual cost-effectiveness model established the incremental cost per 52-week quitter, while a Markov model was developed for the lifetime analysis to estimate the potential lifetime outcomes in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, to account for the benefits quitters will receive in terms of extended life years and improvements in quality of life from smoking cessation. RESULTS: The proportion of carbon monoxide-validated quitters from both services combined fell from 22.5% at 4-week follow-up to 3.6% at 52 weeks. The group service achieved a higher quit rate (6.3%) than the pharmacy service (2.8%) but was more intensive and required greater overhead costs. The lifetime analysis resulted in an incremental cost per QALY of £4,800 for the group support and £2,600 for pharmacy one-to-one counseling.

7358,Economic impact of remote patient monitoring: an integrated economic model derived from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in heart failure,"AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness and the cost utility of remote patient monitoring (RPM) when compared with the usual care approach based upon differences in the number of hospitalizations, estimated from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the literature published between January 2000 and September 2009 on multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) management, either by usual care or RPM to retrieve the number of hospitalizations and length of stay (LOS) for HF and for any cause. We performed a meta-analysis of 21 RCTs (5715 patients). Remote patient monitoring was associated with a significantly lower number of hospitalizations for HF [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91, P < 0.001] and for any cause (IRR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.96, P = 0.003), while LOS was not different. Direct costs for hospitalization for HF were approximated by diagnosis-related group (DRG) tariffs in Europe and North America and were used to populate an economic model. The difference in costs between RPM and usual care ranged from €300 to €1000, favouring RPM. These cost savings combined with a quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gain of 0.06 suggest that RPM is a 'dominant' technology over existing standard care. In a budget impact analysis, the adoption of an RPM strategy entailed a progressive and linear increase in costs saved. CONCLUSIONS: The novel cost-effectiveness data coupled with the demonstrated clinical efficacy of RPM should encourage its acceptance amongst clinicians and its consideration by third-party payers. At the same time, the scientific community should acknowledge the lack of prospectively and uniformly collected economic data and should request that future studies incorporate economic analyses.",2010-01-06909,21193439,Eur J Heart Fail,C Klersy,2010,/,,No,21193439,"C Klersy; Economic impact of remote patient monitoring: an integrated economic model derived from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in heart failure, Eur J Heart Fail, 2010-Dec-29; ():1388-9842",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Remote patient monitoring vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-7524.83,Euro,2008,-13319.95
7359,The cost effectiveness of rapid-acting insulin aspart compared with human insulin in type 2 diabetes patients: an analysis from the Japanese third-party payer perspective,"Abstract Objectives: The Nippon Ultra-Rapid Insulin and Diabetic Complication Evaluation Study (NICE Study) (NCT00575172) was a 5-year, open-label, randomised controlled trial which compared cardiovascular outcomes in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients intensively treated with regular human insulin or insulin aspart (NovoRapid; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark), a rapid-acting insulin analogue. The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of insulin aspart versus regular human insulin from the perspective of a Japanese third-party healthcare payer. Research design and methods: A discrete event-simulation model was developed in Microsoft Excel to assess the within-trial cost effectiveness and make longer-term clinical projections in patients treated with regular human insulin or insulin aspart. In addition to severe hypoglycaemia, the model captured myocardial and cerebral infarction events and percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft procedures. Within-trial mortality, incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular event probabilities were derived from the annual rates observed during the trial period, while post-trial outcomes were calculated using the event rates from the trial, adjusted for increasing patient age. Event costs were accounted from the healthcare payer perspective and expressed in 2008 Japanese yen (JPY), while health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was captured using event and state utilities. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cardiovascular event rates and costs were evaluated over 5- and 10-year time horizons and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess variability in model outcomes. Results: Over 5 years of treatment, insulin aspart dominated human insulin both in incremental life expectancy and in incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS). Insulin aspart was associated with a small improvement in discounted life expectancy of 0.005 years (4.688 vs. 4.684 years) and an increase of 0.023 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (3.800 vs. 3.776 QALYs) when compared with regular human insulin. Insulin aspart also incurred lower costs (JPY 481,586 vs. 594,717, difference -113,131) which resulted from the decreased incidence of cardiovascular events with insulin aspart (0.013 events per patient year vs. 0.030 on regular human insulin). Breakdown of costs indicated that pharmacy costs were higher with insulin aspart (JPY 346,608 vs. 278,468), but these costs were more than offset by the reduced costs associated with cardiovascular complications and hypoglycaemia over 5 years of treatment (JPY 134,978 vs. 316,249). Sensitivity analysis showed that insulin aspart was still cost-effective in the case where only 18% of the within-trial cardiovascular and mortality benefit over regular human insulin was captured in the model (assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of JPY 5,000,000). Limitations: The NICE study cohort was relatively small (n?=?325), meaning that caution should be exercised when calculating and interpreting the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Also, despite the differences in cardiovascular risk profile between the Japanese and UK populations, UKPDS-derived risk equations were used to project MI outcomes and PCI and CABG procedures and UKPDS HRQoL scores were applied to all health states. While these risk formulas and HRQoL utilities may not be directly applicable to the Japanese population, no equivalent Japanese-specific data are currently available. Conclusions: In a Japanese type 2 diabetes population, prescribing rapid-acting insulin aspart significantly reduced cardiovascular complications over 5- and 10-year time horizons, resulting in increased quality of life and decreased costs when compared with human insulin.",2010-01-06910,21192769,J Med Econ,RF Pollock,2010,/,,Yes,21192769,"RF Pollock; The cost effectiveness of rapid-acting insulin aspart compared with human insulin in type 2 diabetes patients: an analysis from the Japanese third-party payer perspective, J Med Econ, 2010-Dec-31; ():1369-6998",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Insulin aspart, a rapid-acting insulin analogue vs. Regular human insulin",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-4014650.75,Japan,2008,-46808.56

Furthermore, in the phase III TITAN trial (TMC114-C214), DRV/r 600/100?mg bid-based HAART generated a superior 48-week virological response rate compared with standard-of-care lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r; 400/100?mg bid)-based therapy in treatment-experienced, lopinavir-naive patients, and in particular those with one or more International AIDS Society - USA (IAS-USA) primary PI resistance-associated mutations at baseline. These patients had a broader degree of previous PI use/failure (0-=2) than the POWER patients. Objectives: To determine whether DRV/r 600/100?mg bid-based HAART is cost effective compared with LPV/r-based therapy, from the perspective of Belgian, Italian, Swedish and UK reimbursement authorities, when used in treatment-experienced patients similar to TITAN patients with one or more IAS-USA primary PI mutations at baseline. Methods: An existing Markov model containing health states defined by CD4 cell count ranges (>500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50?cells/mm3) and an absorbing state of death was adapted for use in the above-mentioned healthcare settings. Baseline demographics, CD4 cell count distribution, antiretroviral drug usage, virological/immunological response rates and matching transition probabilities were based on data collected during the first 48 weeks of therapy in the modelled subgroup of TITAN patients and the published literature. After treatment failure, patients were assumed to switch to a follow-on combination regimen. For each health state, utility values and mortality rates were obtained from the published literature. Data from local observational studies (Belgium, Sweden and Italy) or the published literature (UK) were used to determine resource-use patterns and costs associated with each CD4 cell count range. Unit costs were derived from official local sources; a lifetime horizon was taken and discount rates were chosen based on local guidelines. Results: The base-case analysis predicted quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains of 0.785 in Belgium, 0.608 in Italy, 0.584 in Sweden and 0.550 in the UK when DRV/r-based therapy was used instead of LPV/r-based treatment. The estimated base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were &U20AC;6964/QALY gained in Belgium, &U20AC;9277/QALY gained in Italy, &U20AC;6868 (SEK69?687)/QALY gained in Sweden and &U20AC;14?778 (£12?612)/QALY gained in the UK.

This study estimates the cost effectiveness of DRV/r from a US societal perspective when compared with LPV/r in treatment-experienced patients with a profile similar to those TITAN patients who had one or more International AIDS Society - USA (IAS-USA) primary protease inhibitor (PI) resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) at baseline. This population had less advanced HIV disease and a broader range of previous PI exposure/failure (0-=2 PIs) at enrolment than those in the darunavir phase IIb POWER trials. Methods: An existing Markov model containing six health states defined by CD4 cell count range (>500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50?cells/mm3) and an absorbing state of death was adapted. Baseline demographics, CD4 cell count distribution and antiretroviral drug usage, virological response (at week 24), and immunological response estimates and matching transition probabilities were based on data collected directly from the one or more IAS-USA PI mutation subpopulation during the first 48 weeks of the TITAN trial, as well as from published literature. Patients were assumed to switch to a regimen containing tipranavir plus an optimized background regimen after treatment failure. For each CD4 cell count range or health state, the utility values, HIV and non-HIV-related mortality rates, and non-antiretroviral-related cost of HIV care estimates were derived from published literature. Unit costs were derived from official local sources. A lifetime horizon was taken in the base-case analysis. Results: The base-case analysis predicted discounted quality-adjusted survival gains of 0.493 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for DRV/r compared with LPV/r, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$23?057 per QALY gained over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0.754 probability of an ICER below the threshold of US$50?000 per QALY gained. DRV/r remained cost effective over all parameter ranges tested in extensive one-way sensitivity analyses and variability analyses, which examined the impact of input parameter uncertainty and changes in model assumptions and treatment patterns, respectively. Shortening the model time horizon had the largest impact on the ICER, reducing it most notably to US$4919 with a 10-year time horizon. Conclusion: From a US societal perspective and based on an analysis of the patients with primary IAS-USA PI RAMs enrolled in the darunavir phase III TITAN trial, a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen containing DRV/r 600/100?mg bid is estimated to be a cost-effective therapy when compared with a HAART regimen containing LPV/r, for the management of treatment-experienced, PI-resistant, HIV-infected adults with a broad range of previous PI use/failure.",2010-01-06918,21182348,Pharmacoeconomics,A Brogan,2010,28 / S1,129-146,Yes,21182348,"A Brogan; US Cost Effectiveness of Darunavir/Ritonavir 600/100?mg bid in Treatment-Experienced, HIV-Infected Adults with Evidence of Protease Inhibitor Resistance Included in the TITAN Trial, Pharmacoeconomics, 2010-Dec-23; 28(S1):1179-2027; 129-146",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Darunavir with low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r) 600/100mg twice daily vs. Lopinavir with low-dose ritonavir (LPV/r),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,23057,United States,2008,27716.31

This study estimates the cost effectiveness of darunavir with ritonavir (DRV/r) in this population over 5-year and lifetime time horizons in the USA. Methods: A Markov model was used to follow a treatment-experienced HIV-1 cohort through six health states, based on CD4 cell count: greater than 500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50?cells/mm3, and death. The magnitude of the CD4 cell count increase and duration of increasing and stable periods were derived from week 48 DRV/r clinical trial results (POWER 1 and 2). The treatment pathway assumed one regimen switch following treatment failure on the initial regimen. The use of antiretroviral drugs was based on usage in DRV/r clinical trials. US daily wholesale acquisition costs were calculated using the recommended daily doses. For each CD4 cell count range, utility values, HIV-1-related mortality rates and costs for medical resources (other than antiretroviral drug costs) were obtained from published literature. Non-HIV-1-related mortality rates were calculated by applying a relative risk value to the US general population age and gender-specific mortality rates. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and variability analysis were performed. Results: In a 5-year analysis, patients receiving DRV/r experienced 3.80 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incurred total medical costs of US$217?288, while those receiving control PIs experienced 3.60 QALYs and incurred costs of US$218?962. DRV/r was both more effective and less costly than control PIs. For the lifetime analysis, the QALYs and lifetime medical costs with DRV/r were 10.03 and US$565?358, compared with 8.76 and US$527?287 with control PIs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for DRV/r compared with control PIs was US$30?046. One-way sensitivity analyses for both time horizons indicated that the results were most sensitive to changes in the rate of CD4 cell count change during stable and declining periods (lifetime only), duration of stable period (5-year only) and HIV-1-related mortality rates. The results of the variability analysis were most sensitive to the model time horizon. Nevertheless, for all ranges and scenarios tested in these analyses, the incremental cost per QALY gained remained below US$50?000. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there was a 0.921 and 0.950 probability of a cost-effectiveness ratio below US$50?000 per QALY for the 5-year and lifetime time horizon, respectively. Conclusions: DRV/r is predicted to be cost effective compared with control PI in highly treatment-experienced patients and is predicted to yield an average of 0.20 additional QALYs per treatment-experienced patient over 5 years and 1.27 additional QALYs over a lifetime in this population.",2010-01-06920,21182346,Pharmacoeconomics,J Mauskopf,2010,28 / S1,83-105,Yes,21182346,"J Mauskopf; Cost Effectiveness of Darunavir/Ritonavir in Highly Treatment-Experienced, HIV-1-Infected Adults in the USA, Pharmacoeconomics, 2010-Dec-23; 28(S1):1179-2027; 83-105",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Darunavir with ritonavir (DRV/r) vs. Best available Protease Inhibitor-based regimen,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,30046,United States,2008,36117.64
7373,Sacral neuromodulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence: analysis of cost-effectiveness,"Purpose: The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing sacral nerve modulation (SNM) as a treatment for fecal incontinence in Italy were evaluated in a simulation model. Methods: A decision-analysis model with a Markov submodel was used to represent clinical pathways for treatment of patients with fecal incontinence in a scenario with SNM and a scenario without SNM. Data were obtained from published studies and from an expert panel. Evaluation of resource consumption was conducted from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service, and costs were retrieved from the Italian NHS procedures reimbursement list. The time horizon was 5 years, and a 3% discount rate was applied to costs and outcomes. Effectiveness was measured in symptom-free years and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Fecal incontinence prevalence data and SNM usage forecasts were used to estimate budget impact over the next 5 years. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for introducing SNM was €28,285 per QALY gained for patients with a structurally deficient anal sphincter and €38,662 per QALY gained for patients with intact anal sphincters. If a threshold of €40,000 per QALY gained is set as the level that a decision-maker would regard as cost-effective, the probability that the introduction of SNM will be cost-effective would be 99% for patients with a structurally deficient sphincter and 53% for patients with an intact sphincter. Budget impact analysis showed that introducing SNM would have an estimated budget impact of 0.56% over 5 years on the budget allocated for fecal incontinence treatment.

7375,Cost-effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy in traumatic brain injuries,"Background and purpose: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is used regularly in traumatic brain injury (TBI). There are, however, no cost-effectiveness studies of the procedure. Methods: We evaluated the outcomes and treatment costs of all decompressive craniectomies performed between the 2000 and 2006 in a single institution to lower intractable intracranial pressure after TBI. The health-related quality of life was evaluated on the Euroqol (EQ-5D) questionnaire and on the visual-analogue scale (VAS), and cost of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was calculated. Results: In this study of 54 patients, the median follow-up time was 5.6 years. Overall mortality rate was 41%. Of the 22 non-survivors, 73% died within 30 days. For 32 survivors, the median EQ-5D index value was 0.85, which is equal to the normal population. The median VAS value was 73, whilst normal population's value is 80. Of the survivors, 81% (26/32) were able to live at home and 31% (10/32) returned to work. The cost of neurosurgical treatment for one QALY was 2400€. Estimation for all medical costs, including rehabilitation and anticipated future costs, resulted cost of a QALY 17 900 €. Conclusion Mortality after severe TBI leading to DC was high, but amongst the survivors, the health-related quality of life was equal to normal population. Most survivors were able to live at home and were almost as satisfied with their health as in general people are. Cost of neurosurgical treatment was low, and also including all evaluated costs, cost of a QALY gained was acceptable.",2010-01-06927,21175999,Eur J Neurol,Kirsi Malmivaara,2010,/,,No,21175999,"Kirsi Malmivaara; Cost-effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy in traumatic brain injuries, Eur J Neurol, 2010-Dec-22; ():1351-5101",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,6 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,2008,Not Stated
7376,Modelled cost-effectiveness of high cut-off haemodialysis compared to standard haemodialysis in the management of myeloma kidney,"Abstract Background: Approximately 10-20% of multiple myeloma patients experience dialysis-dependent renal failure. This is principally due to myeloma kidney, a tubulointerstitial injury caused by high circulating concentrations of monoclonal free light chains. Studies have found that between 3% and 37% of patients with myeloma kidney requiring dialysis recover renal function. In-vivo studies indicate that extended haemodialysis using high cut-off dialysers (HCO-HD) can remove significant quantities of free light chains and is associated with a renal recovery rate of 63-74% in these patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of HCO-HD compared to standard HD in the management of myeloma kidney. Methods: The study used a lifetime Excel-based decision tree model that followed all patients from treatment of the initial presentation with myeloma kidney requiring dialysis to death. It was populated with published clinical data, United Kingdom costs and expert opinion, using a National Health Service perspective and 3.5% annual discounting. Results: HCO-HD was dominant to standard HD, meaning it was both more effective (greater life years and quality adjusted life years) and less costly, due to a greater increase in the proportion of patients recovering renal function. The model projected lifetime costs of £31,345 per patient for patients treated with standard haemodialysis only and £24,845 for the new treatment (discounted). The model predicted an average survival of 19.92 months for patients on standard HD and 33.90 months for the new therapy (discounted). Conclusions: The analysis found that treatment of myeloma kidney using an extended schedule of HCO-HD may substantially improve renal recovery in multiple myeloma patients compared to standard HD, resulting in greater life expectancy and cost savings due to avoided chronic dialysis. Limitations of the study include those common to rare diseases including small study sizes and limited natural history data.",2010-01-06928,21175375,Curr Med Res Opin,D T Grima,2010,/,,No,21175375,"D T Grima; Modelled cost-effectiveness of high cut-off haemodialysis compared to standard haemodialysis in the management of myeloma kidney, Curr Med Res Opin, 2010-Dec-23; ():0300-7995",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Extended haemodialysis using high cut-off dialysers (HCO-HD) vs. Standard haemodialysis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-8666.67,United Kingdom,2009,-15138.38
7377,The Cost-Effectiveness and Population Outcomes of Expanded HIV Screening and Antiretroviral Treatment in the United States,"Background: Although recent guidelines call for expanded routine screening for HIV, resources for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited, and all eligible persons are not currently receiving treatment. Objective: To evaluate the effects on the U.S. HIV epidemic of expanded ART, HIV screening, or interventions to reduce risk behavior. Design: Dynamic mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression and cost-effectiveness analysis. Data Sources: Published literature. Target Population: High-risk (injection drug users and men who have sex with men) and low-risk persons aged 15 to 64 years in the United States. Time Horizon: Twenty years and lifetime (costs and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]). Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Expanded HIV screening and counseling, treatment with ART, or both. Outcome Measures: New HIV infections, discounted costs and QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results of Base-Case Analysis: One-time HIV screening of low-risk persons coupled with annual screening of high-risk persons could prevent 6.7% of a projected 1.23 million new infections and cost $22 382 per QALY gained, assuming a 20% reduction in sexual activity after screening. Expanding ART utilization to 75% of eligible persons prevents 10.3% of infections and costs $20 300 per QALY gained. A combination strategy prevents 17.3% of infections and costs $21 580 per QALY gained. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: With no reduction in sexual activity, expanded screening prevents 3.7% of infections. Earlier ART initiation when a CD4 count is greater than 0.350 × 10(9) cells/L prevents 20% to 28% of infections. Additional efforts to halve high-risk behavior could reduce infections by 65%. Limitation: The model of disease progression and treatment was simplified, and acute HIV screening was excluded. Conclusion: Expanding HIV screening and treatment simultaneously offers the greatest health benefit and is cost-effective.

7381,"Use of Internal Stent, External Transanastomotic Stent or No Stent During Pediatric Pyeloplasty: A Decision Tree Cost-Effectiveness Analysis","PURPOSE:: Copious studies exist regarding the use of stents in pediatric pyeloplasty. Most surgeons use either no stent, an internal (Double-J®) stent or an external transanastomotic pyeloureteral stent. We propose the first known study to compare all 3 methods using a decision tree model that incorporates success rates, complications, patient discomfort and costs. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We created a deterministic decision tree model. We conducted a literature search querying urinary diversion in pediatric pyeloplasty. We used the largest studies for base inputs and remaining studies for sensitivity analysis. Direct costs from actual patients seen at the University of California San Francisco populated cost inputs. RESULTS:: Total quality adjusted life-years during a 16-year period for no stents was 12.70851 with a total cost of $6,122. Total quality adjusted life-years for external stents was 12.71098 at a total cost of $5,702. Internal stents resulted in total quality adjusted life-years of 12.69983 and cost of $8,421. Thus, external stents dominated no stents and internal stents, while no stents dominated internal stents. On sensitivity analysis even decreasing complication and failure rates of internal stents to zero did not make them cost effective due to the costs associated with stent removal. In contrast, decreasing complication and pyeloplasty rates of no stents by 20% resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5,475 per quality adjusted life-year gained compared to external stents.

7383,"Use of Internal Stent, External Transanastomotic Stent or No Stent During Pediatric Pyeloplasty: A Decision Tree Cost-Effectiveness Analysis","PURPOSE:: Copious studies exist regarding the use of stents in pediatric pyeloplasty. Most surgeons use either no stent, an internal (Double-J®) stent or an external transanastomotic pyeloureteral stent. We propose the first known study to compare all 3 methods using a decision tree model that incorporates success rates, complications, patient discomfort and costs. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We created a deterministic decision tree model. We conducted a literature search querying urinary diversion in pediatric pyeloplasty. We used the largest studies for base inputs and remaining studies for sensitivity analysis. Direct costs from actual patients seen at the University of California San Francisco populated cost inputs. RESULTS:: Total quality adjusted life-years during a 16-year period for no stents was 12.70851 with a total cost of $6,122. Total quality adjusted life-years for external stents was 12.71098 at a total cost of $5,702. Internal stents resulted in total quality adjusted life-years of 12.69983 and cost of $8,421. Thus, external stents dominated no stents and internal stents, while no stents dominated internal stents. On sensitivity analysis even decreasing complication and failure rates of internal stents to zero did not make them cost effective due to the costs associated with stent removal. In contrast, decreasing complication and pyeloplasty rates of no stents by 20% resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5,475 per quality adjusted life-year gained compared to external stents. CONCLUSIONS:: External and no stents are superior to internal stents.

7384,Universal Prophylaxis is Cost Effective in Cytomegalovirus Serology-Positive Kidney Transplant Patients,"BACKGROUND.: The economic merit of universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy in the management of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection for serology positive (R+) kidney transplant patients remains undefined. We performed cost effectiveness and cost utility modeling comparing these two approaches. METHODS.: The incidence of CMV infection under universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy was determined among 653 R+ patients from our institution and 416 R+ patients from various clinic trials, respectively. Standardized decision tree analysis and Markov transitional models were used to calculate cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the prototypical clinical data and published literature. Incremental cost effectiveness and cost utility were calculated as dollars for one case of infection avoided and one QALY gained over 10 years, respectively. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS.: The incidence of CMV infection was 4.1% and 55.5% within the first year after transplant for universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy, respectively. Compared with preemptive therapy, universal prophylaxis incurred $1464 more in direct cost while saving $7309 in indirect cost, and resulted in a net gain of 0.209 in QALYs per patient over a 10-year period. Thus, universal prophylaxis dominates over preemptive therapy with a cost saving of $27,967 for 1 QALY gained. This cost saving was sensitive to the variation in the rate of CMV infection and disease with each approach. CONCLUSION.: Universal prophylaxis in CMV R+ kidney transplant patients is clinically effective and cost saving.

7388,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin A treatment for patients with idiopathic overactive bladder,"Study Type - Therapy (economic analysis)?Level of Evidence 1b OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the costs and effects value of either starting with sacral neuromodulation (SNM) or botulinum toxin A (BTX) treatment in patients with refractory idiopathic overactive bladder from a societal perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An economic model comparing SNM with BTX was developed. A clinical relevant effect (i.e. success) was defined as 50% or greater reduction in incontinence episodes or urgency frequency symptoms. Information on the clinical effectiveness of the two treatments and on the course of the disease with the two treatments were based primarily on published literature and, when required, on expert opinion. Both treatments were assumed to be performed under general anaesthesia and, for SNM treatment, first-stage tined lead test was used. All costs were based on national data from the year 2008. Analyses from the societal perspective were conducted for a 5-year duration. Costs were discounted at 4% and effects at 1.5%. In addition, different modelling scenarios were used to see determine any changes in the results obtained. RESULTS: Starting with SNM resulted in a higher quality adjusted life year (QALY) gain (differenceof 0.23) and a higher cost (difference of €6428) compared to starting with BTX. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €27 991/QALY. The probability of this ratio being cost effective (e.g. under €40 000/QALY) is 88%. SNM starts to be cost-effective after 4 years. SNM was not cost-effective in some other scenarios, such as when BTX was conducted under local anaesthesia or when peripheral nerve evaluation or bilateral testing was used for SNM. CONCLUSIONS: Starting with SNM, treatment is cost-effective after 5 years compared to BTX. However, in some scenarios, such as the use of local anaesthesia for BTX treatment and SNM peripheral nerve evaluation or bilateral test, SNM was not cost-effective.",2010-01-06937,21166750,BJU Int,RK Leong,2010,/,,No,21166750,"RK Leong; Cost-effectiveness analysis of sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin A treatment for patients with idiopathic overactive bladder, BJU Int, 2010-Dec-16; ():1464-4096",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) vs. Botulinum toxin A (BTX) treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,4.00,1.50,27991,Euro,2008,49547.76
7389,Cost-effectiveness model for a specific mixture of prebiotics in The Netherlands,"The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the use of prebiotics for the primary prevention of atopic dermatitis in The Netherlands. A model was constructed using decision analytical techniques. The model was developed to estimate the health economic impact of prebiotic preventive disease management of atopic dermatitis. Data sources used include published literature, clinical trials and official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was no supplementation with prebiotics. The primary perspective for conducting the economic evaluation was based on the situation in The Netherlands in 2009. The results show that the use of prebiotics infant formula (IMMUNOFORTIS(®)) leads to an additional cost of <euro> 51 and an increase in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) of 0.108, when compared with no prebiotics. Consequently, the use of infant formula with a specific mixture of prebiotics results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of <euro> 472. The sensitivity analyses show that the ICER remains in all analyses far below the threshold of <euro> 20,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the favourable health benefit of the use of a specific mixture of prebiotics results in positive short- and long-term health economic benefits.

7390,Cost Utility of Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention with Dutasteride in Men with an elevated PSA,"BackgroundIn the REDUCE trial, dutasteride reduced the relative risk of prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis over a 4 year period by 22.8% but questions remain regarding the cost-effectiveness of widespread utilization. We evaluated the cost-utility of chemoprevention using dutasteride in men at elevated risk for CaP. Methods A Markov decision analysis model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis was designed to determine the lifetime prostate-health-related costs, beginning at age 50, for men treated with dutasteride compared with placebo who are at elevated risk for CaP. Model assumptions were based on data in REDUCE; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results program; literature review of costs, utilities, and transition rates among various prostate cancer health states; and local institutional cost data.Results Under the assumptions of the base case analysis, dutasteride chemoprevention is associated with a gain of 108 QALYs per 1000 men and the quality-adjusted cost-effectiveness ratio for dutasteride compared to men not receiving chemoprevention was $140,240 per QALYs. At a cost of $626 per year, down from the current cost of $1400, the model predicts a cost benefit from dutasteride with a willingness to pay threshold lower than $50K. Assuming a 15% period prevalence renders an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $576,630 per QALYs and a 30% period prevalence would yield a $98,059 per QALYs.Conclusions Dutasteride is unlikely to be cost-effective when considering the impact on survival differences among treated versus untreated groups.

7391,Cost-effectiveness of Exercise Therapy in Patients with Intermittent Claudication: Supervised Exercise Therapy versus a 'Go Home and Walk' Advice,"OBJECTIVES: The Exercise Therapy in Peripheral Arterial Disease (EXITPAD) study has shown supervised exercise therapy (SET) to be more effective regarding walking distance and quality of life than a 'go home and walk' advice (WA) for patients with intermittent claudication. The present study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of SET versus WA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the EXITPAD study, a 12-month randomised controlled trial in 304 patients with claudication, was used to study the proportion of costs to walking distance and quality of life. Two different incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for SET versus WA: costs per extra metre on the treadmill test, and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). QALYs were based on utilities derived from the EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D). RESULTS: Mean total costs were higher for SET than for WA (3407 versus 2304 Euros), mainly caused by the costs of exercise therapy. The median walking distance was 620 m for SET and 400 m for WA. QALYs were 0.71 for SET and 0.67 for WA. All differences were statistically significant. The ICER for cost per extra metre on the 12-month treadmill test was € 4.08. For cost per QALY, the ICER was € 28693.

7392,Universal cervical length screening to prevent preterm birth: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether routine 2(nd) trimester transvaginal cervical length ultrasound in low risk singleton pregnancies is a cost-effective strategy. METHODS: We developed a decision analysis model to compare the cost-effectiveness of two strategies to identify pregnancies at risk for preterm birth: 1) no routine cervical length screening and 2) a single routine transvaginal cervical length measurement at 18-24 weeks gestation. In our model, women identified at increased risk (cervical length <1.5cm) for preterm birth would be offered daily vaginal progesterone supplementation. We assumed that vaginal progesterone reduced preterm birth <34 weeks gestation by 45%. We also assumed that a decreased cervical length could result in additional costs (ultrasounds, inpatient admission) without significantly improved neonatal outcomes. The main outcome measure was Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Our model predicts that routine cervical length screening is a dominant strategy when compared to routine care. For every 100,000 women screened, $12,119,947 can be potentially saved (in 2010 dollars) and 423.9 quality adjusted life-years (QALY) could be gained. Additionally, we estimate that 22 cases of neonatal death or long-term neurologic deficits could be prevented per 100,000 women screened. Screening remained cost-effective but was no longer the dominant strategy when cervical length ultrasound costs exceeded $187 or when vaginal progesterone reduced delivery risk <34 weeks by less than 20%. CONCLUSION: In low-risk pregnancies, universal transvaginal cervical length ultrasound screening appears to be a cost-effective strategy under a wide range of clinical circumstances (varied preterm birth rates, predictive values of a shortened cervix and costs).Universal transvaginal cervical length ultrasound screening appears to be a cost-effective strategy under a wide range of clinical circumstances.

7394,Cost-effectiveness of ablation surgery in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery,"This study was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of concomitant ablation surgery (AS) compared to regular cardiac surgery in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients over a one-year follow-up. Cost analysis was performed from a societal perspective alongside a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, multicentre trial. One hundred and fifty patients with documented AF were randomly assigned to undergo cardiac surgery with or without AS. One hundred and thirty-two patients were included in the cost-effectiveness study. All costs (medical and non-medical) were measured during follow-up. Costs data were combined with quality adjusted life years (QALYs) to obtain the incremental costs per QALY. Total costs of the AS group were significantly higher compared to the regular cardiac surgery group [cost difference bootstrap: €4,724; 95% uncertainty interval (UI), €2,770-€6,678]. The bootstrapped difference in QALYs was not statistically significant (0.06; 95% UI: -0.024 to 0.14). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to €73,359 per QALY. The acceptability curve showed that, even in the case of a maximum threshold value of €80,000 per QALY gained, the probability of AS being more cost-effective than regular cardiac surgery did not reach beyond 50%. Concluding that concomitant AS in AF is not cost-effective after a one-year follow-up compared to regular cardiac surgery.

7395,Cost-Effectiveness of Genetic Testing in Family Members of Patients With Long-QT Syndrome,"Background Family members of patients with established long-QT syndrome (LQTS) often lack definitive clinical findings, yet may have inherited an LQTS mutation and be at risk of sudden death. Genetic testing can identify mutations in 75% of patients with LQTS, but genetic testing of family members remains controversial. Methods and Results We used a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 strategies for treating an asymptomatic 10-year-old, first-degree relative of a patient with clinically evident LQTS. In the genetic testing strategy, relatives undergo genetic testing only for the mutation identified in the index patient, and relatives who test positive for the mutation are treated with ß-blockers. This strategy was compared with (1) empirical treatment of relatives with ß-blockers and (2) watchful waiting, with treatment only after development of symptoms. The genetic testing strategy resulted in better survival and quality-adjusted life years at higher cost, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $67 400 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with watchful waiting. The cost-effectiveness of the genetic testing strategy improved to less than $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained when applied selectively either to (1) relatives with higher clinical suspicion of LQTS (pretest probability 65% to 81%), or to (2) families with a higher than average risk of sudden death, or to (3) larger families (2 or more first-degree relatives tested).

7397,Treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with or without rituximab: cost-effectiveness and value of information based on a 5-year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Rituximab induction together with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and rituximab maintenance (RCHOP-R) resulted to significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in comparison to RCHOP in the EORTC20981 trial of relapsed/refractory follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (FL). However, the overall survival (OS) difference between RCHOP-R and RCHOP was insignificant. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of RCHOP, RCHOP-R, and CHOP in the treatment of relapsed/refractory FL. Design: A lifetime Markov modeling based on the 5-year EORTC20981 survivals (Weibull regressions) was carried out from the public health care payer perspective. Finnish costs (drug, routine, adverse event, and relapse management) were employed. The main outcomes were incremental cost (€2008) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), progression-free year (PFY), and life-years gained (LYG). Analyses included cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier and multinomial expected value of perfect information (mEVPI). RESULTS: RCHOP-R resulted to OS (PFS) benefit compared with RCHOP and CHOP: 6 (10) and 17 (25) months, respectively. The incremental costs per QALY gained/LYG/PFY gained were €18?147/€16?380/€10?416 for RCHOP-R versus RCHOP (mEVPI €5196); €14?360/€13?041/€8976 for RCHOP-R versus CHOP (mEVPI €1986); and €12?123/€11?049/€8004 for RCHOP versus CHOP (mEVPI €1,240).

7398,Treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with or without rituximab: cost-effectiveness and value of information based on a 5-year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Rituximab induction together with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and rituximab maintenance (RCHOP-R) resulted to significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in comparison to RCHOP in the EORTC20981 trial of relapsed/refractory follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (FL). However, the overall survival (OS) difference between RCHOP-R and RCHOP was insignificant. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of RCHOP, RCHOP-R, and CHOP in the treatment of relapsed/refractory FL. Design: A lifetime Markov modeling based on the 5-year EORTC20981 survivals (Weibull regressions) was carried out from the public health care payer perspective. Finnish costs (drug, routine, adverse event, and relapse management) were employed. The main outcomes were incremental cost (€2008) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), progression-free year (PFY), and life-years gained (LYG).

7399,Cost-Utility Estimation of Surgical Treatment of Pancreatic Carcinoma Aimed at Cure,"BACKGROUND: Little is reported on costs for radical tumor resections of pancreatic carcinoma in relationship to adjusted quality of life survival postoperatively. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the cost utility of surgical treatment aimed at cure. METHODS: A population-based cohort of patients with exocrine or ampullary pancreatic adenocarcinoma resected for cure in Gothenburg University Hospitals during 1998-2005 were evaluated retrospectively (n = 139). Total inpatient and outpatient healthcare costs were available for 103 patients, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) (based on the SF-36 Health Survey) were assessed preoperatively and postoperataively in 119 patients. Survival and utility index (SF-36-6D) across 5 years of postoperative follow-up were used to achieve quality adjusted life years. RESULTS: Mean survival after resection was 977 days for patients with exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, with expected differences among subgroups as related to disease stage (p < 0.01), in agreement with international reports. The HRQL index was 0.65 ± 0.06 preoperatively, 0.63 ± 0.04 early postoperatively (<1 year) and 0.69 ± 0.06 at long-term follow-up (1-5 years) compared to 0.77 ± 0.02 in age-matched healthy reference individuals from the Swedish population (p < 0.05). Total lifetime costs for treatments including surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy were <euro>39,000 per patient, with a mean of 1.13 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.93-1.40) QALYs across 5 years follow-up. The cost per QALY was <euro>35,000 (95% CI <euro>28,026-<euro>41,947). CONCLUSIONS: Resection aimed at cure of pancreatic exocrine ductal carcinoma provided costs for one quality adjusted year of survival comparable to other complex surgical treatments within cost limits regarded as reasonable to bear by the Swedish health care system, as well as in several other Western countries.",2010-01-06963,21132294,World J Surg,D Ljungman,2010,/,,No,21132294,"D Ljungman; Cost-Utility Estimation of Surgical Treatment of Pancreatic Carcinoma Aimed at Cure, World J Surg, 2010-Dec-04; ():0364-2313",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgical resection aimed at cure vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,34636,Euro,2009,58227.74
7400,Economic evaluation of fractional flow reserve-guided percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease,"Background: The Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation (FAME) study demonstrated significantly improved health outcomes at 1 year in patients randomized to multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR) compared with percutaneous coronary intervention guided by angiography alone. The economic impact of routine measurement of FFR in this setting is not known. Methods and results: In this study, 1005 patients were randomly assigned to FFR-guided or angiography-guided percutaneous coronary intervention and followed up for 1 year. A prospective cost-utility analysis comparing costs and quality-adjusted life-years was performed with a time horizon of 1 year. Quality-adjusted life-years were calculated with the use of utilities determined by the EuroQuol 5 dimension health survey with US weights. Direct medical costs included those of the index procedure and hospitalization and costs for major adverse cardiac events during follow-up. Confidence intervals for both quality-adjusted life-years and costs were estimated by the bootstrap percentile method. Major adverse cardiac events at 1 year occurred in 13.2% of those in the FFR-guided arm and 18.3% of those in the angiography-guided arm (P=0.02). Quality-adjusted life-years were slightly greater in the FFR-guided arm (0.853 versus 0.838; P=0.2). Mean overall costs at 1 year were significantly less in the FFR-guided arm ($14 315 versus $16 700; P<0.001). Bootstrap simulation indicated that the FFR-guided strategy was cost-saving in 90.74% and cost-effective at a threshold of US $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-years in 99.96%. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robust results. Conclusion: Economic evaluation of the FAME study reveals that FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel coronary disease is one of those rare situations in which a new technology not only improves outcomes but also saves resources.
