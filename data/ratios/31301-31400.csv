31301,Implications of scaling up cardiovascular disease treatment in South Africa: a microsimulation and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors-particularly hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes-have become an increasing concern for middle-income countries. Using newly available, nationally representative data, we assessed how cardiovascular risk factors are distributed across subpopulations within South Africa and identified which cardiovascular treatments should be prioritised. METHODS: We created a demographically representative simulated population for South Africa and used data from 17 743 respondents aged 15 years or older of the 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES) to assign information on cardiovascular risk factors to each member of the simulated population. We created a microsimulation model to estimate the health and economic implications of two globally recognised treatment recommendations: WHO''s package of essential non-communicable disease interventions (PEN) and South Africa''s Primary Care 101 (SA PC 101) guidelines. The primary outcome was total disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted through treatment of all cardiovascular disease or microvascular type 2 diabetes complications per 1000 population. We compared outcomes at the aspirational level of achieving access to treatment among 70% of the population. FINDINGS: Based on the SANHANES data, South Africans had a high prevalence of hypertension (24.8%), dyslipidaemia (17.5%), and diabetes (15.3%). Prevalence was disproportionately high and treatment low among male, black, and poor populations. Our simulated population experienced a burden of 40.0 DALYs (95% CI 29.5-52.0) per 1000 population per year from cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes complications at current treatment levels, which lowered to 32.9 DALYs (24.4-44.7) under WHO PEN implementation and to 32.5 (24.4-44.8) under SA PC 101 implementation. Under both guidelines, there were increases in blood pressure treatment (4.2 percentage points under WHO PEN vs 12.6 percentage points under SA PC 101), lipid treatment (16.0 vs 14.9), and glucose control medications (1.2 vs 0.6). The incremental cost-effectiveness of implementing SA PC 101 over current treatment would be a saving of US$24 902 (95% CI 14 666-62 579) per DALY averted compared with a saving of $17 587 (1840-42 589) under WHO PEN guidelines. INTERPRETATION: Cardiovascular risk factors are common and disproportionate among disadvantaged populations in South Africa. Treatment with blood pressure agents and statins might need greater prioritisation than blood glucose therapies, which contrasts with observed treatment levels despite a lower monthly cost of blood pressure or statin treatment than of sulfonylurea or insulin treatment.

31302,Risks and benefits of dolutegravir-based antiretroviral drug regimens in sub-Saharan Africa: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir could have a major role in future antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in sub-Saharan Africa because of its high potency and barrier to resistance, good tolerability, and low cost, but there is uncertainty over appropriate policies for use relating to the potential for drug resistance spread and a possible increased risk of neural tube defects in infants if used in women at the time of conception. We used an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission, progression, and the effect of ART with the aim of informing policy makers on approaches to the use of dolutegravir that are likely to lead to the highest population health gains. METHODS: We used an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and progression in adults, which takes into account the effects of drug resistance and differential drug potency in determining viral suppression and clinical outcomes to compare predicted outcomes of alternative ART regimen policies. We calculated disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) for each policy, assuming that a woman having a child with a neural tube defect incurs an extra DALY per year for the remainder of the time horizon and accounting for mother-to-child transmission. We used a 20 year time horizon, a 3% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$500 per DALY averted. FINDINGS: The greatest number of DALYs is predicted to be averted with use of a policy in which tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir is used in all people on ART, including switching to tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir in those currently on ART, regardless of current viral load suppression and intention to have (more) children. This result was consistent in several sensitivity analyses. We predict that this policy would be cost-saving. INTERPRETATION: Using a standard DALY framework to compare health outcomes from a public health perspective, the benefits of transition to tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir for all substantially outweighed the risks.

31306,The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in Gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Tens of thousands of people die from dog-mediated rabies annually. Deaths can be prevented through post-exposure prophylaxis for people who have been bitten, and the disease eliminated through dog vaccination. Current post-exposure prophylaxis use saves many lives, but availability remains poor in many rabies-endemic countries due to high costs, poor access, and supply. METHODS: We developed epidemiological and economic models to investigate the effect of an investment in post-exposure prophylaxis by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We modelled post-exposure prophylaxis use according to the status quo, with improved access using WHO-recommended intradermal vaccination, with and without rabies immunoglobulin, and with and without dog vaccination. We took the health provider perspective, including only direct costs. FINDINGS: We predict more than 1 million deaths will occur in the 67 rabies-endemic countries considered from 2020 to 2035, under the status quo. Current post-exposure prophylaxis use prevents approximately 56 000 deaths annually. Expanded access to, and free provision of, post-exposure prophylaxis would prevent an additional 489 000 deaths between 2020 and 2035. Under this switch to efficient intradermal post-exposure prophylaxis regimens, total projected vaccine needs remain similar (about 73 million vials) yet 17.4 million more people are vaccinated, making this an extremely cost-effective method, with costs of US$635 per death averted and $33 per disability-adjusted life-years averted. Scaling up dog vaccination programmes could eliminate dog-mediated rabies over this time period; improved post-exposure prophylaxis access remains cost-effective under this scenario, especially in combination with patient risk assessments to reduce unnecessary post-exposure prophylaxis use. INTERPRETATION: Investing in post-exposure vaccines would be an extremely cost-effective intervention that could substantially reduce disease burden and catalyse dog vaccination efforts to eliminate dog-mediated rabies.

31307,Costs and cost-effectiveness analyses of mCARE strategies for promoting care seeking of maternal and newborn health services in rural Bangladesh,"OBJECTIVE: We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness between two mHealth programs, implemented from 2011 to 2015 in rural Bangladesh: (1) Comprehensive mCARE package as an intervention group and (2) Basic mCARE package as a control group. METHODS: Both programs included a core package of census enumeration and pregnancy surveillance provided by an established cadre of digitally enabled community health workers (CHWs). In the comprehensive mCARE package, short message service (SMS) and home visit reminders were additionally sent to pregnant women (n = 610) and CHWs (n = 70) to promote the pregnant women''s care-seeking of essential maternal and newborn care services. Economic costs were assessed from a program perspective inclusive of development, start-up, and implementation phases. Effects were calculated as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and the number of newborn deaths averted. For comparative purposes, we normalized our evaluation to estimate total costs and total newborn deaths averted per 1 million people in a community for both groups. Uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analyses with Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: The addition of SMS and home visit reminders based on a mobile phone-facilitated pregnancy surveillance system was highly cost effective at a cost per DALY averted of $31 (95% uncertainty range: $19-81). The comprehensive mCARE program had at least 88% probability of being highly cost-effective as compared to the basic mCARE program based on the threshold of Bangladesh''s GDP per capita.

31310,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the community-based management of hypertension in Nepal study (COBIN): a retrospective analysis,"BACKGROUND: The greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease is hypertension, which can be alleviated via diet, exercise, and adherence to medication. Yet, blood pressure control in Nepal is inadequate, which is partly hindered by a lack of evidence-based, low-cost, scalable, and cost-effective cardiovascular disease prevention programmes. The the community-based management of hypertension in Nepal (COBIN) study was a 12-month community-based hypertension management programme of blood pressure monitoring and lifestyle counselling intervention undertaken by female community health volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal, against usual care, which showed success in reducing blood pressure. Here we aimed to retrospectively quantify the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of the scale-up of the programme. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we collected participant-level data from the COBIN study; programme delivery cost data from programme administrators from the COBIN study group; and popualtion and other data from WHO, the World Bank, and the Nepalese Government. We estimated costs per participant and total costs of a national scale-up of the COBIN programme focusing on two scenarios: scenario A, delivery of the intervention to only people aged 25-65 years with hypertension; and scenario B, delivery of the intervention to all adults aged 25-65 years regardless of hypertension status. Effectiveness was based on in-trial blood pressure reductions converted to cardiovascular disease disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. The primary cost-effectiveness measure was incremental cost per averted cardiovascular disease DALY (calculated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) from a health system perspective, including programme delivery and incremental medication costs. We did univariate sensitivity analyses of scenario B to assess the effect of uncertainty in key parameter values in our calculations. FINDINGS: From a health system perspective, the first-year budget impact was US$7.1 million in scenario A and $10.8 million in scenario B. With each subsequent year, the costs decreased by approximately 50%. In the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, from the health system perspective, scenario A resulted in an ICER of $582 per DALY averted and scenario B resulted in an ICER of $411 per DALY averted. The ICER was most sensitive to uncertainty in the number of total avertable cardiovascular disease DALYs in the eligible population.

31311,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the community-based management of hypertension in Nepal study (COBIN): a retrospective analysis,"BACKGROUND: The greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease is hypertension, which can be alleviated via diet, exercise, and adherence to medication. Yet, blood pressure control in Nepal is inadequate, which is partly hindered by a lack of evidence-based, low-cost, scalable, and cost-effective cardiovascular disease prevention programmes. The the community-based management of hypertension in Nepal (COBIN) study was a 12-month community-based hypertension management programme of blood pressure monitoring and lifestyle counselling intervention undertaken by female community health volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal, against usual care, which showed success in reducing blood pressure. Here we aimed to retrospectively quantify the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of the scale-up of the programme. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we collected participant-level data from the COBIN study; programme delivery cost data from programme administrators from the COBIN study group; and popualtion and other data from WHO, the World Bank, and the Nepalese Government. We estimated costs per participant and total costs of a national scale-up of the COBIN programme focusing on two scenarios: scenario A, delivery of the intervention to only people aged 25-65 years with hypertension; and scenario B, delivery of the intervention to all adults aged 25-65 years regardless of hypertension status. Effectiveness was based on in-trial blood pressure reductions converted to cardiovascular disease disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. The primary cost-effectiveness measure was incremental cost per averted cardiovascular disease DALY (calculated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) from a health system perspective, including programme delivery and incremental medication costs. We did univariate sensitivity analyses of scenario B to assess the effect of uncertainty in key parameter values in our calculations. FINDINGS: From a health system perspective, the first-year budget impact was US$7.1 million in scenario A and $10.8 million in scenario B. With each subsequent year, the costs decreased by approximately 50%. In the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, from the health system perspective, scenario A resulted in an ICER of $582 per DALY averted and scenario B resulted in an ICER of $411 per DALY averted. The ICER was most sensitive to uncertainty in the number of total avertable cardiovascular disease DALYs in the eligible population. INTERPRETATION: The programme is projected to be highly cost-effective in both scenarios compared with the WHO thresholds for cost-effectiveness for Nepal.

31312,"Health economic assessment of a scenario to promote bicycling as active transport in Stockholm, Sweden","OBJECTIVES: To conduct a health economic evaluation of a proposed investment in urban bicycle infrastructure in Stockholm County, Sweden. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis is undertaken from a healthcare perspective. Investment costs over a 50-year life cycle are offset by averted healthcare costs and compared with estimated long-term impacts on morbidity, quantified in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The results are re-calculated under different assumptions to model the effects of uncertainty. SETTING: The Municipality of Stockholm (population 2.27 million) committed funds for bicycle path infrastructure with the aim of achieving a 15% increase in the number of bicycle commuters by 2030. This work is based on a previously constructed scenario, in which individual registry data on home and work address and a transport model allocation to different modes of transport identified 111 487 individuals with the physical capacity to bicycle to work within 30 min but that currently drive a car to work. RESULTS: Morbidity impacts and healthcare costs attributed to increased physical activity, change in air pollution exposure and accident risk are quantified under the scenario. The largest reduction in healthcare costs is attributed to increased physical activity and the second largest to reduced air pollution exposure among the population of Greater Stockholm. The expected net benefit from the investment is 8.7% of the 2017 Stockholm County healthcare budget, and 3.7% after discounting. The economic evaluation estimates that the intervention is cost-effective and each DALY averted gives a surplus of euro9933. The results remained robust under varied assumptions pertaining to reduced numbers of additional bicycle commuters.

31313,Cost-Effectiveness of Exploratory Laparotomy in a Regional Referral Hospital in Eastern Uganda,"BACKGROUND: Surgical disease increasingly contributes to global mortality and morbidity. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery found that global cost-effectiveness data are lacking for a wide range of essential surgical procedures. This study helps to address this gap by defining the cost-effectiveness of exploratory laparotomies in a regional referral hospital in Uganda. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A time-and-motion analysis was utilized to calculate operating theater personnel costs per case. Ward personnel, administrative, medication, and supply costs were recorded and calculated using a microcosting approach. The cost in 2018 US Dollars (USD, $) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted was calculated based on age-specific life expectancies for otherwise fatal cases. RESULTS: Data for 103 surgical patients requiring exploratory laparotomy at the Soroti Regional Referral Hospital were collected over 8 mo. The most common cause for laparotomy was small bowel obstruction (32% of total cases). The average cost per patient was $75.50. The postoperative mortality was 11.7%, and 7.8% of patients had complications. The average number of DALYs averted per patient was 18.51. The cost in USD per DALY averted was $4.08. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provides evidence that exploratory laparotomy is cost-effective compared with other public health interventions. Relative cost-effectiveness includes a comparison with bed nets for malaria prevention ($6.48-22.04/DALY averted), tuberculosis, tetanus, measles, and polio vaccines ($12.96-25.93/DALY averted), and HIV treatment with multidrug antiretroviral therapy ($453.74-648.20/DALY averted).

The Triple Pill versus Usual Care Management for Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) trial showed a greater reduction in blood pressure in patients using fixed-combination, low-dose, triple-pill antihypertensive therapy (consisting of amlodipine, telmisartan, and chlorthalidone) than in those receiving usual care in Sri Lanka. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the triple-pill strategy. METHODS: We did a within-trial (6-month) and modelled (10-year) economic evaluation of the TRIUMPH trial, using the health system perspective. Health-care costs, reported in 2017 US dollars, were determined from trial records and published literature. A discrete-time simulation model was developed, extrapolating trial findings of reduced systolic blood pressure to 10-year health-care costs, cardiovascular disease events, and mortality. The primary outcomes were the proportion of people reaching blood pressure targets (at 6 months from baseline) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted (at 10 years from baseline). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to estimate the cost per additional participant achieving target blood pressure at 6 months and cost per DALY averted over 10 years. FINDINGS: The triple-pill strategy, compared with usual care, cost an additional US$9.63 (95% CI 5.29 to 13.97) per person in the within-trial analysis and $347.75 (285.55 to 412.54) per person in the modelled analysis.

INTERPRETATION: Compared with usual care, the triple-pill strategy is cost-effective for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

31319,"Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination pill for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa: a modelling study","BACKGROUND: Fewer than 25% of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in countries of low and middle income (LMICs) use guideline-directed drugs for secondary prevention. A fixed-dose combination polypill might improve cardiovascular outcomes by increasing prescription rates and adherence, but the cost-effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. METHODS: We developed microsimulation models to assess the cost-effectiveness of a polypill containing aspirin, lisinopril, atenolol, and simvastatin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared with current care in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa. We modelled baseline use of secondary prevention drugs on the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological study. In the intervention arm, we assumed that patients currently prescribed any prevention drug for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease would receive the polypill instead, which would improve adherence by 32% (from a meta-analysis of two randomised trials in LMICs). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the polypill at prices in the public sector and on the retail market. Key outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) over a 5-year period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the perspective of the health-care sector and a lifetime analytical horizon. We assumed a cost-effectiveness threshold equal to each country''s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. In sensitivity analyses, we examined the population health effect achievable by increasing the uptake of the polypill in the eligible population. FINDINGS: Among adults aged 30-84 years with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adoption of the polypill for secondary prevention compared with current care was projected to avert 40-54 major adverse cardiovascular events for every 1000 patients treated for 5 years and produce between three and ten additional serious adverse events. Assuming public-sector pharmaceutical prices, the ICER of the polypill compared with current care over a lifetime analytical horizon was Int$168 (95% UI 55 to 337) per DALY averted in China, $154 (57 to 289) in India, $88 (15 to 193) in Mexico, $364 (147 to 692) in Nigeria, and $64 (cost-saving to 203) in South Africa, amounting to 0.4-6.2% of the per capita GDP in these countries. The ICER of the polypill compared with current care increased to 3.3-14.6% of the per capita GDP at retail market pharmaceutical prices. Use of the polypill at current rates of prescription of secondary prevention drugs would produce modest health benefits, reducing DALYs from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among patients with established disease by 3.1-10.1% over 10 years. Increasing use to 50% or 75% of the eligible population would produce substantially larger health gains (up to 24.3% atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease DALYs averted). INTERPRETATION: The polypill is projected to be cost-effective compared with current care for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa, particularly if it is made available at public-sector pricing. However, achieving meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health will require simultaneous investments in health infrastructure to increase the uptake of the polypill among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

METHODS: We developed microsimulation models to assess the cost-effectiveness of a polypill containing aspirin, lisinopril, atenolol, and simvastatin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared with current care in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa. We modelled baseline use of secondary prevention drugs on the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological study. In the intervention arm, we assumed that patients currently prescribed any prevention drug for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease would receive the polypill instead, which would improve adherence by 32% (from a meta-analysis of two randomised trials in LMICs). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the polypill at prices in the public sector and on the retail market. Key outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) over a 5-year period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the perspective of the health-care sector and a lifetime analytical horizon. We assumed a cost-effectiveness threshold equal to each country''s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. In sensitivity analyses, we examined the population health effect achievable by increasing the uptake of the polypill in the eligible population. FINDINGS: Among adults aged 30-84 years with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adoption of the polypill for secondary prevention compared with current care was projected to avert 40-54 major adverse cardiovascular events for every 1000 patients treated for 5 years and produce between three and ten additional serious adverse events. Assuming public-sector pharmaceutical prices, the ICER of the polypill compared with current care over a lifetime analytical horizon was Int$168 (95% UI 55 to 337) per DALY averted in China, $154 (57 to 289) in India, $88 (15 to 193) in Mexico, $364 (147 to 692) in Nigeria, and $64 (cost-saving to 203) in South Africa, amounting to 0.4-6.2% of the per capita GDP in these countries. The ICER of the polypill compared with current care increased to 3.3-14.6% of the per capita GDP at retail market pharmaceutical prices. Use of the polypill at current rates of prescription of secondary prevention drugs would produce modest health benefits, reducing DALYs from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among patients with established disease by 3.1-10.1% over 10 years. Increasing use to 50% or 75% of the eligible population would produce substantially larger health gains (up to 24.3% atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease DALYs averted). INTERPRETATION: The polypill is projected to be cost-effective compared with current care for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa, particularly if it is made available at public-sector pricing. However, achieving meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health will require simultaneous investments in health infrastructure to increase the uptake of the polypill among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

31327,"Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination pill for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa: a modelling study","BACKGROUND: Fewer than 25% of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in countries of low and middle income (LMICs) use guideline-directed drugs for secondary prevention. A fixed-dose combination polypill might improve cardiovascular outcomes by increasing prescription rates and adherence, but the cost-effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. METHODS: We developed microsimulation models to assess the cost-effectiveness of a polypill containing aspirin, lisinopril, atenolol, and simvastatin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared with current care in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa. We modelled baseline use of secondary prevention drugs on the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological study. In the intervention arm, we assumed that patients currently prescribed any prevention drug for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease would receive the polypill instead, which would improve adherence by 32% (from a meta-analysis of two randomised trials in LMICs). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the polypill at prices in the public sector and on the retail market. Key outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) over a 5-year period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the perspective of the health-care sector and a lifetime analytical horizon. We assumed a cost-effectiveness threshold equal to each country''s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. In sensitivity analyses, we examined the population health effect achievable by increasing the uptake of the polypill in the eligible population. FINDINGS: Among adults aged 30-84 years with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adoption of the polypill for secondary prevention compared with current care was projected to avert 40-54 major adverse cardiovascular events for every 1000 patients treated for 5 years and produce between three and ten additional serious adverse events. Assuming public-sector pharmaceutical prices, the ICER of the polypill compared with current care over a lifetime analytical horizon was Int$168 (95% UI 55 to 337) per DALY averted in China, $154 (57 to 289) in India, $88 (15 to 193) in Mexico, $364 (147 to 692) in Nigeria, and $64 (cost-saving to 203) in South Africa, amounting to 0.4-6.2% of the per capita GDP in these countries. The ICER of the polypill compared with current care increased to 3.3-14.6% of the per capita GDP at retail market pharmaceutical prices. Use of the polypill at current rates of prescription of secondary prevention drugs would produce modest health benefits, reducing DALYs from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among patients with established disease by 3.1-10.1% over 10 years. Increasing use to 50% or 75% of the eligible population would produce substantially larger health gains (up to 24.3% atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease DALYs averted). INTERPRETATION: The polypill is projected to be cost-effective compared with current care for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa, particularly if it is made available at public-sector pricing. However, achieving meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health will require simultaneous investments in health infrastructure to increase the uptake of the polypill among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

The authors aim to (1) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of plastic and reconstructive surgery in the developing world and (2) quantify the economic benefit. METHODS: In this study, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of surgical trips performed by ReSurge International from 2014 to 2017. The organization gathered data on trip information, cost, and clinical characteristics. The authors measured the cost-effectiveness of the interventions using cost per disability-adjusted life-years and defined cost-effectiveness using World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds. The authors also performed a cost-to-benefit analysis using the human capital approach. RESULTS: A total of 22 surgical trips from eight different developing countries were included in this study. The authors analyzed a total of 756 surgical interventions. The cost-effectiveness of the surgical trips ranged from $52 to $11,410 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. The economic benefit for the 22 surgical trips was $9,795,384. According to World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds, 21 of the surgical trips were considered very cost-effective or cost-effective.

The authors aim to (1) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of plastic and reconstructive surgery in the developing world and (2) quantify the economic benefit. METHODS: In this study, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of surgical trips performed by ReSurge International from 2014 to 2017. The organization gathered data on trip information, cost, and clinical characteristics. The authors measured the cost-effectiveness of the interventions using cost per disability-adjusted life-years and defined cost-effectiveness using World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds. The authors also performed a cost-to-benefit analysis using the human capital approach. RESULTS: A total of 22 surgical trips from eight different developing countries were included in this study. The authors analyzed a total of 756 surgical interventions. The cost-effectiveness of the surgical trips ranged from $52 to $11,410 per disability-adjusted life-year averted.

The economic benefit for the 22 surgical trips was $9,795,384. According to World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds, 21 of the surgical trips were considered very cost-effective or cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic and reconstructive operations performed during short-term surgical trips performed by this organization are economically sustainable. High-volume trips and those treating complex surgical conditions prove to be the most cost-effective. To continue to receive monetary funding, providing fiscally sustainable surgical care to low- and middle-income countries is imperative.",2019-99-32068,31461047,Plast Reconstr Surg,Jacob S Nasser,2019,144 / 3,485e-493e,No,31461047,"Jacob S Nasser; Sebastian Willert; Anja Weissenfels; Matthias Kohl; Simon von Stengel; Michael Frohlich; Heinz Kleinoder; Daniel Schone; Marc Teschler; Wolfgang Kemmler; Evaluating the Economic Impact of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgical Efforts in the Developing World: The ReSurge Experience, Plast Reconstr Surg, 2019 Sep; 144(3):0032-1052; 485e-493e",DALY,Viet Nam,Not Stated,Surgical,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,252,United States,2017,266.08
31351,Accounting for aetiology: can regional surveillance data alongside host biomarker-guided antibiotic therapy improve treatment of febrile illness in remote settings?,"Background: Across Southeast Asia, declining malaria incidence poses a challenge for healthcare providers, in how best to manage the vast majority of patients with febrile illnesses who have a negative malaria test. In rural regions, where the majority of the population reside, empirical treatment guidelines derived from central urban hospitals are often of limited relevance. In these settings, relatively untrained health workers deliver care, often without any laboratory diagnostic support. In this paper, our aim was to model the impact on mortality from febrile illness of using point-of-care C-reactive protein testing to inform the decision to prescribe antibiotics and regional surveillance data to inform antibiotic selection, rooted in the real-world context of rural Savannakhet province, southern Laos. Methods: Our model simulates 100 scenarios with varying quarterly incidence of six key pathogens known to be prevalent in rural Laos. In the simulations, community health workers either prescribe antibiotics in-line with current practice as documented in health facilities in rural Laos, or with the aid of the two interventions. We provide cost-effectiveness estimates for each strategy alone and then for an integrated approach using both interventions. Results: We find that each strategy alone is predicted to be highly cost-effective, and that the combined approach is predicted to result in the biggest reduction in mortality (averting a predicted 510 deaths per year in rural Savannakhet, a 28% reduction compared to standard practice) and is highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of just $66 per disability-adjusted life year averted. Conclusions: Substantial seasonal variation in the predicted optimal empirical antibiotic treatment for febrile illness highlights the benefits of up-to-date information on regional causes of fever.

31354,Targeted hepatitis E vaccination for women of childbearing age is cost-effective in China,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is hyper-endemic in China, it is characterized with a high morbidity of fulminant hepatitis and mortality in pregnant women. The first hepatitis E vaccine, HEV 239, was licensed in China in 2011 which provides an effective preventive measure. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with HEV 239 in women of childbearing age in China and whether HEV antibody screening should be considered before vaccination. METHODS: A decision tree-Markov model was constructed to simulate HEV infection in a closed female cohort with an average first-marriage age of 25years and evaluate health and economic outcomes of two potential vaccination strategies, direct vaccination and combined screening and vaccination, from a societal perspective. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, additional costs per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted) was calculated for each vaccination strategy versus no vaccination and between two vaccination strategies. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model findings. RESULTS: ICERs of direct vaccination and combined screening and vaccination versus no vaccination were $4040 and $3114 per DALY averted, respectively, much lower than 1-time Chinese per-capita GDP ($8127). Direct vaccination would need additional $45,455 for each DALY averted compared with combined screening and vaccination, far more than the 3-time per-capita GDP. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed our findings that two vaccination strategies would be cost-effective if the willingness-to-pay reached the 1-time per-capita GDP, and that combined screening and vaccination would be more cost-effective than direct vaccination strategy.

31357,The cost-effectiveness of stepped care for the treatment of anxiety disorders in adults: A model-based economic analysis for the Australian setting,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of stepped care compared to care as usual (CAU) for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate anxiety disorders from a health sector perspective in the Australian setting. METHOD: A decision tree model was constructed to estimate the cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted over a 12-month time horizon. The model compared a three-step stepped care intervention to CAU. Stepped care included an initial phase of guided self-help, followed by face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacotherapy as the final step. The model adopted a health sector perspective, used epidemiological parameters and disability weights obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Effect sizes were derived from a randomized trial of stepped care and a longitudinal cohort study. Costs were expressed in 2013 Australian dollars (A$). Multivariate probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Stepped care was found to be cost-effective compared to CAU with an incremental cost-effective ratio of A$3093 per DALY averted. One-hundred percent of the uncertainty iterations fell below the A$50,000 per DALY averted willingness-to-pay threshold commonly used in Australia. The evaluation was most sensitive to changes in diagnosis rates and effect sizes. CONCLUSION: A three-step model of stepped care appears to be cost-effective for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate anxiety disorders from the Australian health sector perspective.

METHODS: Analysis was undertaken of direct per-person costs of CPAP therapy (according to 5-year care pathways), health system and other costs of OSA and its comorbidities averted by CPAP treatment (5-year adherence rate 56.7%) and incremental benefit of therapy (in terms of disability-adjusted life years [DALYs] averted) to determine cost-effectiveness of CPAP. This was expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (= dollars per DALY averted). Direct costs of CPAP were estimated from government reimbursements for services and advertised equipment costs. Costs averted were calculated from both the health care system perspective (health system costs only) and societal perspective (health system plus other financial costs including informal care, productivity losses, nonmedical accident costs, deadweight taxation and welfare losses). These estimates of costs (expressed in US dollars) and DALYs averted were based on our recent analyses of costs of untreated OSA. RESULTS: From the health care system perspective, estimated cost of CPAP therapy to treat OSA was $12 495 per DALY averted while from a societal perspective the effect was dominant (-$10 688 per DALY averted) meaning it costs more not to treat the problem than to treat it.

To reduce this burden, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 10) was introduced into the general childhood national immunization program in Ethiopia in 2011. However, there is little evidence on its cost-effectiveness, and the aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of PCV 10 vaccination in the Ethiopian setting. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out based on a quasi-experimental evaluation of implementing PCV 10 at the Butajira rural health program site in Ethiopia. The intervention and the control groups consisted 876 and 1010 children, respectively. Using data from program site''s surveillance system database as a framework, health outcome and vaccination data were collected from medical records, immunization registration books and reports. Disability- Adjusted Life Year (DALY) was a main health outcome metric complimented by incidence of acute lower respiratory infection/1000-person years. Vaccination and treatment costs were collected by document review and cross-sectional household survey. RESULTS: In the intervention cohort, 626 of 876 (71.5%) children received PCV 10 vaccination. Until the first year of life, the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection was higher in the intervention group. After the first year of life, the incidence rate was 35.2 per 1000-person years in the intervention group compared to 60.4 per 1000-person years in the control group.

Disability- Adjusted Life Year (DALY) was a main health outcome metric complimented by incidence of acute lower respiratory infection/1000-person years. Vaccination and treatment costs were collected by document review and cross-sectional household survey. RESULTS: In the intervention cohort, 626 of 876 (71.5%) children received PCV 10 vaccination.

31368,Potential impact and cost-effectiveness of future ETEC and Shigella vaccines in 79 low- and lower middle-income countries,"While diarrhea mortality in children has declined over the last two decades, there has been a slower decline in diarrheal episodes. Repeated diarrheal episodes are associated with childhood stunting, which leads to increased mortality risk from infectious diseases. Vaccine candidates are under development for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [ETEC] and Shigella, important enteric pathogens in children in low income countries. These future vaccines could significantly reduce diarrheal burden, prevent ETEC- and Shigella-induced stunting, and stunting-associated mortality. We developed a cost-effectiveness model for two putative standalone ETEC and Shigella vaccine candidates to evaluate vaccine impact on mortality, morbidity, stunting, and stunting-associated deaths from other infectious diseases. We modeled impact over the first ten years after vaccine introduction in children under five years old living in 79 low and low-middle income countries. ETEC and Shigella diarrhea would cause an estimated 239,300 [95% UL: 179,700-309,800] and 340,300 [256,500-440,800] child deaths, respectively, from years 2025 to 2034.

31384,Informing decision-making for universal access to quality tuberculosis diagnosis in India: an economic-epidemiological model,"BACKGROUND: India and many other high-burden countries have committed to providing universal access to high-quality diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing (DST) for tuberculosis (TB), but the most cost-effective approach to achieve this goal remains uncertain. Centralized testing at district-level hub facilities with a supporting sample transport network can generate economies of scale, but decentralization to the peripheral level may provide faster diagnosis and reduce losses to follow-up (LTFU). METHODS: We generated functions to evaluate the costs of centralized and decentralized molecular testing for tuberculosis with Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), a WHO-endorsed test which can be performed at centralized and decentralized levels. We merged the cost estimates with an agent-based simulation of TB transmission in a hypothetical representative region in India to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of each strategy. RESULTS: Compared against centralized Xpert testing, decentralization was most favorable when testing volume at decentralized facilities and pre-treatment LTFU were high, and specimen transport network was exclusively established for TB. Assuming equal quality of centralized and decentralized testing, decentralization was cost-saving, saving a median $338,000 (interquartile simulation range [IQR] - $222,000; $889,000) per 20 million people over 10 years, in the most cost-favorable scenario. In the most cost-unfavorable scenario, decentralized testing would cost a median $3161 [IQR $2412; $4731] per disability-adjusted life year averted relative to centralized testing. CONCLUSIONS: Decentralization of Xpert testing is likely to be cost-saving or cost-effective in most settings to which these simulation results might generalize. More decentralized testing is more cost-effective in settings with moderate-to-high peripheral testing volumes, high existing clinical LTFU, inability to share specimen transport costs with other disease entities, and ability to ensure high-quality peripheral Xpert testing.

31388,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the implementation of a National Immunization Program for rotavirus vaccination in a country with a low rotavirus gastroenteritis-related mortality: A South Korean study,"Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis among children younger than 5years in South Korea. Two rotavirus vaccines (RVs), pentavalent human-bovine reassortant vaccine (Rotateq(R); RV5) and attenuated human strain originated monovalent vaccine (Rotarix(R); RV1), have been available for voluntary vaccination using out-of-pocket payment since 2007 and 2008, respectively. Yet, RVs are not included in the National Immunization Program (NIP), partly because of the low associated mortality rate. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of RVs to assist the evidence-based decision-making process for NIP implementation in South Korea. Using a transparent age-structured static cohort model, we simulated the experience of ten annual birth cohorts of South Korean children from 2018 to 2027. Model inputs included rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) incidence and mortality rates, RVGE treatment costs, vaccine coverage and timeliness, and vaccine effectiveness and price. The incremental costs of including RVs in the NIP compared to no vaccination were 59,662,738 USD and 152,444,379 USD for RV1 and RV5, respectively. The introduction of RV1 and RV5 can prevent 4799 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 5068 DALYs. From the societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for adopting RV into the NIP versus no vaccination were 12,432 USD per DALY averted for RV1 and 30,081 USD per DALY averted for RV 5. The weighted average for the ICERs of the two vaccines computed using the market share of each vaccine in the current voluntary use as a weight, was 21,698 USD per DALY averted. The estimated ICER was below 1xgross domestic product per capita (30,000 USD), which has been a commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold for health care technology assessment in South Korea, suggesting that introducing RVs into the NIP would be cost-effective.",2019-99-32348,31326252,Vaccine,Hankil Lee,2019,37 / 35,4987-4995,Yes,31326252,"Hankil Lee; David J Beard; Loretta J Davies; Jonathan A Cook; Graeme Maclennan; Andrew Price; Seamus Kent; Jemma Hudson; Andrew Carr; Jose Leal; Helen Campbell; Ray Fitzpatrick; Nigel Arden; David Murray; Marion K Campbell; TOPKAT Study Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of the implementation of a National Immunization Program for rotavirus vaccination in a country with a low rotavirus gastroenteritis-related mortality: A South Korean study, Vaccine, 2019 Aug 14; 37(35):1873-2518; 4987-4995",DALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Immunization,Rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,12432,United States,2018,12813.42
31389,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the implementation of a National Immunization Program for rotavirus vaccination in a country with a low rotavirus gastroenteritis-related mortality: A South Korean study,"Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis among children younger than 5years in South Korea. Two rotavirus vaccines (RVs), pentavalent human-bovine reassortant vaccine (Rotateq(R); RV5) and attenuated human strain originated monovalent vaccine (Rotarix(R); RV1), have been available for voluntary vaccination using out-of-pocket payment since 2007 and 2008, respectively. Yet, RVs are not included in the National Immunization Program (NIP), partly because of the low associated mortality rate. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of RVs to assist the evidence-based decision-making process for NIP implementation in South Korea. Using a transparent age-structured static cohort model, we simulated the experience of ten annual birth cohorts of South Korean children from 2018 to 2027.

31390,The cost-effectiveness of the use of selective media for the diagnosis of melioidosis in different settings,"BACKGROUND: Melioidosis is a frequently fatal disease requiring specific treatment. The yield of Burkholderia pseudomallei from sites with a normal flora is increased by culture using selective, differential media such as Ashdown''s agar and selective broth. However, since melioidosis mainly affects people in resource-poor countries, the cost effectiveness of selective culture has been questioned. We therefore retrospectively evaluated this in two laboratories in southeast Asia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results of all cultures in the microbiology laboratories of Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos and Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia, in 2017 were reviewed. We identified patients with melioidosis who were only diagnosed as a result of culture of non-sterile sites and established the total number of such samples cultured using selective media and the associated costs in each laboratory. We then conducted a rudimentary cost-effectiveness analysis by determining the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per DALY averted and compared this against the 2017 GDP per capita in each country. Overall, 29 patients in Vientiane and 9 in Siem Reap (20% and 16.9% of all culture-positive patients respectively) would not have been diagnosed without the use of selective media, the majority of whom (18 and 8 respectively) were diagnosed by throat swab culture. The cost per additional patient detected by selective culture was approximately $100 in Vientiane and $39 in Siem Reap. Despite the different patient populations (all ages in Vientiane vs. only children in Siem Reap) and testing strategies (all samples in Vientiane vs. based on clinical suspicion in Siem Reap), selective B. pseudomallei culture proved highly cost effective in both settings, with an ICER of ~$170 and ~$28 in Vientiane and Siem Reap, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Selective culture for B. pseudomallei should be considered by all laboratories in melioidosis-endemic areas.

31392,Cost-per-diagnosis as a metric for monitoring cost-effectiveness of HIV testing programmes in low-income settings in southern Africa: health economic and modelling analysis,"INTRODUCTION: As prevalence of undiagnosed HIV declines, it is unclear whether testing programmes will be cost-effective. To guide their HIV testing programmes, countries require appropriate metrics that can be measured. The cost-per-diagnosis is potentially a useful metric. METHODS: We simulated a series of setting-scenarios for adult HIV epidemics and ART programmes typical of settings in southern Africa using an individual-based model and projected forward from 2018 under two policies: (i) a minimum package of ""core"" testing (i.e. testing in pregnant women, for diagnosis of symptoms, in sex workers, and in men coming forward for circumcision) is conducted, and (ii) core-testing as above plus additional testing beyond this (""additional-testing""), for which we specify different rates of testing and various degrees to which those with HIV are more likely to test than those without HIV. We also considered a plausible range of unit test costs. The aim was to assess the relationship between cost-per-diagnosis and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the additional-testing policy. The discount rate used in the base case was 3% per annum (costs in 2018 U.S. dollars). RESULTS: There was a strong graded relationship between the cost-per-diagnosis and the ICER. Overall, the ICER was below $500 per-DALY-averted (the cost-effectiveness threshold used in primary analysis) so long as the cost-per-diagnosis was below $315. This threshold cost-per-diagnosis was similar according to epidemic and programmatic features including the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV, the HIV incidence and a measure of HIV programme quality (the proportion of HIV diagnosed people having a viral load <1000 copies/mL). However, restricting to women, additional-testing did not appear cost-effective even at a cost-per-diagnosis of below $50, while restricting to men additional-testing was cost-effective up to a cost-per-diagnosis of $585. The threshold cost per diagnosis for testing in men to be cost-effective fell to $256 when the cost-effectiveness threshold was $300 instead of $500, and to $81 when considering a discount rate of 10% per annum.

To guide their HIV testing programmes, countries require appropriate metrics that can be measured. The cost-per-diagnosis is potentially a useful metric. METHODS: We simulated a series of setting-scenarios for adult HIV epidemics and ART programmes typical of settings in southern Africa using an individual-based model and projected forward from 2018 under two policies: (i) a minimum package of ""core"" testing (i.e. testing in pregnant women, for diagnosis of symptoms, in sex workers, and in men coming forward for circumcision) is conducted, and (ii) core-testing as above plus additional testing beyond this (""additional-testing""), for which we specify different rates of testing and various degrees to which those with HIV are more likely to test than those without HIV. We also considered a plausible range of unit test costs. The aim was to assess the relationship between cost-per-diagnosis and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the additional-testing policy. The discount rate used in the base case was 3% per annum (costs in 2018 U.S. dollars). RESULTS: There was a strong graded relationship between the cost-per-diagnosis and the ICER. Overall, the ICER was below $500 per-DALY-averted (the cost-effectiveness threshold used in primary analysis) so long as the cost-per-diagnosis was below $315. This threshold cost-per-diagnosis was similar according to epidemic and programmatic features including the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV, the HIV incidence and a measure of HIV programme quality (the proportion of HIV diagnosed people having a viral load <1000 copies/mL). However, restricting to women, additional-testing did not appear cost-effective even at a cost-per-diagnosis of below $50, while restricting to men additional-testing was cost-effective up to a cost-per-diagnosis of $585. The threshold cost per diagnosis for testing in men to be cost-effective fell to $256 when the cost-effectiveness threshold was $300 instead of $500, and to $81 when considering a discount rate of 10% per annum.
