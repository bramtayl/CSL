6301,A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF THREE TREATMENTS FOR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION,"PURPOSE:: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pegaptanib sodium and ranibizumab injections compared with photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration. METHODS:: The analyses were performed using outcomes data from the pivotal trials for each treatment and the medicare reimbursable costs for each treatment and associated medical procedures. A multistate transition model with 3-month cycles was created to compare incremental medical costs associated with pegaptanib or ranibizumab versus PDT for patients with starting vision of 20/40, 20/80, and 20/200 Snellen equivalent. RESULTS:: Two-year medical treatment costs ranged from $3,100 to $54,100 depending on treatment and lesion type. Photodynamic therapy was less costly and more effective than pegaptanib for predominantly classic and minimally classic lesions. Ranibizumab was not only more effective but also more costly than PDT for all lesion types. CONCLUSION:: Compared with PDT, pegaptanib is inferior in both cost and effectiveness, whereas ranibizumab has a greater effectiveness. Because ranibizumab does not meet 1 of the common thresholds for being considered cost effective (<$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year), there is rationale to seek other therapies that are more cost effective.",2009-01-05736,19940805,Retina,Emily W Gower,2009,/,,No,19940805,"Emily W Gower; Sandra D Cassard; Eric B Bass; Oliver D Schein; Neil M Bressler; A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF THREE TREATMENTS FOR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION, Retina, 2009-Nov-23; ():0275-004X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pagaptanib sodium injection vs. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-915500,United States,2009,-1104431.73
6302,Cost-Effectiveness of the Boston Keratoprosthesis,"PURPOSE: To conduct a cost-utility analysis and determine the cost-effectiveness of the Boston Keratoprosthesis (Boston Kpro). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: setting: The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary corneal service. patients: Inclusion required a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patients with autoimmune diseases and chemical burns were excluded. Eighty-two patients were included with various indications for surgery. intervention: The keratoprosthesis is a collar button-shaped polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) device consisting of 2 curved plates sandwiched around a corneal donor (allo)graft. The device is assembled intraoperatively and sutured to a patient's eye after removing the diseased cornea. main outcome measures: Average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was determined by cost-utility analysis, using expected-value calculations and time-tradeoff utilities. The comparative effectiveness, or gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), was also sought. Cost-effectiveness was compared to recently published data on penetrating keratoplasty (PK). RESULTS: A total discounted incremental QALY gain for the Boston Kpro of 0.763 correlated with a conferred QALY gain of 20.3% for the average patient. The average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was $16 140 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Comparable to corneal transplantation, with a cost-effectiveness between $12 000 and $16 000 per QALY, the keratoprosthesis can be considered highly cost-effective.",2009-01-05739,19939347,Am J Ophthalmol,Jared D Ament,2009,/,,No,19939347,"Jared D Ament; Tomasz P Stryjewski; Joseph B Ciolino; Amit Todani; James Chodosh; Claes H Dohlman; Cost-Effectiveness of the Boston Keratoprosthesis, Am J Ophthalmol, 2009-Nov-23; ():0002-9394",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Boston Keratoprosthesis vs. Corneal transplantation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,16140,United States,2009,19470.81
6303,Cost-effectiveness of multifaceted evidence implementation programs for the prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis,"Using a computer simulation model, we determined that an intervention aimed at improving the management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is likely to be cost-effective to third-party health insurers only if it focuses on individuals with very high fracture risk and the proportion of prescriptions for generic bisphosphonates increases substantially. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to determine whether an evidence implementation program (intervention) focused on increasing appropriate management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) might be cost-effective compared with current practice (no intervention) from the perspective of a third-party health insurer. METHODS: We developed a Markov microsimulation model to determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The hypothetical patient cohort was of current chronic glucocorticoid users 50-65 years old and 70% female. Model parameters were derived from published literature, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The intervention resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $298,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and $206,000 per hip fracture averted. If the cohort's baseline risk of fracture was increased by 50% (10-year cumulative incidence of hip fracture of 14%), the ICERs improved significantly: $105,000 per QALY and $137,000 per hip fracture averted. The ICERs improved significantly if the proportion of prescriptions for generic bisphosphonates was increased to 75%, with $113,000 per QALY and $77,900 per hip fracture averted. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence implementation programs for the management of GIOP are likely to be cost-effective to third-party health insurers only if they are targeted at individuals with a very high risk of fracture and the proportion of prescriptions for less expensive generic bisphosphonates increases substantially.",2009-01-05744,19937227,Osteoporos Int,T Beukelman,2009,/,,No,19937227,"T Beukelman; K G Saag; J R Curtis; M L Kilgore; M Pisu; Cost-effectiveness of multifaceted evidence implementation programs for the prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, Osteoporos Int, 2009-Nov-24; ():0937-941X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Appropriate management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis vs. Current practice (no intervention),Not Stated,65 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,298000,United States,2007,371973.25
6304,The Cost Effectiveness and Cost Utility of Valsartan in Chronic Heart Failure Therapy in Italy: A Probabilistic Markov Model,"To evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of the use of valsartan in addition to standard therapy for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The study was conducted by means of a cohort simulation based on a probabilistic Markov model and projecting the 23-month follow-up results of the Val-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure Trial) study over a 10-year time horizon. The model included four states (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II, III, IV, and death), and had a cycle duration of 1 month. Probabilistic simulations were performed using the WinBUGS software for Bayesian analysis. The distribution of patient parameters (sex, age, use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and ACE inhibitors) in the simulated population were derived from the Italian heart failure patient population. Individual mortality data were derived from general mortality data by multiplying by a NYHA state-specific relative risk, while the probability of changing NYHA class was taken from the Val-HeFT data. Costs (2007 values) were calculated from the perspective of the Italian Health Service (IHS) and included costs for drugs and heart failure hospitalizations. Quality-of-life (QOL) weights were obtained by using published health-related QOL data for heart failure patients. A 3.5% annual discount rate was applied. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed on each parameter using original-source 95% confidence interval (CI) values, or a +/-10% range when 95% CI values were unavailable. For the 10-year time horizon, patients were estimated to live for an average of 2.3 years or 1.7 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with slight increases in the valsartan group. In this group, hospitalizations for worsening heart failure were predicted to be significantly reduced and overall treatment costs per patient to decrease by about &U20AC;550. In subgroup analyses, valsartan lost dominance in patients in NYHA II, and in those receiving beta-adrenoceptor antagonists or ACE inhibitors; the mean incremental cost-utility ratio for these groups was 21 240, 129 200, and 36 500 &U20AC;/QALY, respectively. Valsartan in addition to standard therapy is predicted to dominate standard therapy alone in Italian patients with mild to severe heart failure and low LVEF. There are relevant differences among various patient subgroups, and valsartan is expected to be good value for money particularly in the treatment of the most severe and less intensively treated (no ACE inhibitors, no beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) heart failure patients.",2009-01-05756,19929036,Am J Cardiovasc Drugs,Lorenzo Pradelli,2009,9 / 6,383-392,No,19929036,"Lorenzo Pradelli; Sergio Iannazzo; Orietta Zaniolo; The Cost Effectiveness and Cost Utility of Valsartan in Chronic Heart Failure Therapy in Italy: A Probabilistic Markov Model, Am J Cardiovasc Drugs, 2009-Dec-01; 9(6):1175-3277; 383-392",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Valsartan vs. Standard therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-36933.34,Euro,2007,-63207.9

6307,Cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty in patients with symptomatic vertebral compression fractures in a UK setting,"Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a procedure used to treat vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). We developed a cost-effectiveness model to evaluate BKP in United Kingsdom patients with hospitalised VCFs and estimated the cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to non-surgical management. The results indicate that BKP provides a cost-effective alternative for treating these patients. INTRODUCTION: VCFs of osteoporotic patients are associated with chronic pain, a reduction in health-related quality of life (QoL) and high healthcare costs. BKP is a minimally invasive procedure that has resulted in pain relief, vertebral body height-restoration, decreased kyphosis and improved physical functioning in patients with symptomatic VCFs. BKP was shown to improve health-related QoL in a 12-month interim analysis of a randomised phase-III trial. METHODS: The objectives of this study were to develop a Markov cost-effectiveness model to evaluate BKP in patients with painful hospitalised VCFs and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of BKP compared with non-surgical management in a UK setting. It was assumed that QoL-benefits found at 12 months linearly approached zero during another 2 years, and that patients receiving BKP warranted six fewer hospital bed days compared with patients given non-surgical management. RESULTS: The procedure was associated with quality-adjusted life-years (QALY)-gains of 0.17 and cost/QALY-gains at pound8,800. The results were sensitive to assumptions about avoided length of hospital-stay and persistence of kyphoplasty-related QoL-benefits.

6308,Results of a Markov model analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of a single tablet of fixed-dose amlodipine and atorvastatin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Korea,"BACKGROUND: In Korea, the treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia constitutes an important strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the cost-effectiveness (from the Korean health care system perspective) of prescribing a proprietary formulation single-tablet fixed-dose combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin (at weighted mean doses of 5 mg and 10.25 mg, respectively) to all eligible patients aged > or = 45 years for the primary prevention of CVD (ie, coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke) in Korea, compared with currently observed patterns of blood-pressure and lipid-lowering medication prescription and use. METHODS: A Markov model was developed with 4 health states: alive without CVD, alive with CVD, dead from CVD, and dead from non-CVD causes. The model population comprised 244 Koreans aged >/=45 years from the 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES) without a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke who met current criteria for both blood-pressure and lipid-lowering treatment. From a 2008 baseline, follow-up was simulated for 40 years. Cardiovascular risk was estimated for each subject individually using a multivariate, Asian population-specific equation, and updated with ongoing cycles. Decision analysis compared the effects of prescribing the fixed-dose combination to all subjects versus currently observed patterns of treatment. Data regarding the blood-pressure and lipid-lowering efficacies of combination therapy were drawn from the Respond trial. Costs of the fixed-dose combination tablet and CVD were sourced from pharmaceutical pricing lists and Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Services estimates, respectively. Utility values for CVD were obtained from a large Korean utility study. RESULTS: In the model, of the 244 treatment-eligible subjects, 126 (51.6%) and 13 (5.3%) were taking blood-pressure and lipid-lowering therapy, respectively. Use of single-tablet fixed-dose combination amlodipine and atorvastatin by all subjects was associated with estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 7,773,063 Korean won (KRW) per quality-adjusted life-year gained and 10,378,230 KRW per overall life-year gained (1300 KRW approximately US $1). Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicated these results to be robust. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, based on data from the 2005 KNHNES, hypertension and dyslipidemia were undertreated among Koreans aged > or = 45 years without a history of MI or stroke. The administration of single-tablet fixed-dose combination amlodipine and atorvastatin to all such individuals was likely to represent a cost-effective means of preventing first-onset CVD (ie, coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke) in this subgroup, compared with current patterns of treatment.",2009-01-05763,19922890,Clin Ther,Danny Liew,2009,31 / 10,2189-203; discussion 2150-1,Yes,19922890,"Danny Liew; Results of a Markov model analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of a single tablet of fixed-dose amlodipine and atorvastatin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Korea, Clin Ther, ; 31(10):1879-114X; 2189-203; discussion 2150-1",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single-tablet fixed-dose combination amlodipine and atorvastatin vs. Current therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,7773063,Korean Won,2007,10445.81
6309,Cost-effectiveness of postural exercise therapy versus physiotherapy in computer screen-workers with early non-specific work-related upper limb disorders (WRULD); a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Exercise therapies generate substantial costs in computer workers with non-specific work-related upper limb disorders (WRULD). AIMS: To study if postural exercise therapy is cost-effective compared to regular physiotherapy in screen-workers with early complaints, both from health care and societal perspective. METHODS: Prospective randomized trial including cost-effectiveness analysis; one year follow-up. Participants: Eighty-eight screen-workers with early non-specific WRULD; six drop-outs. Interventions: A ten week postural exercise program versus regular physiotherapy. Outcome measures: Effectiveness measures: Pain: visual analogous scale (VAS), self-perceived WRULD (yes/no). Functional outcome: Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand- Dutch Language Version (DASH-DLV). Quality of life outcome: EQ-5D.Economic measures: health care costs including patient and family costs and productivity costs resulting in societal costs. Cost-effectiveness measures: health care costs and societal costs related to the effectiveness measures. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline; three, six and twelve months after baseline. RESULTS: At baseline both groups were comparable for baseline characteristics except scores on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and comparable for costs. No significant differences between the groups concerning effectiveness at one year follow-up were found. Effectiveness scores slightly improved over time. After one year 55% of participants were free of complaints. After one year the postural exercise group had higher mean total health care costs, but lower productivity costs compared to the physiotherapy group. Mean societal costs after one year (therefore) were in favor of postural exercise therapy [- euro622; 95% CI -2087; +590)]. After one year, only self- perceived WRULD seemed to result in acceptable cost-effectiveness of the postural exercise strategy over physiotherapy; however the probability of acceptable cost-effectiveness did not exceed 60%.Considering societal costs related to QALYs, postural exercise therapy had a probability of over 80% to be cost-effective over a wide range of cost-effectiveness ceiling ratios; however based on a marginal QALY-difference of 0.1 over a 12 month time frame. CONCLUSION: Although our trial failed to find significant differences in VAS, QALYs and ICERs based on VAS and QALYs at one-year follow-up, CEACs suggest that postural exercise therapy according to Mensendieck/Cesar has a higher probability of being cost-effective compared to regular physiotherapy; however further research is required.

6313,The Cost-Effectiveness of an Extended Course (12 + 12 Weeks) of Varenicline Compared with Other Available Smoking Cessation Strategies in the United States: An Extension and Update to the BENESCO Model,"ABSTRACT Objectives: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an extended (12 + 12 weeks) course of varenicline using the (Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes) BENESCO smoking cessation model. Methods: Data on the efficacy of 12 + 12 weeks varenicline therapy in aiding smoking cessation were analyzed in conjunction with the efficacy data for 12 weeks of varenicline, bupropion, and placebo previously included in the BENESCO model, by using a mixed treatment comparison. This analysis provided updated efficacy estimates for all the interventions, and these were used to update the model to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of all smoking cessation interventions considered, now including 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline. Results: The updated 1-year abstinence estimates derived from the mixed treatment comparison were, for 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline, 12 weeks of varenicline, 12 weeks of bupropion, and 12 weeks of placebo, respectively: 27.7%, 22.9%, 15.9%, and 9.3%. The average cost of the course of 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline was estimated at $603.89, based on a 12-week course followed by a further 12 weeks for successful quitters. Over all subjects' lifetimes, 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline is less costly and more effective than (dominates) all other strategies compared in the updated BENESCO model, with the exception of 12 weeks of varenicline. In this comparison, 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline is a very cost-effective alternative to the 12-week course, with an incremental cost of less than $1000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

6314,Economic value of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination during pregnancy,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of maternal influenza immunization against laboratory-confirmed influenza has never been studied. The current 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a timely opportunity to perform such analyses. The study objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination using both single- and 2-dose strategies against laboratory-confirmed influenza secondary to both seasonal epidemics and pandemic influenza outbreaks. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness decision analytic model construct using epidemic and pandemic influenza characteristics from both the societal and third-party payor perspectives. A comparison was made between vaccinating all pregnant women in the United States versus not vaccinating pregnant women. Probabilistic (Monte Carlo) sensitivity analyses were also performed. The main outcome measures were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Maternal influenza vaccination using either the single- or 2-dose strategy is a cost-effective approach when influenza prevalence > or =7.5% and influenza-attributable mortality is > or =1.05% (consistent with epidemic strains). As the prevalence of influenza and/or the severity of the outbreak increases the incremental value of vaccination also increases. At a higher prevalence of influenza (> or =30%) the single-dose strategy demonstrates cost-savings while the 2-dose strategy remains highly cost-effective (ICER, < or =$6787.77 per quality-adjusted life year). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal influenza immunization is a highly cost-effective intervention at disease rates and severity that correspond to both seasonal influenza epidemics and occasional pandemics.

6318,An Economic Analysis of Hand Transplantation in the United States,"BACKGROUND:: Hand transplantation has received international attention in recent years; however, the economic impact of this innovative treatment is uncertain. The aim of this study is to assess the utility and estimate the costs of hand transplantation and the use of hand prostheses for forearm amputations. METHODS:: 100 medical students completed a time trade-off survey to assess the utilities of single and double hand transplantation and the use of hand prostheses. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated for each outcome to create decision trees. Cost data for medical care were estimated based on Medicare fee schedules using the Current Procedural Terminology code for forearm replantation. The cost of immunosuppressive therapy was estimated based on the wholesale price of drugs. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated from the differences in costs and utilities between transplantation and prosthesis. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS:: For unilateral hand amputation, prosthetic use was favored over hand transplantation (30.00 QALYS vs. 28.81 QALYs; p = 0.03). Double hand transplantation was favored over the use of prostheses (26.73 QALYs vs. 25.20 QALYs; p = 0.01). The ICUR of double transplantation when compared with prostheses was $381,961/QALY, exceeding the traditionally accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY.

6320,Cost-effectiveness of adult circumcision in a resource-rich setting for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men,"BACKGROUND: We examined the effects and cost-effectiveness of 4 strategies of circumcision in a resource-rich setting (Australia) in a population of men who have sex with men (MSM). METHOD: We created a dynamic mathematical transmission model and performed an economic analysis to estimate the costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of different strategies, compared with those of the status quo. Strategies included circumcision of all MSM at age 18 years, circumcision of all MSM aged 35-44 years, circumcision of all insertive MSM aged 18 years, and circumcision of all MSM aged 18 years . All costs are reported in US dollars, with a cost-effectiveness threshold of $42,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: We find that 2%-5% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections would be averted per year, with initial costs ranging from $3.6 million to $95.1 million, depending on the strategy. The number of circumcisions needed to prevent 1 HIV infection would range from 118 through 338. Circumcision of predominately insertive MSM would save $21.7 million over 25 years with a $62.2 million investment. Strategies to circumcise 100% of all MSM and to circumcise MSM aged 35-44 years would be cost-effective; the latter would require a smaller investment. The least cost-effective approach is circumcision of young MSM close to their sexual debut. Results are very sensitive to assumptions about the cost of circumcision, the efficacy of circumcision, sexual preferences, and behavioral disinhibition.

6326,Evaluation of modernisation of adult critical care services in England: time series and cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact and cost effectiveness of a programme to transform adult critical care throughout England initiated in late 2000. DESIGN: Evaluation of trends in inputs, processes, and outcomes during 1998-2000 compared with last quarter of 2000-6. SETTING: 96 critical care units in England. PARTICIPANTS: 349,817 admissions to critical care units. INTERVENTIONS: Adoption of key elements of modernisation and increases in capacity. Units were categorised according to when they adopted key elements of modernisation and increases in capacity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in inputs (beds, costs), processes (transfers between units, discharge practices, length of stay, readmissions), and outcomes (unit and hospital mortality), with adjustment for case mix. Differences in annual costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) adjusted for case mix were used to calculate net monetary benefits (valuing a QALY gain at pound20,000 ($33,170, euro22 100)). The incremental net monetary benefits were reported as the difference in net monetary benefits after versus before 2000. RESULTS: In the six years after 2000, the risk of unit mortality adjusted for case mix fell by 11.3% and hospital mortality by 13.4% compared with the steady state in the three preceding years. This was accompanied by substantial reductions both in transfers between units and in unplanned night discharges. The mean annual net monetary benefit increased significantly after 2000 (from pound402 ($667, euro445) to pound1096 ($1810, euro1210)), indicating that the changes were relatively cost effective. The relative contribution of the different initiatives to these improvements is unclear. CONCLUSION: Substantial improvements in NHS critical care have occurred in England since 2000. While it is unclear which factors were responsible, collectively the interventions represented a highly cost effective use of NHS resources.",2009-01-05795,19906740,BMJ,Andrew Hutchings,2009,339 /,b4353,No,19906740,"Andrew Hutchings; Evaluation of modernisation of adult critical care services in England: time series and cost effectiveness analysis, BMJ, 2009; 339():0959-8138; b4353",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Modernization of acute care services vs. No services of modernization adopted,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,3.50,-8125,United Kingdom,2006,-19227.71
6327,Economic evaluation of high-dose (80 mg/day) atorvastatin treatment compared with standard-dose (20 mg/day to 40 mg/day) simvastatin treatment in Canada based on the Incremental Decrease in End-Points Through Aggressive Lipid-Lowering (IDEAL) trial,"BACKGROUND: The Incremental Decrease in End-Points Through Aggressive Lipid-Lowering (IDEAL) trial demonstrated incremental cardiovascular benefit of treatment with high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg/ day) versus standard-dose simvastatin (20 mg/day to 40 mg/day) in 8888 patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) over a median follow-up period of 4.8 years. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin versus standard-dose simvastatin treatment in patients with a history of MI from a Canadian societal perspective. METHODS: In a within-trial analysis, end point-related events, resources used and productivity losses occurring during the IDEAL trial were aggregated by treatment arm on an intention-to-treat basis to calculate the incremental cost per event avoided. Additionally, quality-adjusted survival was projected using a lifetime Markov model. Transition probabilities, workdays lost, use of study medication and cardiovascular hospitalization rates were based on IDEAL trial data. Hospitalization, study medication and productivity costs were included. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with standard-dose simvastatin, atorvastatin 80 mg led to 0.099 fewer events per patient and cost savings over 4.8 years of treatment. Over a lifetime horizon, atorvastatin 80 mg led to 0.023 qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient at an incremental cost of $26,795/QALY gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained below $50,000/QALY in 78% of 1000 simulations. Exclusion of indirect costs resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $38,834/QALY. Results were relatively sensitive to baseline age, but robust with respect to sex, baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, diabetes status and hospitalization costs.

6329,Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Imaging Strategies for the Diagnosis of Small-bowel Crohn's Disease,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:: The cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to the diagnosis of small-bowel Crohn's disease is unknown. This study evaluates whether CT-Enterography (CTE) is a cost-effective alternative to small bowel follow-through (SBFT) and whether capsule endoscopy is a cost-effective third test in patients in whom a high suspicion of disease remains after two previous negative tests. METHODS:: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare the lifetime costs and benefits of each diagnostic strategy. Patients were considered with low (20%) and high (75%) pretest probability of small-bowel Crohn's disease. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Parameter assumptions were tested with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS:: With a moderate to high pretest probability of small-bowel Crohn's disease, and higher likelihood of isolated jejunal disease, follow-up with CTE has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $54,000/QALY-gained compared to SBFT. The addition of capsule endoscopy after ileocolonoscopy and negative CTE or SBFT costs greater than $500,000 per QALY-gained in all scenarios.

6331,Clinical trial: cost-effectiveness of macrogol 3350 compared to lactulose in the treatment of adults suffering from chronic constipation in the UK,"ABSTRACT Background: It is unknown whether macrogol 3350 (Movicol((R)) (1)) affords the UK's National Health Service (NHS) a cost-effective addition to the current range of laxatives. Aim: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of macrogol 3350 compared to lactulose in the treatment of chronic constipation, from the perspective of the UK's NHS. Methods: A decision model depicting the management of chronic constipation was constructed using clinical outcomes and resource use values derived from patients suffering from chronic constipation in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) Database. The model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a GP prescribing macrogol 3350 instead of lactulose to treat adults >/=18 years of age suffering from chronic constipation. Results: Sixty-eight percent of macrogol 3350-treated patients were successfully treated within six months after starting treatment, compared to 60% of lactulose-treated patients. Patients' health status at six months was estimated to be 0.458 and 0.454 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the macrogol 3350 and lactulose groups respectively. The total six-monthly NHS cost of treating patients with macrogol 3350 or lactulose was estimated to be pound420 (US $688) and pound419 (US $686), respectively. Hence, the cost per QALY gained with macrogol 3350 was estimated to be pound250 (US $410). Conclusion: Macrogol 3350 affords the NHS a cost-effective addition to the range of laxatives available for this potentially resource-intensive condition.",2009-01-05812,19886948,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,R R Taylor,2009,/,,No,19886948,"R R Taylor; Clinical trial: cost-effectiveness of macrogol 3350 compared to lactulose in the treatment of adults suffering from chronic constipation in the UK, Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 2009-Nov-03; ():0269-2813",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Macrogol 3350 vs. Lactulose,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,250,United Kingdom,2008,557.31

However, no optimal first therapeutic strategy has been determined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential cost-effectiveness of major therapeutic strategies for very early RA. DESIGN: Decision analytic model with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. DATA SOURCES: Published data, the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases, and actual 2007 hospital costs. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. adults with very early RA (symptom duration <or=3 months). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Health care provider and societal. INTERVENTION: 3 management strategies were compared: a symptomatic or ""pyramid"" strategy with initial nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, patient education, pain management, and low-dose glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at 1 year for nonresponders; early DMARD therapy with methotrexate; and early therapy with biologics and methotrexate. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: By reducing the progression of joint erosions and subsequent functional disability, both early intervention strategies increase quality-adjusted life more than the pyramid strategy and save long-term costs. When the cost of very early intervention is factored in, the cost-effectiveness ratio of the early DMARD strategy is $4849 per QALY (95% CI, $0 to $16 354 per QALY) compared with the pyramid strategy, whereas the benefits gained through the early biologic strategy come at a substantial incremental cost. The early DMARD strategy maximizes the effectiveness of early DMARDs and reserves the use of biologics for patients with more treatment-resistant disease of longer duration, for which the incremental benefit of biologics is greater.Results of Sensitivity Analysis:The early biologic strategy becomes more cost-effective if drug prices are reduced, risk for death is permanently lowered through biologic therapy, patients experience drug-free remission, responders can be selected before therapy initiation, or effective alternative antirheumatic agents are available for patients for whom several biologics have failed. LIMITATIONS: Data on the long-term effect of very early therapeutic interventions on the natural progression in disability and joint erosions are limited.

INTERVENTION: 3 management strategies were compared: a symptomatic or ""pyramid"" strategy with initial nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, patient education, pain management, and low-dose glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at 1 year for nonresponders; early DMARD therapy with methotrexate; and early therapy with biologics and methotrexate. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: By reducing the progression of joint erosions and subsequent functional disability, both early intervention strategies increase quality-adjusted life more than the pyramid strategy and save long-term costs. When the cost of very early intervention is factored in, the cost-effectiveness ratio of the early DMARD strategy is $4849 per QALY (95% CI, $0 to $16 354 per QALY) compared with the pyramid strategy, whereas the benefits gained through the early biologic strategy come at a substantial incremental cost. The early DMARD strategy maximizes the effectiveness of early DMARDs and reserves the use of biologics for patients with more treatment-resistant disease of longer duration, for which the incremental benefit of biologics is greater.Results of Sensitivity Analysis:The early biologic strategy becomes more cost-effective if drug prices are reduced, risk for death is permanently lowered through biologic therapy, patients experience drug-free remission, responders can be selected before therapy initiation, or effective alternative antirheumatic agents are available for patients for whom several biologics have failed. LIMITATIONS: Data on the long-term effect of very early therapeutic interventions on the natural progression in disability and joint erosions are limited. The study considered only tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and not the newer biologics. CONCLUSION: According to the most objective measures of RA progression, very early intervention with conventional DMARDs is cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of very early intervention with biologics remains uncertain.",2009-01-05815,19884622,Ann Intern Med,Axel Finckh,2009,151 / 9,612-21,No,19884622,"Axel Finckh; Treatment of very early rheumatoid arthritis with symptomatic therapy, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or biologic agents: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Ann Intern Med, 2009-Nov-03; 151(9):1539-3704; 612-21",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Early biologics strategy: 3 sequential tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, in combination with methotrexate vs. Early DMARD(disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) strategy",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-262815,United States,2007,-328054.2
6338,Cost-Effectiveness of Scheduled Maintenance Treatment with Infliximab for Pediatric Crohn's Disease,"ABSTRACT Background: Infliximab recently became the only biologic approved for use in pediatric patients with severe active Crohn's disease (CD). Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab compared with standard care in children suffering from severe active CD over 5 years from the UK National Health Service perspective. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the progression of a hypothetical cohort of CD children through predefined health states on scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg). The data to populate the model came from infliximab trials from Targan et al., ACCENT I, and REACH. The health states included in the model were remission, responding active disease, nonresponding active disease, surgery, postsurgery remission, postsurgery complications, and death. Standard care, comprising immunomodulators, and/or corticosteroids were used as a comparator. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) estimated using the EuroQol (EQ-5D) from a European CD population. To account for the weight-based dosing of infliximab, a baseline patient weight of 40 kg that increased by 5 kg/year up to 60 kg was used. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over a period of 5 years. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the infliximab efficacy estimates, costs, and utilities. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for infliximab treatment was pound14,607 compared with standard care. The sensitivity analyses revealed the treatment effect of infliximab to be the most influential parameter with ICERs ranging from pound10,480 to pound37,017. Assuming a willingness to pay of pound30,000 per QALY, the probability of infliximab being cost-effective is 78.6%. Conclusion: Scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg) is likely to be a cost-effective treatment in children suffering from severe active CD under an 8-week maintenance program.",2009-01-05816,19883407,Value Health,Yogesh Suresh Punekar,2009,/,,Yes,19883407,"Yogesh Suresh Punekar; Cost-Effectiveness of Scheduled Maintenance Treatment with Infliximab for Pediatric Crohn's Disease, Value Health, 2009-Oct-26; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab(5mg/kg) vs. Standard care: 8-week maintenance program,Not Stated,17 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,14607,United Kingdom,2007,36502.3
6339,The Impact of Fewer Hip Fractures with Risedronate Versus Alendronate in the First Year of Treatment: Modeled German Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"ABSTRACT Background: The Risedronate and Alendronate (REAL) cohort study provides unique comparative effectiveness data for real world bisphosphonate treatment of osteoporosis. Objective: The objective of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of risedronate compared to generic alendronate in Germany applying the REAL effectiveness data. Materials and Methods: A validated Markov model of osteoporosis was populated with REAL effectiveness data and German epidemiological, cost, and utility data. To estimate the impact of therapy on hip fractures, costs, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), the analysis included women >/=65 years, treated with risedronate or alendronate and followed for 4 additional years. Country-specific data included population mortality, fracture costs, and annual drug costs, using a German social insurance perspective. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. A differential hip fracture relative risk reduction of 43% was applied to risedronate vs. alendronate. Results: The model predicted that treatment with risedronate would result in fewer hip fractures and more QALYs at a reduced cost (savings of euro278 per treated woman) compared to treatment with generic alendronate. Sensitivity analysis assuming 2 years of treatment and equivalence of effect after 1 year show cost savings as well (euro106 per treated woman). Discussion: Whereas previous economic evaluations involving bisphosphonates have mainly relied on efficacy data from noncomparative clinical trials, this study's strength is in the use of comparative effectiveness data from one data source. The magnitude of the cost savings observed were sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding treatment duration, therapy discontinuation and cost of generic alendronate.

6341,Screening and Early Treatment of Migrants for Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection Is Cost-Effective,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are at risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early detection of chronic HBV infection through screening and treatment of eligible patients has the potential to prevent these sequellae. We assessed the cost-effectiveness in The Netherlands of systematically screening migrants from countries that have high and intermediate HBV infection levels. METHODS: Epidemiologic data of the expected numbers of patients with active chronic HBV infection in the target population and information about the costs of a screening program were used in a Markov model and used to determine costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for patients who were and were not treated. RESULTS: Compared with the status quo, a 1-time screen for HBV infection can reduce mortality of liver-related diseases by 10%. Using base case estimates, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of screening, compared with not screening, is euros (euro) 8966 per QALY gained. The ICER ranged from euro7936 to euro11,705 based on univariate sensitivity analysis, varying parameter values of HBV prevalence, participation rate, success in referral, and treatment compliance. Using multivariate sensitivity analysis for treatment effectiveness, the ICER ranged from euro7222 to euro15,694; for disease progression, it ranged from euro5568 to euro60,418. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection and treatment of people with HBV infection can have a large impact on liver-related health outcomes.

6342,A cost-utility analysis of cervical cancer vaccination in preadolescent Canadian females,"BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that approximately 70% of Canadian women undergo cervical cancer screening at least once every 3 years, approximately 1,300 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer and approximately 380 died from it in 2008. This study estimates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 12-year old Canadian females with an AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine. The indirect effect of vaccination, via herd immunity, is also estimated. METHODS: A 12-health-state 1-year-cycle Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime HPV related events for a cohort of 12-year old females. Annual transition probabilities between health-states were derived from published literature and Canadian population statistics. The model was calibrated using Canadian cancer statistics. From a healthcare perspective, the cost-effectiveness of introducing a vaccine with efficacy against HPV-16/18 and evidence of cross-protection against other oncogenic HPV types was evaluated in a population undergoing current screening practices. The base-case analysis included 70% screening coverage, 75% vaccination coverage, $135/dose for vaccine, and 3% discount rate on future costs and health effects. Conservative herd immunity effects were taken into account by estimated HPV incidence using a mathematical model parameterized by reported age-stratified sexual mixing data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: Vaccinating 12-year old females (n = 100,000) was estimated to prevent between 390-633 undiscounted cervical cancer cases (reduction of 47%-77%) and 168-275 undiscounted deaths (48%-78%) over their lifetime, depending on whether or not herd immunity and cross-protection against other oncogenic HPV types were included. Vaccination was estimated to cost $18,672-$31,687 per QALY-gained, the lower range representing inclusion of cross-protective efficacy and herd immunity. The cost per QALY-gained was most sensitive to duration of vaccine protection, discount rate, and the correlation between probability of screening and probability of vaccination. CONCLUSION: In the context of current screening patterns, vaccination of 12-year old Canadian females with an ASO4-ajuvanted cervical cancer vaccine is estimated to significantly reduce cervical cancer and mortality, and is a cost-effective option.

6346,A Rapid-Response Economic Evaluation of the UK NHS Cancer Reform Strategy Breast Cancer Screening Program Extension via a Plausible Bounds Approach,"ABSTRACT Objectives: The 2007 National Health Service Cancer Reform Strategy includes a proposed extension of the UK breast screening program to women aged 47 to 49 years. The aim of this study is to undertake a preliminary assessment of this proposal to identify the key factors determining its cost-effectiveness and to determine whether there is sufficient uncertainty that requires more thorough analyses. Methods: An economic model was constructed. For simplicity, the health impact of screening was estimated by calculating the lives saved through shifts in prognostic group. A ""plausible bounds"" approach was used to derive distributions for model parameters for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. UK data were used to populate the model. Results: The cost-effectiveness of the extension is estimated to be pound27,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with a 29% probability of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. The deterministic estimate of benefit becomes negative if the anxiety due to a false-positive result is set at 0.028 QALYs. Including a small positive benefit from a negative screen has a dramatic impact on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The impact of other factors appears less marked. Conclusions: Because the vast majority of women aged 47 to 49 years will test negative when screened for breast cancer and most of those who test positive will actually be free of the disease, the psychological impacts of screening are likely to drive cost-effectiveness for this age group. Therefore, a research priority should be to better understand and quantify these effects.",2009-01-05824,19878494,Value Health,Jason Madan,2009,/,,Yes,19878494,"Jason Madan; A Rapid-Response Economic Evaluation of the UK NHS Cancer Reform Strategy Breast Cancer Screening Program Extension via a Plausible Bounds Approach, Value Health, 2009-Oct-29; ():1098-3015",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Breast cancer screening from ages 47-49 vs. No breast cancer screening ages 47-49,Not Stated,49 Years,47 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,3.50,3.50,27400,United Kingdom,2007,68471.5
6347,"Cost-Effectiveness of Screening and Optimal Management for Diabetes, Hypertension, and Chronic Kidney Disease: A Modeled Analysis","ABSTRACT Objectives: Chronic kidney disease is, increasingly, both a contributor to premature deaths and a financial burden to the health system, and is estimated to affect between 10% and 15% of the adult population in Western countries. Hypertension and, in particular diabetes, are significant contributors to the global burden of chronic kidney disease. Although it might increase costs, screening for, and improved management of, persons at increased risk of progressive kidney disease could improve health outcomes. We therefore sought to estimate the costs and health outcomes of alternative strategies to prevent end-stage kidney disease, compared with usual care. Methods: A Markov model comparing: 1) intensive management versus usual care for patients with suboptimally managed diabetes and hypertension; and 2) screening for and intensive treatment of diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria versus usual care was developed. Intervention effectiveness was based on published meta-analyses and randomized controlled trial data; costs were measured from a central health-care funder perspective in 2008 Australian dollars ($A), and outcomes were reported in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Intensive treatment of inadequately controlled diabetes was both less costly (an average lifetime saving of $A133) and more effective (with an additional 0.075 QALYs per patients) than conventional management. Intensive management of hypertension had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) $A2588 per QALY gained. Treating all known diabetics with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was both less costly (an average lifetime saving of $A825 per patient) and more effective than current treatment (resulting in 0.124 additional QALYs per patient). Primary care screening for 50- to 69-year-olds plus intensive treatment of diabetes had an ICER of $A13,781 per QALY gained. Primary care screening for hypertension (between ages 50 and 69 years) plus intensive blood pressure management had an ICER of $A491 per QALY gained. Primary care screening for proteinuria (between ages 50 and 69 years) combined with prescription of an ACE inhibitor for all persons showing proteinuria and all known diabetics had an ICER of $A4793 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Strategies combining primary care screening of 50- to 69-year-olds for proteinuria, diabetes, and hypertension followed by the routine use of ACE inhibitors, and optimal treatment of diabetes and hypertension, respectively, have the potential to reduce death and end-stage kidney disease and are likely to represent good value for money.",2009-01-05825,19878493,Value Health,Kirsten Howard,2009,/,,Yes,19878493,"Kirsten Howard; Cost-Effectiveness of Screening and Optimal Management for Diabetes, Hypertension, and Chronic Kidney Disease: A Modeled Analysis, Value Health, 2009-Oct-29; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive glucose control in known diabetics vs. Routine glucose control,Not Stated,Not Stated,26 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-1773.33,Australia,2008,-1819.82

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CT coronary angiography performed as a triage test prior to conventional coronary angiography from the perspective of the patient, physician, hospital, health care system, and society by using recommendations from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands for cost-effectiveness analyses. For CT coronary angiography, a range of sensitivities (79%-100%) and specificities (63%-94%) were used to help diagnose significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Optimization criteria (ie, outcomes considered) were: revised posttest probability of CAD, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: For a prior probability of CAD of less than 40%, the probability of CAD after CT coronary angiography with negative results was less than 1%. The Markov model calculations from the patient/physician perspective suggest that CT coronary angiography maximizes life-years respectively in 60-year-old men and women at a prior probability of less than 38% and 24% and maximizes QALYs at a prior probability of less than 17% and 11%. From the hospital/health care perspective, CT coronary angiography helps reduce health care and direct nonhealth care-related costs (according to UK/U.S. recommendations), regardless of prior probability, and lowers all costs, including production losses (Netherlands recommendations) at a prior probability of less than 87%-92%.

6359,A cost-utility analysis of adding a bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the Irish cervical screening programme,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and in Ireland it is the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Almost 100% of these cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Two newly developed vaccines against HPV infection have become available. This study is a cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland, and it compares the cost-effectiveness profiles of the two vaccines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland was performed using a Markov model. A cohort of screened and vaccinated women was compared with an unvaccinated screened cohort, and both cohorts were followed over their lifetimes. The model looked at uptake of services related to HPV disease in both cohorts. Outcomes were measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Extensive sensitivity analysis was done. RESULTS: For the base case analysis, the model showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for quadrivalent HPV vaccination would be euro25 349/QALY and euro30 460/QALY for the bivalent vaccine. The ICER for the quadrivalent vaccine ranged from euro2877 to euro36 548, and for the bivalent from euro3399 to euro45 237.

6360,A cost-utility analysis of adding a bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the Irish cervical screening programme,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and in Ireland it is the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Almost 100% of these cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Two newly developed vaccines against HPV infection have become available. This study is a cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland, and it compares the cost-effectiveness profiles of the two vaccines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland was performed using a Markov model. A cohort of screened and vaccinated women was compared with an unvaccinated screened cohort, and both cohorts were followed over their lifetimes.

6361,Cost-effectiveness of hormone therapy in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of 5 years of treatment with hormone therapy (HT) compared with no treatment for women with menopausal symptoms in the United States. METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation model was used with tunnel techniques to assess the cost-effectiveness of HT in women aged 50 years, based on a societal perspective. Clinical data, where possible, used results taken from the Women Health Initiative (WHI). The model had a lifetime horizon with cycle lengths of 1 year and contained the following disease states: hip fracture, vertebral fracture, wrist fracture, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic events. An intervention was modelled by its impact on the disease risks during and after stopping treatment. The model required data on clinical effects, risks, mortality rates, quality of life weights, and costs. The main outcome of the model was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained on HT compared with no treatment. RESULTS: The results indicated that it was cost-effective to treat women with menopausal symptoms with HT in the United States. The severity of menopausal symptoms was the single most important determinant of cost-effectiveness, but HT remained cost-effective even where symptoms were mild or effects on symptom relief were small.

6363,Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis,"Treatment options for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) are limited. Mitoxantrone is routinely used to stabilize disease progression; however, evolving evidence suggests clinical benefit from intensive treatment with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Given differences in cost and outcomes, preliminary cost-effectiveness studies are warranted if this approach is to be developed for more widespread application in SPMS. We developed a decision-analytic Markov model to explore the potential cost-effectiveness of autologous HSCT versus mitoxantrone in SPMS, using patient-level data from registry sources. The model evaluates the lifetime costs and health outcomes associated with disability progression and relapse. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to examine the uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness outcomes. In the absence of randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence, conditions for comparative analysis were not ideal. Under optimistic assumptions, HSCT is estimated to cost below pound3000 per quality adjusted life year gained. However, when a strict 6-month sustained progression rule is adopted, HSCT may be less effective and more expensive than mitoxantrone. The model results were sensitive to reducing procedural costs and HSCT-related mortality. We conclude that HSCT could potentially achieve an acceptable level of cost-effectiveness. However, caution should be exercised as large, high-quality RCTs comparing HSCT versus mitoxantrone are necessary to validate these findings.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 26 October 2009; doi:10.1038/bmt.2009.305.",2009-01-05842,19855441,Bone Marrow Transplant,P Tappenden,2009,/,,No,19855441,"P Tappenden; Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis, Bone Marrow Transplant, 2009-Oct-26; ():0268-3369",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) vs. Mitoxantrone 20 mg plus 1 g methylprednisolone monthly,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-24058.9,United Kingdom,2007,-60122.22

6366,Cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life analysis of physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical services,"BACKGROUND: The long-term health outcomes and costs of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) assistance remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of HEMS assistance compared with emergency medical services (EMS). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed at a level I trauma centre. Quality-of-life measurements were obtained at 2 years after trauma, using the EuroQol-Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) as generic measure to determine health status. Health outcomes and costs were combined into costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The study population receiving HEMS assistance was more severely injured than that receiving EMS assistance only. Over the 4-year study interval, HEMS assistance saved a total of 29 additional lives. No statistically significant differences in quality of life were found between assistance with HEMS or with EMS. Two years after trauma the mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.70 versus 0.71 respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for HEMS versus EMS was 28,327 Euro per QALY. The sensitivity analysis showed a cost-effectiveness ratio between 16,000 and 62,000 Euro. CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, the costs of HEMS assistance per QALY remain below the acceptance threshold.

6367,Self-report versus care provider registration of healthcare utilization: impact on cost and cost-utility,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the impact of two different sources of resource use, self-report versus care provider registrations, on cost and cost utility. METHODS: Data were gathered for a cost-effectiveness study performed alongside a 2-year randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of an INTERdisciplinary COMmunity-based management program (INTERCOM) for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The program was offered by physiotherapists, dieticians and respiratory nurses. During the 2-year period, patients reported all resource use in a cost booklet. In addition, data on hospital admissions and outpatient visits, visits to the physiotherapist, dietician or respiratory nurse, diet nutrition, and outpatient medication were obtained from administrative records. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated in two ways, using data from the cost booklet or registrations. RESULTS: In total, 175 patients were included in the study. Agreement between self-report and registrations was almost perfect for hospitalizations (rho = 0.93) and physiotherapist visits (rho = 0.86), but above 0.55, moderate, for all other types of care. The total cost difference between the registrations and the cost booklet was 464 euros with the highest difference for hospitalizations 386 euro. Based on the cost booklet the cost difference between the treatment group and usual care was 2,444 euros (95 percent confidence interval [CI], -819 to 5,950), which resulted in a cost-utility of 29,100 euro/QALY. For the registrations, the results were 2,498 euros (95 percent CI, -88 to 6,084) and 29,390 euro/QALY, respectively.

6369,Economic evaluation of a minimal psychological intervention in chronically ill elderly patients with minor or mild to moderate depression: a randomized trial (the DELTA-study),"OBJECTIVES: Depression is associated with high healthcare utilization and related costs. Effective treatments might reduce the economic burden. The objective of this study was to establish the cost-utility of a minimal psychological intervention (MPI) aimed at reducing depression and improving quality of life in elderly persons with diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and co-occurring minor, mild, or moderate depression. METHODS: Trial-based cost-utility analysis was used to compare the MPI with usual care. Annual costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on the Euroqol (EQ5D) and on depression-free days were calculated. RESULTS: Annual costs and effects were not significantly different for the MPI group and care as usual. Bootstrap analysis indicated a dominant intervention, with a probability of 63 percent that the MPI is less costly and more effective than usual care. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness analysis does not support dissemination of the MPI in its current form. The economic evaluation study showed limited probability that MPI is cost-effective over usual care. Further adjustments to the MPI are needed to make the intervention suitable for dissemination in regular care.

However, the incidence and prevalence of STIs in sex workers is very low, especially since there is almost universal condom use at work. We aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the financial cost of the testing policy versus the health benefits of averting the transmission of HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea to clients. METHODS: We developed a simple mathematical transmission model, informed by conservative parameter estimates from all available data, linked to a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: We estimated that under current testing rates it costs over AU$90,000 in screening costs for every chlamydia infection averted (and AU$600,000 in screening costs for each quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved) and over AU$4,000,000 for every HIV infection averted (AU$10,000,000 in screening costs for each QALY saved).

6374,Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical cancer screening in women older than 30 years in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Women older than 30 years are the main beneficiaries of improved cervical cancer screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. The role of vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18, which is recommended routinely for preadolescent girls, is unclear in this age group. OBJECTIVE: To assess the health and economic outcomes of HPV vaccination in older U.S. women. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with an empirically calibrated model. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women aged 35 to 45 years. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: HPV vaccination added to screening strategies that differ by test (cytology or HPV DNA testing), frequency, and start age versus screening alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2006 U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In the context of annual or biennial screening, HPV vaccination of women aged 35 to 45 years ranged from $116 950 to $272 350 per QALY for cytology with HPV DNA testing for triage of equivocal results and from $193 690 to $381 590 per QALY for combined cytology and HPV DNA testing, depending on age and screening frequency. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The probability of HPV vaccination being cost-effective for women aged 35 to 45 years was 0% with annual or biennial screening and less than 5% with triennial screening, at thresholds considered good value for money. LIMITATION: The natural history of the disease and the efficacy of the vaccine in older women are uncertain. CONCLUSION: Given currently available information, the effectiveness of HPV vaccination for women older than 30 years who are screened seems to be small.

6388,Clinical and economic effects of iNO in premature newborns with respiratory failure at 1 year,"BACKGROUND: The long-term consequences of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) use in premature newborns with respiratory failure are unknown. We therefore studied the clinical and economic outcomes to 1 year of corrected age after a randomized controlled trial of prophylactic iNO. METHODS: Premature newborns (gestational age <or=34 w, birth weight 500-1250 g) with respiratory failure randomly received 5 ppm iNO or placebo within 48 h of birth until 21 d or extubation. We assessed clinical outcomes via in-person neurodevelopmental evaluation at 1 y corrected age and telephone interviews every 3 m. We estimated costs from detailed hospital bills and interviews, converting all costs to 2008 US$. Of 793 trial subjects, 631 (79.6%) contributed economic data, and 455 (77.1% of survivors) underwent neurodevelopmental evaluation. RESULTS: At 1 y corrected age, survival was not different by treatment arm (79.2% iNO vs. 74.5% placebo, P = .12), nor were other post-discharge outcomes. For subjects weighing 750-999 g, those receiving iNO had greater survival free from neurodevelopmental impairment (67.9% vs. 55.6%, P = .04). However, in subjects weighing 500-749 g, iNO led to greater oxygen dependency (11.7% vs. 4.0%, P = .04). Median total costs were similar ($235,800 iNO vs. $198,300 placebo, P = .19). Quality-adjusted survival was marginally better with iNO (by 0.011 quality-adjusted life-years/subject). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $2.25 million/quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in both arms commonly experienced neurodevelopmental and pulmonary morbidity, consuming substantial health care resources.

6389,Oseltamivir for influenza postexposure prophylaxis: economic evaluation for children aged 1-12 years in the U.S,"BACKGROUND: Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has been shown to be effective and is approved in children exposed to a case of influenza in a household setting. Given limited healthcare budgets, it is important to understand the costs and cost effectiveness of PEP in children. PURPOSE: This study aims to estimate the cost effectiveness of oseltamivir PEP for children aged 1-12 years in the U.S. METHODS: A decision-tree model with a 1-year time horizon was used to assess the cost effectiveness of oseltamivir PEP for 10 days at approved doses compared with no prophylaxis for children aged 1-12 years who were exposed to a household index case of influenza from the U.S. societal and payer perspectives. Model inputs included U.S. influenza epidemiology data, efficacy data from oseltamivir PEP clinical trials, direct medical resource use and costs for PEP and influenza treatment derived from large U.S. databases, and indirect costs based on caregiver lost productivity. Base-case estimates were tested in extensive sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For the societal perspective, the model estimated 12,184 fewer cases of influenza per 100,000 children exposed and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $41,452 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results were most sensitive to the influenza attack rate, PEP protective efficacy, and prescribing patterns for initiating PEP. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that oseltamivir PEP was likely to be cost effective for all willingness-to-pay threshold values above $34,300 per QALY gained. Results were similar for the payer perspective.

6391,Cost-effectiveness of nationwide hepatitis B catch-up vaccination among children and adolescents in China,"Liver disease and liver cancer associated with childhood-acquired chronic hepatitis B are leading causes of death among adults in China. Despite expanded newborn hepatitis B vaccination programs, approximately 20% of children under age 5 years and 40% of children aged 5 to 19 years remain unprotected from hepatitis B. Although immunizing them will be beneficial, no studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B catch-up vaccination in an endemic country like China. We examined the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical nationwide free hepatitis B catch-up vaccination program in China for unvaccinated children and adolescents aged 1 to 19 years. We used a Markov model for disease progression and infections. Cost variables were based on data published by the Chinese Ministry of Health, peer-reviewed Chinese and English publications, and the GAVI Alliance. We measured costs (2008 U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi), quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. Our results show that hepatitis B catch-up vaccination for children and adolescents in China is cost-saving across a range of parameters, even for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years old. We estimate that if all 150 million susceptible children under 19 were vaccinated, more than 8 million infections and 65,000 deaths due to hepatitis B would be prevented. Conclusion: The adoption of a nationwide free catch-up hepatitis B vaccination program for unvaccinated children and adolescents in China, in addition to ongoing efforts to improve birth dose and newborn vaccination coverage, will be cost-saving and can generate significant population-wide health benefits.

DESIGN: A pragmatic, non-blinded, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Three UK hospitals (two teaching hospitals and one district general hospital). PARTICIPANTS: 286 patients aged >or=18 years were recruited after discharge from intensive care between September 2006 and October 2007. INTERVENTION: Nurse led intensive care follow-up programmes versus standard care. Main outcome measure(s) Health related quality of life (measured with the SF-36 questionnaire) at 12 months after randomisation. A cost effectiveness analysis was also performed. RESULTS: 286 patients were recruited and 192 completed one year follow-up. At 12 months, there was no evidence of a difference in the SF-36 physical component score (mean 42.0 (SD 10.6) v 40.8 (SD 11.9), effect size 1.1 (95% CI -1.9 to 4.2), P=0.46) or the SF-36 mental component score (effect size 0.4 (-3.0 to 3.7), P=0.83). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes or subgroup analyses. Follow-up programmes were significantly more costly than standard care and are unlikely to be considered cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: A nurse led intensive care follow-up programme showed no evidence of being effective or cost effective in improving patients' quality of life in the year after discharge from intensive care. Further work should focus on the roles of early physical rehabilitation, delirium, cognitive dysfunction, and relatives in recovery from critical illness. Intensive care units should review their follow-up programmes in light of these results.

METHODS: We developed a Markov model of a hypothetical 68-year-old cohort to determine the cost-effectiveness of early EVAR for ""small"" AAAs (4.0 cm-5.4 cm) compared with elective repair (open or endovascular) at the traditional cut-off of 5.5 cm. Repair options for 5.5-cm AAAs include both endovascular and open procedures. Probabilities were obtained from the literature. Costs reflected direct costs in 2007 dollars. Outcomes were reported as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The model demonstrated that early EVAR for 4.0 cm-5.4 cm AAAs led to fewer QALYs at greater costs when compared with observational management with elective repair at 5.5 cm. Sensitivity analyses suggested that early EVAR of 4.6 cm-4.9 cm AAAs can be cost-effective if the long-term mortality rate after EVAR is </=1.91% per year or if the quality of life after EVAR is improved. Likewise, if the quality of life before repair is low, EVAR for AAAs >/=4.6 cm may be cost-effective. With a >70% probability, observational management until AAA diameter is 5.5 cm will be the cost-effective option. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated that early EVAR for AAAs <5.5 cm is not likely to be cost-effective compared with elective repair at 5.5 cm. However, EVAR for small AAAs may become cost-effective when differences in quality of life and mortality are considered.",2009-01-05870,19837537,J Vasc Surg,Kate C Young,2009,/,,No,19837537,"Kate C Young; Cost-effectiveness of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair based on aneurysm size, J Vasc Surg, 2009-Oct-16; ():0741-5214",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular reapir (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) ranging from 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm vs. Elective repair (open or endovascular) at traditional cutoff for 5.5 cm AAA,Not Stated,68 Years,68 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,600000,United States,2007,748939.43
6398,Cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation versus intravesical botulinum A toxin for treatment of refractory urge incontinence,"PURPOSE: We determined the cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation vs intravesical botulinum toxin A for the treatment of refractory urge incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model using a societal perspective to compare costs (2008 U.S. dollars) and effectiveness (quality adjusted life-years) of sacral nerve stimulation and botulinum toxin A. Our primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which was defined as (sacral nerve stimulation cost - botulinum toxin A cost)/(sacral nerve stimulation quality adjusted life-year - botulinum toxin A quality adjusted life-year). Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of varying efficacy, costs and adverse event rates over the range of reported values. RESULTS: In the base case scenario sacral nerve stimulation was more expensive ($15,743 vs $4,392) and more effective (1.73 vs 1.63 quality adjusted life-years) than botulinum toxin A during a 2-year period. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $116,427 per quality adjusted life-year. Using conventional incremental cost-effectiveness ratio thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per quality adjusted life-year, sacral nerve stimulation was not cost-effective. In sensitivity analyses intravesical botulinum generally remained cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: During a 2-year period botulinum toxin A was cost-effective compared to sacral neuromodulation for the treatment of refractory urge incontinence. Additional data regarding time to failure after botulinum toxin A injections, long-term efficacy with repeat botulinum toxin A injections and long-term complications with both therapies will be helpful for future cost-effectiveness studies.",2009-01-05871,19837427,J Urol,Nazema Y Siddiqui,2009,182 / 6,2799-804,No,19837427,"Nazema Y Siddiqui; Cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation versus intravesical botulinum A toxin for treatment of refractory urge incontinence, J Urol, 2009-Dec; 182(6):0022-5347; 2799-804",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sacral neuromodulation vs. Botulinum toxin A,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,116427,United States,2008,139954.34
6399,Consensus Guidelines in the Management of Branch Duct Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Based on consensus guidelines, surgical resection of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) is indicated in patients with symptoms of cyst size >/=30 mm, intramural nodules, or dilated main pancreatic duct greater than 6 mm. The aim of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness of consensus guideline implementation in the management of BD-IPMN. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to compare the costs and effectiveness of three management strategies for a cohort of 60-year-old patients with branch duct IPMN: (1) surveillance using consensus guidelines for surgical resection (surveillance strategy), (2) surgical resection based on symptoms without surveillance (no surveillance strategy), and (3) immediate surgery (surgery strategy). The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analysis was performed over a wide ranges of estimates. RESULTS: The no surveillance strategy was the least costly, but also the least effective, while the surgery strategy was the most costly and most effective. Compared to the no surveillance strategy, the surveillance strategy cost an additional $20,096 per QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the surgery strategy compared with the surveillance strategy was $132,436 per QALY. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, if society was willing to pay $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, then 88.1% of patients using the surveillance strategy would be within budget. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate surgery is the most effective, but may be prohibitively expensive. The surveillance strategy is a cost-effective option compared to no surveillance.",2009-01-05872,19834805,Dig Dis Sci,Edward S Huang,2009,/,,No,19834805,"Edward S Huang; Consensus Guidelines in the Management of Branch Duct Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Dig Dis Sci, 2009-Oct-16; ():0163-2116",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surveillance vs. No surveillance,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,20096,United States,2008,24156.96
