30101,Cost-effectiveness of Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms in six European countries,"Broilers are an important reservoir for human Campylobacter infections, one of the leading causes of acute diarrheal disease in humans worldwide. Therefore, it is relevant to control Campylobacter on broiler farms. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness ratios of eight Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms in six European countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom. The cost-effectiveness ratio of an intervention was the estimated costs of the intervention divided by the estimated public health benefits due to the intervention, and was expressed in euro per avoided disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Interventions were selected on the basis of a European risk factor study and other risk factor research. A deterministic simulation model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of each intervention, if it would be implemented on all broiler farms in a country where it isn''t implemented yet and implementation is possible. The model considered differences between countries in number and size of broiler farms and established practices, in import, export and transit of live broilers, broiler meat and meat products, in effect of interventions on Campylobacter prevalence in broilers, in disease burden of Campylobacter related human illness, in national economic factors, such as interest rate and general cost levels, and in technical and economic farm performance. Across interventions, cost-effectiveness ratios were the lowest for Poland and Spain, and highest for Norway and Denmark. Across countries, applying designated tools for each farm house and building an anteroom with hygiene barrier in each farm house had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratios, whereas a ban on thinning (partial depopulation), slaughter at 35 days, replacing old houses by new houses, and applying drink nipples without cup had the highest. Applying fly screens in Denmark had an intermediate cost-effectiveness ratio. A maximum downtime between flocks of ten days had a negative cost-effectiveness ratio (i.e. revenue) in Poland, a low positive cost-effectiveness ratio in Spain and high positive cost-effectiveness ratios in Denmark, the Netherlands and United Kingdom. Estimated cost-effectiveness ratios of Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms differed substantially between the six countries, but the order of interventions in increasing cost-effectiveness ratio was generally similar across the countries.",2016-01-04113,0,Epidemiol Health,C.,2016,/,53-62,No,Not Stated,"C.; Rosemary J.

30120,Cost and cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis treatment shortening: A model-based analysis,"Background: Despite improvements in treatment success rates for tuberculosis (TB), current six-month regimen duration remains a challenge for many National TB Programmes, health systems, and patients. There is increasing investment in the development of shortened regimens with a number of candidates in phase 3 trials. Methods: We developed an individual-based decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical four-month regimen for first-line treatment of TB, assuming non-inferiority to current regimens of six-month duration. The model was populated using extensive, empirically-collected data to estimate the economic impact on both health systems and patients of regimen shortening for first-line TB treatment in South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Tanzania. We explicitly considered ''real world'' constraints such as sub-optimal guideline adherence. Results: From a societal perspective, a shortened regimen, priced at USD1 per day, could be a cost-saving option in South Africa, Brazil, and Tanzania, but would not be cost-effective in Bangladesh when compared to one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Incorporating ''real world'' constraints reduces cost-effectiveness. Patient-incurred costs could be reduced in all settings. From a health service perspective, increased drug costs need to be balanced against decreased delivery costs. The new regimen would remain a cost-effective option, when compared to each countries'' GDP per capita, even if new drugs cost up to USD7.5 and USD53.8 per day in South Africa and Brazil; this threshold was above USD1 in Tanzania and under USD1 in Bangladesh.

30123,Cost and cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis treatment shortening: A model-based analysis,"Background: Despite improvements in treatment success rates for tuberculosis (TB), current six-month regimen duration remains a challenge for many National TB Programmes, health systems, and patients. There is increasing investment in the development of shortened regimens with a number of candidates in phase 3 trials. Methods: We developed an individual-based decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical four-month regimen for first-line treatment of TB, assuming non-inferiority to current regimens of six-month duration. The model was populated using extensive, empirically-collected data to estimate the economic impact on both health systems and patients of regimen shortening for first-line TB treatment in South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Tanzania. We explicitly considered ''real world'' constraints such as sub-optimal guideline adherence. Results: From a societal perspective, a shortened regimen, priced at USD1 per day, could be a cost-saving option in South Africa, Brazil, and Tanzania, but would not be cost-effective in Bangladesh when compared to one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Incorporating ''real world'' constraints reduces cost-effectiveness. Patient-incurred costs could be reduced in all settings. From a health service perspective, increased drug costs need to be balanced against decreased delivery costs. The new regimen would remain a cost-effective option, when compared to each countries'' GDP per capita, even if new drugs cost up to USD7.5 and USD53.8 per day in South Africa and Brazil; this threshold was above USD1 in Tanzania and under USD1 in Bangladesh. Conclusion: Reducing the duration of first-line TB treatment has the potential for substantial economic gains from a patient perspective. The potential economic gains for health services may also be important, but will be context-specific and dependent on the appropriate pricing of any new regimen.",2016-01-04360,27905897,BMC Infect Dis,G.,2016,16 /,,No,27905897,"G.; Andrey Rzhetsky; Steven C.

30148,Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of childhood pneumonia is a key priority in low-income countries, with substantial resource implications. WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia. RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 (0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries. Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Afghanistan,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2005 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,39,United States,2013,43.33

WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia. RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 (0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries.

WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia. RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 (0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries.

WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no treatment intervention for pneumonia.

Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Swaziland,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2005 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,36.47,United States,2013,40.52

Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.",2017-99-23373,28400955,J Glob Health,Shanshan Zhang,2017,7 / 1,010409,No,28400955,"Shanshan Zhang; Beatrice Incardona; Shamim A Qazi; Karin Stenberg; Harry Campbell; Harish Nair; Severe ALRI Working Group; Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries, J Glob Health, 2017 Jun; 7(1):2047-2986; 010409",DALY,Turkmenistan,Not Stated,Other,Childhood pneumonia management according to 2013 World Health Organization Guidelines vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,42.53,United States,2013,47.25
30197,Cost-effectiveness analysis of revised WHO guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 74 Countdown countries,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of childhood pneumonia is a key priority in low-income countries, with substantial resource implications. WHO revised their guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines. METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years.
