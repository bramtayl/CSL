24201,Pneumococcal Vaccination in Adults Aged =65 Years: Cost-Effectiveness and Health Impact in U.S. Populations,"INTRODUCTION: Recommending both the conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines to all U.S. seniors may have little public health impact and be economically unreasonable. Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of using both vaccines in all adults aged =65 years were estimated compared with an alternative strategy (omitting pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the nonimmunocompromised) and with the newly revised recommendation (giving or omitting conjugate vaccine based on patient-physician shared decision making). METHODS: Strategies were examined in hypothetical U.S. 65-year-old population cohorts and segmented into health states based on age- and population-specific data in a Markov state-transition model with a lifetime time horizon from a healthcare perspective. Black population cohorts were examined separately given greater illness risk and lower vaccine uptake. Model parameters came from the Centers for Disease Control Active Core Bacterial Surveillance network, National Health Interview Survey, and Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Outcomes included incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and pneumococcal disease outcomes for each strategy. Data were gathered and analysis performed in 2018. RESULTS: Giving both vaccines, either routinely or with shared decision making, was most effective, reducing pneumococcal disease incidence compared with no vaccination, but costing $765,000-$2.18 million/quality-adjusted life year gained. Depending on examined population and scenario, the alternative strategy cost $65,700-$226,700/quality-adjusted life year gained (less in black populations) and reduced cases and deaths by 0.3%-0.9%. CONCLUSIONS: A vaccination strategy that omits pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in immunocompetent U.S. seniors may be economically reasonable, particularly for black seniors. Use of both pneumococcal vaccines was more effective but substantially more expensive.",2020-01-34018,32001052,Am J Prev Med,Angela R Wateska,2020,58 / 4,487-495,No,32001052,"Angela R Wateska; Mary Patricia Nowalk; Chyongchiou J Lin; Lee H Harrison; William Schaffner; Richard K Zimmerman; Kenneth J Smith; Thomas J Lee; Alexander A Thomas; Nikhil R Grandhi; Matthew S Galetta; Dhruv K C Goyal; Taolin Fang; Gregory D Schroeder; Christopher K Kepler; Alexander R Vaccaro; Pneumococcal Vaccination in Adults Aged =65 Years: Cost-Effectiveness and Health Impact in U.S. Populations, Am J Prev Med, 2020 Apr; 58(4):0749-3797; 487-495",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Immunization,alternate strategy vs. None,general older adult population,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,105199,United States,2018,108426.52

24203,Value-Based Healthcare in Ostomies,"In order to achieve significant improvements in quality, cost, and accessibility (the health ""iron triangle""), innovation in organizational and service delivery models is necessary to increase the value of healthcare. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a model of organizational innovation based on advanced practice nurse in the care of people with ostomies (APN-O) versus usual care. An observational, exploratory, analytical, prospective study with a six-month follow-up was carried out at 12 hospitals that implemented this model in Andalusia. A total of 75 patients who had undergone a digestive elimination ostomy and/or a urinary ostomy were followed for six months. Clinical outcomes, healthcare resources, health-related quality of life, and willingness to pay (WTP) were analyzed. The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective, including healthcare costs and indirect costs. The cost difference between the two models was €136.99 and the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was 0.05965 (€2297 per QALY gained). At six months, the mean of WTP was €69 per APN-O consultation. This model contributes to increasing the value-based healthcare in ostomies. Results of this study suggested that APN-O is an effective patient management model for improving their health status and is highly efficient.",2020-01-34019,32823745,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Ana C Montesinos Gálvez,2020,17 / 16,,No,32823745,"Ana C Montesinos Gálvez; Francisco Jódar Sánchez; Carmen Alcántara Moreno; Antonio J Pérez Fernández; Rosario Benítez García; Mercedes Coca López; María Paz Bienvenido Ramírez; Monserrat Cabrera López; Luisa Vázquez Burrero; Pilar Jurado Berja; Raquel Sánchez García; Josefa Martín Cebrián; María Luz Hervas García; Remedios López Fernández; Claudia Pérez Jiménez; María Antonia Reyes Vico; Ana Belén Vargas Villegas; Nuria García-Agua Soler; Antonio J García Ruiz; Sofia Pazmino; Annelies Boonen; Veerle Stouten; Diederik De Cock; Johan Joly; Kristien Van der Elst; Rene Westhovens; Patrick Verschueren; Shu-Jie Dong; Bin Wu; Suo-Di Zhai; Yan-Jun Zhang; Yun-Bo Chu; Parul Gupta; Ya-Huei Li; Value-Based Healthcare in Ostomies, Int J Environ Res Public Health, 2020 Aug 18; 17(16):1660-4601",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",new clinical management model vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,9 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2297,Euro,2018,2797.63
24204,Cost-Effectiveness of Maintenance Olaparib for Germline BRCA-Mutated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib for metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has been shown to be effective. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maintenance olaparib for MPC from the US payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model was adopted to project the disease course of MPC. Efficacy and toxicity data were gathered from the Pancreas Cancer Olaparib Ongoing (POLO) trial. Transition probabilities were estimated from the reported survival probabilities in each POLO group. Cost and health preference data were derived from the literature. The incremental cost-utility ratio, incremental net-health benefit, and incremental monetary benefit were measured. Subgroup analysis, one-way analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the model uncertainties. RESULTS: Maintenance olaparib had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $191,596 per additional progression-free survival (PFS) quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, with a high cost of $132,287 and 0.691 PFS QALY gained, compared with results for a placebo. Subgroup analysis indicated that maintenance olaparib achieved at least a 16.8% probability of cost-effectiveness at the threshold of $200,000/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that the results were sensitive to the hazard ratio of PFS and the cost of olaparib. When overall survival was considered, maintenance olaparib had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $265,290 per additional QALY gained, with a high cost of $128,266 and 0.483 QALY gained, compared with results for a placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance olaparib is potentially cost-effective compared with placebo for patients with a germline BRCA mutation and MPC.

24206,Donor Kidney Quality and Transplant Outcome: An Economic Evaluation of Contemporary Practice,"OBJECTIVES: The study had two main aims. First, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of transplanting deceased donor kidneys of differing quality levels based on the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). Second, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of remaining on the waiting list until a high-quality kidney becomes available compared to transplanting a lower-quality kidney. METHODS: A decision analytic model to estimate cost-effectiveness was developed using a Markov process. Separate models were developed for 4 separate KDPI bands, with higher values indicating lower quality. Models were simulated in 1-year cycles for a 20-year time horizon, with transitions through distinct health states relevant to the kidney recipient from the healthcare payer''s perspective. Weibull regression was used to calculate the time-dependent transition probabilities in the base analysis. The impact uncertainty arising in model parameters was included by probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Willingness to pay was considered as Australian $28?000. RESULTS: Transplanting a kidney of any quality is cost-effective compared to remaining on a waitlist. Transplanting a lower KDPI kidney is cost-effective compared to a higher KDPI kidney. Transplanting lower KDPI kidneys to younger patients and higher KDPI kidneys to older patients is also cost-effective.

24214,Donor Kidney Quality and Transplant Outcome: An Economic Evaluation of Contemporary Practice,"OBJECTIVES: The study had two main aims. First, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of transplanting deceased donor kidneys of differing quality levels based on the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). Second, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of remaining on the waiting list until a high-quality kidney becomes available compared to transplanting a lower-quality kidney. METHODS: A decision analytic model to estimate cost-effectiveness was developed using a Markov process. Separate models were developed for 4 separate KDPI bands, with higher values indicating lower quality. Models were simulated in 1-year cycles for a 20-year time horizon, with transitions through distinct health states relevant to the kidney recipient from the healthcare payer''s perspective. Weibull regression was used to calculate the time-dependent transition probabilities in the base analysis. The impact uncertainty arising in model parameters was included by probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Willingness to pay was considered as Australian $28?000.

24216,Cost-effectiveness analysis of influenza vaccination during pregnancy in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and infants are known as high risk groups for influenza. WHO recommend pregnant women be vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine. In Japan, some municipalities started to give subsidy to encourage pregnant women to receive a shot on their own accord, which has made the introduction of seasonal antepartum maternal vaccination program (AMVP) into the routine vaccination list a current topic in health policy and has raised the need to evaluate the value for money of such possibility. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the efficiency of conducting AMVP in Japan. A decision tree model was adopted taking into consideration the duration of single-year vaccine effectiveness for infants and for mothers. The program targeted pregnant women aged 20-49 years old at or over 12 weeks gestation during October 1 through March 30. Estimated probabilities of treatments received due to influenza for pregnant/postpartum women or their infants varied by calendar time, vaccination status, and/or gestational age. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared with current no-AMVP from societal perspective was calculated. Transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and disease treatment costs were either calculated or extracted from literature. Costs per vaccination was assumed at ¥3,529/US$32.1. RESULTS: AMVP reduces disease treatment costs, while the reduction cannot offset the vaccination cost. Incremental QALYs were at 0.00009, among them 84.2% were from infants. ICER was ¥7,779,356/US$70,721 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that vaccine effectiveness for infant and costs per shot were the two main key variables affecting the ICER. CONCLUSION: We found that vaccinating pregnant women with influenza vaccine to prevent unvaccinated infants and pregnant/postpartum women from influenza-associated disease in Japan can be cost-effective from societal perspective, under the WHO-suggested ""cost-effective"" criteria (1-3 times of GDP).",2020-01-34028,33020012,Vaccine,Shu-Ling Hoshi,2020,38 / 46,7363-7371,Yes,33020012,"Shu-Ling Hoshi; Aiko Shono; Xerxes Seposo; Ichiro Okubo; Masahide Kondo; Zhan-Miao Yi; Peng Men; Shuli Qu; Chaoyun Li; Xin Yu; Suodi Zhai; Cost-effectiveness analysis of influenza vaccination during pregnancy in Japan, Vaccine, 2020 Oct 27; 38(46):1873-2518; 7363-7371",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Immunization,antepartum maternal vaccination program vs. None,pregnant,49 Years,20 Years,Female,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,7779356,Japan,2018,72627.3
24217,Cost-utility analysis of four common surgical treatment pathways for breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the cost-utility of four common surgical treatment pathways for breast cancer: mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy (BCT), implant breast reconstruction (BR) and autologous-BR. METHODS: Patient-level healthcare consumption data and results of a large quality of life (QoL) study from five Dutch hospitals were combined. The cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of incremental costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year follow-up period. Costs were assessed from a healthcare provider perspective. RESULTS: BCT resulted in comparable QoL with lower costs compared to implant-BR and autologous-BR and showed better QoL with higher costs than mastectomy (€17,246/QALY). QoL outcomes and costs of especially autologous-BR were affected by the relatively high occurrence of complications. If reconstruction following mastectomy was performed, implant-BR was more cost-effective than autologous-BR. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of complications had a substantial effect on costs and QoL outcomes of different surgical pathways for breast cancer. When this was taken into account, BCT was most the cost-effective treatment.

24220,Levofloxacin prophylaxis in hospitalized children with leukemia: A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Infections are common and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality during treatment of childhood leukemia. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of levofloxacin antibiotic prophylaxis, compared to no prophylaxis, in children receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURES: A cost-utility analysis was conducted from the perspective of the single-payer health care system using a lifetime horizon. A comprehensive literature review identified available evidence for effectiveness, safety, costs of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with leukemia, and health utilities associated with the relevant health states. The effects of levofloxacin prophylaxis on health outcomes, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and direct health costs were derived from a combined decision tree and state-transition model. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the sensitivity of results to parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The literature review revealed one randomized controlled trial on levofloxacin prophylaxis in childhood AML and relapsed ALL, by Alexander et al, that showed a significant reduction in rates of fever and neutropenia (71.2% vs 82.1%) and bacteremia (21.9% vs 43.4%) with levofloxacin compared to no prophylaxis. In our cost-utility analysis, levofloxacin prophylaxis was dominant over no prophylaxis, resulting in cost savings of $542.44 and increased survival of 0.13 QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, levofloxacin prophylaxis was dominant in 98.8% of iterations.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 9 C difficile single intervention strategies and 8 multi-intervention bundles. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was conducted in a simulated 200-bed tertiary, acute care, adult hospital. The study relied on clinical outcomes from a published agent-based simulation model of C difficile transmission. The model included 4 agent types (ie, patients, nurses, physicians, and visitors). Cost and utility estimates were derived from the literature. INTERVENTIONS: Daily sporicidal cleaning, terminal sporicidal cleaning, health care worker hand hygiene, patient hand hygiene, visitor hand hygiene, health care worker contact precautions, visitor contact precautions, C difficile screening at admission, and reduced intrahospital patient transfers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from the hospital perspective and defined by 2 measures: cost per hospital-onset C difficile infection averted and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: In this agent-based model of a simulated 200-bed tertiary, acute care, adult hospital, 5 of 9 single intervention strategies were dominant, reducing cost, increasing QALYs, and averting hospital-onset C difficile infection compared with baseline standard hospital practices. They were daily cleaning (most cost-effective, saving $358?268 and 36.8 QALYs annually), health care worker hand hygiene, patient hand hygiene, terminal cleaning, and reducing intrahospital patient transfers. Screening at admission cost $1283/QALY, while health care worker contact precautions and visitor hand hygiene interventions cost $123?264/QALY and $5?730?987/QALY, respectively. Visitor contact precautions was dominated, with increased cost and decreased QALYs. Adding screening, health care worker hand hygiene, and patient hand hygiene sequentially to the daily cleaning intervention formed 2-pronged, 3-pronged, and 4-pronged multi-intervention bundles that cost an additional $29?616/QALY, $50?196/QALY, and $146?792/QALY, respectively.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from the hospital perspective and defined by 2 measures: cost per hospital-onset C difficile infection averted and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: In this agent-based model of a simulated 200-bed tertiary, acute care, adult hospital, 5 of 9 single intervention strategies were dominant, reducing cost, increasing QALYs, and averting hospital-onset C difficile infection compared with baseline standard hospital practices. They were daily cleaning (most cost-effective, saving $358?268 and 36.8 QALYs annually), health care worker hand hygiene, patient hand hygiene, terminal cleaning, and reducing intrahospital patient transfers. Screening at admission cost $1283/QALY, while health care worker contact precautions and visitor hand hygiene interventions cost $123?264/QALY and $5?730?987/QALY, respectively. Visitor contact precautions was dominated, with increased cost and decreased QALYs. Adding screening, health care worker hand hygiene, and patient hand hygiene sequentially to the daily cleaning intervention formed 2-pronged, 3-pronged, and 4-pronged multi-intervention bundles that cost an additional $29?616/QALY, $50?196/QALY, and $146?792/QALY, respectively.

However, the optimal sequence of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as part of antidepressant treatment algorithm is unclear. We examined the cost-effectiveness of ECT and TMS in MDD. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to determine total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for 10 strategies. Each strategy comprised four treatment lines with ECT and TMS incorporated as second, third, or fourth line. A scenario analysis that explored the cost-effectiveness of maintenance approach by continuing ECT and TMS after acute treatment was performed. RESULTS: In the base case, fourth-line TMS after three preceding trials of antidepressants was least costly at US$ 5523 yielding 1.424 QALYs. Compared with this strategy, fourth-line ECT and third-line TMS followed by ECT were cost-effective with ICERs of US$ 7601 per QALY gained and US$ 11?388 per QALY gained, respectively.

24237,Neurostimulation therapies in major depressive disorder: A decision-analytic model,"AIM: Neurostimulation techniques are effective treatments for major depressive disorders (MDD). However, the optimal sequence of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as part of antidepressant treatment algorithm is unclear. We examined the cost-effectiveness of ECT and TMS in MDD. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to determine total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for 10 strategies. Each strategy comprised four treatment lines with ECT and TMS incorporated as second, third, or fourth line. A scenario analysis that explored the cost-effectiveness of maintenance approach by continuing ECT and TMS after acute treatment was performed. RESULTS: In the base case, fourth-line TMS after three preceding trials of antidepressants was least costly at US$ 5523 yielding 1.424 QALYs. Compared with this strategy, fourth-line ECT and third-line TMS followed by ECT were cost-effective with ICERs of US$ 7601 per QALY gained and US$ 11?388 per QALY gained, respectively.

24238,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Genetic Testing and Tailored First-Line Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors,"IMPORTANCE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is frequently driven by oncogenic KIT variations. Imatinib targeting of KIT marked a new era in GIST treatment and ushered in precision oncological treatment for all solid malignant neoplasms. However, studies on the molecular biological traits of GIST have found that tumors respond differentially to imatinib dosage based on the KIT exon with variation. Despite this knowledge, few patients undergo genetic testing at diagnosis, and empirical imatinib therapy remains routine. Barriers to genetic profiling include concerns about the cost and utility of testing. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether targeted gene testing (TGT) is a cost-effective diagnostic for patients with metastatic GIST from the US payer perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of TGT and tailored first-line therapy compared with empirical imatinib therapy among patients with a new diagnosis of metastatic GIST. The main health outcome, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were obtained from the literature, and transitional probabilities were modeled from disease progression and survival estimates from randomized clinical trials of patients with metastatic GIST. Data analyses were conducted October 2019 to January 2020. EXPOSURE: TGT and tailored first-line therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was QALYs and cost. Cost-effectiveness was defined using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than $100?000/QALY considered cost-effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model stability. RESULTS: Therapy directed by TGT was associated with an increase of 0.10 QALYs at a cost of $9513 compared with the empirical imatinib approach, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $92?100. These findings were sensitive to the costs of TGT, drugs, and health utility model inputs. Therapy directed by TGT remained cost-effective for genetic testing costs up to $3730. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that TGT-directed therapy was considered cost-effective 70% of the time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that using genetic testing to match treatment of KIT variations to imatinib dosing is a cost-effective approach compared with empirical imatinib.",2020-01-34049,32986105,JAMA Netw Open,Sudeep Banerjee,2020,3 / 9,e2013565,No,32986105,"Sudeep Banerjee; Abhishek Kumar; Nicole Lopez; Beiqun Zhao; Chih-Min Tang; Mayra Yebra; Hyunho Yoon; James D Murphy; Jason K Sicklick; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Genetic Testing and Tailored First-Line Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors, JAMA Netw Open, 2020 Sep 1; 3(9):2574-3805; e2013565",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical, Screening",targeted gene testing-directed therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- empirical imatinib,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,92100,United States,2018,94925.64
24239,Cost-Effectiveness of Ivacaftor Therapy for Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis Patients With the G551D Gating Mutation,"OBJECTIVES: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disease with no cure. Until recently, treatment has targeted symptoms of the disease and not the disease-causing genetic defect. Ivacaftor is included in a new class of breakthrough drugs targeting the genetic defects of CF. We sought to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of ivacaftor from a US payer perspective. METHODS: We developed an individual-level microsimulation model that followed a cohort of heterogeneous US CF patients over a lifetime. The primary outcome of interest was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We also compared unadjusted life years, count of acute pulmonary exacerbations, and count of lung transplants over a lifetime between patients treated with ivacaftor plus best supportive care and patients treated with best supportive care alone. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the impact of various model inputs and uncertainties. RESULTS: We found a substantial increase in QALYs, life years, and treatment costs over a lifetime for patients treated with ivacaftor plus best supportive care versus best supportive care alone. Discounted results for ivacaftor were 22.92 QALYs and $8?797?840 in total lifetime costs compared to 16.12 QALYs and $2?336?366 lifetime costs for best supportive care alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $950?217 per QALY. Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0% chance that ivacaftor was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $500?000 per QALY.

24240,Cost-effectiveness of consensus guideline based management of pancreatic cysts: The sensitivity and specificity required for guidelines to be cost-effective,"BACKGROUND: Detection of cystic lesions of the pancreas has outpaced our ability to stratify low-grade cystic lesions from those at greater risk for pancreatic cancer, raising a concern for overtreatment. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model to determine the cost-effectiveness of guideline-based management for asymptomatic pancreatic cysts. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and survival were calculated for current management guidelines. A sensitivity analysis estimated the effect on cost-effectiveness and mortality if overtreatment of low-grade cysts is avoided, and the sensitivity and specificity thresholds required of methods of cyst stratification to improve costs expended. RESULTS: ""Surveillance"" using current management guidelines had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $171,143/quality adjusted life year compared with no surveillance or operative treatment (""do nothing""). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surveillance decreases to $80,707/quality adjusted life year if the operative overtreatment of low-grade cysts was avoided. Assuming a societal willingness-to-pay of $100,000/quality adjusted life year, the diagnostic specificity for high-risk cysts must be >67% for surveillance to be preferred over surgery and ""do nothing."" Changes in sensitivity alone cannot make surveillance cost-effective. Most importantly, survival in surveillance is worse than ""do nothing"" for 3 years after cyst diagnosis, although long-term survival is improved. The disadvantage is eliminated when overtreatment of low-grade cysts is avoided.

24242,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Screening Extremely Low Birth Weight Children for Hepatoblastoma Using Serum Alpha-fetoprotein,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening children born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW) for hepatoblastoma using serial serum alpha-fetoprotein measurements. STUDY DESIGN: We created a decision tree to evaluate the cost effectiveness of screening children born at ELBW between 3 and 48 months of age compared with current standard of care (no screening). Our model used discounted lifetime costs and monetary benefits in 2018 US dollars, based on estimates in the published literature. The effects of uncertainty in model parameters were also assessed using univariate sensitivity analyses, in which we changed the values for one parameter at a time to assess the effect on the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: For the estimated 55 699 children born at ELBW in the US each year, this screening is associated with 77.7 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a cost of $8.7 million. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of about $112 000/QALY, which is considered cost effective from a US societal perspective. For children diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, our model finds that the screening regimen is associated with a 10.1% increase in survival, a 4.18% increase in expected QALYs, and a $245 184 decrease in expected cost.

24243,Cost-effectiveness of Mechanical Thrombectomy More Than 6 Hours After Symptom Onset Among Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke,"IMPORTANCE: Two 2018 randomized controlled trials (DAWN and DEFUSE 3) demonstrated the clinical benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) more than 6 hours after onset in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Health-economic evidence is needed to determine whether the short-term health benefits of late MT translate to a cost-effective option during a lifetime in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 strategies (MT added to standard medical care [SMC] vs SMC alone) for various subgroups of patients with AIS receiving care more than 6 hours after symptom onset. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation study used the results of the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials to populate a cost-effectiveness model from a US health care perspective combining a decision tree and Markov trace. The DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials enrolled 206 international patients from 2014 to 2017 and 182 US patients from 2016 to 2017, respectively. Patients were followed until 3 months after stroke. The clinical outcome at 3 months was available for 29 subgroups of patients with AIS and anterior circulation large vessel occlusions. Data analysis was conducted from July 2018 to October 2019. EXPOSURES: MT with SMC in the extended treatment window vs SMC alone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) during lifetime were estimated. Deterministic results (incremental costs and effectiveness, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefit) were presented, and probabilistic analyses were performed for the total populations and 27 patient subgroups. RESULTS: In the DAWN study, the MT group had a mean (SD) age of 69.4 (14.1) years and 42 of 107 (39.3%) were men, and the control group had a mean (SD) age of 70.7 (13.2) years and 51 of 99 (51.5%) were men. In the DEFUSE 3 study, the MT group had a median (interquartile range) age of 70 (59-79) years, and 46 of 92 (50.0%) were men, and the control group had a median (interquartile range) age of 71 (59-80) years, and 44 of 90 (48.9%) were men. For the total trial population, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $662/QALY and $13?877/QALY based on the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials, respectively. MT with SMC beyond 6 hours had a probability greater than 99.9% of being cost-effective vs SMC alone at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000/QALY. Subgroup analyses showed a wide range of probabilities for MT with SMC to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50?000/QALY, with the greatest uncertainty observed for patients with a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of at least 16 and for those aged 80 years or older. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that late MT added to SMC is cost-effective in all subgroups evaluated in the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials, with most results being robust in probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

24245,Cost-effectiveness of Population-Wide Genomic Screening for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in the United States,"IMPORTANCE: Genomic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in unselected women offers an opportunity to prevent cancer morbidity and mortality, but the potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of such screening have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime incremental incidence of HBOC and the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness of HBOC genomic screening in an unselected population vs family history-based testing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study conducted from October 27, 2017, to May 3, 2020, a decision analytic Markov model was developed that included health states for precancer, for risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), for earlier- and later-stage HBOC, after cancer, and for death. A complimentary cascade testing module was also developed to estimate outcomes in first-degree relatives. Age-specific RRM and RRSO uptake probabilities were estimated from the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative and published sources. Parameters including RRM and RRSO effectiveness, variant-specific cancer risk, costs, and utilities were derived from published sources. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate model assumptions and uncertainty. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime cancer incidence, QALYs, life-years, and direct medical costs for genomic screening in an unselected population vs family history-based testing only were calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the difference in cost between strategies divided by the difference in QALYs between strategies. Earlier-stage and later-stage cancer cases prevented and total cancer cases prevented were also calculated. RESULTS: The model found that population screening of 30-year-old women was associated with 75 (95% credible range [CR], 60-90) fewer overall cancer cases and 288 QALYs (95% CR, 212-373 QALYs) gained per 100?000 women screened, at an incremental cost of $25 million (95% CR, $21 millon to $30 million) vs family history-based testing; the ICER was $87?700 (78% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of $100?000 per QALY). In contrast, population screening of 45-year-old women was associated with 24 (95% CR, 18-29) fewer cancer cases and 97 QALYs (95% CR, 66-130 QALYs) gained per 100?000 women screened, at an incremental cost of $26 million (95% CR, $22 million to $30 million); the ICER was $268?200 (0% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of $100?000 per QALY). A scenario analysis without cascade testing increased the ICER to $92?600 for 30-year-old women and $354?500 for 45-year-old women. A scenario analysis assuming a 5% absolute decrease in mammography screening in women without a variant was associated with the potential for net harm (-90 QALYs per 100?000 women screened; 95% CR, -180 to 10 QALYs). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that population HBOC screening may be cost-effective among younger women but not among older women.

RESULTS: The model found that population screening of 30-year-old women was associated with 75 (95% credible range [CR], 60-90) fewer overall cancer cases and 288 QALYs (95% CR, 212-373 QALYs) gained per 100?000 women screened, at an incremental cost of $25 million (95% CR, $21 millon to $30 million) vs family history-based testing; the ICER was $87?700 (78% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of $100?000 per QALY). In contrast, population screening of 45-year-old women was associated with 24 (95% CR, 18-29) fewer cancer cases and 97 QALYs (95% CR, 66-130 QALYs) gained per 100?000 women screened, at an incremental cost of $26 million (95% CR, $22 million to $30 million); the ICER was $268?200 (0% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of $100?000 per QALY). A scenario analysis without cascade testing increased the ICER to $92?600 for 30-year-old women and $354?500 for 45-year-old women. A scenario analysis assuming a 5% absolute decrease in mammography screening in women without a variant was associated with the potential for net harm (-90 QALYs per 100?000 women screened; 95% CR, -180 to 10 QALYs). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that population HBOC screening may be cost-effective among younger women but not among older women.

24247,Cost-effectiveness of Population-Wide Genomic Screening for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in the United States,"IMPORTANCE: Genomic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in unselected women offers an opportunity to prevent cancer morbidity and mortality, but the potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of such screening have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime incremental incidence of HBOC and the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness of HBOC genomic screening in an unselected population vs family history-based testing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study conducted from October 27, 2017, to May 3, 2020, a decision analytic Markov model was developed that included health states for precancer, for risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), for earlier- and later-stage HBOC, after cancer, and for death. A complimentary cascade testing module was also developed to estimate outcomes in first-degree relatives. Age-specific RRM and RRSO uptake probabilities were estimated from the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative and published sources. Parameters including RRM and RRSO effectiveness, variant-specific cancer risk, costs, and utilities were derived from published sources. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate model assumptions and uncertainty. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime cancer incidence, QALYs, life-years, and direct medical costs for genomic screening in an unselected population vs family history-based testing only were calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the difference in cost between strategies divided by the difference in QALYs between strategies.

24297,Pertussis vaccination in pregnancy in Canada: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: The Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends universal vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine in pregnancy in Canada. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing a vaccination program to no program corresponding with the 2017 Canadian guideline for economic evaluation from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health. We developed 2 models - part decision tree, part Markov model - to estimate the long-term cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for pregnant women and their infants. We obtained epidemiologic data from 2006 to 2015, and derived costs and utility values from relevant sources. Results were reported in 2019 Canadian dollars. We obtained expected values through probabilistic analysis, with methodologic and structural uncertainty assessed through scenario analyses. The analysis adopted an acquisition price of Tdap vaccine of $12.50, with scenario analysis conducted to identify the threshold price for vaccination to be cost-effective. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, for every 1000 pregnant women vaccinated, the program would lead to a gain of 0.3 QALYs, occurring solely in infants, at an increased total cost of $12 987, or $44 301 per QALY gained. Based on a threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained, vaccination would have been cost-effective in 6 of the 10 years included in the model (range of incremental costs $20 463-$100 348 per QALY gained). The threshold cost for Tdap vaccine to be cost-effective over the 10-year horizon was $14.03. INTERPRETATION: Based on a threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained, vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy would be cost-effective if the acquisition cost per vaccine were $14.03 or less.

24298,Two-year cost effectiveness between two gradual tapering strategies in rheumatoid arthritis: cost-utility analysis of the TARA trial,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the 2-year cost-utility ratio between tapering conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD) first followed by the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor, or vice versa, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Two-year data of the Tapering strategies in Rheumatoid Arthritis trial were used. Patients with RA, who used both a csDMARD and a TNF-inhibitor and had a well-controlled disease (disease activity score =2.4 and swollen joint count=1) for at least 3 months, were randomised into gradual tapering the csDMARD first followed by the TNF-inhibitor, or vice versa. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived from the European Quality of life questionnaire with 5 dimensions. Healthcare and productivity costs were calculated with data from patient records and questionnaires. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit were used to assess cost effectiveness between both tapering strategies. RESULTS: 94 patients started tapering their TNF-inhibitor first, while the other 95 tapered their csDMARD first. QALYs (SD) were, respectively, 1.64 (0.22) and 1.65 (0.22). Medication costs were significantly lower in the patients who tapered the TNF-inhibitor first, while indirect cost were higher due to more productivity loss (p=0.10). Therefore, total costs (SD) were €38?833 (€39 616) for tapering csDMARDs first, and €39?442 (€47 271) for tapering the TNF-inhibitor (p=0.88). For willingness-to-pay (WTP) levels <€83?800 tapering, the csDMARD first has the highest probability of being cost effective, while for WTP levels >€83?800 tapering the TNF-inhibitor first has the highest probability. CONCLUSION: Our economic evaluation shows that costs are similar for both tapering strategies. Regardless of the WTP, tapering either the TNF-inhibitor or the csDMARD first is equally cost effective.

METHODS: A previously published model estimated costs [2018 euros (EUR)] and effectiveness [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] with degludec compared with glargine U300 over a 1-year time horizon. The model captured hypoglycaemia rates and insulin dosing. Clinical outcomes were informed by CONCLUDE (NCT03078478), a head-to-head randomised controlled trial in insulin-experienced patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Treatment with degludec was associated with mean annual cost savings (EUR 24.71 per patient) relative to glargine U300, driven by a lower basal insulin dose and lower severe hypoglycaemia rate with degludec compared with glargine U300. Lower rates of non-severe nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia resulted in improved effectiveness (+?0.0045 QALYs) with degludec relative to glargine U300. In sensitivity analyses, changes to the vast majority of model parameters did not materially affect model outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This short-term analysis, informed by the latest clinical trial evidence, demonstrated that degludec was a cost-effective treatment option relative to glargine U300. As such, our modelling analysis suggests that degludec would represent an efficient use of Dutch public healthcare resources in this patient population.",2020-01-34074,32306247,Adv Ther,Marc Evans,2020,37 / 5,2413-2426,No,32306247,"Marc Evans; Robert G J Moes; Katrine S Pedersen; Jens Gundgaard; Thomas R Pieber; Zhe Li; Steven Habbous; Jenny Thain; Daniel E Hall; A Dave Nagpal; Rodrigo Bagur; Bob Kiaii; Ava John-Baptiste; Cost-Effectiveness of Insulin Degludec Versus Insulin Glargine U300 in the Netherlands: Evidence From a Randomised Controlled Trial, Adv Ther, 2020 May; 37(5):0741-238X; 2413-2426",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,insulin degludec vs. Insulin glargine U300,previously treated with a basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-5491.11,Euro,2018,-6687.9
24300,The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a hospital avoidance program in a residential aged care facility: a prospective cohort study and modelled decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: Residential aged care facility residents experience high rates of hospital admissions which are stressful, costly and often preventable. The EDDIE program is a hospital avoidance initiative designed to enable nursing and care staff to detect, refer and quickly respond to early signals of a deteriorating resident. The program was implemented in a 96-bed residential aged care facility in regional Australia. METHODS: A prospective pre-post cohort study design was used to collect data on costs of program delivery, hospital admission rates and length of stay for the 12?months prior to, and following, the intervention. A Markov decision model was developed to synthesize study data with published literature in order to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the program. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were adopted as the measure of effectiveness. RESULTS: The EDDIE program was associated with a 19% reduction in annual hospital admissions and a 31% reduction in the average length of stay. The cost-effectiveness analysis found the program to be both more effective and less costly than usual care, with 0.06 QALYs gained and $249,000 health system costs saved in a modelled cohort of 96 residents. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated that there was an 86% probability that the program was cost-effective after taking the uncertainty of the model inputs into account. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides promising evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a nurse led, early intervention program in preventing unnecessary hospital admissions within a residential aged care facility. Further research in multi-site randomised studies is needed to confirm the generalisability of these results.",2020-01-34075,33287716,BMC Geriatr,Hannah E Carter,2020,20 / 1,527,No,33287716,"Hannah E Carter; Xing J Lee; Trudy Dwyer; Barbara O'Neill; Dee Jeffrey; Christopher M Doran; Lynne Parkinson; Sonya R Osborne; Kerry Reid-Searl; Nicholas Graves; Bin Wan; Nan Fang; Wei Guan; Haixia Ding; Ying Wang; Xin Ge; Hui Liang; Xin Li; Yiyang Zhan; The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a hospital avoidance program in a residential aged care facility: a prospective cohort study and modelled decision analysis, BMC Geriatr, 2020 Dec 7; 20(1):1471-2318; 527",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Care Delivery,early detection of deterioration in elderly residents program vs. Standard/Usual Care,residents of aged care setting,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-4150,Australia,2018,-3197.15
