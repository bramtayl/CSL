28901,Obstacles to surgical services in a rural Cameroonian district hospital,"BACKGROUND: There are significant obstacles to the delivery of surgical care in low income countries. Few studies have defined or characterized these constraints. The present study aimed to identify financial and demographic factors limiting the utilization of surgical services in rural Cameroon. METHODS: A review was performed of all surgical records for patients presenting for surgery at the District Hospital of Kolofata in rural Cameroon over the 3-year study period (2004-2007). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated using disease- and patient-specific outcomes while accounting for postoperative morbidity. Univariate and multivariate analysis identified factors associated with failure to return for care. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,213 patients presented for preoperative evaluation, were informed of the cost to be paid preoperatively, and had surgery scheduled. Of these, 544 patients did not return for treatment, representing 2,163 DALYs potentially lost. Multivariate analysis revealed significant factors associated with increased likelihood of not returning for care as required preoperative payment >$US 310 (OR 0.44-0.86) and a recommended procedure for cancer (OR 0.47-0.86) or cutaneous disease (OR 0.28-0.95). Factors associated with increased odds of returning were male gender (OR 1.03-1.98), preoperative payment <$US 50 (OR 2.86-16.2), and a procedure with low DALYs (OR 1.71-9.89). The average cost per DALY for all operations performed was $US 27.13.

28906,"Application of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment to analyze the public health risk from poor drinking water quality in a low income area in Accra, Ghana","In Accra, Ghana, a majority of inhabitants lives in over-crowded areas with limited access to piped water supply, which is often also intermittent. This study assessed in a densely populated area the risk from microbial contamination of various sources of drinking water, by conducting a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) to estimate the risk to human health from microorganism exposure and dose-response relationships. Furthermore the cost-effectiveness in reducing the disease burden through targeted interventions was evaluated. Five risk pathways for drinking water were identified through a survey (110 families), namely household storage, private yard taps, communal taps, communal wells and water sachets. Samples from each source were analyzed for Escherichia coli and Ascaris contamination. Published ratios between E. coli and other pathogens were used for the QMRA and disease burden calculations. The major part of the burden of disease originated from E. coli O157:H7 (78%) and the least important contributor was Cryptosporidium (0.01%). Other pathogens contributed 16% (Campylobacter), 5% (Rotavirus) and 0.3% (Ascaris). The sum of the disease burden of these pathogens was 0.5 DALYs per person per year, which is much higher than the WHO reference level.

28911,African Programme For Onchocerciasis Control 1995-2015: model-estimated health impact and cost,"BACKGROUND: Onchocerciasis causes a considerable disease burden in Africa, mainly through skin and eye disease. Since 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) has coordinated annual mass treatment with ivermectin in 16 countries. In this study, we estimate the health impact of APOC and the associated costs from a program perspective up to 2010 and provide expected trends up to 2015. METHODS AND FINDINGS: With data on pre-control prevalence of infection and population coverage of mass treatment, we simulated trends in infection, blindness, visual impairment, and severe itch using the micro-simulation model ONCHOSIM, and estimated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to onchocerciasis. We assessed financial costs for APOC, beneficiary governments, and non-governmental development organizations, excluding cost of donated drugs. We estimated that between 1995 and 2010, mass treatment with ivermectin averted 8.2 million DALYs due to onchocerciasis in APOC areas, at a nominal cost of about US$257 million. We expect that APOC will avert another 9.2 million DALYs between 2011 and 2015, at a nominal cost of US$221 million. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations suggest that APOC has had a remarkable impact on population health in Africa between 1995 and 2010. This health impact is predicted to double during the subsequent five years of the program, through to 2015. APOC is a highly cost-effective public health program. Given the anticipated elimination of onchocerciasis from some APOC areas, we expect even more health gains and a more favorable cost-effectiveness of mass treatment with ivermectin in the near future.",2013-99-10855,23383355,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,Luc E Coffeng,2013,7 / 1,e2032,No,23383355,"Luc E Coffeng; Wilma A Stolk; Honorat G M Zoure; J Lennert Veerman; Koffi B Agblewonu; Michele E Murdoch; Mounkaila Noma; Grace Fobi; Jan Hendrik Richardus; Donald A P Bundy; Dik Habbema; Sake J de Vlas; Uche V Amazigo; African Programme For Onchocerciasis Control 1995-2015: model-estimated health impact and cost, PLoS Negl Trop Dis, ; 7(1):1935-2735; e2032",DALY,"Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Democratic Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Liberia, Malawi, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda",Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Other",Mass treatment with ivermectin agianst onchocerciasis vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,27.49,United States,2011,31.63
28912,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a national neonatal hearing screening program in China: conditions for the scale-up,"BACKGROUND: In 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Health recommended scale-up of routine neonatal hearing screening - previously performed primarily only in select urban hospitals - throughout the entire country. METHODS: A decision analytical model for a simulated population of all live births in china was developed to compare the costs and health effects of five mutually exclusive interventions: 1) universal screening using Otoacoustic Emission (OAE) and Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR); 2) universal OAE; 3) targeted OAE and AABR; 4) targeted OAE; and 5) no screening. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated for health effects. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Based on the cost-effectiveness and potential health outcomes, the optimal path for scale-up would be to start with targeted OAE and then expand to universal OAE and universal OAE plus AABR. Accessibility of screening, diagnosis, and intervention services significantly affect decision of the options.

28915,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a national neonatal hearing screening program in China: conditions for the scale-up,"BACKGROUND: In 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Health recommended scale-up of routine neonatal hearing screening - previously performed primarily only in select urban hospitals - throughout the entire country. METHODS: A decision analytical model for a simulated population of all live births in china was developed to compare the costs and health effects of five mutually exclusive interventions: 1) universal screening using Otoacoustic Emission (OAE) and Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR); 2) universal OAE; 3) targeted OAE and AABR; 4) targeted OAE; and 5) no screening. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated for health effects.

28916,Cost-effectiveness of interventions for reducing road traffic injuries related to driving under the influence of alcohol,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce road traffic injuries caused by driving under the influence of alcohol in Thailand. METHODS: We used generalized cost-effectiveness analysis and included costs from a health sector perspective. The model considered road traffic crash victims who were injured, disabled, or died. We obtained proportions of alcohol-related crashes from the Thai Injury Surveillance system. Intervention effectiveness was derived from published reviews and a study in one province of Thailand. Random breath testing, selective breath testing, and mass media campaigns, both current and intervention scenarios, were compared with a ""do-nothing"" scenario. We calculated intervention costs and cost offsets of prevented treatment costs in 2004 Thai baht (US $1 = 41 baht) and measured benefits in terms of disability-adjusted life-years averted. Interventions with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below 110,000 Thai baht (1xgross domestic product per capita) per disability-adjusted life-year (US $2,680) were considered very cost-effective. RESULTS: Compared with doing nothing, mass media campaigns, random breath testing, and selective breath testing are all cost saving. When averted treatment costs are ignored and only intervention costs are included, all three interventions are very cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 10,300, 14,300 and 13,000 baht/disability-adjusted life-year, respectively. The current mix of mass media campaigns and sobriety checkpoints is therefore also cost-effective, but underinvestment in checkpoints limits its overall effect.

28921,The cost-effectiveness of gestational diabetes screening including prevention of type 2 diabetes: application of a new model in India and Israel,"OBJECTIVE: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with elevated risks of perinatal complications and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and screening and intervention can reduce these risks. We quantified the cost, health impact and cost-effectiveness of GDM screening and intervention in India and Israel, settings with contrasting epidemiologic and cost environments. METHODS: We developed a decision-analysis tool (the GeDiForCE) to assess cost-effectiveness. Using both local data and published estimates, we applied the model for a general medical facility in Chennai, India and for the largest HMO in Israel. We computed costs (discounted international dollars), averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and net cost per DALY averted, compared with no GDM screening. RESULTS: The programme costs per 1000 pregnant women are $259,139 in India and $259,929 in Israel. Net costs, adjusted for averted disease, are $194,358 and $76,102, respectively. The cost per DALY averted is $1626 in India and $1830 in Israel. Sensitivity analysis findings range from $628 to $3681 per DALY averted in India and net savings of $72,420-8432 per DALY averted in Israel.

28923,Burden of surgically correctable disabilities among children in the Dadaab Refugee Camp,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is increasingly recognized as a means to reduce the morbidity and mortality of disabling impairments in resource-limited environments. We sought to estimate the burden of surgically correctable disabling impairments and the cost-effectiveness of their treatment among children in a large refugee camp. METHODS: This is a chart review of all patients aged 0-18 years from Dadaab Refugee Camp (Kenya) treated at a facility primarily responsible for providing pediatric surgical care in the region. Total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were calculated using life expectancy tables and established or estimated disability weights. A sensitivity analysis was performed using various life expectancy tables. Delayed averted DALYs caused by delay in care were also estimated. Inpatient costs were collected to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011 a total of 640 procedures were performed on 341 patients. The median age at surgery was 4.6 years, and 33 % of the children treated were female. Only 13.5 % of surgeries estimated as required for common congenital surgical conditions were actually performed. The total number of DALYs averted ranged from 4,136 to 9,529 (6.4-14.8 per patient), depending on the calculation method used. Cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in values of $40-$88 per DALY. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of pediatric surgical disabling impairments in refugee camps is substantial. Surgical intervention to address this burden is both feasible and cost-effective.

28924,Getting the job done: analysis of the impact and effectiveness of the SmileTrain program in alleviating the global burden of cleft disease,"BACKGROUND: The study measured the success of SmileTrain, the largest cleft charity globally, in alleviating the global burden of disease (GBD). It was done by estimating averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and delayed averted DALYs because of the global backlog in cleft procedures. METHODS: Anonymized data for all procedures in the SmileTrain global database were analyzed by age, sex, country, region, and surgery type. DALYs averted were calculated using life expectancy tables and established and estimated disability weights. The cost-effectiveness analysis used mean SmileTrain procedural disbursement figures. Sensitivity analysis was performed using various cleft incidence rates, life expectancy tables, and disability weights. RESULTS: During 2003-2010 a total of 536,846 operations were performed on 364,467 patients-86 % in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific region. Procedure numbers increased yearly. Mean age at primary surgery-6.2 years (9.8 years in Africa)-remained fairly constant over time in each region. Globally, 2.1-4.7 million DALYs were averted through the operations at a total estimated cost of US$196 M. Mean DALYs per patient were 3.8-9.0, and mean cost per DALY was $72-$134. Total delayed GBD due to advanced age at surgery was 191,000-457,000 DALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an unparalleled number of surgeries performed and yearly increase by one charity, the unmet and delayed averted cleft GBD remains significant in all regions. Large geographic disparities reflect varied challenges regarding access to surgery. Cleft surgeries are cost-effective interventions to reduce the global burden of disease (GBD).

28925,Characterizing the global burden of surgical disease: a method to estimate inguinal hernia epidemiology in Ghana,"BACKGROUND: Surgical conditions represent an immense yet underrecognized source of disease burden globally. Characterizing the burden of surgical disease has been defined as a priority research agenda in global surgery. Little is known about the epidemiology of inguinal hernia, a common easily treatable surgical condition, in resource-poor settings. METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey prospective cohort study of inguinal hernia, we created a method to estimate hernia epidemiology in Ghana. We calculated inguinal hernia incidence and prevalence using Ghanaian demographic data and projected hernia prevalence under three surgical rate and hernia incidence scenarios. Disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with inguinal hernia along with costs for surgical repair were estimated. RESULTS: According to this approach, the prevalence of inguinal hernia in the Ghanaian general population is 3.15% (range 2.79-3.50%). Symptomatic hernias number 530,082 (range 469,501-588,980). The annual incidence of symptomatic hernias is 210 (range 186-233) per 100,000 population. At the estimated Ghanaian hernia repair rate of 30 per 100,000, a backlog of 1 million hernias in need of repair develop over 10 years. The cost of repairing all symptomatic hernias in Ghana is estimated at US $53 million, and US $106 million would be required to eliminate hernias over a 10-year period. Nearly 5 million DALYs would be averted with the repair of prevalent cases of symptomatic hernia in Ghana. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated by our method indicate the extent to which Ghana lacks the surgical capacity to address its significant inguinal hernia disease burden. This approach provides a simple framework for calculating inguinal hernia epidemiology in resource-poor settings that may be used for advocacy and program planning in multiple country contexts.",2013-99-10128,23224074,World J Surg,Jessica H Beard,2013,37 / 3,,No,23224074,"Jessica H Beard; Lawrence B Oresanya; Michael Ohene-Yeboah; Rochelle A Dicker; Hobart W Harris; Characterizing the global burden of surgical disease: a method to estimate inguinal hernia epidemiology in Ghana, World J Surg, 2013 Mar; 37(3):0364-2313",DALY,Ghana,Not Stated,Surgical,Tension-free inguinal hernia repair with mosquito net mesh and spinal anesthesia vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,10.75,United States,2011,12.37

The cost effectiveness of treating childhood cancers in these settings is unknown. The objective of the present work was to determine cost-effectiveness thresholds for common paediatric cancers using acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Brazil and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) in Malawi as examples.

The case examples were selected due to the data available and because ALL and BL both have the potential to yield significant health gains at a low cost per patient treated. The key findings were as follows: the 3:1 cost/DALY prevented to GDP/capita ratio for ALL in Brazil was US $771,225; expenditures below this threshold were cost effective. Costs below US $257,075 (1:1 ratio) were considered very cost effective. Analogous thresholds for BL in Malawi were US $42,729 and US $14,243. Actual costs were far less. In Brazil, US $16,700 was spent to treat each patient while in Malawi total drug costs were less than US $50 per child.

In Brazil, US $16,700 was spent to treat each patient while in Malawi total drug costs were less than US $50 per child.

28928,Cost-effectiveness of inguinal hernia surgery in northwestern Ecuador,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness of tension-free inguinal hernia repair at a private 20-bed rural hospital in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador, was calculated relative to no treatment. METHODS: Lichtenstein repair using mosquito net or polypropylene commercial mesh was provided to patients with inguinal hernia by surgeons from Europe and North America. Prospective data were collected from provider, patient, and societal perspectives, with component costs collected on site and from local supply companies or published literature. Patient outcomes were forecasted using disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Uncertainty in patient-level data was evaluated with Monte-Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Surgery was provided to 102 patients with inguinal hernias of various sizes. Local anesthesia was used for 80 % of operations during the first mission, and spinal anesthesia was used for 89 % in the second mission. Few complications were observed. An average 6.39 DALYs (3,0) were averted per patient (95 % confidence interval: 6.22-6.84). The average cost per patient was US$499.33 (95 % CI: US$490.19-$526.03) from a provider perspective, US$118.79 (95 % CI: US$110.28-$143.72) from a patient perspective, and US$615.46 (95 % CI: US$603.39-$650.40) from a societal perspective. Mean cost-effectiveness from a provider perspective was US$78.18/DALY averted (95 % CI: US$75.86-$85.78) according to DALYs (3,0) averted using the West Life Table level 26, well below the Ecuadorian per-capita Gross National Income (US$3,850).

28929,"Forecasting burden of long-term disability from neonatal conditions: results from the Projahnmo I trial, Sylhet, Bangladesh","INTRODUCTION: The burden of disease resulting from neonatal conditions is substantial in developing countries. From 2003 to 2005, the Projahnmo I programme delivered community-based interventions for maternal and newborn health in Sylhet, Bangladesh. This analysis quantifies burden of disability and incorporates non-fatal outcomes into cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions delivered in the Projahnmo I programme. METHODS: A decision tree model was created to predict disability resulting from preterm birth, neonatal meningitis and intrapartum-related hypoxia (''birth asphyxia''). Outcomes were defined as the years lost to disability (YLD) component of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Calculations were based on data from the Projahnmo I trial, supplemented with values from published literature and expert opinion where data were absent. RESULTS: 195 YLD per 1000 neonates [95% confidence interval (CI): 157-241] were predicted in the main calculation, sensitive to different DALY assumptions, disability weights and alternative model structures. The Projahnmo I home care intervention may have averted 2.0 (1.3-2.8) YLD per 1000 neonates. Compared with calculations based on reductions in mortality alone, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreased by only 0.6% from $105.23 to $104.62 ($65.15-$266.60) when YLD were included, with 0.6% more DALYs averted [total 338/1000 (95% CI: 131-542)]. DISCUSSION: A significant burden of disability results from neonatal conditions in Sylhet, Bangladesh. Adding YLD has very little impact on recommendations based on cost-effectiveness, even at the margin of programme adoption. This model provides guidance for collecting data on disabilities in new settings.",2012-XX-09798,23002251,Health Policy Plan,Samuel D Shillcutt,2013,28 / 4,,No,23002251,"Samuel D Shillcutt; Amnesty E Lefevre; Anne C C Lee; Abdullah H Baqui; Robert E Black; Gary L Darmstadt; Forecasting burden of long-term disability from neonatal conditions: results from the Projahnmo I trial, Sylhet, Bangladesh, Health Policy Plan, 2013 Jul; 28(4):0268-1080",DALY,Bangladesh,Not Stated,Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care,"Community-based interventions for maternal and newborn health (e.g. pregnancy surveillance, birth preparedness, essential newborn care training, referral and/or home treatment for sepsis) vs. Standard/Usual Care","preterm birth, neonatal meningitis and intrapartum-related hypoxia",5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,104.62,United States,2010,124.17

The cost-effectiveness of this model of treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) was compared with the cost-effectiveness of the ''standard of care'' for SAM (i.e. inpatient treatment), augmented with community surveillance by CHWs to detect cases, in a neighbouring area. An activity-based cost model was used, and a societal perspective taken, to include all costs incurred in the programme by providers and participants for the management of SAM in both areas. Cost data were coupled with programme effectiveness data. The community-based strategy cost US$26 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted, compared with US$1344 per DALY averted for inpatient treatment. The average cost to participant households for their child to recover from SAM in community treatment was one-sixth that of inpatient treatment.

28932,"Cost-effectiveness of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine introduction in the universal immunization schedule in Haryana State, India","OBJECTIVE: In India, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine introduction in the universal immunization programme requires evidence of its potential health impact and cost-effectiveness, as it is a costly vaccine. Since childhood mortality, vaccination coverage and health service utilization vary across states, the cost-effectiveness of introducing Hib vaccine was studied in Haryana state. METHODOLOGY: A mathematical model was used to compare scenarios with and without Hib vaccination to estimate the cost-effectiveness of Hib vaccine in Haryana from 2010 to 2024. Demographic and National Family Health Surveys were used to estimate vaccination coverage and mortality rates among children under 5. Hib pneumonia, Hib meningitis and invasive Hib disease incidence were based on Indian studies. Vaccine and syringe prices of the UNICEF supply division were used. Cost-effectiveness from government and societal perspectives was calculated as the net incremental cost per unit of health benefit gained [disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, life years saved, Hib cases averted, Hib deaths averted]. Sensitivity analysis was done using variation in parameter estimates among different states of India. FINDINGS: The incremental cost of Hib vaccine introduction from a government and a societal perspective was estimated to be US$81.4 and US$27.5 million, respectively, from 2010 to 2024. Vaccination of 73.3, 71.6 and 67.4 million children with first, second and third dose of pentavalent vaccine, respectively, would avert 7 067 817 cases, 31 331 deaths and 994 564 DALYs. Incremental cost per DALY averted from a government (US$819) and a societal perspective (US$277) was found to be less than the per capita gross national income of India in 2009.

Country decision makers must consider whether to further expand ART eligibility accordingly.

Analyses considered extending eligibilityto include individuals with CD4 </=500 cells/microL or all HIV-positive adults,compared to the previous recommendation of initiation with CD4 </=350cells/microL. We assessed costs from a health system perspective, and calculated the incremental cost per DALY averted ($/DALY) to compare competing strategies.Strategies were considered 'very cost-effective' if the $/DALY was less than the country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP; South Africa: $8040, Zambia:$1425, India: $1489, Vietnam: $1407) and 'cost-effective' if $/DALY was less thanthree times per capita GDP. FINDINGS: In South Africa, the cost per DALY averted of extending ART eligibility to CD4 </=500 cells/microL ranged from $237 to$1691/DALY compared to 2010 guidelines; in Zambia, expanded eligibility rangedfrom improving health outcomes while reducing costs (i.e. dominating currentguidelines) to $749/DALY.

METHODS: We used multiple independent mathematicalmodels in four settings-South Africa, Zambia, India, and Vietnam-to evaluate the potential health impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of different adult ARTeligibility criteria under scenarios of current and expanded treatment coverage, with results projected over 20 years. Analyses considered extending eligibilityto include individuals with CD4 </=500 cells/microL or all HIV-positive adults,compared to the previous recommendation of initiation with CD4 </=350cells/microL. We assessed costs from a health system perspective, and calculated the incremental cost per DALY averted ($/DALY) to compare competing strategies.Strategies were considered 'very cost-effective' if the $/DALY was less than the country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP; South Africa: $8040, Zambia:$1425, India: $1489, Vietnam: $1407) and 'cost-effective' if $/DALY was less thanthree times per capita GDP. FINDINGS: In South Africa, the cost per DALY averted of extending ART eligibility to CD4 </=500 cells/microL ranged from $237 to$1691/DALY compared to 2010 guidelines; in Zambia, expanded eligibility rangedfrom improving health outcomes while reducing costs (i.e. dominating currentguidelines) to $749/DALY. Results were similar in scenarios with substantiallyexpanded treatment access and for expanding eligibility to all HIV-positiveadults. Expanding treatment coverage in the general population was thereforefound to be cost-effective. In India, eligibility for all HIV-positive personsranged from $131 to $241/DALY and in Vietnam eligibility for CD4 </=500cells/microL cost $290/DALY. In concentrated epidemics, expanded access among keypopulations was also cost-effective. INTERPRETATION: Earlier ART eligibility isestimated to be very cost-effective in low- and middle-income settings, although these questions should be revisited as further information becomes available.Scaling-up ART should be considered among other high-priority healthinterventions competing for health budgets.

We assessed costs from a health system perspective, and calculated the incremental cost per DALY averted ($/DALY) to compare competing strategies.Strategies were considered 'very cost-effective' if the $/DALY was less than the country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP; South Africa: $8040, Zambia:$1425, India: $1489, Vietnam: $1407) and 'cost-effective' if $/DALY was less thanthree times per capita GDP. FINDINGS: In South Africa, the cost per DALY averted of extending ART eligibility to CD4 </=500 cells/microL ranged from $237 to$1691/DALY compared to 2010 guidelines; in Zambia, expanded eligibility rangedfrom improving health outcomes while reducing costs (i.e. dominating currentguidelines) to $749/DALY. Results were similar in scenarios with substantiallyexpanded treatment access and for expanding eligibility to all HIV-positiveadults. Expanding treatment coverage in the general population was thereforefound to be cost-effective. In India, eligibility for all HIV-positive personsranged from $131 to $241/DALY and in Vietnam eligibility for CD4 </=500cells/microL cost $290/DALY. In concentrated epidemics, expanded access among keypopulations was also cost-effective. INTERPRETATION: Earlier ART eligibility isestimated to be very cost-effective in low- and middle-income settings, although these questions should be revisited as further information becomes available.Scaling-up ART should be considered among other high-priority healthinterventions competing for health budgets.

METHODS: We used multiple independent mathematicalmodels in four settings-South Africa, Zambia, India, and Vietnam-to evaluate the potential health impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of different adult ARTeligibility criteria under scenarios of current and expanded treatment coverage, with results projected over 20 years. Analyses considered extending eligibilityto include individuals with CD4 </=500 cells/microL or all HIV-positive adults,compared to the previous recommendation of initiation with CD4 </=350cells/microL. We assessed costs from a health system perspective, and calculated the incremental cost per DALY averted ($/DALY) to compare competing strategies.Strategies were considered 'very cost-effective' if the $/DALY was less than the country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP; South Africa: $8040, Zambia:$1425, India: $1489, Vietnam: $1407) and 'cost-effective' if $/DALY was less thanthree times per capita GDP. FINDINGS: In South Africa, the cost per DALY averted of extending ART eligibility to CD4 </=500 cells/microL ranged from $237 to$1691/DALY compared to 2010 guidelines; in Zambia, expanded eligibility rangedfrom improving health outcomes while reducing costs (i.e. dominating currentguidelines) to $749/DALY. Results were similar in scenarios with substantiallyexpanded treatment access and for expanding eligibility to all HIV-positiveadults. Expanding treatment coverage in the general population was thereforefound to be cost-effective. In India, eligibility for all HIV-positive personsranged from $131 to $241/DALY and in Vietnam eligibility for CD4 </=500cells/microL cost $290/DALY. In concentrated epidemics, expanded access among keypopulations was also cost-effective. INTERPRETATION: Earlier ART eligibility isestimated to be very cost-effective in low- and middle-income settings, although these questions should be revisited as further information becomes available.Scaling-up ART should be considered among other high-priority healthinterventions competing for health budgets.

29000,Cost-effectiveness analysis of infant feeding strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in South Africa,"Despite increasing availability of perinatal interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in South Africa, MTCT remains high due to breastfeeding. To inform policy decisions in the country, cost-effectiveness of alternative infant-feeding interventions was conducted. Mathematical modelling was used to simulate post-natal transmission and mortality due to infant feeding in a hypothetical cohort of 1 000 HIV-exposed infants. Lifetime costs to the health system were calculated for each strategy. Interventions compared with current practice were: increasing coverage of extended nevirapine prophylaxis (ENP) to infants from 30% (base case) to 60% without changing current feeding practices; actively supporting breastfeeding with ENP to infants for 12 months; and actively supporting exclusive formula (replacement) feeding for 6 months. HIV-free survival at 24 months and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were estimated for typical rural and certain urban settings. Base-case analysis revealed that expanding coverage of nevirapine prophylaxis with breastfeeding is cost-saving and improves HIV-free survival. Changing feeding practices is beneficial, depending on context. Breastfeeding is dominant (less costly, more effective) in rural settings, whilst formula feeding is a dominant strategy in urban settings. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to proportion of women on lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) and infant mortality rate (IMR). When >55% of women are on ART, breastfeeding dominates in the urban settings modelled, whilst formula feeding is cost-effective in rural settings when IMR </= 45/1000. The study concludes that strategies to support breastfeeding are essential. Strengthening health systems is critical to ensure optimal nevirapine delivery during breastfeeding.
