24501,Effect and cost-effectiveness of national gastric cancer screening in Japan: a microsimulation modeling study,"BACKGROUND: A national endoscopic screening program for gastric cancer was rolled out in Japan in 2015. We used a microsimulation model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of current screening guidelines and alternative screening strategies in Japan. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model that simulated a virtual population corresponding to the Japanese population in risk factor profile and life expectancy. We evaluated 15 endoscopic screening scenarios with various starting ages, stopping ages, and screening intervals. The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Cost-effective screening strategies were determined using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to explore model uncertainty. RESULTS: Using the threshold of $50,000 per QALY, a triennial screening program for individuals aged 50 to 75?years was the cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45,665. Compared with no endoscopic screening, this strategy is predicted to prevent 63% of gastric cancer mortality and confer 27.2 QALYs gained per 1000 individuals over a lifetime period. Current screening guidelines were not on the cost-effectiveness efficient frontier. The results were robust on one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study suggests that the endoscopic screening program in Japan would be cost-effective when implemented between age 50 and 75?years, with the screening repeated every 3 years. These findings underscore the need for further evaluation of the current gastric cancer screening recommendations.",2020-01-34396,32921305,BMC Med,Hsi-Lan Huang,2020,18 / 1,257,No,32921305,"Hsi-Lan Huang; Chi Yan Leung; Eiko Saito; Kota Katanoda; Chin Hur; Chung Yin Kong; Shuhei Nomura; Kenji Shibuya; Effect and cost-effectiveness of national gastric cancer screening in Japan: a microsimulation modeling study, BMC Med, 2020 Jan 14; 18(1):1741-7015; 257",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Screening,triennial endoscopic screening vs. triennial endoscopic screening from age 50-80,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,258571.43,United States,2015,282347.38

24514,Effect and cost-effectiveness of national gastric cancer screening in Japan: a microsimulation modeling study,"BACKGROUND: A national endoscopic screening program for gastric cancer was rolled out in Japan in 2015. We used a microsimulation model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of current screening guidelines and alternative screening strategies in Japan. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model that simulated a virtual population corresponding to the Japanese population in risk factor profile and life expectancy. We evaluated 15 endoscopic screening scenarios with various starting ages, stopping ages, and screening intervals. The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Cost-effective screening strategies were determined using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to explore model uncertainty. RESULTS: Using the threshold of $50,000 per QALY, a triennial screening program for individuals aged 50 to 75?years was the cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45,665. Compared with no endoscopic screening, this strategy is predicted to prevent 63% of gastric cancer mortality and confer 27.2 QALYs gained per 1000 individuals over a lifetime period. Current screening guidelines were not on the cost-effectiveness efficient frontier. The results were robust on one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

24515,Cost-utility analysis of pralatrexate for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma based on a case-matched historical control study along with single arm clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (R/R PTCL) treated with pralatrexate have previously shown superior overall survival (OS) compared to those who underwent conventional chemotherapy (CC, 15.4 vs. 4.07?months). We conducted an economic evaluation of pralatrexate from a societal perspective in Korea based on data from the PROPEL phase II study. METHODS: Using a Markov model with a weekly cycle, we simulated the experience of patients with R/R PTCL receiving pralatrexate or CC for 15?years. The model consists of five health states; initial treatment, treatment pause, subsequent treatment, stem cell transplantation (SCT) success, and death. Comparative effectiveness was based on PROPEL phase II single-arm study and its matched historical control analysis. Costs included drug, drug administration, monitoring, adverse event management, and SCT costs. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the base case was $39,153 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The results of one-way sensitivity analysis ranged from $33,949 to $51,846 per QALY gained, which remained within an implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of anticancer drugs in Korea. CONCLUSIONS: Pralatrexate is a cost-effective intervention with improved OS and incremental costs within the WTP limit.

24516,Cost-effectiveness analysis of initial nonoperative management versus emergency laparoscopic appendectomy for acute complicated appendicitis,"BACKGROUND: The evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of nonoperative management is growing. However, the best treatment strategy for acute complicated appendicitis remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies for complicated appendicitis patients. This study sought to determine the most cost-effective strategy from the health care-payer''s perspective. METHODS: The primary outcome was an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) using nonoperative management with or without interval laparoscopic appendectomy (ILA) as the intervention compared with operative management with emergency laparoscopic appendectomy (ELA) alone as the control. Model variables were abstracted from a literature review, and from data obtained from the hospital records of Tochigi Medical Center. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using an ICER. We constructed a Markov model to compare treatment strategies for complicated appendicitis in otherwise-healthy adults, over a time horizon of a single year. Uncertainty surrounding model parameters was assessed via one-way- and probabilistic-sensitivity analyses. Threshold analysis was performed using the willingness-to-pay threshold set at the World Health Organization''s criterion of $107,690. RESULTS: Three meta-analysis were included in our analysis. Operative management cost $6075 per patient. Nonoperative management with interval laparoscopic appendectomy (ILA) cost $984 more than operative management and produced only 0.005 more QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $182,587. Nonoperative management without ILA cost $235 more than operative management, and also yielded only 0.005 additional QALYs resulting in an ICER of $45,123 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 1000 draws resulted in average ICER of $172,992 in nonoperative management with ILA and $462,843 in Nonoperative management without ILA. The threshold analysis demonstrated that regardless of willingness-to-pay, nonoperative management without ILA would not be most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative management with ILA and Nonoperative management without ILA were not cost-effective strategies compared with operative management to treat complicated appendicitis.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness modelling over a life-time period, taking a UK National Health Service (NHS) and personal social service perspective. SETTING: Based on the Big CACTUS randomised controlled trial, conducted in 21 UK NHS speech and language therapy departments. PARTICIPANTS: Big CACTUS included 278 people with long-standing aphasia post-stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Computerised word finding therapy plus usual care; usual care alone; usual care plus attention control. MAIN MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated, comparing the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained for each intervention. Credible intervals (CrI) for costs and QALYs, and probabilities of cost-effectiveness, were obtained using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Subgroup and scenario analyses investigated cost-effectiveness in different subsets of the population, and the sensitivity of results to key model inputs.

24520,Cost-effectiveness of introducing cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the management of complex phalangeal fractures: economic simulation,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the management of the complex finger fractures with articular involvement. METHODS: We created a decision tree model simulating the diagnostic pathway of complex finger fractures, suggesting the use of CBCT as alternative to multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT), and we compared their clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients. Measures of effectiveness are analysed by using quality-adjusted life years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net monetary benefit. RESULTS: Diagnosis of a complex finger fracture performed with CBCT costed 67.33€ per patient, yielded 9.08 quality-adjusted life years, and gained an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 29.94€ and a net monetary benefit of 9.07 € at 30,000€ threshold. Using MSCT for diagnosis costed 106.23 €, yielded 8.18 quality-adjusted life years, and gained an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 371.15 € and a net monetary benefit of 8.09 €.

24522,What is the Cost-Effective Treatment for Melanoma Patients with a Positive Sentinel Node?,"BACKGROUND: Survival for positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) patients does not differ between completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and nodal observation (OBS). However, treating these patients with CLND and checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab (PEM), improves outcomes. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OBS, CLND, and CLND with PEM (CLND-PEM) treatments. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate treatment for a theoretical cohort of 1000 positive SLN patients per therapy with a 5-year follow-up period. An intervention was cost-effective if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio among therapies was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Compared with CLND or CLND-PEM, OBS resulted in fewer lymphedema cases but in more disease recurrences. Compared with OBS, CLND had higher costs and lower QALYs. Although CLND-PEM had a lower number of recurrences and deaths than OBS or CLND, it had higher costs and lower QALYs than OBS, and thus was not cost-effective. However, with the effects of CLND from CLND-PEM removed, allowing evaluation of PEM effects alone (PEM alone), the resulting QALYs were the highest, but PEM alone still was not cost-effective compared with OBS ($1.2 million per QALY). By reducing the drug cost to less than $14,404 per patient, PEM alone would become cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CLND, CLND-PEM, and PEM alone, OBS was cost-effective for managing positive SLN patients.

Separate analyses were conducted for an intermediate- and poor-risk patient population (base case) and a favorable-risk population (exploratory analysis) because prognosis is known to differ between risk groups; 100?000 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma were simulated in each treatment arm. Survival, treatment regimens, and other relevant conditions were based on data from the phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 and CheckMate214 clinical trials. The study perspective was the US health care sector. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for each of the 2 analyses and compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Pembrolizumab-axitinib was estimated to add 0.60 QALYs compared with nivolumab-ipilimumab in the base case analysis (3.66 vs 3.05 QALYs) and 0.25 QALYs compared with nivolumab-ipilimumab in the exploratory analysis (4.55 vs 4.30 QALYs), and was more costly (base case analysis: $562?927 vs $458?961; exploratory analysis: $589?035 vs $470?403). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $172?532 per QALY in the base case analysis and $468?682 per QALY in the exploratory analysis. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that the base case model was most sensitive to first-line drug prices (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at upper limit of nivolumab price and lower limits of axitinib and pembrolizumab prices: $89?983, $102?287, and $114?943 per QALY, respectively). The exploratory analysis model was most sensitive to overall survival rates (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at lower limit of pembrolizumab-axitinib rate and upper limit of nivolumab-ipilimumab rate: $278?644 and $285?684 per QALY, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that pembrolizumab-axitinib treatment is associated with greater QALYs compared with nivolumab/ipilimumab treatment in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma but may not be cost-effective. Price reductions may make the cost of pembrolizumab-axitinib proportional to its clinical value and less financially burdensome to the US health care system.",2020-01-34419,33052401,JAMA Netw Open,Tina R Watson,2020,3 / 10,e2016144,No,33052401,"Tina R Watson; Xin Gao; Kerry L Reynolds; Chung Yin Kong; Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab Plus Axitinib Vs Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab as First-Line Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma in the US, JAMA Netw Open, 2020 Oct 1; 3(10):2574-3805; e2016144",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,pembrolizumab axitinib vs. Standard/Usual Care- nivolumab-ipilimumab for four 3-week cycles --> nivolumab monotherapy,intermediate risk and poor risk,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,Not Stated,172532,United States,2020,172532
24526,Cost-Effectiveness of Routine Screening for Autoimmune Encephalitis in Patients With First-Episode Psychosis in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a highly treatable neurologic condition that can cause psychosis. Screening for AE is not currently recommended in routine workup for first-episode psychosis (FEP), owing partly to the high cost of testing for AE-associated neuronal autoantibodies. METHODS: This study used a decision-analytic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of routine serum screening for AE compared with clinically targeted screening in patients with FEP. Model parameters drawn from prior published literature included the prevalence of neuronal autoantibodies in FEP (4.5%), serum autoantibody panel cost (US $291), remission probability with antipsychotics (0.58), and remission probability with immunotherapy for patients diagnosed with AE (0.85). Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), assessed over a 5-year horizon from the US health care sector and societal perspectives. ICER thresholds of $50,000/QALY to $150,000/QALY were used to define cost-effectiveness. The analysis was conducted between June 2018 and January 2020. RESULTS: Routine screening led to mean QALY gains of 0.008 among all patients and 0.174 among the subgroup of patients with neuronal autoantibodies. Mean costs increased by $780 from a societal perspective and $1,150 from a health care sector perspective, resulting in ICERs of $99,330/QALY and $147,460/QALY, respectively. Incorporating joint input data uncertainty, the likelihood routine screening has an ICER = $150,000/QALY was 55% from a societal perspective and 37% from a health care sector perspective. The model parameter with the greatest contribution to overall uncertainty was the effectiveness of immunotherapy relative to antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: Routine screening for AE in patients with FEP may be cost-effective in the United States.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model was developed from projections of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) to estimate accrued quality-adjusted survival and costs over a 30-year time horizon. The analysis included nivo?+?ipi, nivolumab, and ipilimumab monotherapies (the three treatments included in CheckMate 067). Drug acquisition, administration, disease management, subsequent therapy, and adverse event (AE) costs were obtained via published sources and expert input (solicited via Delphi panel). AE frequencies were collected from the Checkmate 067 trial. Utility weights were estimated from the Checkmate 067 trial, based on Japanese tariffs. Results were presented as incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs, cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)). RESULTS: Nivo?+?ipi had the greatest estimated survival among the three competing treatments, followed by nivolumab monotherapy accruing the second greatest survival. The incremental cost-effectiveness of nivo?+?ipi was ¥778,000 per QALY vs. nivolumab and ¥1,584,000 per QALY vs. ipilimumab. The results indicate that nivo?+?ipi is cost-effective in Japan when compared to a threshold of ¥7,500,000 per QALY.

24531,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients from a US payer perspective,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of letermovir versus no prophylaxis for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection and disease in adult cytomegalovirus-seropositive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) recipients. A decision model for 100 patients was developed to estimate the probabilities of cytomegalovirus infection, cytomegalovirus disease, various other complications, and death in patients receiving letermovir versus no prophylaxis. The probabilities of clinical outcomes were based on the pivotal phase 3 trial of letermovir use for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis versus placebo in adult cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients of an allo-HCT. Costs of prophylaxis with letermovir and of each clinical outcome were derived from published sources or the trial clinical study reports. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were used in the model. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainty around the base-case analysis. In this model, the use of letermovir prophylaxis would lead to an increase of QALYs (619) and direct medical cost ($1??733??794) compared with no prophylaxis (578 QALYs; $710??300) in cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients of an allo-HCT. Letermovir use for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis was a cost-effective option versus no prophylaxis with base-case analysis ICER $25?046/QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the most influential parameter was mortality rate. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a 92% probability of letermovir producing an ICER below the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000/QALY gained.

24532,Evaluating the Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Once-Daily Liraglutide for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that has demonstrated significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight than the GLP-1 RA once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg in the SUSTAIN 10 trial. The present analysis aimed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg from a UK healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: Long-term outcomes were projected using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.0), with baseline characteristics and treatment effects sourced from SUSTAIN 10. Patients were assumed to initiate treatment with GLP-1 RAs and continue treatment until HbA1c exceeded 7.5%, at which point GLP-1 RAs were discontinued and basal insulin was initiated. Pharmacy costs and costs of complications were measured in 2018 pounds sterling (GBP), with future costs and outcomes discounted at 3.5% per annum. Utilities were taken from published sources. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with an increase in discounted life expectancy of 0.21 years and discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.30 quality-adjusted life-years, compared with once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg. Clinical benefits were achieved at reduced costs, with lifetime cost savings of GBP 140 per patient with semaglutide versus liraglutide, owing to a reduction in diabetes-related complications, in particular cardiovascular disease (mean cost saving of GBP 279 per patient). Therefore, once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was dominant compared with once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg. The results of the sensitivity analyses were similar, demonstrating the robustness of the base-case analysis.

24533,Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound as Diagnostic Options for Unclear Cystic Renal Lesions: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"PURPOSE: Correct differentiation between malignant and benign incidentally found cystic renal lesions has critical implications for patient management. In several studies contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) showed higher sensitivity with respect to the accurate characterization of these lesions compared to MRI, but the cost-effectiveness of CEUS has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CEUS as an alternative imaging method to MRI for the characterization of incidentally found cystic renal lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model including the diagnostic modalities MRI and CEUS was created based on Markov simulations estimating lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The recent literature was reviewed to obtain model input parameters. The deterministic sensitivity of diagnostic parameters and costs was determined and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo Modelling was applied. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) was assumed to be $ 100?000/QALY. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the total costs for CEUS were $9654.43, whereas the total costs for MRI were $9675.03. CEUS resulted in an expected effectiveness of 8.06 QALYs versus 8.06 QALYs for MRI. Therefore, from an economic point of view, CEUS was identified as an adequate diagnostic alternative to MRI. Sensitivity analysis showed that results may vary if CEUS costs increase or those of MRI decrease. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the analysis, the use of CEUS was identified as a cost-effective diagnostic strategy for the characterization of incidentally found cystic renal lesions.",2020-01-34446,32052386,Ultraschall Med,Felix Gassert,2020,/,,No,32052386,"Felix Gassert; Moritz Schnitzer; Su Hwan Kim; Wolfgang G Kunz; Benjamin Philipp Ernst; Dirk-André Clevert; Dominik Nörenberg; Johannes Rübenthaler; Matthias Frank Froelich; Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound as Diagnostic Options for Unclear Cystic Renal Lesions: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Ultraschall Med, 2020 Feb 12; ():1438-8782",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Diagnostic,contrast-enhanced ultrasound for cystic renal lesions vs. Standard/Usual Care- MRI for cystic renal lesions,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2018,Not Stated
24534,Cost-Effectiveness of Initial Versus Delayed Lanreotide for Treatment of Metastatic Enteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,"BACKGROUND: The Controlled Study of Lanreotide Antiproliferative Response in Neuroendocrine Tumors (CLARINET) trial showed prolonged progression-free survival in patients initially treated with lanreotide versus placebo. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of upfront lanreotide versus active surveillance with lanreotide administered after progression in patients with metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), both of which are treatment options recommended in NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors. METHODS: We developed a Markov model calibrated to the CLARINET trial and its extension. We based the active surveillance strategy on the CLARINET placebo arm. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We modeled lanreotide''s cost at $7,638 per 120 mg (average sales price plus 6%), used published utilities (stable disease, 0.77; progressed disease, 0.61), adopted a healthcare sector perspective and lifetime time horizon, and discounted costs and benefits at 3% annually. We examined sensitivity to survival extrapolation and modeled octreotide long-acting release (LAR) ($6,183 per 30 mg). We conducted one-way, multiway, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Upfront lanreotide led to 5.21 QALYs and a cost of $804,600. Active surveillance followed by lanreotide after progression led to 4.84 QALYs and a cost of $590,200, giving an ICER of $578,500/QALY gained. Reducing lanreotide''s price by 95% (to $370) or 85% (to $1,128) per 120 mg would allow upfront lanreotide to reach ICERs of $100,000/QALY or $150,000/QALY. Across a range of survival curve extrapolation scenarios, pricing lanreotide at $370 to $4,000 or $1,130 to $5,600 per 120 mg would reach ICERs of $100,000/QALY or $150,000/QALY, respectively. Our findings were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. The ICER modeling octreotide LAR is $482,700/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: At its current price, lanreotide is not cost-effective as initial therapy for patients with metastatic enteropancreatic NETs and should be reserved for postprogression treatment. To be cost-effective as initial therapy, the price of lanreotide would need to be lowered by 48% to 95% or 27% to 86% to reach ICERs of $100,000/QALY or $150,00/QALY, respectively.",2020-01-34448,32886901,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,James I Barnes,2020,18 / 9,1200-1209,No,32886901,"James I Barnes; John K Lin; Divya Gupta; Douglas K Owens; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Pamela L Kunz; Cost-Effectiveness of Initial Versus Delayed Lanreotide for Treatment of Metastatic Enteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors, J Natl Compr Canc Netw, 2020 Sep; 18(9):1540-1413; 1200-1209",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,initial lanreotide --> standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- active surveillance --> lanreotide given after progression,"advanced, well- or moderately differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin recepotr-positive enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,578500,United States,2020,578500
24535,Cost-effectiveness of adding dapagliflozin to standard treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients in China,"AIMS: This study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients in China from a perspective of health care payers. METHODS AND RESULTS: We built a Markov model to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing standard treatment + dapagliflozin (10 mg, q.d.) with standard treatment for HFrEF. The base case in our simulation was a 65-year-old HFrEF patient and was modelled over 15 years. Inputs of the model were derived from the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure trial and other relevant data from China. Costs, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated for adding dapagliflozin relative to standard treatment. Costs and QALY were discounted at a 4.2% rate annually. All costs are presented in 2017 US dollars. Dapagliflozin would be considered very cost-effective if the ICER was lower than a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $8573.4. Uncertainty was assessed in our model using one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). In our base case, compared with standard treatment, adding dapagliflozin was more expensive ($5829.4 vs. $4377.1) but more effective (4.82 vs. 4.44 QALYs). The respondent ICER was $3827.6 per QALY gained at 15-year follow-up. When the simulated horizon was longer than 3.5 years, the respondent ICER became lower than the WTP threshold. The inputs with the largest impact on ICER were the cost of dapagliflozin, the cardiovascular mortality in both groups, and the cost of hospitalization for heart failure. Most results of sensitivity analysis were robust. PSA showed a similar result as the base case (ICER = $4412.5 per QALY gained). In Monte Carlo simulation, at a WTP threshold of $8573.4 per QALY, dapagliflozin was considered very cost-effective in 53.10% of the simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was a very cost-effective treatment option for HFrEF patients in China according to the result of our model.

24536,Cost-effectiveness of adding dapagliflozin to standard treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients in China,"AIMS: This study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients in China from a perspective of health care payers. METHODS AND RESULTS: We built a Markov model to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing standard treatment + dapagliflozin (10 mg, q.d.) with standard treatment for HFrEF. The base case in our simulation was a 65-year-old HFrEF patient and was modelled over 15 years. Inputs of the model were derived from the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure trial and other relevant data from China. Costs, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated for adding dapagliflozin relative to standard treatment. Costs and QALY were discounted at a 4.2% rate annually. All costs are presented in 2017 US dollars. Dapagliflozin would be considered very cost-effective if the ICER was lower than a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $8573.4.

METHODS: A simulation model was created to model a hypothetical cohort of wrist osteoarthritis patients (mean age, 45 years) presenting with painful wrist and having failed conservative management. Three initial surgical treatment strategies-(1) four-corner fusion, (2) proximal row carpectomy, or (3) total wrist arthroplasty-were compared from a hospital perspective. Outcomes included clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years and cost) over a lifetime. RESULTS: The highest complication rates were seen in the four-corner fusion cohort: 27.1 percent compared to 20.9 percent for total wrist arthroplasty and 17.4 percent for proximal row carpectomy. Secondary surgery was common for all procedures: 87 percent for four-corner fusion, 57 percent for proximal row carpectomy, and 46 percent for total wrist arthroplasty. Proximal row carpectomy generated the highest quality-adjusted life-years (30.5) over the lifetime time horizon, compared to 30.3 quality-adjusted life-years for total wrist arthroplasty and 30.2 quality-adjusted life-years for four-corner fusion. Proximal row carpectomy was the least costly; the mean expected lifetime cost for patients starting with proximal row carpectomy was $6003, compared to $11,033 for total wrist arthroplasty and $13,632 for four-corner fusion.

24539,Cost-Effectiveness of Ribociclib for Hormone Receptor-Positive HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer,"PURPOSE: Ribociclib has provided significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC). However, given the high cost of ribociclib, its value must be evaluated based on cost-effectiveness. Thus, we aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of ribociclib for postmenopausal patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC. METHODS: A comprehensive Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ribociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant as first-line treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative ABC. Variables were estimated based on data from the randomized Phase III MONALEESA-3 trial. Ten-year values were estimated for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Direct treatment costs were estimated from the perspective of a United States payer. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to confirm the model''s robustness. RESULTS: Ribociclib plus fulvestrant increased the treatment cost by $382,172 and provided 0.47 QALYs, relative to fulvestrant alone, which corresponded to an ICER of $813,132 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed that ribociclib was unlikely to be cost-effective even under the most favorable assumptions. When the cost of ribociclib was <$1,384, there was a >50% chance of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY. Subgroup analyses also confirmed that ribociclib was not cost-effective.

24543,An updated cost-effectiveness analysis of pazopanib versus sunitinib as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Italy,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) from an Italian National Health Service perspective, considering the evolving Italian landscape in terms of new reimbursement agreements trend. METHODS: This analysis is an update of the previously published cost-effectiveness analysis to incorporate recent 2019 costs and additional changes regarding drug discounting. A partitioned-survival analysis model with three different health states (progression-free survival, post-progression survival, and dead) was utilized. Outcomes included progression-free life years, post-progression life years, overall life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs calculated for both treatments. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of incremental costs per QALY gained and the net monetary benefit (NMB) of pazopanib versus sunitinib. In the base case analysis, a time horizon of 5?years was used and future costs and QALYs were discounted at a 3% annual discount rate. An impact of methodological and parameter uncertainly on base case results was evaluated using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base case, pazopanib had higher QALYs (+0.060) at lower costs (-€5,857) versus sunitinib, hence it dominated sunitinib. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of €30,000 and €50,000 per QALY, the NMB with pazopanib were €7,647 and €8,841 per patient, respectively, versus sunitinib. The probability that pazopanib is cost-effective versus sunitinib was estimated to be 97.5% at a cost-effectiveness threshold of €20,000, 95.4% at a threshold of €30,000, and 90.2% at a threshold of €50,000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness results were robust to changes in key parameter values and assumptions as demonstrated by deterministic sensitivity analyses.

24544,Economic consequences of migraine in Sweden and implications for the cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) for chronic migraine in Sweden and Norway,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common and incapacitating condition, with severe impact on the quality of life (QoL) of the afflicted and their families, and negative economic consequences through decreased workforce participation, reduced functional ability and elevated healthcare costs. This study aimed to describe the economic consequences of migraine in Sweden using cost of illness survey data and, based on this data, assess the cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) for the treatment of chronic migraine in Sweden and Norway. METHODS: A survey study was conducted in Swedish migraine patients, with questions on patient characteristics, headache frequency and severity, effect on daily activities and work, QoL, health resource utilization, and medication use. Resulting costs were estimated as annual averages over subgroups of average monthly headache days. Some results were used to inform a Markov cost-effectiveness chronic migraine model. The model was adapted to Sweden and Norway using local data. The analysis perspective was semi-societal. Results'' robustness was tested using one-way, structural, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Results from the cost of illness analysis (n?=?454) indicated a clear correlation between decreased QoL and increased costs with increasing monthly headache days. Total annual costs ranged from EUR 6221 in patients with 0-4 headache days per month, to EUR 57,832 in patients with 25-31. Indirect costs made up the majority of costs, ranging from 82% of total costs in the 0-4 headache days group, to 91% in 25-31 headache days. The cost-effectiveness analyses indicated that in Sweden, Botox was associated with 0.223 additional QALYs at an additional cost of EUR 4126 compared to placebo, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR 18,506. In Norway, Botox was associated with 0.216 additional QALYs at an additional cost of EUR 4301 compared to placebo, resulting in an ICER of EUR 19,954. CONCLUSIONS: In people with migraine, an increase in monthly headache days is clearly related to lower QoL and higher costs, indicating considerable potential costs-savings in reducing the number of headache days.

24546,Cost-effectiveness of first-line vs third-line ibrutinib in patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"The ALLIANCE A041202 trial found that continuously administered ibrutinib in the first-line setting significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with a fixed-duration treatment of rituximab and bendamustine in older adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In this study, we created a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of ibrutinib in the first-line setting, compared with a strategy of using ibrutinib in the third-line after failure of time-limited bendamustine and venetoclax-based regimens. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from a US payer perspective. First-line ibrutinib was associated with an improvement of 0.26 QALYs and 0.40 life-years compared with using ibrutinib in the third-line setting. However, using ibrutinib in the first-line led to significantly higher health care costs (incremental cost of $612?700), resulting in an ICER of $2?350?041 per QALY. The monthly cost of ibrutinib would need to be decreased by 72% for first-line ibrutinib therapy to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150?000 per QALY. In a scenario analysis where ibrutinib was used in the second-line in the delayed ibrutinib arm, first-line ibrutinib had an incremental cost of $478?823, an incremental effectiveness of 0.05 QALYs, and an ICER of $9?810?360 per QALY when compared with second-line use. These data suggest that first-line ibrutinib for unselected older adults with CLL is unlikely to be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying ibrutinib for most patients with CLL until later lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit health care costs without compromising clinical outcomes.",2020-01-34478,32518952,Blood,Kishan K Patel,2020,136 / 17,1946-1955,No,32518952,"Kishan K Patel; Iris Isufi; Shalin Kothari; Amy J Davidoff; Cary P Gross; Scott F Huntington; Cost-effectiveness of first-line vs third-line ibrutinib in patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Blood, 2020 Oct 22; 136(17):0006-4971; 1946-1955",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,ibrutinib first-line treatment vs. ibrutinib third-line treatment,untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia,71 Years,71 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2350001,United States,2019,2378992.59
24547,Economic evaluation of supplementing the diet with Souvenaid in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: The LipiDiDiet trial showed that Souvenaid, a medical food, might delay progression to dementia in prodromal Alzheimer''s disease (AD). The objective of this study was to assess the cost-utility of Souvenaid compared to placebo in patients with prodromal AD under the conditions applied in that trial. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed based on the LipiDiDiet trial and a literature review to assess the cost-utility of Souvenaid from a societal perspective considering direct and indirect costs. For both intervention and control groups, patient trajectories in terms of functional decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scale in LipiDiDiet were reproduced statistically with mixed models by assigning time until events to simulated patients. From the societal perspective, four scenarios were analysed by combining different options for treatment duration and diagnostic test cost. Univariate sensitivity analysis assessed parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: Validation results at year 2 of disease progression fit with CDR-SB progression in LipiDiDiet. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) in the baseline case was €22,743/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). All scenarios rendered an ICUR lower than €25,000/QALY (the societal threshold). Moreover, the treatment option was cost-saving and increased health benefits when diagnostic costs were not considered and treatment was only administered during the prodromal stage. CONCLUSIONS: Treating prodromal AD with Souvenaid is a cost-effective intervention in all scenarios analysed. The LipiDiDiet trial showed a modest improvement in disease course but as the social costs of AD are very high, the intervention was efficient. Assessing small benefits at specific stages of AD is relevant because it is reasonable to expect that no effective, safe and affordable disease-modifying therapies will become available in the short to medium term.",2020-01-34482,33308302,Alzheimers Res Ther,Javier Mar,2020,12 / 1,166,No,33308302,"Javier Mar; Ania Gorostiza; Oliver Ibarrondo; Igor Larrañaga; Arantzazu Arrospide; Pablo Martinez-Lage; Myriam Soto-Gordoa; Economic evaluation of supplementing the diet with Souvenaid in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimers Res Ther, 2020 Dec 11; 12(1):1758-9193; 166",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Other,souvenaid vs. Placebo,mild cognitive impairment,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,22743,Euro,2019,25789.38
24548,A Microsimulation Model to Project the 5-Year Impact of Using Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis Patients Hospitalized for Acute Flares,"BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) improves short-term outcomes for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients hospitalized for acute flares. Longer-term impacts and cost-effectiveness are unknown. METHODS: We compared disease outcomes and cost-effectiveness of HBOT in addition to standard of care versus standard of care alone for UC patients hospitalized for acute flares using a microsimulation model. Published literature was used for transition probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates. We modeled 100,000 individuals in each group over a 5-year horizon and compared rates of re-hospitalization, rescue medical therapy, colectomy, death, and cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed with 500 samples and 250 trials, in addition to multiple microsimulation sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The use of HBOT at the time of index hospitalization for an acute UC flare is projected to reduce the risk of re-hospitalization, inpatient rescue medical therapy, and inpatient emergent colectomy by over 60% (p?<?0.001) and mortality by over 30% (p?<0.001), during a 5-year horizon. The HBOT strategy costs more ($5600 incremental cost) but also yielded higher QALYs (0.13 incremental yield), resulting in this strategy being cost-effective ($43,000/QALY). Results were sensitive to HBOT costs and rates of endoscopic improvement with HBOT. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses observed HBOT to be more cost-effective than standard of care in 95% of iterations. CONCLUSION: The use of HBOT to optimize response to steroids during the index hospitalization for an acute UC flare is cost-effective and is projected to result in significant reductions in disease-related complications in the long term.",2020-01-34483,33185788,Dig Dis Sci,Parambir S Dulai,2020,/,,No,33185788,"Parambir S Dulai; Vipul Jairath; A Microsimulation Model to Project the 5-Year Impact of Using Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis Patients Hospitalized for Acute Flares, Dig Dis Sci, 2020 Jun 23; ():0163-2116",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,hyperbaric oxygen therapy in combination with intravenous steroids vs. Standard/Usual Care- intravenous steroids,hospitalized for acute flares,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,43000,United States,2019,43530.48
24549,Cost-Effectiveness of Earlier Transition to Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitor in Patients With Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) therapy improves clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. However, ARNi therapy uptake remains modest, potentially in part due to perceived cost considerations of early transition from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to assess cost-effectiveness of 3 different ARNi initiation strategies according to timing of initiation: (1) de novo, or immediate initiation at baseline, (2) Early or after 3 months, or (3) Late, or after 9 months. Initiation strategies were compared with (4) current care, with utilization of ARNi derived from a large observational database. Total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated over a 5-year time horizon in the base case analysis. RESULTS: Current care was associated with the lowest total cost (CAD$26,664) and accrued benefit (3.28 QALYs). The de novo strategy yielded an ICER of $34,727 per QALY gained, whereas Early and Late initiation strategies yielded a less favourable ICER per QALY gained of $35,871 and $40,234, respectively. The model was most sensitive to the cost of ARNi therapy.

24552,Long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for fracture risk in a UK primary care setting: the SCOOP study,"Community-based screening and treatment of women aged 70-85 years at high fracture risk reduced fractures; moreover, the screening programme was cost-saving. The results support a case for a screening programme of fracture risk in older women in the UK. INTRODUCTION: The SCOOP (screening for prevention of fractures in older women) randomized controlled trial investigated whether community-based screening could reduce fractures in women aged 70-85 years. The objective of this study was to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for fracture risk in a UK primary care setting compared with usual management, based on the SCOOP study. METHODS: A health economic Markov model was used to predict the life-time consequences in terms of costs and quality of life of the screening programme compared with the control arm. The model was populated with costs related to drugs, administration and screening intervention derived from the SCOOP study. Fracture risk reduction in the screening arm compared with the usual management arm was derived from SCOOP. Modelled fracture risk corresponded to the risk observed in SCOOP. RESULTS: Screening of 1000 patients saved 9 hip fractures and 20 non-hip fractures over the remaining lifetime (mean 14 years) compared with usual management. In total, the screening arm saved costs (£286) and gained 0.015 QALYs/patient in comparison with usual management arm. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that a screening programme of fracture risk in older women in the UK would gain quality of life and life years, and reduce fracture costs to more than offset the cost of running the programme.",2020-01-34489,32239237,Osteoporos Int,E Söreskog,2020,31 / 8,1499-1506,No,32239237,"E Söreskog; F Borgström; L Shepstone; S Clarke; C Cooper; I Harvey; N C Harvey; A Howe; H Johansson; T Marshall; T W O'Neill; T J Peters; N M Redmond; D Turner; R Holland; E McCloskey; J A Kanis; SCOOP Study Team; Long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for fracture risk in a UK primary care setting: the SCOOP study, Osteoporos Int, 2020 Aug; 31(8):0937-941X; 1499-1506",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Screening,frax tool screening vs. None,Not Stated,85 Years,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-19066.67,United Kingdom,2018,-26259.54
24553,Cost-effectiveness analysis of adding ramucirumab to the first-line erlotinib treatment for untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in China,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of ramucirumab plus erlotinib compared with placebo plus erlotinib in the first-line setting for patients with EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. DESIGN: A Markov model consisting of three health states using clinical survival data from the RELAY phase III randomised clinical trial, a lifetime horizon for costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was constructed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of ramucirumab plus erlotinib. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model. Additional price reduction scenario analyses were performed. SETTING: The Chinese healthcare system perspective. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical Chinese cohort of patients with confirmed previously documented ex19del or Leu858Arg mutation stage IV NSCLC, and without known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Thr790Met mutation and central nervous system metastases. INTERVENTIONS: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib versus placebo plus erlotinib. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In base-case analysis, ramucirumab plus erlotinib yield an additional 4.21 QALYs at a cost of $540 590, resulting in an ICER of $128 302/QALY. In price reduction scenario analysis, the ICER ($65 227/QALY) was decreased significantly when the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) negotiation was available for ramucirumab, and the ICER ($131 554/QALY) was increased slightly when the NRDL negotiation was unavailable for erlotinib. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated our results to be most sensitive to the unit cost of ramucirumab (10 mg/kg), and more than 52.1% reduction in the price of ramucirumab resulted in the ICER under the willingness-to-pay threshold set for affluent regions ($70 353/QALY).

24554,Cost-effectiveness of alcohol use treatments in patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcohol use treatment such medication-assisted therapies (MATs) and counseling are available and effective in promoting alcohol abstinence. We sought to explore the cost-effectiveness of different alcohol use treatments among patients with compensated alcohol-related cirrhosis (AC). METHODS: We simulated a cohort of compensated AC patients receiving care from a hepatology clinic over their lifetimes. We estimated costs (in 2017 US$) and benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from healthcare and societal perspectives. Transition probabilities, costs, and health utility weights were taken from the literature. Treatment effects of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MATs (acamprosate and naltrexone) and non-FDA approved MATs (baclofen, gabapentin, and topiramate) and counseling were based on a study of employer-insured AC patients. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: When compared to a do-nothing scenario, MATs and counseling were found to be cost-saving from a healthcare perspective, which means that they provide more benefits with less costs than no intervention. Compared to other interventions, acamprosate and naltrexone cost the least and provide the most QALYs.

24568,Cost-effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin in advanced stage Hodgkin's lymphoma: a probabilistic analysis,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a well-established therapy for advanced Hodgkin''s lymphoma (HL). However, the recently completed ECHELON-1 trial showed potential net clinical benefit for brentuximab vedotin (BREN+AVD) compared to ABVD as frontline therapy in patients with advanced Hodgkin''s lymphoma. The objective of this analysis is to determine whether, on current evidence, BREN+AVD is cost-effective relative to ABVD as frontline therapy in patients with advanced HL. METHODS: We constructed a probabilistic Markov model with two arms and six mutually exclusive health states, using six-month?cycle lengths, and a 15-year time horizon. Time-dependent transition probabilities were calculated from ''real-world'' data collected by the BC Cancer''s Centre for Lymphoid Cancer database or from the literature for ABVD. Time-dependent transition probabilities for BREN+AVD were taken from the ECHELON-1 trial. We estimated the incremental cost and effects per patient of each therapy and calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs were measured in 2018 Canadian dollars and effects measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A probabilistic analysis was used to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). RESULTS: The incremental cost between standard therapy with ABVD and therapy with BREN+AVD was estimated to be $192,336. The regimen of BREN+AVD resulted in a small benefit in terms of QALYs (0.46 QALYs). The estimated ICER was $418,122 per QALY gained. The probabilistic analysis suggests very few (8%) simulations fall below $100,000 per QALY. Even at a threshold of $200,000 per QALY gained, there was only a 24% chance that BREN+AVD would be considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses evaluating price reductions for brentuximab showed that these reductions needed to be in excess of 70% for this regimen to be cost-effective at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: There may be a clinical benefit associated with BREN+AVD, but on current evidence the benefit is not adequately substantive compared to ABVD therapy given the cost of brentuximab vedotin. Agencies responsible for making decisions about BREN+AVD as frontline therapy for patients with advanced HL should consider whether they are willing to implement this treatment given the current uncertainty and cost-benefit profile, or negotiate substantial price-reductions from the manufacturer should they choose to reimburse.",2020-01-34511,33050897,BMC Cancer,A J N Raymakers,2020,20 / 1,992,No,33050897,"A J N Raymakers; S Costa; D Cameron; D A Regier; Cost-effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin in advanced stage Hodgkin's lymphoma: a probabilistic analysis, BMC Cancer, 2020 Jun 26; 20(1):1471-2407; 992",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,brentuximab vedotin + doxorubicin + vinblastine + dacarbazine vs. Standard/Usual Care- six cycles of doxorubicin + bleomycin + vinblastine + dacarbazine,"advanced disease, HIV negative, not pregnant",Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,1.50,1.50,418122,Canada,2018,332607.24
24569,Choice across 10 pharmacologic combination strategies for type 2 diabetes: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend a stepped-escalation treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Across multiple treatment strategies varying in efficacy and costs, no clinical or economic studies directly compared them. This study aims to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, a-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation, the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273 with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117 with strategy 8. Strategy 7 was dominant over seven strategies (strategies 2~6, 9~10) with higher QALYs but lower costs. Additionally, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $30,787/QALY (i.e., 3 times GDP/capita for China), strategy 7 was cost-effective compared with strategy 1 (ICER of strategy 7 vs. 1, $3371/QALY) and strategy 8 (ICER of strategy 8 vs. 7, $132,790/QALY).

This study aims to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, a-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs).

This study aims to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, a-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation, the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273 with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117 with strategy 8.

This study aims to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, a-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs).

Across multiple treatment strategies varying in efficacy and costs, no clinical or economic studies directly compared them. This study aims to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of 10 commonly used pharmacologic combination strategies for T2DM. METHODS: Based on Chinese guideline and practice, 10 three-stepwise add-on strategies were identified, which start with metformin, then switch to metformin plus one oral drug (i.e., sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, a-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, or DPP-4 inhibitor) as second line, and finally switch to metformin plus one injection (i.e., insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist) as third line. A cohort of 10,000 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was established. From a healthcare system perspective, the Cardiff model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies, with clinical data sourced from a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison of 324 trials, costs from claims data of 1164 T2DM patients, and utilities from an EQ-5D study. Outcome measures include costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). RESULTS: Over 40-year simulation, the costs accumulated for a patient ranged from $7661 with strategy 1 to $14,273 with strategy 10, while the QALY gains ranged from 13.965 with strategy 1 to 14.117 with strategy 8.
