7201,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for the prevention of postsurgical venous thromboembolism in Canada,"This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with rivaroxaban vs. enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare system. A model was developed that included both acute VTE (represented as a decision tree) and long-term complications (represented as a Markov process with one-year cycles). Transition probabilities were derived from phase III clinical trials comparing rivaroxaban with enoxaparin and published literature. Costs were derived from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative and publicly available sources. Utilities were derived from published literature. The model reported VTE event rates, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs over a five-year horizon. Costs are reported in 2007 Canadian Dollars (C$). When rivaroxaban and enoxaparin are compared in patients undergoing THR, rivaroxaban dominates enoxaparin. That is, rivaroxaban is associated with improved health outcomes as measured by increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.0006) and fewer symptomatic VTE events (0.0061), and also with lower cost (savings of C$300) per patient. Similarly, rivaroxaban dominates enoxaparin in patients undergoing TKR, achieving a gain of 0.0018 QALYs, a reduction of 0.0192 symptomatic venous thromboembolic events and savings of C$129 per patient. Rivaroxaban is a cost-effective alternative to enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing THR and TKR. Over a five-year horizon, rivaroxaban dominated enoxaparin in the prevention of VTE events in patients undergoing THR and TKR, providing more quality-of-life benefit at a lower cost.",2010-01-06724,20806107,Thromb Haemost,Alexander Diamantopoulos,2010,104 / 4,760-70,No,20806107,"Alexander Diamantopoulos; Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for the prevention of postsurgical venous thromboembolism in Canada, Thromb Haemost, 2010-Oct-01; 104(4):0340-6245; 760-70",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily as prophylactic) vs. Enoxaparin (40mg od),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,-71650,Canada,2007,-83707.59
7203,Cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events according to Framingham Risk Score in patients with elevated C-reactive protein,"CONTEXT: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved rosuvastatin calcium for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients who have elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) but not overt hyperlipidemia. The FDA's decision was based primarily on research reported by the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) Study Group. The cost-effectiveness of such treatment is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment with rosuvastatin vs standard management, according to Framingham Risk Score (FRS), for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients who have hs-CRP levels of 2.0 mg/L or higher and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of less than 130 mg/dL. METHODS: A Markov-type model was used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of rosuvastatin (20 mg daily) vs standard management for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients over a 10-year period. Cost data were obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Red Book drug reference. Health utility measures were obtained from the literature. Cardiovascular event data were obtained directly from the JUPITER Study Group. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Treating patients with rosuvastatin to prevent cardiovascular events based on a hs-CRP level greater than 2.0 mg/L and an LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL or lower would result in estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $35,455 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in patients with an FRS greater than 10% and $90,714 per QALY in patients with an FRS less than or equal to 10%. Results of probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that in patients with an FRS greater than 10%, the probability that rosuvastatin is considered cost-effective at $50,000 per QALY is approximately 98%. In patients with an FRS less than or equal to 10%, the probability that rosuvastatin is considered cost-effective at $50,000 per QALY is 0%.

7205,Cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for severely obese adults with diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in severely obese (BMI >or=35 kg/m(2)) adults who have diabetes, using a validated diabetes cost-effectiveness model. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We expanded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-RTI Diabetes Cost-Effectiveness Model to incorporate bariatric surgery. In this simulation model, bariatric surgery may lead to diabetes remission and reductions in other risk factors, which then lead to fewer diabetes complications and increased quality of life (QoL). Surgery is also associated with perioperative mortality and subsequent complications, and patients in remission may relapse to diabetes. We separately estimate the costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass surgery relative to usual diabetes care and of gastric banding surgery relative to usual diabetes care. We examine the cost-effectiveness of each type of surgery for severely obese individuals who are newly diagnosed with diabetes and for severely obese individuals with established diabetes. RESULTS: In all analyses, bariatric surgery increased QALYs and increased costs. Bypass surgery had cost-effectiveness ratios of $7,000/QALY and $12,000/QALY for severely obese patients with newly diagnosed and established diabetes, respectively. Banding surgery had cost-effectiveness ratios of $11,000/QALY and $13,000/QALY for the respective groups. In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness ratios were most affected by assumptions about the direct gain in QoL from BMI loss following surgery.

7209,Cost effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay versus chest X-ray for tuberculosis screening of BCG-vaccinated elderly populations,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in the elderly is higher than that in the general population, and elderly populations are considered a high-risk group. Currently, annual TB screening of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated people aged over 65 years is performed by an annual chest x-ray examination (CXR) in Japan. Interferon-gamma release assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT]) are new alternatives to the tuberculin skin test to diagnose latent TB infection (LTBI) that have no cross-reactivity with the BCG vaccine. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of QFT versus CXR versus no screening in BCG-vaccinated elderly populations. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of QFT, CXR, and no screening. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 1000 immunocompetent 65-year-olds, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. All costs and clinical benefits were discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3%. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, a no-screening strategy resulted in the lowest cost ($US303.51; 14.6475 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) compared with CXR ($US393.22; 14.6477 QALYs) and QFT ($US525.45; 14.6516 QALYs) [year 2008 values]. The sensitivity of QFT, as well as the prevalence of TB and LTBI, influenced the cost effectiveness; when the sensitivity of QFT was higher than 0.89, QFT became more cost effective than providing no screening. As the prevalence of LTBI and TB increased, the QFT strategy became progressively more cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Providing no routine TB screening is currently the most cost-effective strategy for BCG-vaccinated elderly populations in Japan. There appears to be little role for CXR in TB screening of elderly populations.

7212,Economic evaluation of a workplace intervention for sick-listed employees with distress,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness, cost utility and cost benefit of a workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with distress. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. Employees with distress and who were sick-listed for 2-8 weeks were randomised to a workplace intervention (n=73) or to usual care (n=72). The workplace intervention is a stepwise process involving the sick-listed employee and their supervisor, aimed at formulating a consensus-based plan for return to work (RTW). The effect outcomes were lasting RTW and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Healthcare utilisation was measured over 12 months. Cost effectiveness analyses (CEA) and cost utility analyses (CUA) were conducted from the societal perspective and cost benefit analyses (CBA) from the employer perspective. Bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate cost and effect differences, related CIs, and cost effectiveness and cost utility ratios. Cost effectiveness planes were presented and subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: CEA and CUA revealed no statistically significant differences in lasting RTW, QALYs or costs. The CBA indicated a statistically significant higher cost of occupational health services in the workplace intervention group. The workplace intervention was not cost effective according to the CEA, CUA and CBA. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread implementation of the workplace intervention for sick-listed employees with distress is not recommended because there was no economic benefit compared with usual care.

7213,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in children with dilated cardiomyopathy,"BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) improve survival and are cost-effective in adults with poor left ventricular function. Because of differences in heart failure etiology, sudden death rates, and ICD complication rates, these findings may not be applicable to children. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a Markov model to compare typical management of childhood dilated cardiomyopathy with symptomatic heart failure to prophylactic ICD implantation plus typical management. Model costs included costs of outpatient care, medications, complications, and transplantation. Time horizon was up to 20 years from model entry. Total costs were $433,000 (ICD strategy) and $355,000 (typical management). Although quality adjusted survival was greater in the ICD group (6.78 versus 6.43 quality adjusted life-years [QALY]), the incremental cost-utility ratio was $281,622/QALY saved with the ICD strategy. In sensitivity analyses, the ICD strategy cost less than the $100,000/QALY benchmark for cost-effectiveness only when the annual probability of sudden death exceeded 13% or when strong, sustained benefits in quality of life from the ICD were assumed. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic ICD use in children with dilated cardiomyopathy, poor ventricular function, and symptomatic heart failure does not appear to be cost-effective. This is likely due to lower sudden death rates in this population.",2010-01-06738,20797597,J Card Fail,B Feingold,2010,16 / 9,734-41,No,20797597,"B Feingold; Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in children with dilated cardiomyopathy, J Card Fail, 2010-Sep; 16(9):1532-8414; 734-41",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Implantation of a transvenous single lead ICD for primary prevention of sudden arrhythmic death vs. Typical management,Not Stated,15 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,222857.14,United States,2006,286100.59

We estimated the costs and benefits of different BRCA testing criteria for women with breast cancer younger than 50 years. METHODS: We developed a Markov Monte Carlo simulation to compare six criteria for BRCA mutation testing: (1) no testing (reference); (2) medullary breast cancer in patients younger than 50 years; (3) any breast cancer in patients younger than 40 years; (4) triple negative (TN) breast cancer in patients younger than 40 years; (5) TN breast cancer in patients younger than 50 years; (6) any breast cancer in patients younger than 50 years. Net health benefits were life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy, and primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The model estimated the number of new breast and ovarian cancer cases. RESULTS: BRCA mutation testing for all women with breast cancer who were younger than 50 years could prevent the highest number of breast and ovarian cancer cases, but with unfavorable ICERs. Testing women with TN breast cancers who were younger than 50 years was cost-effective with an ICER of $8,027 per year of life gained ($9,084 per quality-adjusted life-year), and could reduce subsequent breast and ovarian cancer risks by 23% and 41%, respectively, compared with the reference strategy.

7221,Delivering the diabetes education and self management for ongoing and newly diagnosed (DESMOND) programme for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the long term clinical and cost effectiveness of the diabetes education and self management for ongoing and newly diagnosed (DESMOND) intervention compared with usual care in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: We undertook a cost-utility analysis that used data from a 12 month, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial and, using the Sheffield type 2 diabetes model, modelled long term outcomes in terms of use of therapies, incidence of complications, mortality, and associated effect on costs and health related quality of life. A further cost-utility analysis was also conducted using current ""real world"" costs of delivering the intervention estimated for a hypothetical primary care trust. SETTING: Primary care trusts in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTION: A six hour structured group education programme delivered in the community by two professional healthcare educators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: On the basis of the data in the trial, the estimated mean incremental lifetime cost per person receiving the DESMOND intervention is pound209 (95% confidence interval - pound704 to pound1137; euro251, -euro844 to euro1363; $326, -$1098 to $1773), the incremental gain in QALYs per person is 0.0392 (-0.0813 to 0.1786), and the mean incremental cost per QALY is pound5387. Using ""real world"" intervention costs, the lifetime incremental cost of the DESMOND intervention is pound82 (- pound831 to pound1010) and the mean incremental cost per QALY gained is pound2092. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the likelihood that the DESMOND programme is cost effective at a threshold of pound20 000 per QALY is 66% using trial based intervention costs and 70% using ""real world"" costs. Results from a one way sensitivity analysis suggest that the DESMOND intervention is cost effective even under more modest assumptions that include the effects of the intervention being lost after one year. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the DESMOND intervention is likely to be cost effective compared with usual care, especially with respect to the real world cost of the intervention to primary care trusts, with reductions in weight and smoking being the main benefits delivered.",2010-01-06749,20729270,BMJ,M Gillett,2010,341 /,c4093,No,20729270,"M Gillett; Delivering the diabetes education and self management for ongoing and newly diagnosed (DESMOND) programme for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: cost effectiveness analysis, BMJ, 2010; 341():0959-8138; c4093",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diabetes education and self management for ongoing and newly diagnosed (DESMOND) vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,80 Years,3.50,3.50,2092,United Kingdom,2008,4663.55
7222,Cost-effectiveness of stockpiling 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to prevent secondary pneumococcal infections among a high-risk population in the United States during an influenza pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Secondary bacterial infections (especially pneumococcal infections) were a major cause of death during prior influenza pandemics. One strategy to prevent pneumococcal infections in adults during a future pandemic is to stockpile 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Stockpiling a pneumococcal vaccine can ensure that it is available when needed most-that is, at the onset of a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to project the health and economic impact of stockpiling PPSV23 to prevent secondary pneumococcal infections among high-risk adults aged 18 to 64 years during an influenza pandemic within the United States. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to evaluate the health and economic effects of stockpiling PPSV23 versus not stockpiling this vaccine for preventing secondary pneumococcal infections among 20 million high-risk US adults aged 18 to 64 years during an influenza pandemic. The model was used to project the number of pneumococcal cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and days of work loss averted. Three health outcomes (deaths, hospitalizations, and outpatient care) were estimated from secondary pneumococcal infections. To assess the overall effectiveness of the different strategies, the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was used as a measure of these 3 health outcomes. The results are presented for 3 scenarios based on the pandemic severity and anticipated prepandemic influenza vaccine availability: base case, more-severe case, and less-severe case. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, vaccinating 20 million high-risk adults with PPSV23 avoided 2858 deaths, 878 hospitalizations, 41,881 pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 232,891 days of work loss during a pandemic. Under the more-severe case scenario, vaccination avoided 21,921 deaths, 10,280 hospitalizations, 70,345 pneumococcal cases, and approximately 1.12 million days of work loss. Under the less-severe case scenario, pneumococcal vaccination avoided 715 deaths, 219 hospitalizations, 10,470 pneumococcal cases, and 58,235 days of work loss. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for stockpiling PPSV23 versus no stockpiling for the base-case and less-severe case scenarios was $39,946 and $198,653 per QALY, respectively. For the more-severe case scenario, stockpiling PPSV23 was cost saving. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses found that the range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values was broad due to the large uncertainty regarding the timing and impact of the next pandemic. In addition, the shelf life of PPSV23 and stockpile management substantially influenced the cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSIONS: For severe pandemics or pandemics in which prepandemic influenza vaccine is unavailable, stockpiling of PPSV23 can be a cost-effective strategy for reducing the health and economic burden associated with secondary pneumococcal infections in a high-risk US population.

Because pertussis is most severe in unimmunized infants and infants who have only received some of the recommended doses, new pertussis immunization strategies should be considered to protect this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 3 new immunization strategies for possible addition to the current Dutch national immunization program: immunization of the infant at birth, immunization of the parents immediately after birth of the child (cocooning), and maternal immunization during the third trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed database for articles published in English, German, and Dutch using the following terms: pertussis, whooping cough, vaccination strategies, maternal immunization, cocooning, at birth, vaccine efficacy, mortality, underreporting, prevalence, incidence, and cost-effectiveness. A decision-tree model was developed for this analysis, and data on pertussis morbidity and costs were collected consistently for different age groups (infants <1 year of age and adults 25 to 34 years of age). The size of the infant cohort was set at 200,000 to approximate previous Dutch birth cohorts. The size of the adult cohort was set at 401,380 parents for the cocooning strategy and 201,380 mothers for the maternal immunization strategy. Health benefits (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and costs were estimated in both cohorts for each of the 3 immunization strate- gies. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated from both a payer's and a societal perspective. The robustness of the results was determined through sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, cocooning and maternal immunization were found to be effective in reducing the incidence of pertussis among infants (123 and 174 infant cases were expected to be prevented, respectively). Furthermore, cocooning and maternal immunization were estimated to be cost-effective from a payer's perspective (euro4600 [US $6400]/QALY and euro3500 [$4900]/QALY, respectively) and even cost-saving from a societal perspective (savings of up to euro7200 [$10,100] and euro5000 [$7000], respectively). Sensitivity analyses revealed that favorable cost-effectiveness was generally robust. In the sensitivity analysis, the cost-effectiveness of cocooning and maternal immunization was mostly sensitive for changes in assumptions on underreporting (200-fold increase in reported number of symptomatic cases) of pertussis disease and infection. With no underreporting, the ICER was estimated at euro211,900 ($296,700)/QALY for cocooning and euro81,600 ($114,200)/QALY for maternal immunization from a payer's perspective. However, even at much lower levels of underreporting (20- to 30-fold increase in incidence), cost-effectiveness remained favorable. The cost-effectiveness of the third strategy, at-birth immunization, was highly unfavorable (euro329,900 [$461,900]/QALY from a payer's perspective and euro330,100 [$462,100]/ QALY from a societal perspective). CONCLUSIONS: This study estimated that the addition of cocooning or maternal immunization to the current Dutch national immunization program likely would be cost-effective or even cost-saving. These estimates were mainly due to reduction in the number of cases among parents, which are likely to be mild and therefore would largely remain unreported. Immunization at birth was not a cost-effective strategy. Cocooning was the most expensive intervention to implement; however, it resulted in the highest number of QALYs gained (mainly in adults).

7231,Renal mass biopsy to guide treatment decisions for small incidental renal tumors: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of using renal mass biopsy to guide treatment decisions for small incidentally detected renal tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate life expectancy and lifetime costs for patients with small (< or = 4-cm) renal tumors. Two strategies were compared: renal mass biopsy to triage patients to surgery or imaging surveillance and empiric nephron-sparing surgery. The model incorporated biopsy performance, the probability of track seeding with malignant cells, the prevalence and growth of benign and malignant tumors, treatment effectiveness and costs, and patient outcomes. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to identify strategy preference under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Effects of changes in key parameters on strategy preference were evaluated in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, the biopsy strategy yielded a minimally greater quality-adjusted life expectancy (4 days) than did empiric surgery at a lower lifetime cost ($3466), dominating surgery from a cost-effectiveness perspective. Over the majority of parameter ranges tested in one-way sensitivity analysis, the biopsy strategy dominated surgery or was cost-effective relative to surgery based on a $75,000-per-QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. In two-way sensitivity analysis, surgery yielded greater life expectancy when the prevalence of malignancy and propensity for biopsy-negative cancers to metastasize were both higher than expected or when the sensitivity and specificity of biopsy were both lower than expected. CONCLUSION: The use of biopsy to guide treatment decisions for small incidentally detected renal tumors is cost-effective and can prevent unnecessary surgery in many cases.",2010-01-06757,20720070,Radiology,Pari V Pandharipande,2010,256 / 3,836-46,No,20720070,"Pari V Pandharipande; Renal mass biopsy to guide treatment decisions for small incidental renal tumors: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Radiology, 2010-Sep; 256(3):0033-8419; 836-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Renal mass biopsy to triage patients to surgery or CT surveillance vs. Direct nephron-sparing surgery without biopsy,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-315090.91,United States,2007,-393306.67

Methods and results We constructed a decision analysis model to compare the cost-effectiveness of routine TEE for detection of left atrial thrombus vs. no TEE. The model incorporated health outcomes and costs. Markov methodology was used to follow patients as they transition through varying health states. We examined a hypothetical cohort of patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation suitable for PVI, and expected outcomes were modelled over a period of 2 years. Simulated patients (SPs) undergoing a strategy of a routine TEE experienced significantly fewer transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) [OR 0.28 (0.22-0.37)], and debilitating strokes [OR 0.23 (0.15-0.33)]. Routine TEE led to an absolute risk reduction for stroke of 1.2% [number needed to treat (NNT) 84 (79-100)] and 1.9% for TIA [NNT 53 (48-59)]. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for TEE was $226 608 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER for TEE among high-risk SPs, with pre-existing clot in the left atrium, was $2232 per QALY.

Simulated patients (SPs) undergoing a strategy of a routine TEE experienced significantly fewer transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) [OR 0.28 (0.22-0.37)], and debilitating strokes [OR 0.23 (0.15-0.33)]. Routine TEE led to an absolute risk reduction for stroke of 1.2% [number needed to treat (NNT) 84 (79-100)] and 1.9% for TIA [NNT 53 (48-59)]. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for TEE was $226 608 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER for TEE among high-risk SPs, with pre-existing clot in the left atrium, was $2232 per QALY. Conclusion Decision analysis and microsimulation suggest that routine use of TEE in an unselected population prior to PVI lowers the incidence of cerebral thrombo-embolic events but with considerable cost per QALY.",2010-01-06759,20716548,Europace,LJ Gula,2010,/,,No,20716548,"LJ Gula; Impact of routine transoesophageal echocardiography on safety, outcomes, and cost of pulmonary vein ablation: inferences drawn from a decision analysis model, Europace, 2010-Aug-23; ():1099-5129",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,2232,Canada,2007,2607.61
7234,Cost-effectiveness of using human papillomavirus 16/18 genotype triage in cervical cancer screening,"OBJECTIVE: Testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 genotypes, which are known to cause approximately 65-70% of invasive cervical cancer cases, may allow clinicians to identify women at highest risk for underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia missed by Pap cytology. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of adding HPV-16 and 18 genotype triage to current cervical cancer screening strategies in the United States. METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the following cervical cancer screening algorithms: (1) liquid-based cytology (LBC), (2) LBC+HPV triage, (3) HPV+LBC triage, (4) co-screening, (5) co-screening+HPV genotyping, and (6) HPV only+HPV genotyping. Costs were estimated from a payer perspective in 2007 U.S. dollars. Outcome measures included lifetime risk of cervical cancer, quality-adjusted life years saved (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: In our model, the use of HPV genotyping strategies prevented 51-73 deaths per 100,000 women screened compared to screening using LBC followed by HPV triage and 4-26 deaths compared to co-screening with LBC and high-risk HPV. Use of HPV genotyping to triage all high-risk HPV-positive women every three years had an ICER of $34,074 per QALY compared to HPV and LBC co-screening. HPV genotyping with co-screening was the most effective strategy and had an ICER of $33,807 per QALY compared to HPV genotyping for all high-risk HPV-positive women.

7245,Impact of vaccinating boys and men against HPV in the United States,"We assessed the public health impact and value of vaccinating boys and men with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the United States. We used mathematical population models, accounting for both the direct and indirect protective effects of vaccination. Inputs for the models were obtained from public data sources, published literature, and analyses of clinical trial data.

7246,Impact of vaccinating boys and men against HPV in the United States,"We assessed the public health impact and value of vaccinating boys and men with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the United States. We used mathematical population models, accounting for both the direct and indirect protective effects of vaccination. Inputs for the models were obtained from public data sources, published literature, and analyses of clinical trial data.

7247,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of efforts to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in southwestern Pennsylvania, 2005-2007","INTRODUCTION: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a community-based, modified Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) designed to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model to compare costs and effectiveness of a modified DPP intervention with usual care during a 3-year period. Input parameters included costs and outcomes from 2 projects that implemented a community-based modified DPP for participants with metabolic syndrome, and from other sources. The model discounted future costs and benefits by 3% annually. RESULTS: At 12 months, usual care reduced relative risk of metabolic syndrome by 12.1%. A modified DPP intervention reduced relative risk by 16.2% and yielded life expectancy gains of 0.01 quality-adjusted life-years (3.67 days) at an incremental cost of $34.50 ($3,420 per quality-adjusted life-year gained). In 1-way sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to probabilities that risk factors would be reduced with or without a modified DPP and that patients would enroll in an intervention, undergo testing, and acquire diabetes with or without an intervention if they were risk-factor-positive. Results were also sensitive to utilities for risk-factor-positive patients. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the intervention cost less than $20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in approximately 78% of model iterations. CONCLUSION: We consider the modified DPP delivered in community and primary care settings a sound investment.",2010-01-06764,20712936,Prev Chronic Dis,K Smith,2010,7 / 5,A109,No,20712936,"K Smith; Cost-effectiveness analysis of efforts to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in southwestern Pennsylvania, 2005-2007, Prev Chronic Dis, 2010-Sep; 7(5):1545-1151; A109",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Community-based intervention: individualized, resource-intensive management and oversight over 12 to 14 weeks vs. Usual care",Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,3420,United States,2000,5140.15
7248,A cost-utility analysis of microwave endometrial ablation versus thermal balloon endometrial ablation,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of microwave endometrial ablation (MEA) and thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBALL) for heavy menstrual bleeding. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis performed alongside a pragmatic RCT in a single hospital within Scotland on women undergoing MEA and TBALL. Resource use data collected from all 314 trial participants were combined with study specific and published unit cost data to estimate a cost per patient. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were based on EQ-5D responses at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months. The incremental cost per QALY of TBALL versus MEA was calculated and bootstrapping was performed to determine the likelihood that a treatment would be cost-effective at different threshold values for society's willingness to pay for a QALY. RESULTS: The mean cost of TBALL (10 years equipment life, 100 uses annually) of reusable equipment was pound181 (95% confidence interval [CI] pound70-434) greater than MEA. There were no statistically significant differences between the total nonhealth costs and health benefits of the two arms. On average, MEA provided more QALYs after adjusting for baseline EQ-5D score (0.017; 95% CI 0.017-0.051). In terms of mean incremental cost per QALY, MEA was, on average, dominant (less costly and at least as effective) and there was over a 90% chance that MEA would be considered cost-effective at a pound20,000 threshold of a cost per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: MEA is likely to be more cost-effective than TBALL at 1 year.

7249,A one-year economic evaluation of six alternative strategies in the management of uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms in Canadian primary care,"Background: The cost-effectiveness of initial strategies in managing Canadian patients with uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms remains controversial. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of six management approaches to uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms in the Canadian setting. Methods: The present study analyzed data from four randomized trials assessing homogeneous and complementary populations of Canadian patients with uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms with comparable outcomes. Symptom-free months, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and direct costs in Canadian dollars of two management approaches based on the Canadian Dyspepsia Working Group (CanDys) Clinical Management Tool, and four additional strategies (two empirical antisecretory agents, and two prompt endoscopy) were examined and compared. Prevalence data, probabilities, utilities and costs were included in a Markov model, while sensitivity analysis used Monte Carlo simulations. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were determined. Results: Empirical omeprazole cost $226 per QALY ($49 per symptom-free month) per patient. CanDys omeprazole and endoscopy approaches were more effective than empirical omeprazole, but more costly. Alternatives using H2-receptor antagonists were less effective than those using a proton pump inhibitor. No significant differences were found for most incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. As willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds rose from $226 to $24,000 per QALY, empirical antisecretory approaches were less likely to be the most cost effective choice, with CanDys omeprazole progressively becoming a more likely option. For WTP values ranging from $24,000 to $70,000 per QALY, the most clinically relevant range, CanDys omeprazole was the most cost-effective strategy (32% to 46% of the time), with prompt endoscopy-proton pump inhibitor favoured at higher WTP values.

7257,Topotecan for relapsed small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Topotecan is a relatively new drug for use as a second-line treatment in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We performed a systematic review and economic evaluation of topotecan, and consider it here in relation to the NICE end of life criteria. METHODS: Seventeen bibliographic databases (including Cochrane library, Medline and Embase) were searched from 1990 to February 2009, and experts and manufacturers were consulted, to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were selected according to prospectively defined criteria. An economic evaluation was undertaken to assess cost effectiveness compared with best supportive care (BSC) in the UK. RESULTS: Five RCTs were included. The clinical evidence indicates a statistically significant benefit of oral topotecan plus BSC compared to BSC alone for overall survival. Intravenous topotecan was similar in efficacy to both oral topotecan and CAV (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine). In the survival model, oral topotecan plus BSC was associated with an average gain in life expectancy of approximately 4months, resulting in a gain of 0.183 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). At an incremental cost of approximately pound6200 the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) is pound33,851 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BSC alone, oral topotecan for patients with relapsed SCLC was associated with improved health outcomes but at increased cost. The ICER is at the upper extreme of the range conventionally regarded as cost effective from an NHS decision making perspective.

7258,Cost-effectiveness of administering oral adsorbent AST-120 to patients with diabetes and advance-stage chronic kidney disease,"AIMS: AST-120, an oral adsorbent currently on-label only in Asian countries with phase III trials ongoing in the US, slows renal disease progression in patients with diabetes and advanced-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using AST-120 to treat patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced-stage CKD. METHODS: We used Markov model simulating the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Data were obtained from randomized trials estimating the progression of diabetic nephropathy with and without AST-120, and published literature. The base population was patients 60 years of age with type 2 diabetes and Stages 3 and 4 CKD. RESULTS: Treating patients with diabetes and advanced-stage CKD was found to be a dominant strategy, and quality of life improved further and more money was saved (0.22 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] and $15,019 per patient) using AST-120 than the control strategy. Sensitivity analysis results were robust with regard to cost, adherence, and quality of life associated with AST-120 therapy, as well as age at diagnosis. The model was relatively sensitive to the effectiveness of AST-120.

7259,Assessing the potential effects and cost-effectiveness of programmatic herpes zoster vaccination of elderly in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a painful disease affecting a considerable part of the elderly. Programmatic HZ vaccination of elderly people may considerably reduce HZ morbidity and its related costs, but the extent of these effects is unknown. In this article, the potential effects and cost-effectiveness of programmatic HZ vaccination of elderly in the Netherlands have been assessed according to a framework that was developed to support evidence-based decision making regarding inclusion of new vaccines in the Dutch National Immunization Program. METHODS: An analytical framework was used combining a checklist, which structured relevant data on the vaccine, pathogen and disease, and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective, using a Markov-cohort-model. Simultaneous vaccination with influenza was assumed. RESULTS: Due to the combination of waning immunity after vaccination and a reduced efficacy of vaccination at high ages, the most optimal cost-effectiveness ratio (21716 euro per QALY) for HZ vaccination in the Netherlands was found for 70-year olds. This estimated ratio is just above the socially accepted threshold in the Netherlands of 20000 euro per QALY. If additional reduction of postherpetic neuralgia was included, the cost-effectiveness ratio improved (approximately 10000 euro per QALY) but uncertainty for this scenario is high. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against HZ at the age of 70 years seems marginally cost-effective in the Netherlands. Due to limited vaccine efficacy a considerable part of the disease burden caused by HZ will remain, even with optimal acceptance of programmatic vaccination.",2010-01-06774,20707884,BMC Health Serv Res,A van Lier,2010,10 /,237,Yes,20707884,"A van Lier; Assessing the potential effects and cost-effectiveness of programmatic herpes zoster vaccination of elderly in the Netherlands, BMC Health Serv Res, 2010; 10():1472-6963; 237",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Programmatic herpes zoster vaccination with ZOSTAVAX vaccine through inclusion of the new vaccine through the Dutch National Immunization Program vs. None,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,21716,Euro,2008,38440.18
7260,Health economic evaluation of a vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and post-herpetic neuralgia in adults in Belgium,"Abstract Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in individuals aged 60 years and older in Belgium. Methods: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with that of a policy of no vaccination. The model estimated the lifetime incidence and consequences of HZ and PHN using inputs derived from Belgian data, literature sources, and expert opinion. Cost-effectiveness was measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results: Vaccination in individuals aged 60 years and older resulted in ICERs of €6,799 (third party payer perspective), €7,168 (healthcare perspective), and €7,137 (societal perspective). The number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case was 12 for HZ, and 35 or 36 for PHN depending on the definition used. Univariate sensitivity analyses produced ICERs of €4,959-19,052/QALY; duration of vaccine efficacy had the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed at least a 94% probability of ICERs remaining below the unofficial €30,000 threshold. Discussion: Key strengths of the model are the combination of efficacy data from a pivotal clinical trial with country-specific epidemiological data and complete sensitivity analysis performed. Main limitations are the use of non country-specific PHN proportion and non Belgian disease-specific utilities. Results are comparable with those recently published.

7262,Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid plus endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with hormone-responsive early breast cancer,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously every 6 months to endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer from a US health care system perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict disease progression, mortality, and costs of breast cancer care for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving up to 3 years of (1) endocrine therapy (goserelin plus tamoxifen or anastrozole); or (2) endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid. Model parameters were obtained from ABCSG-12 (Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial-12) and the literature. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with zoledronic acid was calculated under 2 scenarios: (1) benefits of zoledronic acid persist to maximum (7 years) follow-up in ABCSG-12 (""trial benefits"") or (2) benefits persist until death (""lifetime benefits""). RESULTS: Adding zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy was projected to yield a gain of 0.41 life years (LYs) and 0.43 QALYs assuming trial benefits and 1.34 LYs and 1.41 QALYs assuming lifetime benefits. Assuming trial benefits, the incremental cost per QALY gained with zoledronic acid was $9300. Assuming lifetime benefits, zoledronic acid was estimated to increase QALYs and reduce costs. Cost per QALY gained was <or= $56,000 in all deterministic sensitivity analyses and was <or= $50,000 in 94% and 97% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses for trial and lifetime benefits scenarios, respectively.

7263,Cost effectiveness of escitalopram versus SNRIs in second-step treatment of major depressive disorder in Sweden,"Abstract Objectives: Escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of citalopram and is the most discriminating of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). The aim of the current analysis was to assess the cost effectiveness of escitalopram versus the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) duloxetine and generic venlafaxine as second-step treatment of major depressive disorder. Methods: The analysis was based on a decision analytic model. Effectiveness outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and remission rates; cost outcomes were direct medical costs, including impact of treating adverse events, and indirect costs associated with lost productivity. The analysis was performed from the societal perspective in Sweden over a 6-month timeframe. Results: Estimated remission rates showed an incremental effectiveness in favour of escitalopram of 16.4 percentage points compared with both SNRI comparators. The escitalopram strategy was associated with a 0.025 increase in QALYs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the model is robust and that escitalopram remains a cost-effective option when considering future predicted price reductions of generic venlafaxine. Limitations: The main limitation in this study was the lack of data available for second-step treatment. The remission rates, which are a key input to the model, were obtained from a relatively small sample of patients on second-step treatment and there are no published relapse rates for second-step treatment. The model also assumed that there was no difference in the adverse event (AE) rates between treatments after the first 8 weeks. Conclusions: This cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000, escitalopram is the most cost-effective second-step treatment option for MDD in Sweden in over 85% cases compared with both venlafaxine and with duloxetine.

7265,Cost and health outcome of primary percutaneous coronary intervention versus thrombolysis in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction-Results of the Swedish Early Decision reperfusion Study (SWEDES) trial,"BACKGROUND: In ST-elevation myocardial infarction, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has a superior clinical outcome, but it may increase costs in comparison to thrombolysis. The aim of the study was to compare costs, clinical outcome, and quality-adjusted survival between primary PCI and thrombolysis. METHODS: Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were randomized to primary PCI with adjunctive enoxaparin and abciximab (n = 101), or to enoxaparin followed by reteplase (n = 104). Data on the use of health care resources, work loss, and health-related quality of life were collected during a 1-year period. Cost-effectiveness was determined by comparing costs and quality-adjusted survival. The joint distribution of incremental costs and quality-adjusted survival was analyzed using a nonparametric bootstrap approach. RESULTS: Clinical outcome did not differ significantly between the groups. Compared with the group treated with thrombolysis, the cost of interventions was higher in the PCI-treated group ($4,602 vs $3,807; P = .047), as well as the cost of drugs ($1,309 vs $1,202; P = .001), whereas the cost of hospitalization was lower ($7,344 vs $9,278; P = .025). The cost of investigations, outpatient care, and loss of production did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment arms. Total cost and quality-adjusted survival were $25,315 and 0.759 vs $27,819 and 0.728 (both not significant) for the primary PCI and thrombolysis groups, respectively. Based on the 1-year follow-up, bootstrap analysis revealed that in 80%, 88%, and 89% of the replications, the cost per health outcome gained for PCI will be <$0, $50,000, and $100,000 respectively.

7266,Identifying cost-effective treatment with raloxifene in postmenopausal women using risk algorithms for fractures and invasive breast cancer,"INTRODUCTION: The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends considering treatment in women with a 20% or higher 10-year probability of a major fracture. However, raloxifene reduces both the risk of vertebral fractures and invasive breast cancer so that raloxifene treatment may be clinically appropriate and cost-effective in women who do not meet a 20% threshold risk. The aim of this study was to identify cost-effective scenarios of raloxifene treatment compared to no treatment in younger postmenopausal women at increased risk of invasive breast cancer and fracture risks below 20%. METHOD: A micro-simulation model populated with data specific to American Caucasian women was used to quantify the costs and benefits of 5-year raloxifene treatment. The population evaluated was selected based on 10-year major fracture probability as estimated with FRAX® being below 20% and 5-year invasive breast cancer risk as estimated with the Gail risk model ranging from 1% to 5%. RESULTS: The cost per QALY gained ranged from US $22,000 in women age 55 with 5% invasive breast cancer risk and 15-19.9% fracture probability, to $110,000 in women age 55 with 1% invasive breast cancer risk and 5-9.9% fracture probability. Raloxifene was progressively cost-effective with increasing fracture risk and invasive breast cancer risk for a given age cohort. At lower fracture risk in combination with lower invasive breast cancer risk or when no preventive raloxifene effect on invasive breast cancer was assumed, the cost-effectiveness of raloxifene worsened markedly and was not cost-effective given a willingness-to-pay of US $50,000. At fracture risk of 15-19.9% raloxifene was cost-effective also in women at lower invasive breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene is potentially cost-effective in cohorts of young postmenopausal women, who do not meet the suggested NOF 10-year fracture risk threshold. The cost-effectiveness is contingent on their 5-year invasive breast cancer risk. The result highlights the importance of considering a woman's full risk profile when considering anti-osteoporosis treatment.",2010-01-06791,20691296,Bone,M Ivergård,2010,/,,No,20691296,"M Ivergård; Identifying cost-effective treatment with raloxifene in postmenopausal women using risk algorithms for fractures and invasive breast cancer, Bone, 2010-Aug-03; ():8756-3282",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Raloxifene (for up to 5 years) vs. None,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,22152,United States,2008,26628.43
7267,Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis of solifenacin compared to oxybutynin immediate-release in patients with overactive bladder,"Abstract Objective: To estimate the cost effectiveness of solifenacin 5?mg/day compared to oxybutynin immediate-release (IR) 15?mg/day in patients with overactive bladder, from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare (payer) system. Research design and methods: A Markov model was adapted to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of solifenacin and oxybutynin IR over a 1-year time horizon, based on efficacy and discontinuation data from the Canadian VECTOR (VEsicare in Comparison To Oxybutynin for oveRactive bladder patients) study. In the model, patients who discontinued treatment were offered tolterodine extended release 4?mg/day as second-line. Model robustness was tested using various sensitivity analyses. Utility values were derived from published literature; incontinence pads were included in a secondary analysis. Results: In the base-case analysis, total costs over 1 year were CAN$695 and CAN$550 in the solifenacin and oxybutynin IR groups, respectively. When including incontinence pad costs, there was an incremental saving of CAN$1,831 per patient with solifenacin. Solifenacin was associated with an incremental QALY gain of 0.01 over 1 year. In the base-case analysis without incontinence pads, the incremental cost-utility ratio for solifenacin was CAN$14,092. Probabilistic analyses showed no overlap in the 95% confidence intervals for total costs or QALYs with or without incontinence pads. Solifenacin was cost effective in >90% of cases, based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of CAN$50,000 per additional QALY, irrespective of whether pad costs were included in the model. The most influential variables were the discontinuation rates and the cost of incontinence pads. Limitations of the analysis relate mainly to the fact that data in the VECTOR study were collected using a direct questioning approach, which might have increased the reporting of dry mouth.

7268,Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir compared with neutral protamine hagedorn insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes using a basal-bolus regimen in Sweden,"AIMS: To evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with insulin detemir and neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin in combination with mealtime insulin aspart in patients with type 1 diabetes in Sweden, based on data from a two-year, multi-national, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: Insulin detemir was associated with significant improvements in glycaemic control after 24 months (HbA1c 7.36% versus 7.58%, mean difference -0.22%, p = 0.022) and major hypoglycaemic events (69% risk reduction, p = 0.001) versus NPH. Patients treated with detemir gained less weight (1.7 versus 2.7 kg, P = 0.024). Based on these findings, a published and validated computer model (IMS CORE Diabetes Model) was used to estimate life-expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and both direct medical costs and indirect costs. RESULTS: Basal-bolus therapy with insulin detemir was projected to improve life expectancy by 0.14 years (15.02 +/- 0.19 versus 14.88 +/- 0.18 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.53 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus NPH (8.35 +/- 0.11 versus 7.82 +/- 0.10 QALYs). Improvements in QALYs were driven by avoided or delayed diabetes-related complications and fewer hypoglycaemic events. Direct medical costs over patient lifetimes were SEK 26,144 higher in the insulin detemir arm (SEK 995,025 +/- 19,580 versus 968,881 +/- 19,769), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SEK 49,757 per QALY gained. Capturing indirect costs led to insulin detemir being cost saving over patient lifetimes, by SEK 80,113, compared to NPH (SEK 2,959,909 +/- 64,727 versus 3,040,022 +/- 62,317).

7269,Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in patients with COPD,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term (cost-) effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: A systematic review was performed of randomised controlled trials on smoking cessation interventions in patients with COPD reporting 12-month biochemical validated abstinence rates. The different interventions were grouped into four categories: usual care, minimal counselling, intensive counselling and intensive counselling + pharmacotherapy ('pharmacotherapy'). For each category the average 12-month continuous abstinence rate and intervention costs were estimated. A dynamic population model for COPD was used to project the long-term (cost-) effectiveness (25 years) of 1-year implementation of the interventions for 50% of the patients with COPD who smoked compared with usual care. Uncertainty and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the calculation of the abstinence rates, the type of projection, intervention costs and discount rates. RESULTS: Nine studies were selected. The average 12-month continuous abstinence rates were estimated to be 1.4% for usual care, 2.6% for minimal counselling, 6.0% for intensive counselling and 12.3% for pharmacotherapy.

7270,Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in patients with COPD,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term (cost-) effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: A systematic review was performed of randomised controlled trials on smoking cessation interventions in patients with COPD reporting 12-month biochemical validated abstinence rates. The different interventions were grouped into four categories: usual care, minimal counselling, intensive counselling and intensive counselling + pharmacotherapy ('pharmacotherapy'). For each category the average 12-month continuous abstinence rate and intervention costs were estimated. A dynamic population model for COPD was used to project the long-term (cost-) effectiveness (25 years) of 1-year implementation of the interventions for 50% of the patients with COPD who smoked compared with usual care.

7272,Economic evaluation of dose-response resistance training in older women: a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis,"We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a once-weekly or twice-weekly resistance training intervention compared with balance and tone classes in terms of falls prevented and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Both resistance training interventions were more likely to save health care resource money and offer better health outcomes for falls prevention than balance and tone classes. INTRODUCTION: This study aims to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a once-weekly or twice-weekly resistance training intervention compared with twice-weekly balance and tone classes in terms of falls prevented and QALYs gained. METHODS: Economic evaluation was conducted concurrently with a three-arm randomized controlled trial including 155 community-dwelling women aged 65 to 75 years, Mini Mental State Examination >/=24, and visual acuity 20/40 or better. Participants received the once-weekly resistance training (n = 54), the twice-weekly resistance training (n = 51) or the twice-weekly balance and tone (the comparator) classes (n = 50) for 1 year. Measurements included the number of falls for each participant, healthcare resource utilization, and associated costs over 9 months; health status was assessed using the EQ-5D and SF-6D to calculate QALYs. RESULTS: Based on the point estimates from our base case analysis, we found that both once- and twice-weekly resistance training groups were less costly (p < 0.05) and more effective than twice-weekly balance and tone classes. The incremental QALYs assessed using the SF-6D were 0.003 for both the once- and twice-weekly resistance training groups, compared with the twice-weekly balance and tone classes. The incremental QALYs assessed using the EQ-5D were 0.084 for the once-weekly and 0.179 for the twice-weekly resistance training groups, respectively, compared with the twice-weekly balance and tone classes.

7274,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a rural telemedicine collaborative care intervention for depression,"CONTEXT: Collaborative care interventions for depression in primary care settings are clinically beneficial and cost-effective. Most prior studies were conducted in urban settings. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a rural telemedicine-based collaborative care depression intervention. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of intervention vs usual care. SETTING: Seven small (serving 1000 to 5000 veterans) Veterans Health Administration community-based outpatient clinics serving rural catchment areas in 3 mid-South states. Each site had interactive televideo dedicated to mental health but no psychiatrist or psychologist on site. Patients Among 18 306 primary care patients who were screened, 1260 (6.9%) screened positive for depression; 395 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled from April 2003 to September 2004. Of those enrolled, 360 (91.1%) completed a 6-month follow-up and 335 (84.8%) completed a 12-month follow-up. Intervention A stepped-care model for depression treatment was used by an off-site depression care team to make treatment recommendations via electronic medical record. The team included a nurse depression care manager, clinical pharmacist, and psychiatrist. The depression care manager communicated with patients via telephone and was supported by computerized decision support software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The base case cost analysis included outpatient, pharmacy, and intervention expenditures. The effectiveness outcomes were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey standard gamble conversion formula. RESULTS: The incremental depression-free days outcome was not significant (P = .10); therefore, further cost-effectiveness analyses were not done. The incremental QALY outcome was significant (P = .04) and the mean base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $85 634/QALY. Results adding inpatient costs were $111 999/QALY to $132 175/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In rural settings, a telemedicine-based collaborative care intervention for depression is effective and expensive. The mean base case result was $85 634/QALY, which is greater than cost per QALY ratios reported for other, mostly urban, depression collaborative care interventions.",2010-01-06802,20679589,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Jeffrey M Pyne,2010,67 / 8,812-21,No,20679589,"Jeffrey M Pyne; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a rural telemedicine collaborative care intervention for depression, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 2010-Aug; 67(8):0003-990X; 812-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Telemedicine Enhanced Antidepressant Management (TEAM) vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,85634,United States,2005,113481.93
7275,Cost effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for the prevention of migraine: a markov model application,"BACKGROUND: There are few data about the cost effectiveness of prophylactic medications for migraine. Clinical trials have shown several preventive agents to be useful in reducing the frequency of migraine attack while having tolerable side effects. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of adding preventive treatment to abortive therapy for acute migraine with abortive therapy for acute migraine alone in the primary care setting. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model with a cycle length of 1 day, a time horizon of 365 days and three health states was used to perform an analysis comparing the cost effectiveness and utility of five treatments for migraine prophylaxis (amitriptyline 75 mg/day, topiramate 100 and 200 mg/day, timolol 20 mg/day, divalproex sodium 1000 mg/day or propranolol 160 mg/day) with treatment of acute migraine alone for the management of migraine in the primary care setting. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The expected total annual cost for the use of preventive agents ranged from $US2932 to $US3887, compared with $US3960 for the use of abortive medications only. In the baseline analysis, use of each of the five preventive agents generated more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incurred lower costs compared with abortive medications only. Monte Carlo Simulation suggested that amitriptyline 75 mg/day was most likely to be considered a cost-effective option versus the other five therapies, followed by timolol 20 mg/day, topiramate 200 mg/day, topiramate 100 mg/day, divalproex sodium 1000 mg/day and propranolol 160 mg/day when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for society is <$US18 000 per QALY gained.

7286,Suspected carotid artery stenosis: cost-effectiveness of CT angiography in work-up of patients with recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke,"PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of state-of-the-art noninvasive diagnostic imaging strategies in patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke who are suspected of having carotid artery stenosis (CAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: All prospectively evaluated patients provided informed consent, and the local ethics committee approved this study. Diagnostic performance, treatment, long-term events, quality of life, and costs resulting from strategies employing duplex ultrasonography (US), computed tomographic (CT) angiography, contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, and combinations of these modalities were modeled in a decision tree and Markov model. Data sources included a prospective diagnostic cohort study, a meta-analysis, and a review of the literature. Outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net health benefits (QALY-equivalents), with a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro 50,000 per QALY and a societal perspective. The strategy with the highest net health benefit was considered the most cost effective. Extensive one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of varying parameter values were performed. The reference case analysis assumed that patients underwent surgery 2-4 weeks after the first symptoms, and the effect of earlier intervention was explored. RESULTS: The reference case analysis showed that duplex US combined with CT angiography and surgery for 70%-99% stenoses was the most cost-effective strategy, with a net health benefit of 13.587 and 15.542 QALY-equivalents in men and women, respectively. In men, the CT angiography strategy with a 70%-99% cutoff yielded slightly more QALYs, at an incremental cost of euro 71,419 per QALY, compared with duplex US combined with CT angiography. In patients with a high-risk profile, in patients with a high prior probability of disease, and when patients could be treated within 2 weeks after the first symptoms, the CT angiography strategy with surgery for 50%-99% stenoses was the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSION: In diagnosing CAS, duplex US should be the initial test, and, if its results are positive, CT angiography should be performed; patients with 70%-99% stenoses should then undergo carotid endarterectomy. In patients with a high-risk profile, a high probability of CAS, or who can undergo surgery without delay, immediate CT angiography and surgery for 50%-99% stenoses is indicated.",2010-01-06807,20656842,Radiology,AT Tholen,2010,256 / 2,585-97,No,20656842,"AT Tholen; Suspected carotid artery stenosis: cost-effectiveness of CT angiography in work-up of patients with recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke, Radiology, 2010-Aug; 256(2):0033-8419; 585-97",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,CT (Computerized tomography) angiography vs. Duplex US (Ultra Sound) and CT (Computerized tomography) angiography,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,71419,Euro,2007,122226.85
7287,"Cost-effectiveness of dasatinib versus high-dose imatinib in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), resistant to standard dose imatinib--a Swedish model application","BACKGROUND: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a progressive disease, consisting of three phases, chronic, accelerated and blast phase. Treatment with imatinib has demonstrated high response rates and improved prognosis for patients with CML. The emergence of imatinib resistance is a major concern. Dasatinib is an oral kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL that has been developed for treating CML patients across all phases of disease who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib versus high-dose imatinib treatment in chronic phase CML patients, resistant to lower doses of imatinib (< or =600 mg) in Sweden. METHODS AND DATA: A Markov simulation model was adapted to Swedish treatment practice. The model was populated with efficacy data from clinical trials, resource utilisation by expert opinion, published quality of life data and unit prices from official price lists. A life-long, societal perspective was used and sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The results showed that chronic phase CML patients resistant to standard dose imatinib gain on average 0.67 life-years, or 0.62 quality adjusted life-years, when treated with dasatinib 140 mg/day compared with high-dose imatinib 800 mg/day. The incremental societal cost amounts to EUR 4 250 during the lifetime period, or EUR6880 per QALY gained.

METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of treatments for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was conducted using a Markov model, in which patients' yearly transitions between different health states were tracked. Patients were tracked as they moved between the following health states: CHB, HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg-positive CHB patients can have this special health state), virologic resistance, virologic response, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death. The transition parameters were derived either from systematic reviews of the literature or from previous economic studies. Cost and utility data came from studies based on a Chinese CHB cohort. One-way sensitivity analyses as well as second-order Monte Carlo and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The entecavir strategy yielded the most quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients when compared with the ""no treatment,"" the lamivudine, the adefovir, and the telbivudine strategies. The risks of complications and mortality also decreased. In the economic analysis, the ""no treatment"" strategy was the least effective, whereas the entecavir strategy was both the least expensive and the most cost-effective option, followed by telbivudine and lamivudine.

7296,The cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies against HBV in Italy,"INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, guidelines for the management of HBV infection in Italy, recommend using vaccines but the screening test among non-vaccinated people is useful to detect people that have a clear presence of the virus without symptoms of the disease. Thanks to the screening test, people infected with HBV are administered traditional therapy in order to stop the progression to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These diseases cause the decrease of Qol and cause a high consumption of resources for the health system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a strategy (test strategy) involving the administration of the screening test to patients at risk and the treatment of the infected according to the protocol therapy. This programme is compared with a strategy (no test strategy) which does not include a screening and treats patients affected by cirrhosis or HCC. METHODS: We created a Markov model following the natural history of the disease and considering the antigen HBeAg to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the test strategy. The analysis was carried out considering a third-party payer perspective. The time horizon considered was 40 cycles of one year. Patients who resulted positive to the test were administered either interferon treatment; or lamivudine or adefovir or entecavir or tenofovir, consistently with the Italian guidelines. Treatments were administered to patients included in the no-test arm after cirrhosis symptoms or HCC. RESULTS: The results of the base case analysis show that patients following the test strategy compared with patients of the no-test approach cost €17,179/QALY. The Monte Carlo simulation based on a probabilistic sensitivity analysis points out that in 95% of the scenarios assumed, the cost per QALY would be under a hypothetical threshold of €40,000 which is the amount that international guidelines for decision makers are likely to consider sustainable for a health system. In conclusion, anti-hbv test to all high-risk categories should be highly recommended.",2010-01-06826,21035229,Health Policy,M Ruggeri,2010,/,,No,21035229,"M Ruggeri; The cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies against HBV in Italy, Health Policy, 2010-Oct-27; ():0168-8510",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Test strategy vs. No-test strategy,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,17179,Euro,2008,30409.1
7297,Cost-effectiveness of psychotherapy for cluster c personality disorders: a decision-analytic model in the Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a formal economic evaluation of various dosages of psychotherapy for patients with avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive (ie, cluster C) personality disorders (Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality criteria). METHOD: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 5 dosages of psychotherapy (ie, long-term outpatient psychotherapy, short-term and long-term day hospital psychotherapy, and short-term and long-term inpatient psychotherapy) over a 5-year time horizon in terms of cost per recovered patient-year and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Model parameters were estimated using data from 466 patients with cluster C personality disorders who were admitted to 6 specialist centers of psychotherapy in The Netherlands and assigned to 1 of the 5 treatment groups. Probabilistic analysis was conducted to explore the stability of results over uncertain data ranges. Analyses were conducted from both societal and payer perspectives. RESULTS: From the societal perspective and below a threshold of €2,637 (US $3,351.92) per recovered patient-year, short-term day hospital psychotherapy resulted in the highest level of benefit for its cost; above the threshold, short-term inpatient psychotherapy was the most cost-effective choice. In terms of cost per QALY, this switch point was at a threshold value of €16,570 (US $21,062.29) per QALY. From the payer perspective, the optimal strategy changed from short-term day hospital psychotherapy to short-term inpatient psychotherapy at threshold values of €9,874 (US $12,550.94) per recovered patient-year and €66,302 (US $84,277.13) per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that short-term day hospital psychotherapy and short-term inpatient psychotherapy are the most cost-effective treatment strategies for patients with cluster C personality disorders.

7300,Cost-effectiveness of adolescent pertussis vaccination for the Netherlands: using an individual-based dynamic model,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread immunization programs, a clear increase in pertussis incidence is apparent in many developed countries during the last decades. Consequently, additional immunization strategies are considered to reduce the burden of disease. The aim of this study is to design an individual-based stochastic dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population in order to predict the epidemiologic and economic consequences of the implementation of universal booster vaccination programs. Using this framework, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal adolescent pertussis booster vaccination at the age of 12 years in the Netherlands. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We designed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to predict the epidemiological and economic consequences of implementing universal adolescent booster vaccination. We used national age-specific notification data over the period 1996-2000--corrected for underreporting--to calibrate the model assuming a steady state situation. Subsequently, booster vaccination was introduced. Input parameters of the model were derived from literature, national data sources (e.g. costing data, incidence and hospitalization data) and expert opinions. As there is no consensus on the duration of immunity acquired by natural infection, we considered two scenarios for this duration of protection (i.e. 8 and 15 years). In both scenarios, total pertussis incidence decreased as a result of adolescent vaccination. From a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness was estimated at €4418/QALY (range: 3205-6364 € per QALY) and €6371/QALY (range: 4139-9549 € per QALY) for the 8- and 15-year protection scenarios, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the outcomes are most sensitive to the quality of life weights used for pertussis disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge we designed the first individual-based dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population. This study indicates that adolescent pertussis vaccination is likely to be a cost-effective intervention for The Netherlands. The model is suited to investigate further pertussis booster vaccination strategies.",2010-01-06838,20976213,PLoS One,R de Vries,2010,5 / 10,e13392,No,20976213,"R de Vries; Cost-effectiveness of adolescent pertussis vaccination for the Netherlands: using an individual-based dynamic model, PLoS One , 2010; 5(10):1932-6203; e13392",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal adolescent pertussis booster vaccination at age 12 years (8 year protection) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,4.00,1.50,4418,Euro,2008,7820.44
