2301,Health-economic comparison of three recommended drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a large and growing disease with significant health consequences. Based on an evaluation of clinical evidence, the German osteology umbrella organization DVO (Dachverband Osteologie deutschsprachiger wissenschaftlicher Fachgesellschaften) published guidelines in March 2003 for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. For prevention of fractures in women with postmenopausal and senile osteoporosis, these guidelines recommend three treatment options as first-line therapy: risedronate, alendronate and raloxifene. No evidence is currently available for the reduction of hip fractures by raloxifene. Only risedronate and alendronate, therefore, are recommended for prevention of hip fractures. Information on the cost-effectiveness of preventing and treating osteoporosis may support decision makers in more efficient allocation of resources. Accordingly, the objective of this study is the comparative assessment of the cost-effectiveness of risedronate, alendronate and raloxifene for patient populations in Germany at high risk of osteoporotic fracture due to low bone mineral density (BMD) (i.e., T-score < -2.5) and resulting from a history of at least one previous vertebral fracture, as compared to osteoporotic patients with no treatment. Target variables for the economic comparison are costs per hip fracture avoided and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Hip fractures are the most costly and best-documented complication of osteoporosis. A cost-effectiveness analysis was therefore conducted, using as criteria for evaluating intervention the incremental cost per hip fracture avoided and the cost per QALY gained. We used a fracture-incidence-based Markov model of osteoporosis, with analysis of patients"" transition across outcome states over time (e.g., fracture, healthy, dead). Base-case analysis was conducted on a cohort of 1,000 women aged 70 with low spine BMD and prevalent vertebral fracture, over 3 years of treatment with risedronate, alendronate or raloxifene, and with application of a 10-year analytic time horizon. Model inputs included hip and vertebral fracture incidence rates; relative risk of fracture given low BMD and prevalent vertebral fracture, fracture cost, treatment prices/day (risedronate: 35 mg, 1.76 euro; alendronate: 70 mg, 1.82 euro; raloxifene: 60 mg, 1.82 euro); health utility; and efficacy in terms of relative-risk reduction of fracture of the hip (60% risedronate; 51% alendronate; not significant raloxifene) and vertebrae (49% risedronate; 47% alendronate; 30% raloxifene). A 5% discount rate was applied to cost and outcomes. In the base case, treatment with risedronate reduces costs from the social insurance perspective with respect to both endpoints: i.e., costs per averted hip fracture and QALY. Over the 3-year treatment period and 10-year observation, furthermore, risedronate proved superior to alendronate and raloxifene (i.e., risedronate was less expensive and more effective). From the perspective of statutory health insurance, the cost per averted hip fracture is 37,348 euro for risedronate and 48,349 euro for alendronate (costs for raloxifene were not calculated due to a nonsignificant effect on prevention of hip fractures); and cost per QALY gained is 32,092 euro for risedronate, in comparison to patients in Germany with no therapy (alendronate 41,302 euro; raloxifene 1,247,119 euro). This cost-effectiveness analysis gives evidence that bisphosphonates are cost effective.

2304,Economic analysis of palivizumab in infants with congenital heart disease,"OBJECTIVE: Palivizumab has been shown to reduce the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations by 45% in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that infants with hemodynamically significant CHD be considered for palivizumab. However, the economic implications of palivizumab prophylaxis in the CHD population have not been evaluated. In the present study, we sought to examine the cost savings and cost utility of RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab in children with CHD. METHODS: Probabilities of hospitalization and efficacy of prophylaxis were based on published results. Costs of hospitalization were derived from a published analysis of bronchiolitis hospitalization costs from a consortium of children""s hospitals. A hypothetical cohort of 10,000 CHD patients (half of whom would receive palivizumab) was created to calculate cost-savings and cost-utility. To assess cost utility, we assumed that by reducing hospitalization, palivizumab would reduce RSV-related hospital mortality, generally reported to be 3% in CHD patients. Sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: On the basis of a protocol of 5 monthly doses of palivizumab, the cost of prophylaxis for 1 RSV season was calculated as 6160 dollars per patient. After accounting for impact on direct and indirect costs of hospitalization, administration of palivizumab to 5000 CHD patients would result in a net loss of 20,415,753 dollars. If one assumes that palivizumab confers a survival benefit, then the cost of life-year saved is 100,338 dollars and cost of quality-adjusted life-year saved is 114,337 dollars. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of palivizumab prophylaxis was high relative to benefits realized. Given the large number of CHD patients who might be considered candidates for RSV prophylaxis (>6000 patients per year in United States) routine use of palivizumab in young children with hemodynamically significant CHD needs to be evaluated further.",2004-01-00087,15574622,Pediatrics,Laura E Yount,2004,114 / 6,1606-11,No,15574622,"Laura E Yount; William T Mahle; William T Mahle; Economic analysis of palivizumab in infants with congenital heart disease, Pediatrics, 2004-Dec; 114(6):1098-4275; 1606-11",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Palivizumab prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vs. No prophylaxis for RSV,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,114337,United States,2002,164489.57
2305,Metastatic colorectal carcinoma: cost-effectiveness of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation versus that of hepatic resection,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) ablation and hepatic resection in patients with metachronous liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and compare the outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness of a variety of treatment and follow-up strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A state-transition decision model for evaluating the (societal) cost-effectiveness of RF ablation and hepatic resection in patients with CRC liver metastases was developed. The model tracks the presence, number, size, location, growth, detection, and removal of up to 15 individual metastases in each patient. Survival, quality of life, and cost are predicted on the basis of disease extent. Imaging, ablation, and resection affect outcomes through detection and elimination of individual metastases. Several patient care strategies were developed and compared on the basis of cost, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness (expressed as dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of alternative scenarios and assumptions on results. RESULTS: A strategy permitting ablation of up to five metastases with computed tomographic (CT) follow-up every 4 months resulted in a gain of 0.65 QALYs relative to a no-treat strategy, at an incremental cost of $2400 per QALY. Compared with this ablation strategy, a strategy permitting resection of up to four metastases, one repeat resection, and CT follow-up every 6 months resulted in an additional gain of 0.76 QALYs at an incremental cost of $24 300 per QALY. Across a range of model assumptions, more aggressive treatment strategies (ie, ablation or resection of more metastases, treatment of recurrent metastases, more frequent follow-up imaging) were superior to less aggressive strategies and had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $35 000 per QALY. Findings were insensitive to changes in most model parameters; however, results were somewhat sensitive to changes in size thresholds for RF ablation, the number of metastases present, and surgery and treatment costs. CONCLUSION: RF ablation is a cost-effective treatment option for patients with CRC liver metastases.

2309,Cost-effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir versus nelfinavir as the first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen for HIV infection,"PURPOSE: Selecting the optimal treatment regimen for antiviral-naive patients may be difficult, given the concern about the antiviral activity, the development of drug resistance, and the increase in drug costs. This study evaluates the costs and effectiveness of using lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) vs. nelfinavir (NFV), both coadministered with stavudine and lamivudine, as the first HAART regimen in treating HIV patients, based on the results from the published clinical trial M98-863. METHOD: A Markov model was developed using a combination of viral load (VL) and CD4 count as surrogate markers to define health states. VL and CD4 count data from the 48-week analysis of the clinical trial were used as measures of effect. The impact of resistance difference between NFV and LPV/r was also examined. RESULTS: Over the first 5 years, the model estimated that LPV/r could save $3,461 USD per patient in total HIV care costs compared with NFV. If the resistance advantage of LPV/r was taken into account, the cost savings by LPV/r increased to $5,546 USD. For longer term projection, without considering the resistance difference, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) for LPV/r vs. NFV was $6,653 USD per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). This CER compares favorably to therapies for HIV disease and for common drug treatments for other conditions and is well within accepted thresholds for health policy makers. CONCLUSION: When treatment options are being considered, this study suggests that use of LPV/r in the first antiretroviral regimen, as compared to NFV, is cost-effective based on improved efficacy and resistance.",2004-01-00091,15562370,HIV Clin Trials,Kit N Simpson,2004,5 / 5,294-304,No,15562370,"Kit N Simpson; Michelle P Luo; Elinor Chumney; Eugene Sun; Scott Brun; Talat Ashraf; Michelle P Luo; Elinor Chumney; Eugene Sun; Scott Brun; Talat Ashraf; Cost-effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir versus nelfinavir as the first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen for HIV infection, HIV Clin Trials, 2004 Sep-Oct; 5(5):1528-4336; 294-304",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lopinavir/ritonavir with stavudine and lamivudine vs. Nelfinavir with stavudine and lamivudine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,6653,United States,2002,9571.26

METHODS: By using decision analysis, the lifetime costs and benefits of 4 strategies for which long-term data exist were estimated by us: esophagectomy, endoscopic surveillance, photodynamic therapy, followed by esophagectomy for residual high-grade dysplasia; and photodynamic therapy followed by endoscopic surveillance for residual high-grade dysplasia. It was assumed by us that there was a 30% prevalence of cancer in high-grade dysplasia patients and a 77% efficacy of photodynamic therapy for high-grade dysplasia and early cancer. RESULTS: Esophagectomy cost 24,045 dollars, with life expectancy of 11.82 quality-adjusted life years. In comparison, photodynamic therapy followed by surveillance for residual high-grade dysplasia was the most effective strategy, with a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 12.31 quality-adjusted life years, but it also incurred the greatest lifetime cost (47,310 dollars) for an incremental cost-effectiveness of 47,410 dollars/quality-adjusted life years. The results were sensitive to post-surgical quality of life and survival, and to cancer prevalence if photodynamic therapy efficacy for cancer was less than 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy followed by endoscopic surveillance for residual high-grade dysplasia appears to be cost effective compared with esophagectomy for patients diagnosed with high-grade dysplasia in Barrett""s esophagus. Clinical trials directly comparing these strategies are warranted.",2004-01-00093,15557950,Gastrointest Endosc,Rohini Vij,2004,60 / 5,739-56,No,15557950,"Rohini Vij; George Triadafilopoulos; Douglas K Owens; Pamela Kunz; Gillian D Sanders; George Triadafilopoulos; Douglas K Owens; Pamela Kunz; Gillian D Sanders; Cost-effectiveness of photodynamic therapy for high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, Gastrointest Endosc, 2004-Nov; 60(5):0016-5107; 739-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Photodynamic therapy or endoscopic surveillance vs. Esophagectomy,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,47410,United States,2001,69284.19
2311,United Kingdom back pain exercise and manipulation (UK BEAM) randomised trial: cost effectiveness of physical treatments for back pain in primary care,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of adding spinal manipulation, exercise classes, or manipulation followed by exercise (""combined treatment"") to ""best care"" in general practice for patients consulting with low back pain. DESIGN: Stochastic cost utility analysis alongside pragmatic randomised trial with factorial design. SETTING: 181 general practices and 63 community settings for physical treatments around 14 centres across the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 1287 (96%) of 1334 trial participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost per QALY over 12 months. RESULTS: Over one year, mean treatment costs relative to ""best care"" were 195 pounds sterling (360 dollars; 279 euros; 95% credibility interval 85 pounds sterling to 308 pounds sterling) for manipulation, 140 pounds sterling (3 pounds sterling to 278 pounds sterling) for exercise, and 125 pounds sterling (21 pounds sterling to 228 pounds sterling) for combined treatment. All three active treatments increased participants"" average QALYs compared with best care alone. Each extra QALY that combined treatment yielded relative to best care cost 3800 pounds sterling; in economic terms it had an ""incremental cost effectiveness ratio"" of 3800 pounds sterling. Manipulation alone had a ratio of 8700 pounds sterling relative to combined treatment. If the NHS was prepared to pay at least 10,000 pounds sterling for each extra QALY (lower than previous recommendations in the United Kingdom), manipulation alone would probably be the best strategy. If manipulation was not available, exercise would have an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 8300 pounds sterling relative to best care.

2314,The cost effectiveness of adalimumab in the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis patients in Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: Societal decision-makers increasingly emphasize their need for evidence-based economic analyses to make reimbursement decisions. The goal of this study was to analyse the cost utility of adalimumab, on both incremental cost and incremental health-value bases, vs. traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and the other tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists suitable for a submission to the Swedish LFN (Pharmaceutical Benefit Board). Adalimumab (Humira(R), Abbott Laboratories) is a fully human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: This study implemented Swedish unit costs and treatment guidelines from a lifetime perspective. A mathematical model, incorporating data from eight trials on efficacy, utility and cost, simulated the experiences of 10,000 hypothetical moderate to severe RA patients for each strategy used in those trials. The primary outcome measure, quality- adjusted life years (QALYs), was derived from utility values calculated from a relationship between the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI) and Health Utility Index-3 (HUI-3) from adalimumab trial results. The model followed OMERACT guidance for incorporating mortality data, accounting for placebo, trending HAQ DI scores over different periods of a treatment cycle, and other factors. RESULTS: In a cost-per-ACR50 analysis, adalimumab plus methotrexate showed the greatest number of QALYs gained (2.3 from one study and 2.1 from the pooled results of two trials). The etanercept plus methotrexate strategy yielded QALY gains similar to the pooled adalimumab results. Except for the infliximab strategy, the costs results are between &#8364 35,000-42,000, a range normally considered cost-effective in other European countries.

2322,Cost effectiveness of a community based exercise programme in over 65 year olds: cluster randomised trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of a community based exercise programme as a population wide public health intervention for older adults. DESIGN: Pragmatic, cluster randomised community intervention trial. SETTING: 12 general practices in Sheffield; four randomly selected as intervention populations, and eight as control populations. PARTICIPANTS: All those aged 65 and over in the least active four fifths of the population responding to a baseline survey. There were 2283 eligible participants from intervention practices and 4137 from control practices. INTERVENTION: Eligible subjects were invited to free locally held exercise classes, made available for two years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause and exercise related cause specific mortality and hospital service use at two years, and health status assessed at baseline, one, and two years using the SF-36. A cost utility analysis was also undertaken. RESULTS: Twenty six per cent of the eligible intervention practice population attended one or more exercise sessions. There were no significant differences in mortality rates, survival times, or admissions. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, patients in intervention practices had a lower decline in health status, although this reached significance only for the energy dimension and two composite scores (p<0.05). The incremental average QALY gain of 0.011 per person in the intervention population resulted in an incremental cost per QALY ratio of 17 174 (95% CI = 8300 to 87 120).

2323,"What is the best management strategy for high grade dysplasia in Barrett""s oesophagus? A cost effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND: Multiple treatment strategies for subjects with high grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett""s oesophagus (BO) have been suggested. However, it is unclear which of these strategies provides the greatest life expectancy, and the costs associated with the management strategies are unknown. AIM: To compare the efficacy and cost effectiveness of competing management strategies for BO with HGD. METHODS: We created a decision analysis model in Data 4.0 to assess possible treatment strategies for BO with HGD. The strategies included: (1) no preventative strategy, (2) elective surgical oesophagectomy, (3) endoscopic ablation, and (4) surveillance endoscopy. The base case was a healthy 50 year old White male with an initial diagnosis of BO with HGD. The model allowed for complications of surgery, including death. Ablative therapy could cause stricture or perforation. Pathological misinterpretation was allowed, and modelled after reported rates. Estimates were derived from the literature for the rate of progression of HGD to cancer and for complication rates for the various treatment modalities. The endoscopic ablation arm was modelled as photodynamic therapy. Sensitivity analyses were performed over a wide range of cancer incidences, complication rates, and procedure costs. RESULTS: Endoscopic ablation was the most effective strategy, yielding 15.5 discounted quality adjusted life years (dQALY), compared with 15.0 for endoscopic surveillance and 14.9 for oesophagectomy. No preventative strategy was the most inexpensive option, yielding an average cost per quality adjusted life year of US dollars 54 (44) per dQALY, but resulted in high rates of cancer. Endoscopic surveillance dominated oesophagectomy, being both less costly and more effective. The condition of extended dominance occurred when comparing endoscopic ablation to endoscopic surveillance because, although the total costs of ablation were greater than those of surveillance, it was less expensive to buy an additional life year using endoscopic ablation than endoscopic surveillance. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio when moving from no therapy to ablative therapy was a reasonable US dollars 25 621/dQALY (21 009/dQALY). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that when yearly rates of progression to cancer from HGD exceeded 30%, oesophagectomy became the most cost effective option. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of endoscopic ablation provided the longest quality adjusted life expectancy for BO with HGD.

2326,Is influenza vaccination cost effective for healthy people between ages 65 and 74 years? A randomised controlled trial,"The aim of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness of influenza vaccination for healthy people aged 65-74 years living in the UK. People without risk factors for influenza (chronic heart, lung or renal disease, diabetic, immunosuppressed or those living in an institution) were identified from 20 general practitioner (GP) practices in Liverpool in September 1999. 729/5875 (12.4%) eligible individuals were recruited and randomised to receive either influenza vaccine or placebo (ratio 3:1), with all participants receiving 23-valent-pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine unless already administered. The primary analysis was the frequency of influenza as recorded by a GP diagnosis of pneumonia or influenza like illness. In 2000, the UK vaccination policy was changed with influenza vaccine becoming available for all people aged 65 years and over irrespective of risk. As a consequence of this policy change, the study had to be fundamentally restructured and only results obtained over a one rather than the originally planned two-year randomised controlled trial framework were used. Results from 1999/2000 demonstrated no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome (relative risk 0.8, 95% CI 0.16-4.1). In addition, there were no deaths or hospitalisations for influenza associated respiratory illness in either group. The subsequent analysis, using both national and local sources of evidence, estimated the following cost effectiveness indicators: (1) incremental NHS cost per GP consultation avoided = 2000 pound sterling; (2) incremental NHS cost per hospital admission avoided = 61,000 pound sterling; (3) incremental NHS cost per death avoided = 1,900,000 pound sterling and (4) incremental NHS cost per QALY gained = 304,000 pound sterling.

2327,Cost-effectiveness of detemir-based basal/bolus therapy versus NPH-based basal/bolus therapy for type 1 diabetes in a UK setting: an economic analysis based on meta-analysis results of four clinical trials,"BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of results from four clinical trials in type 1 diabetes patients showed that insulin detemir (IDet)-based basal/bolus treatment of type 1 diabetes led to improved HbA1c (0.15%-points lower), reduced risk of major hypoglycaemic events (by 2%) and reduction in body mass index (BMI) (0.26 kg/m2) compared to protamine Hagedorn human (NPH) insulin-based basal/bolus therapy in type 1 patients. METHODS: A published, validated, peer-reviewed Markov simulation model (the CORE Diabetes Model) projected short-term results obtained from the fixed-effects (weighted average) meta-analysis to long-term incidence of complications, improvements in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), long-term costs and the cost-effectiveness for IDet combinations versus NPH combinations in type 1 diabetes patients. Probabilities of complications and HbA1c-dependent adjustments were derived from the DCCT and other studies. Costs of treating complications in the UK were retrieved from published sources. Total direct costs (complications + treatment costs) for each arm were projected over patient lifetimes from a UK National Heath Service perspective. Both costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: Improved glycaemic control, decreased hypoglycaemic events and BMI with IDet-based basal/bolus therapy led to fewer diabetes-related complications, an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.09 years, increased total lifetime costs/patient of 1707 pounds sterling and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 19,285 pounds sterling per QALY gained. Results were stable under a wide range of reasonable assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term improvements seen with IDet combinations versus NPH combinations led to decreased complications, improvements in QALYs and reductions in complication costs, which partially offset the additional costs of detemir, leading to a cost-effectiveness ratio which fell within a range considered to represent excellent value for money (< 35,000 pounds sterling/QALY gained).",2004-01-00108,15537473,Curr Med Res Opin,Andrew J Palmer,2004,20 / 11,1729-46,No,15537473,"Andrew J Palmer; Stéphane Roze; William J Valentine; Inger Smith; Kim U Wittrup-Jensen; Stéphane Roze; William J Valentine; Inger Smith; Kim U Wittrup-Jensen; Cost-effectiveness of detemir-based basal/bolus therapy versus NPH-based basal/bolus therapy for type 1 diabetes in a UK setting: an economic analysis based on meta-analysis results of four clinical trials, Curr Med Res Opin, 2004-Nov; 20(11):0300-7995; 1729-46",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin Detemir-based basal/bolus therapy vs. Protamine hagedorn human (NPH) based basal/bolus therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,19285,United Kingdom,2003,44341.56

To quantify the total estimation of uncertainty due to sampling variability as well as inexact knowledge of HIV transmission parameters. METHODS: The authors focus on estimating the incremental net health benefit (INHB) in a randomized trial of HIV prevention with intervention and control conditions.

A sampling model is used to account for variation in the behavior measurements. Bayes""s theorem and Monte Carlo methods are used to attain the stated objectives. RESULTS: The authors obtained a positive mean INHB of 0.0008, indicating that advocacy training is just slightly favored over the control condition for men, assuming a $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold.

2329,Cost-utility analysis of osteopathy in primary care: results from a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Spinal pain is common and costly to health services and society. Management guidelines have encouraged primary care referral for spinal manipulation, but the evidence base is weak. More economic evaluations alongside pragmatic trials have been recommended. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the cost-utility of a practice-based osteopathy clinic for subacute spinal pain. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed alongside a pragmatic single-centre randomized controlled trial in a primary care osteopathy clinic accepting referrals from 14 neighbouring practices in North West Wales. Patients with back pain of 2-12 weeks duration were randomly allocated to treatment with osteopathy plus usual GP care or usual GP care alone. Costs were measured from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective. All primary and secondary health care interventions recorded in GP notes were collected for the study period. We calculated quality adjusted life year (QALY) gains based on EQ-5D responses from patients in the trial, and then cost per QALY ratios. Confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Osteopathy plus usual GP care was more effective but resulted in more health care costs than usual GP care alone. The point estimate of the incremental cost per QALY ratio was 3560 pounds (80% CI 542 pounds-77,100 pounds). Sensitivity analysis examining spine-related costs alone and total costs excluding outliers resulted in lower cost per QALY ratios. CONCLUSION: A primary care osteopathy clinic may be a cost-effective addition to usual GP care, but this conclusion was subject to considerable random error.

2330,Cost utility and budget impact of third-generation aromatase inhibitors for advanced breast cancer: a literature-based model analysis of costs in the Italian National Health Service,"BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are effective alternatives to tamoxifen in patients with advanced breast cancer. However, their acquisition costs might burden fixed-budget health care systems. OBJECTIVE: This study is a decision analysis of the clinical and economic consequences of alternative first-line hormone therapies for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in a real-life Italian health care setting. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to describe disease evolution according to data from previously published, randomized clinical trials. The costs incurred by a local community hospital in the Italian National Health Service were considered (year-2003 values). Clinical data were taken from previously published trials. A 3% discount rate was applied to both resources and life-years gained. RESULTS: Based on model estimates, mean survival times with the third-generation aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole were 30.72 and 30.64 months, respectively, as opposed to 27.28 months with tamoxifen. Mean survival times after adjustment for quality of life were 18.84 and 18.78 months with anastrozole and letrozole, respectively, and 16.14 months with tamoxifen. Baseline analysis produced incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 10,795 Euro (95% CI, 7737 Euro-12,899 Euro) and 16,886 Euro (95% CI, 9117 Euro-15,465 Euro) for anastrozole and letrozole, respectively, compared with tamoxifen. The observed difference between the 2 cost-utility ratios may have been mainly due to the higher acquisition costs of letrozole compared with anastrozole. Despite similar incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, anastrozole and letrozole might increase the budget for advanced breast cancer care by 12% and 18%, respectively, based on the year-2003 Italian market prices of the 2 drugs.

2332,Cost-effectiveness analysis of total ankle arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: There is renewed interest in total ankle arthroplasty as an alternative to ankle fusion in the treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis. Despite a lack of long-term data on the clinical outcomes associated with these implants, the use of ankle arthroplasty is expanding. The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to evaluate whether the currently available literature justifies the emerging use of total ankle arthroplasty. This study also identifies thresholds for the durability and function of ankle prostheses that, if met, would support more widespread dissemination of this new technology. METHODS: A decision model was created for the treatment of ankle arthritis. The literature was reviewed to identify possible outcomes and their probabilities following ankle fusion and ankle arthroplasty. Each outcome was weighted for quality of life with use of a utility factor, and effectiveness was expressed in units of quality-adjusted life years. Gross costs were estimated from Medicare charge and reimbursement data for the relevant codes. The effect of the uncertainty of estimates of costs and effectiveness was assessed with sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The reference case of our model assumed a ten-year duration of survival of the prosthesis, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ankle arthroplasty of $18,419 per quality-adjusted life year gained. This reflects a gain of 0.52 quality-adjusted life years at a cost of $9578 when ankle arthroplasty is chosen over fusion. This ratio compares favorably with the cost-effectiveness of other medical and surgical interventions. Sensitivity analysis determined that the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained with ankle arthroplasty rises above $50,000 if the prosthesis is assumed to fail before seven years. Treatment options with ratios above $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year are commonly considered to have limited cost-effectiveness. This threshold is also crossed when the theoretical functional advantages of ankle arthroplasty are eliminated in sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The currently available literature has not yet shown that total ankle arthroplasty predictably results in levels of durability and function that make it cost-effective at this time. However, the reference case of this analysis does demonstrate that total ankle arthroplasty has the potential to be a cost-effective alternative to ankle fusion. This reference case assumes that the theoretical functional advantages of ankle arthroplasty over ankle fusion will be borne out in future clinical studies. Performance of total ankle replacement will be better justified if these thresholds are met in published long-term clinical trials.",2004-01-00118,15523017,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Nelson F SooHoo,2004,86-A / 11,2446-55,No,15523017,"Nelson F SooHoo; Gerald Kominski; Gerald Kominski; Cost-effectiveness analysis of total ankle arthroplasty, J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2004-Nov; 86-A(11):0021-9355; 2446-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Perform total ankle arthroplasty vs. Perform ankle fusion,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,18419,United States,1998,29245.64
2333,A comparison of the direct costs and cost effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and associated adverse drug reactions,"BACKGROUND: The economic burden of depression is known to be high and was estimated to be USD 83.1 billion in 2000. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), including both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have a superior adverse effect and safety profile relative to traditional agents (e.g. TCAs), and as a result have demonstrated superior cost effectiveness. Although efficacy across the SRIs is similar, the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) within SRIs remains significant and varies by agent. Patients who experience ADRs from SRIs may seek medical care, require additional treatment, and even discontinue treatment altogether, leading to increased utilisation and cost of therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study estimates the direct cost and cost effectiveness, taking into account the impact of treatment-related ADRs, of eight currently marketed SRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, generic fluoxetine, paroxetine, paroxetine controlled release [CR], sertraline, venlafaxine and venlafaxine extended release [XR]) used as initial treatment for depression. METHODS: A decision analytic model with a 6-month treatment goal was used to estimate the direct cost and cost effectiveness of treatment from the managed care/payer perspective. Estimates of SRI-related ADRs, associated treatments and costs were derived from the US FDA-approved prescribing information and published literature. Efficacy was assumed to be similar across all SRIs. Effectiveness was measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) based on EuroQol EQ-5D scores derived from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) regression analysis was used to derive age-adjusted estimates of utility for all health states. Univariate and Bayesian second-order multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. RESULTS: The expected direct cost and cost effectiveness of treatment from least to most expensive were: escitalopram (USD 3891; 0.341), citalopram (USD 3938; 0.340), generic fluoxetine (USD 4034; 0.335), venlafaxine XR (USD 4226; 0.336), sertraline (USD 4250; 0.335), generic paroxetine (USD 4385; 0.332), paroxetine CR (USD 4440; 0.332) and venlafaxine (USD 4613; 0.326). Monte Carlo simulation results suggested that escitalopram was the most likely (77%) to be cost effective for a willingness to pay < or = USD 50,000 per QALY, followed by citalopram (22%), generic fluoxetine (0.3%) and all other SRIs (0%). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results of the study were robust to the assumptions underpinning the model. CONCLUSIONS: SRI-related ADRs have a significant impact on the direct cost and cost effectiveness of treatment.

2334,A comparison of the direct costs and cost effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and associated adverse drug reactions,"BACKGROUND: The economic burden of depression is known to be high and was estimated to be USD 83.1 billion in 2000. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), including both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have a superior adverse effect and safety profile relative to traditional agents (e.g. TCAs), and as a result have demonstrated superior cost effectiveness. Although efficacy across the SRIs is similar, the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) within SRIs remains significant and varies by agent. Patients who experience ADRs from SRIs may seek medical care, require additional treatment, and even discontinue treatment altogether, leading to increased utilisation and cost of therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study estimates the direct cost and cost effectiveness, taking into account the impact of treatment-related ADRs, of eight currently marketed SRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, generic fluoxetine, paroxetine, paroxetine controlled release [CR], sertraline, venlafaxine and venlafaxine extended release [XR]) used as initial treatment for depression.

2335,Two schedules of second-line irinotecan for metastatic colon carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: In a recently reported, randomized trial, it was found that a regimen of irinotecan once every 3 weeks for patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma was associated with a lower incidence of severe diarrhea compared with weekly treatment, and both regimens had similar efficacy. METHODS: Resource utilization was captured prospectively for all 291 patients who were included in the trial. Utilities were estimated by transformation of the global quality-of-life (QOL) item on the Eastern Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 instrument. RESULTS: Patients in the every-3-week arm incurred an average incremental cost of $1362, because they received higher average weekly doses and because the every-3-week regimen resulted in less toxicity, allowing delivery of 97% of the planned doses compared with delivery of only 75% of the planned doses in the weekly arm. This lower toxicity also resulted in offsetting savings from decreased hospitalization and less requirement for supportive medications. Non-chemotherapy-related treatment administration costs also were lower, because the every-3-week regimen could be delivered with half the number of infusions. Utility declined less in the every-3-week arm, resulting in a saving of 6.3 quality-adjusted days. The base-case cost:utility ratio was $78,627 per quality-adjusted life year for patients on the every-3-week schedule. However, that ratio was very sensitive to the cost of irinotecan. CONCLUSIONS: The schedule of irinotecan once every 3 weeks schedule was more costly but achieved lower toxicity, resulting in modestly improved utility.

2336,Cost-effectiveness of imatinib versus interferon-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine for patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia,"BACKGROUND: Despite a lack of long-term data, imatinib has become standard therapy for patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who are not candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In the current study, the authors estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of imatinib versus interferon-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine (IFN+LDAC) as first-line therapy for these patients. METHODS: Data from the International Randomized Interferon versus STI571 Study and the literature were used to estimate lifetime costs, survival, and quality-adjusted survival. Survival estimates were based on published survival curves for patients who achieved and those who did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response after treatment with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: The mean estimated survival with first-line imatinib therapy was 15.30 years, compared with 9.07 years with IFN+LDAC. Undiscounted lifetime costs were approximately $424,600 with imatinib and $182,800 with IFN+LDAC. Using a 3% discount rate, the incremental survival gain with imatinib was 3.93 life-years and 3.89 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental discounted lifetime costs were found to be $168,100 higher with imatinib, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $43,100 per life-year saved (95% confidence interval [95% CI], $37,600-51,100) and $43,300 per QALY (95% CI, $38,300-49,100).

2337,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in England and Wales,"AIM: To establish whether universal vaccination of infants with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is likely to be cost-effective from the perspective of the health care provider (NHS). METHOD: Two hypothetical cohorts--one vaccinated and one unvaccinated--were followed over their lifetime, and the expected net costs and benefits (measured in terms of life-years and quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained) were compared in the two cohorts. The impact of indirect effects of the vaccine, such as herd immunity and serotype replacement, were investigated and their relative importance was assessed by performing univariate sensitivity analysis and multivariate Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions (no herd immunity and no serotype replacement) the programme is not expected to be cost-effective from the NHS perspective at the current price of the vaccine (assumed 30 pounds per dose, three-dose programme). A reduction of the cost of the vaccine to half of its current level could bring the cost per QALY gained within normally acceptable ranges. If the burden of disease is significantly underestimated by current surveillance systems, then the cost per QALY gained approaches acceptable levels at the current vaccine price. Herd immunity may substantially reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease, particularly of pneumonia among the elderly, leading to a significant improvement in the cost per life year and QALY gained. Serotype replacement would partly offset these benefits, although only with a complete substitution of vaccine types with non-vaccine types and a low level of herd immunity, would pneumococcal vaccination programme would not be cost-effective.

2341,Elective cesarean delivery to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis C virus: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether elective cesarean delivery to avert perinatal hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission is cost-effective. STUDY DESIGN: Using decision analysis, we compared 2 approaches: (1) offering elective cesarean delivery to avert perinatal HCV transmission, (2) performing a cesarean delivery only for obstetric indications. Lifetime cost and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) for HCV-infected neonates were evaluated with Markov analysis. We assumed elective cesarean delivery reduces perinatal HCV transmission, and we varied both the risk reduction caused by elective cesarean delivery and the background risk of perinatal HCV infection. RESULTS: When elective cesarean section prevents all perinatal HCV transmission, 18 elective cesarean deliveries are necessary to avert 1 neonatal infection with a cost-effectiveness ratio of 34,812 dollars/QALY. At a background perinatal transmission rate of 7.7% elective cesarean deliveries is cost-effective only if it reduces the risk of perinatal transmission by more than 77%.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of recently proposed strategies for chlamydia screening. DESIGN: State transition simulation model; cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Sexually active U.S. women 15 to 29 years of age. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal. INTERVENTIONS: Four strategies targeted to 3 specific age groups (15 to 19 years, 15 to 24 years, and 15 to 29 years): 1) no screening, 2) annual screening for all women, 3) annual screening followed by 1 repeated test within 3 to 6 months after a positive test result, and 4) annual screening followed by selective semiannual screening for women with a history of infection. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical events (for example, pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility), lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Annual screening in women 15 to 29 years of age followed by semiannual screening for those with a history of infection was the most effective and cost-effective strategy. It consistently had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than 25,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with the next most effective strategy. When the indirect transmission effects of a 10-year screening program on the probability of infection in uninfected women (that is, per-susceptible rate of infection) were considered, all strategies became more cost-effective. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the annual incidence of chlamydia, probability of persistent infection, screening test costs, and costs of treating long-term complications. Each variable was associated with threshold values beyond which screening became cost-saving. In probabilistic analysis, annual screening in women 15 to 29 years of age followed by semiannual screening for those with a history of infection had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than 50,000 dollars per QALY in 99% of simulations.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of recently proposed strategies for chlamydia screening. DESIGN: State transition simulation model; cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Sexually active U.S. women 15 to 29 years of age. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal. INTERVENTIONS: Four strategies targeted to 3 specific age groups (15 to 19 years, 15 to 24 years, and 15 to 29 years): 1) no screening, 2) annual screening for all women, 3) annual screening followed by 1 repeated test within 3 to 6 months after a positive test result, and 4) annual screening followed by selective semiannual screening for women with a history of infection. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical events (for example, pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility), lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Annual screening in women 15 to 29 years of age followed by semiannual screening for those with a history of infection was the most effective and cost-effective strategy. It consistently had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than 25,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with the next most effective strategy. When the indirect transmission effects of a 10-year screening program on the probability of infection in uninfected women (that is, per-susceptible rate of infection) were considered, all strategies became more cost-effective. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the annual incidence of chlamydia, probability of persistent infection, screening test costs, and costs of treating long-term complications. Each variable was associated with threshold values beyond which screening became cost-saving. In probabilistic analysis, annual screening in women 15 to 29 years of age followed by semiannual screening for those with a history of infection had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than 50,000 dollars per QALY in 99% of simulations. LIMITATIONS: Uncertainty about the natural history of chlamydial infection and consideration of only the indirect transmission effects of C. trachomatis screening.

2346,Immediate computed tomography scanning of acute stroke is cost-effective and improves quality of life,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke is very common, but computed tomography (CT) scanning, an expensive and finite resource, is required to differentiate cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, and stroke mimics. We determined whether, and in what circumstances, CT is cost-effective in acute stroke. METHODS: We developed a decision tree representing acute stroke care pathways populated with data from multiple sources. We determined the effect of diagnostic information from CT scanning on functional outcome, length of stay, costs, and quality of life during 5 years for 13 alternative CT strategies (varying proportions and types of patients and rapidity of scanning). RESULTS: For 1000 patients aged 70 to 74 years, the policy ""scan all strokes within 48 hours"" cost 10,279,728 pounds sterling and achieved 1982.3 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The most cost-effective strategy was ""scan all immediately"" (9,993,676 pounds sterling and 1982.4 QALYs). The least cost-effective was ""scan patients on anticoagulants and those in a life-threatening condition immediately and the rest within 14 days"" (12,592,666 pounds sterling and 1931.8 QALYs). ""Scan no patients"" reduced QALYs (1904.2) and increased cost (10,544,000 pounds sterling). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CT scanning is the most cost-effective strategy. For the majority of acute stroke patients, increasing independent survival by correct early diagnosis, ensuring appropriate subsequent treatment and management decisions, reduced costs of stroke and increased QALYs.",2004-01-00152,15459431,Stroke,Joanna M Wardlaw,2004,35 / 11,2477-83,No,15459431,"Joanna M Wardlaw; Janelle Seymour; John Cairns; Sarah Keir; Steff Lewis; Peter Sandercock; Janelle Seymour; John Cairns; Sarah Keir; Steff Lewis; Peter Sandercock; Immediate computed tomography scanning of acute stroke is cost-effective and improves quality of life, Stroke, 2004-Nov; 35(11):1524-4628; 2477-83",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,CT scan all patients immediately vs. CT scan all patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2860520,United Kingdom,2000,-6515843.44

2349,Cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitor treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus,"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend treating patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with ACE inhibitors after the onset of microalbuminuria. Recent clinical trials have shown ACE inhibitors can affect the development of nephropathy when initiated prior to the onset of microalbuminuria. Our objective is to examine the cost effectiveness of treating adults aged over 20 years with an ACE inhibitor (captopril) immediately following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes versus treating them after the onset of microalbuminuria. DESIGN: Using a semi-Markov model, we calculated four main outcome measures: lifetime direct medical costs (discounted), QALYs, cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and number of days of ESRD over a lifetime. Medical costs are in 1999 US dollars. SETTING: All analyses were from the viewpoint of a single US payer responsible for all direct medical costs, including screening for microalbuminuria, ACE inhibitor treatment (captopril), management of major diabetic complications, and routine annual medical costs not specific to diabetes. METHODS: We applied the model to a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 persons newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Distribution of sex and race/ethnicity within the cohort is representative of the general US population. RESULTS: We estimated that the incremental cost of early use of captopril for the average adult with type 1 diabetes is USD 27,143 per QALY. This level varies considerably with age and glycaemic level. When the age at onset of diabetes is 20 years and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) level is 9%, the cost-effectiveness ratio is USD 13,814 per QALY. When the age at onset is 25 years and HbA(1c) level is 7%, the cost-effectiveness ratio is USD 39,530 per QALY. CONCLUSION: This model, with its underlying assumptions and data, suggests that early treatment with captopril provides modest benefit at reasonable cost effectiveness, from the US single-payer perspective, in the prevention of ESRD compared with delaying treatment until diagnosis of microalbuminuria. Early treatment with other ACE inhibitors will provide similar cost effectiveness if they have equivalent efficacy, compliance and price per dose. Treatment may be considered among patients at age 20 years with new onset of type 1 diabetes. This conclusion is sensitive to the extent that ACE inhibitors delay onset of microalbuminuria. Other factors such as the patient""s age and glycaemic level must be considered when deciding to initiate early treatment.",2004-01-00158,15449965,Pharmacoeconomics,Frederick B Dong,2004,22 / 17,1015-27,Yes,15449965,"Frederick B Dong; Stephen W Sorensen; Diane L Manninen; Theodore J Thompson; Venkat Narayan; Carlyn E Orians; Edward W Gregg; Richard C Eastman; Erik J Dasbach; William H Herman; Jeffrey M Newman; Andrew S Narva; David J Ballard; Michael M Engelgau; Stephen W Sorensen; Diane L Manninen; Theodore J Thompson; Venkat Narayan; Carlyn E Orians; Edward W Gregg; Richard C Eastman; Erik J Dasbach; William H Herman; Jeffrey M Newman; Andrew S Narva; David J Ballard; Michael M Engelgau; Cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitor treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Pharmacoeconomics, 2004; 22(17):1179-2027; 1015-27",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors before microalbuminuria vs. No ACE inhibitors before microalbuminuria,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,27143,United States,1999,42166.31
2350,Cost-effectiveness analysis of bicalutamide (Casodex) for adjuvant treatment of early prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of bicalutamide (Casodex) as adjuvant treatment in early prostate cancer (EPC). METHODS: A Markov state transition model was developed, using disease progression rates from a large (N = 8113) clinical trial program comparing bicalutamide in addition to standard care with standard care alone. Utility scores for different disease stages were obtained from published reports. Costs of disease progression were obtained from a retrospective patient chart analysis in six Belgian centers (n = 60). The time horizon was 15 years and the analysis was conducted from the public payer perspective. RESULTS: The model showed good validity in predicting clinical outcomes. At a time horizon of 15 years, an incremental cost-effectiveness of 27,059 euros/QALY was obtained. The main factors influencing conclusions included the time horizon, the duration of bicalutamide treatment, which was set at a maximum (5 years) in the base case, and possible differences in prognosis of metastatic cancer between comparators. Also the discounting of health effects significantly altered cost-effectiveness ratios. Many of these influences are inherently associated with any cost-effectiveness analysis related to treatment of early, slowly progressing malignancies because such an analysis requires a sufficient time horizon to include not only the treatment costs but its benefits as well. CONCLUSION: Based on the current data, bicalutamide appears to be a cost-effective option for adjuvant treatment of EPC.",2004-01-00160,15449639,Value Health,Karen Moeremans,2004,7 / 4,472-81,Yes,15449639,"Karen Moeremans; Karin Caekelbergh; Lieven Annemans; Karin Caekelbergh; Lieven Annemans; Cost-effectiveness analysis of bicalutamide (Casodex) for adjuvant treatment of early prostate cancer, Value Health, 2004Jul-Aug; 7(4):1098-3015; 472-81",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bicalutamide and standard care vs. Standard care only,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,27059,Euro,2002,36802.03
2351,Cost-utility of adjuvant high-dose interferon alpha therapy in stage III cutaneous melanoma in Quebec,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-utility of adjuvant high-dose interferon in high-risk melanoma patients in Quebec compared to a watchful waiting strategy. METHOD: A Markov model was developed that replicates the findings of the pivotal E1684 trial. It was then used to extrapolate survival over a period of 35 years. Costs of medical resources used during the first year were derived through a detailed analysis of a sample (n = 13) of patients treated in a leading academic hospital. Follow-up costs were assessed through a medical decision algorithm. Utilities were derived from a population-based survey (n = 104) in different locations in Quebec using the time trade-off method. RESULTS: The mean incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of adjuvant Interferon therapy is equal to 55,090 CAN dollars over a follow-up of 7 years but drops down to 14,003 CAN dollars when extrapolated over 35 years. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of high-dose interferon in melanoma patients show an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio if long-term survival is taken into account.

2352,The economic impact of payer policies after the Rx-to-OTC switch of second-generation antihistamines,"OBJECTIVE: As a result of the over-the-counter (OTC) introduction of loratadine, health plans have been struggling to determine the best policy to incorporate this change within their existing drug benefit structure for second-generation antihistamines (SGA). The objective of this study was to examine the economic impact of payer policies in response to the Rx-to-OTC switch of loratadine. STUDY DESIGN: Decision analysis was used to model the budgetary impact and cost-effectiveness of four policies for SGA benefits for the managed care organization (MCO), employer, and Medicaid perspectives separately. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Outcomes included direct medical costs and lost productivity (employers only), discounted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved because of amelioration of allergic rhinitis symptoms and avoidance of unintentional injuries associated with the use of first-generation antihistamines (FGA). Bayesian probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using second-order Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Providing limited OTC and second-tier prescription benefits would cost approximately 0.13 dollars and 0.30 dollars compared to third-tier prescription benefits for employers and MCOs, respectively, and would save Medicaid 0.02 dollars per member per month (PMPM). Providing limited coverage for OTC loratadine while retaining second-tier prescription benefits for SGA was the optimal policy for a willingness to pay below 26,200 dollars per QALY for all payers. CONCLUSIONS: Offering second-tier prescription and limited OTC benefits provides greater effectiveness and is not significantly more expensive PMPM than discontinuation.

2355,Management for severe Crohn's disease: a lifetime cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Infliximab is a costly therapy for active Crohn""s disease resistant to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medication. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a treatment including infliximab (episodic re-infusions for relapse or maintenance therapy every 8 weeks) was relevant compared with conventional management (surgery and medical treatment without infliximab) for nonfistulizing resistant Crohn""s disease. METHODS: We performed a life-time cost-utility analysis with an analytic Markov decision model from the perspective of the third-party payer system. Utility measurement using Standard Gamble was used to adjust the survival time for each health state of the disease. Direct costs were estimated from standard management based on expert opinion. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to gauge the effects of uncertainty in the values assigned to variables. RESULTS: The incremental effectiveness with infliximab therapy is .761 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for an added cost ranging from 48,478.79 euros to 596,990.35 euros, depending on treatment procedure. The incremental cost utility ratio expressed in euros per QALYs saved varied from 63,700.82 euros (episodic re-infusions) to over 762,245.09 euros (maintenance therapy). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy could be cost-effective in the case of relapse treatment only, whereas the marginal cost-utility ratio exceeds conventional benchmarks for maintenance therapy.

2356,Cost-effectiveness of reduction mammaplasty,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to provide a comparison of the benefits of reduction mammaplasty (RM) for women with heavy breasts often termed macromastia or breast hypertrophy (BH) surgery. The rationale is to provide information to allow decision-makers to make judgments about the cost-effectiveness of this intervention and make comparisons with other interventions which are commonly undertaken within publicly financed health-care systems. METHODS: Data from a previous outcomes study in Sweden is re-analyzed to derive quality of life measures, from which a mean level of benefit outcome is derived and a cost per quality-adjusted life year is calculated (cost per QALY). RESULTS: The low Cost per QALY suggests that reduction mammaplasty is cost-effective when compared with other treatments which are commonly undertaken. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that the evidence in favor of funding reduction mammaplasty is strong and that decision-makers review their policy in light of this new evidence.",2004-01-00165,15446755,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Andrew J Taylor,2004,20 / 4,269-73,No,15446755,"Andrew J Taylor; David Tate; Yvonne Brandberg; Lennart Blomqvist; David Tate; Yvonne Brandberg; Lennart Blomqvist; Cost-effectiveness of reduction mammaplasty, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2004; 20(4):0266-4623; 269-73",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Reduction mammaplasty vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,Not Stated,5.00,5231,United Kingdom,2003,12027.52

2360,A cost-utility analysis of microwave and thermal balloon endometrial ablation techniques for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the second-generation surgical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding (microwave and thermal balloon endometrial ablation) compared with existing endometrial ablation techniques (transcervical resection and rollerball, alone or in combination) and hysterectomy. DESIGN: A state transition (Markov) cost-utility economic model. POPULATION: Women with heavy menstrual bleeding. METHODS: A Markov model was developed using spreadsheet software. Transition probabilities, costs and quality of life data were obtained from a systematic review of effectiveness undertaken by the authors, from published sources, and expert opinion. Cost data were obtained from the literature and from a NHS trust hospital. Indirect comparison of thermal balloon endometrial ablation versus microwave endometrial ablation or either second-generation endometrial ablation method versus hysterectomy, and comparison of second-generation versus first-generation techniques were carried out from the perspective of health service payers. The effects of uncertainty were explored through extensive one-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost effectiveness ratios based on cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and cost effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Compared with first-generation techniques, both microwave and thermal balloon endometrial ablation cost less and accrued more QALYs. Hysterectomy was more expensive, but accrued more QALYs than all endometrial ablation methods. Baseline results showed that differences between microwave endometrial ablation and thermal balloon endometrial ablation were slight. Sensitivity analyses showed that small changes in values may have a marked effect on cost effectiveness. Probabilistic simulation highlighted the uncertainty in comparisons between different endometrial ablation options, particularly between second-generation techniques.

2365,"Economic analysis of VenUS I, a randomized trial of two bandages for treating venous leg ulcers","BACKGROUND: The study investigated the cost-effectiveness of four-layer and short-stretch compression bandages for treating venous leg ulcers. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed using patient-level data collected alongside the VenUS I leg ulcer study. The perspective for the economic analysis was that of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Service. The time horizon for the analysis was 1 year after recruitment. Health benefit was measured as differences in ulcer-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The mean healing time for ulcers treated with four-layer bandages was 10.9 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) -6.8 to 29.1) days less than that for ulcers treated with short-stretch bandages. Mean average difference in QALYs between compression systems was -0.02 (95 per cent c.i. -0.08 to 0.04). The four-layer bandage cost a mean of pound 227.32 (95 per cent c.i. pound 16.53 to pound 448 .30) less per patient per year than the short-stretch bandage.

The objective of this study was to utilize data from the PLESS and MTOPS studies to assess the cost-utility of finasteride and finasteride in combination with doxazosin, compared to doxazosin alone in men with moderate to severe BPH symptoms. METHODS: A semi-Markov decision analytic model was constructed to estimate the clinical consequences, costs and cost-utility of doxazosin, finasteride, and combination therapy. Analyses were conducted for a 15-year time frame from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC). Results are reported stratified by baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level according to all baseline serum PSA levels, patients with baseline serum PSA > 1.3 ng/ml, and patients with baseline serum PSA > 3.2 ng/ml. RESULTS: Compared to doxazosin alone, combination therapy was more expensive but more effective.

Analyses were conducted for a 15-year time frame from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC). Results are reported stratified by baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level according to all baseline serum PSA levels, patients with baseline serum PSA > 1.3 ng/ml, and patients with baseline serum PSA > 3.2 ng/ml. RESULTS: Compared to doxazosin alone, combination therapy was more expensive but more effective. Cost-utility ratios ranged from 27,823 dollars/QALY for patients with PSA > 3.2 ng/ml to 34,085 dollars/QALY for all patients. Finasteride, although dominated by doxazosin, may be cost-effective compared to watchful waiting in patients who fail doxazosin and do not choose to proceed to surgery. Compared to watchful waiting, cost-utility ratios for finasteride ranged from 35016 dollars/QALY for patients with PSA > 3.2 ng/ml to 44,336 dollars/QALY for all patients. Results were robust across a wide range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy is cost-effective compared to doxazosin with cost-utility ratios under 40,000 dollars/QALY across a wide range of scenarios. The cost-effectiveness of combination therapy increases as serum PSA level increases.",2004-01-00173,15380054,Can J Urol,Heather McDonald,2004,11 / 4,2327-40,No,15380054,"Heather McDonald; Margaret Hux; Marc Brisson; Lisa Bernard; J Curtis Nickel; Margaret Hux; Marc Brisson; Lisa Bernard; J Curtis Nickel; An economic evaluation of doxazosin, finasteride and combination therapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, Can J Urol, 2004-Aug; 11(4):1195-9479; 2327-40",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Watchful waiting vs. Doxazosin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,15 Years,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,Canada,2003,Not Stated
2370,"Cost-effectiveness of interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate in newly diagnosed non-primary progressive multiple sclerosis","OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of three immunomodulatory treatments for newly diagnosed nonprimary progressive MS: interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate. METHODS: We developed a state-transition model to estimate the health effects and costs associated with interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, and no treatment for hypothetical cohorts of men and women with non-primary progressive MS. We used the Expanded Disability Status Scale as the measure of disability and included both relapses and disease progression in the model. We evaluated treatment strategies assuming a 10-year treatment duration using the societal perspective. We elicited preferences for disability and treatment states using standard-gamble questions and modeled the disutility associated with treatment administration and side effects explicitly. Main outcome measures were net gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: For treatment duration of 10 years for newly diagnosed non-primary progressive MS, interferon beta-1a yielded the largest gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2,200,000/QALY for women and $1,800,000/QALY for men, compared with no treatment. For a 5-year treatment duration, a ""no treatment"" strategy yielded more quality-adjusted life years than any of the treatment strategies. Cost-effectiveness ratios were similar for all three immunomodulatory treatments evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness results for all three immunomodulatory treatments for MS were unfavorable in the simulated study population under a wide range of assumptions. For treatment duration less than or equal to 5 years, expected benefits of treatment may not outweigh disutility associated with side effects and treatment discomfort.",2004-01-00175,15367251,Value Health,Lisa A Prosser,2004,7 / 5,554-68,Yes,15367251,"Lisa A Prosser; Karen M Kuntz; Amit Bar-Or; Milton C Weinstein; Karen M Kuntz; Amit Bar-Or; Milton C Weinstein; Cost-effectiveness of interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate in newly diagnosed non-primary progressive multiple sclerosis, Value Health, 2004 Sep-Oct; 7(5):1098-3015; 554-68",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon beta-1a vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,2218000,United States,1999,3445635.04
2371,Cost-effectiveness of two follow-up strategies for curative resection of colorectal cancer: comparative study using a Markov model,"The follow-up of patients with curative resection of colorectal cancer is still controversial. The means mobilized for postoperative monitoring come at a high cost. However, the modalities are neither formalized nor validated with regard to an improved 5-year survival rate. To compare the cost-effectiveness of both strategies for patient follow-up during the 7 years following curative resection of colorectal cancer, we performed a costeffectiveness analysis adjusted for quality of life. Using data from the literature and a population study, a simulation of follow-up on patients who had undergone curative resection of colorectal cancer was carried out over a 7-year period using a Markov model. Two Markov processes were modeled to compare the cost-effectiveness ratio adjusted for quality of life in patients with a follow-up in accordance with the recommendations of the 1998 French Consensus Conference (standard follow-up) with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay and a simplified follow-up. The influence of standard follow-up on the quality-adjusted life expectancy of patients who had Duke""s stage A and B colorectal cancer appears to be modest, with increases of 2.5 months and 1.3 months, respectively; it is more acceptable for patients who had had Duke""s stage C, with an increase of 11 months. The high variability of cost-effectiveness ratios (> 7 years) of +/- 44,830 and 180,195 Euro per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively) did not favor the standard follow-up. The cost-effectiveness ratio (> 7 years) of patients having had Duke""s stage C colorectal cancer was 1,058 (sd: 2746) Euro per QALY and could favor the standard follow-up. This study showed that standard follow-up with CEA assay tended to preferentially improve the survival of Duke""s stage C patients.

2372,Prolonged enoxaparin therapy to prevent venous thromboembolism after primary hip or knee replacement. A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Among patients undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement, prolonged prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduces the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. Whether implementing routine prolonged prophylaxis is cost-effective remains uncertain. METHODS: We performed an economic modeling study to compare the costs and health outcomes of standard (12 days) with prolonged (42 days) enoxaparin prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after elective total hip and knee replacement. The primary economic perspective was that of a societal healthcare payer, taking Belgium as a case country. We used cost-utility analysis, a form of cost effectiveness analysis in which costs are reported in monetary terms (euros) and health outcomes are converted into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, thereby incorporating a measure of quality of life (utility) into the health outcomes. Costs for diagnosis and treatment of proximal and distal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, postphlebitic syndrome, and major bleeding were obtained from a Delphi panel (orthopaedic surgeons) and the official reimbursement rates (Federal Ministry of Health). QALYs for these health outcomes were based on utility scores as reported in the literature. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-utility ratio, reported as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained (euros/QALY). The incremental cost-utility ratio refers to the amount of money needed to produce one additional QALY. We also performed sensitivity analyses on clinical and economic parameters to identify important model uncertainties. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, incremental costs of prolonged prophylaxis amounted to 58 euros and 114 euros per patient, with an additional gain in QALY of 0.0083 and 0.0018 after total hip and knee replacement, respectively. Thus, a strategy of prolonged enoxaparin prophylaxis was associated with a cost-utility ratio of 6,964 euros/QALY and 64,907 euros/QALY after total hip and knee replacement, respectively. This tenfold difference in incremental cost-utility ratios between hip and knee replacement might have important practical implications. According to recent European guidelines, an intervention costing less than 20,000 euros per QALY is said to exhibit strong evidence for adoption, whereas one costing 20,000-100,000 euros exhibits moderate evidence for adoption. By current European guidelines, the cost of 6,964 euros and 64,907 euros per QALY gained would give strong evidence for adoption of prolonged enoxaparin prophylaxis among total hip replacement patients, but moderate evidence for adoption among total knee replacement patients. Sensitivity analyses using 20% changes from the base-case analysis showed this outcome to be robust. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that, among patients undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement, prolonged enoxaparin prophylaxis leads to increased health benefits at increased cost.

METHODS: 301 subjects with early PD were randomized to either pramipexole or levodopa and followed every 3 months over a 2-year period. Costs were assigned to patient collected health utilization data using a variety of methods. Health state preferences were estimated using the EuroQol. RESULTS: Pramipexole strategy was an estimated 2,138 dollars (SE = 1,182 dollars) more expensive than levodopa strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness of pramipexole compared with levodopa was 106,900 dollars/QALY (EQ-5D), compared with pramipexole being dominated by levodopa using the EQVAS. CONCLUSIONS: Although considerable uncertainty exists in the 2-year cost-effectiveness of initial pramipexole compared with initial levodopa in the treatment of early PD, our estimates suggest that pramipexole may not be welfare enhancing during the first 2 years of treatment.

2377,Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with symptomatic heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a common, costly, and debilitating illness. Resynchronization of ventricular contraction in patients with heart failure improves ejection fraction. The long-term morbidity and costs associated with such cardiac resynchronization therapy remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy. DESIGN: Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3%. DATA SOURCES: Effects data were obtained from a concurrent systematic review. Health-related quality-of-life and cost data were obtained from publicly available data or from surveys. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with reduced ventricular function and prolonged QRS. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: U.S. health care system. INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy versus medical therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Medical therapy yielded a median of 2.64 (interquartile range, 2.47 to 2.82) discounted QALYs and a median discounted lifetime cost of 34,400 dollars (interquartile range, 31,100 dollars to 37,700 dollars). Cardiac resynchronization therapy was associated with a median incremental cost of 107,800 dollars(interquartile range, 79,800 dollars to 156,500 dollars) per additional QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to changes in several variables, including the relative risk for death or hospitalization. LIMITATIONS: These results apply to patients who meet the inclusion criteria of the currently completed trials. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost per QALY for cardiac resynchronization is similar to that of other commonly used interventions but is sensitive to changes in several key variables.

METHODS: Pooled data from 8, 8-week, randomized, double-blind studies comparing treatment of major depressive disorder with venlafaxine/venlafaxine XR (n = 851), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine; n = 748), or placebo (4 studies; n = 446) were retrospectively analyzed to determine the economic implications of symptom remission from the perspective of a US third party payer and that of an employer. A decision modeling approach was used to determine cost and effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Patients on VXR were associated with 22.8 depression-free days versus 18.6 depression-free days with the studied selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, based on the decision model. Productive and quality-adjusted days were also expected to increase for VXR patients (22.06 vs. 19.34 and 4.56 to 9.36 vs. 3.72 to 7.63), as was the percentage of patients achieving full activity (25.9% vs. 19.6%). The expected cost per patient achieving remission of symptoms was US 1303.94 dollars and US 1514.96 dollars, and the cost per depression-free days was US 25.66 dollars and US 28.25 dollars, for the VXR and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VXR is not only expected to increase the rate of remission of symptoms but is also associated with achievement of full activity, higher number of depression-free days, productive days, and quality-adjusted days.

Primary care providers, including gynecologists, will need to counsel patients regarding this form of preventive care. In this report, we update cost-effectiveness calculations for tamoxifen chemoprevention and establish reasonable parameters for clinicians"" use. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis that compared women aged 50 years who were treated with tamoxifen for 5 years with an untreated cohort. In the base model, we assumed a 3.4% 5-year breast cancer risk. Quality-of-life estimates for important outcomes (breast cancer, endometrial cancer, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, metastatic cancer, and hot flushes) were obtained from 106 women. Probabilities and costs of outcomes were derived from the Breast Cancer Chemoprevention Trial and other published estimates. Broad sensitivity analyses were performed. Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained as a result of tamoxifen breast cancer prevention was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: The use of tamoxifen led to a remaining life expectancy of 26.07 quality-adjusted life-years compared with 25.97 without treatment. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $43,300. Sensitivity analysis revealed that younger age, the absence of the uterus, higher initial risk of breast cancer, increased fear of curable breast cancer, and reduced tamoxifen cost further favored treatment. CONCLUSION: Tamoxifen chemoprevention is cost-effective for women aged 40-50 years who are at significant breast cancer risk. Whether this holds true for older women depends on the initial breast cancer risk, fear of breast cancer, and presence of the uterus.",2004-01-00194,15339751,Obstet Gynecol,Samuel Cykert,2004,104 / 3,433-42,No,15339751,"Samuel Cykert; Nancy Phifer; Charles Hansen; Nancy Phifer; Charles Hansen; Tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention: a framework for clinical decisions, Obstet Gynecol, 2004-Sep; 104(3):0029-7844; 433-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tamoxifen for 5 years vs. No treatment,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,43300,United States,2002,62293.03
2380,Cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies for osteoarthritis of the knee in Taiwan,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3 treatment strategies for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee: naproxen, celecoxib, and hyaluronan. METHODS: We developed a decision model to estimate the costs and effectiveness of 3 treatment strategies: 250 mg naproxen 3 times daily for 26 weeks, 100 mg celecoxib twice daily for 26 weeks, and 25 mg hyaluronan by intraarticular injection once per week for 5 weeks followed by conventional treatment for 21 weeks. The probabilities and utility data were obtained by surveying the literature and consulting experts. Cost data were obtained from insurance reimbursement data of National Taiwan University Hospital and were converted to 2002 US dollars. The timeframe of the decision tree was 26 weeks. Outcomes were expressed in aggregated costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed on most variables. RESULTS: The expected total costs for the naproxen, celecoxib, and hyaluronan strategies were US$498.98, US$547.80, and US$678.00, respectively.

2381,Cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies for osteoarthritis of the knee in Taiwan,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3 treatment strategies for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee: naproxen, celecoxib, and hyaluronan. METHODS: We developed a decision model to estimate the costs and effectiveness of 3 treatment strategies: 250 mg naproxen 3 times daily for 26 weeks, 100 mg celecoxib twice daily for 26 weeks, and 25 mg hyaluronan by intraarticular injection once per week for 5 weeks followed by conventional treatment for 21 weeks. The probabilities and utility data were obtained by surveying the literature and consulting experts. Cost data were obtained from insurance reimbursement data of National Taiwan University Hospital and were converted to 2002 US dollars. The timeframe of the decision tree was 26 weeks. Outcomes were expressed in aggregated costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed on most variables. RESULTS: The expected total costs for the naproxen, celecoxib, and hyaluronan strategies were US$498.98, US$547.80, and US$678.00, respectively. The ICER of the celecoxib strategy compared with the naproxen strategy was US$21,226 per QALY gained. The ICER of the hyaluronan strategy versus the celecoxib strategy was US$42,000 per QALY gained.

2382,"Indirect and total costs of early rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized comparison of combined step-down prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine with sulfasalazine alone","OBJECTIVE: To describe the effect of indirect costs for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) within the COBRA trial (Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis) on the cost-effectiveness of both therapies. Analyses of the efficacy and direct costs of the treatments have already been reported. METHODS: Patients with early RA selected for the 56-week trial were randomly assigned to prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (the COBRA combination) (n = 76, tapered after 28 weeks) or to sulfasalazine (SSZ; n = 79, of which 78 patients were evaluable) alone. The main efficacy outcomes were a pooled index and radiographic damage score in hands and feet, and utilities. Direct and indirect costs were measured (from a societal perspective) by means of cost diaries and interviews completed by patients during the intervention phase and the followup phase, each lasting 28 weeks. Differences in mean costs between groups and cost-utility ratios were evaluated by applying nonparametric bootstrapping techniques. RESULTS: In the first 28 weeks, indirect costs per patient totaled US $2,578 and US $3,638 for COBRA and SSZ therapy, respectively (p = 0.09). The total costs were $5,931 and $7,853, respectively (p < 0.05). These differences were lost in the second 28 weeks. For the total period the mean total costs per patient were $10,262 and $12,788, respectively (p = 0.11). Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of the data. The point estimate of the cost per quality-adjusted life-year based on the rating scale was negative at $-385, suggesting dominance of COBRA (more effect at lower cost). CONCLUSION: COBRA therapy adds additional disease control (improvements in disease activity, physical function, and rate of damage progression) at lower or equal cost compared to SSZ in early RA.",2004-01-00196,15338488,J Rheumatol,Ingeborg Korthals-de Bos,2004,31 / 9,1709-16,No,15338488,"Ingeborg Korthals-de Bos; Maurits Van Tulder; Maarten Boers; Arco C Verhoeven; Herman J Adèr; Jack Bibo; Annelies Boonen; Sjef Van Der Linden; Maurits Van Tulder; Maarten Boers; Arco C Verhoeven; Herman J Adèr; Jack Bibo; Annelies Boonen; Sjef Van Der Linden; Indirect and total costs of early rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized comparison of combined step-down prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine with sulfasalazine alone, J Rheumatol, 2004-Sep; 31(9):0315-162X; 1709-16",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine vs. Standard treatment with sulfasalazine",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,1994,Not Stated
2383,Imaging of carotid arteries in symptomatic patients: cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of noninvasive imaging strategies in patients who have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke and are suspected of having significant carotid artery stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1997 through 2000, 350 patients were included in a multicenter blinded consecutive cohort study. The sensitivities and specificities of duplex ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, and these two examinations combined were estimated by using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the reference standard. The actual costs (from a societal perspective) of performing imaging and endarterectomy were estimated. The survival, quality of life, and costs associated with stroke were based on data reported in the literature. Markov modeling was used to predict long-term outcomes. Subsequently, a decision model was used to calculate costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental costs per QALY gained for 62 examination-treatment strategies. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Duplex US had 88% sensitivity and 76% specificity with use of conventional cutoff criteria. MR angiography had comparable values: 92% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Combined concordant duplex US and MR angiography had superior diagnostic performance: 96% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Duplex US alone was the most efficient strategy. Adding MR angiography led to a marginal increase in QALYs gained but at prohibitive costs (cost-effectiveness ratio > 1 500 000 per QALY gained). Performing DSA owing to discordant duplex US and MR angiographic findings and to confirm duplex US and MR angiographic findings led to extra costs and QALY loss owing to complications. Sensitivity analyses revealed that duplex US as a stand-alone examination remained the preferred strategy while estimates and assumptions were varied across plausible ranges. CONCLUSION: Duplex US performed without additional imaging is cost-effective in the selection of symptomatic patients suitable for endarterectomy. Adding MR angiography increases effectiveness slightly at disproportionately high costs, whereas DSA is inferior because of associated complications.",2004-01-00197,15333770,Radiology,Erik Buskens,2004,233 / 1,101-12,No,15333770,"Erik Buskens; Paul J Nederkoorn; Tineke Buijs-Van Der Woude; Willem P T M Mali; L Jaap Kappelle; Bert C Eikelboom; Yolanda Van Der Graaf; M G Myriam Hunink; Paul J Nederkoorn; Tineke Buijs-Van Der Woude; Willem P T M Mali; L Jaap Kappelle; Bert C Eikelboom; Yolanda Van Der Graaf; M G Myriam Hunink; Imaging of carotid arteries in symptomatic patients: cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies, Radiology, 2004-Oct; 233(1):0033-8419; 101-12",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Duplex ultrasonography vs. Magnetic resonance angiography,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,2683.14,ECU,1998,4781.56
2384,The economics of routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis for pregnant women who are rhesus negative,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the economics of routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis in the prevention of haemolytic disease of the newborn, in support of the NICE appraisals process. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis. SETTING: UK NHS. POPULATION/SAMPLE: Pregnant women who are RhD-negative. METHODS: A model was constructed to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness and cost utility of: (1) offering routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis to all pregnant women who are RhD-negative; (2) offering routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis to RhD-negative primigravidae, compared with conventional management alone. Effectiveness estimates were derived from a meta-analysis of two UK community-based studies. Costs were derived from published sources and NHS product lists. Threshold analysis was conducted to reflect the social value of routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis through incorporating valuations of parental grief and fetal/neonatal loss. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per life year gained and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The cost per life year gained is in the range pound 5,000- pound 15,000. The inclusion of long term neurodevelopmental problems results in a cost utility ranging between pound 11,000 and pound 52,000 per QALY gained. Threshold analysis suggests that if fetal loss, parental grief and subsequent high intervention pregnancy are valued at greater than 9 QALYs, the comprehensive policy would be more attractive than the primigravidae policy, assuming a maximum acceptable threshold of pound 30,000 per QALY.

2385,"What impact would pancreatic beta-cell preservation have on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes? A projection using the CORE Diabetes Model","OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is characterised by progressive failure of pancreatic beta-cell function against a background of insulin resistance. Multifactorial interventions, including intensive glycaemic and blood pressure control, reduce the risk of onset and progression of complications. However, current management of type 2 diabetes focuses on treatment of signs and symptoms of disease instead of targeting underlying causes. A number of newer pharmacological interventions, including thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptides, have shown early promise in preserving pancreatic beta-cell function. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of stabilising beta-cell function on long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to project life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted LE (QALE) and total lifetime complication costs (TC) for a cohort of newly-diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, either with a typical increase of HbA1c over time as observed in the UKPDS, or assuming stabilisation of HbA1c after diagnosis with a hypothetical new treatment, representing beta-cell function stabilisation. Costs due to diabetes-related complications (from a US third-party payer perspective), were discounted at 3% annually. Both non-discounted and discounted (at 3% annually) LE and QALE were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of results. RESULTS: Over a time period of 50 years, in a cohort with no increase of HbA1c over time, LE and QALE were improved by mean (SD) 1.02 (0.36) and 0.96 (0.25) years, and total costs of complications were reduced by 6,377 dollars (2,568) per patient compared to the cohort with a typical increase in HbA1c over time. Results were robust under a wide range of plausible assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: New interventions that stabilise pancreatic betacell function may have an important impact on length and quality of life, and lead to reduced costs of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.",2004-01-00205,15324517,Curr Med Res Opin,Andrew J Palmer,2004,20Suppl1 /,S59-66,No,15324517,"Andrew J Palmer; Stéphane Roze; William J Valentine; Michael E Minshall; Morten Lammert; Alan Oglesby; Clarice Hayes; Giatgen A Spinas; Stéphane Roze; William J Valentine; Michael E Minshall; Morten Lammert; Alan Oglesby; Clarice Hayes; Giatgen A Spinas; What impact would pancreatic beta-cell preservation have on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes?

2386,Comparing the long-term cost-effectiveness of repaglinide plus metformin versus nateglinide plus metformin in type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate glycaemic control: an application of the CORE Diabetes Model in type 2 diabetes,"OBJECTIVES: As an example application of the CORE Diabetes Model in type 2 diabetes, we simulated the cost-effectiveness of repaglinide/metformin combination therapy versus nateglinide/metformin for treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes with an inadequate response to sulphonylurea, metformin, or fixed dose glyburide/metformin. METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate long-term outcomes for a cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with either repaglinide/metformin or nateglinide/metformin. HbA1c changes for each regimen were taken from a comparative study. At the end of the study, changes in HbA1c from baseline were -1.28% points and -0.67% points for repaglinide/metformin and nateglinide/metformin, respectively. Median final doses were 5.0 mg/day for repaglinide, 360 mg/day for nateglinide and 2000 mg/day metformin in each treatment arm. Costs were calculated as the annual costs for drugs plus costs of complications (US Medicare perspective) over a 30-year period. Life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) were calculated. Outcomes and costs were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: With repaglinide/metformin, improved glycaemic control led to projected decreases in complication rates, improvement of LE and QALE by 0.15 and 0.14 years respectively, and total cost savings of 3,662 dollars/person over the 30-year period. Repaglinide/metformin had a 96% probability that the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained would be 20,000 dollars or less, and a 66% probability that repaglinide/metformin would be cost-saving compared to nateglinide/metformin. Sensitivity analyses supported the validity and reliability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: In the health economic context, repaglinide/metformin combination was dominant to nateglinide/metformin.

METHODS: Using data from a variety of sources a Markov model was built to produce estimates of the cost effectiveness (incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental cost per vision year gained) of PDT for two cohorts of patients (one with starting visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 and one at 20/100) with predominantly classic choroidal neovascular disease over a 2 year and 5 year time horizon. A government perspective and a treatment cost only perspective were considered. Probabilistic and one way sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: From the government perspective, over the 2 year period, the expected incremental cost effectiveness ratios range from 286 000 (starting VA 20/100) to 76 000 UK pounds (starting VA 20/40) per QALY gained and from 14 000 (20/100) to 34 000 UK pounds (20/40) per vision year gained. A 5 year perspective yields incremental ratios less than 5000 UK pounds for vision years gained and from 9000 (20/40) to 30 000 UK pounds (20/100) for QALYs gained. Without societal or NHS cost offsets included, the 2 year incremental cost per vision year gained ranges from 20 000 (20/100) to 40 000 UK pounds (20/40), and the 2 year incremental cost per QALY gained ranges from 412 000 (20/100) to 90 000 UK pounds (20/40). The 5 year time frame shows expected costs of 7000 (20/40) to 10 000 UK pounds (20/100) per vision year gained and from 38 000 (20/40) to 69 000 UK pounds (20/100) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: This evaluation suggests that early treatment (that is, treating eyes at less severe stages of disease) with PDT leads to increased efficiency.

2389,The cost-effectiveness of elective Cesarean delivery to prevent hepatitis C transmission in HIV-coinfected women,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the net health consequences, costs, and cost-effectiveness of elective Cesarean delivery (C-section) to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV/HCV-coinfected women with suppressed HIV RNA but detectable HCV RNA. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a probabilistic decision model. METHODS: The model compared two strategies: (i) C-section for all coinfected women with suppressed HIV RNA but detectable HCV RNA; (ii) C-section only when indicated based on fetal status. Outcomes included vertical transmission of HCV, maternal mortality, quality-adjusted life expectancy, delivery and HCV treatment costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Data were obtained from the literature and national databases. Delivery cost data were from a hospital consortium database. Probability distributions were derived from published confidence intervals or estimated ranges, or calculated using reported sample sizes. RESULTS: Elective C-section in coinfected women with suppressed HIV RNA but detectable HCV RNA would avoid 45 vertical HCV transmissions per 1000 deliveries and increase maternal mortality by one death per 100 000 deliveries. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a recommendation for C-section versus current practice was 3900-6100 dollars per quality-adjusted life year for the mother-child pair. Results are sensitive to the efficacy of C-section in preventing transmission, the probability of vaginal delivery without a recommendation, and rates of maternal acceptance of the recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming 2000 births/year among HIV/HCV-coinfected women in the United States, a recommendation for elective C-section in these women could avoid an additional 90 perinatal HCV transmissions per year with a risk of one maternal death in 50 years.",2004-01-00216,15316344,AIDS,Bruce R Schackman,2004,18 / 13,1827-34,No,15316344,"Bruce R Schackman; Kawai Oneda; Sue J Goldie; Kawai Oneda; Sue J Goldie; The cost-effectiveness of elective Cesarean delivery to prevent hepatitis C transmission in HIV-coinfected women, AIDS, 2004-Sep-03; 18(13):0269-9370; 1827-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Elective caesarean delivery with 50% spontaneous HCV clearance assumed vs. Standard care, elective caesarean delivery when indicated based on fetal status",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,6100,United States,2003,8580.15
2390,Special report: cost-effectiveness of left-ventricular assist devices as destination therapy for end-stage heart failure,"Left-ventricular assist devices (LVADs) augment the impaired cardiac pumping ability in patients experiencing end-stage heart failure. The scarcity of donor hearts makes heart transplantation possible for only 2,200 patients per year. Patients with end-stage heart failure who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation are currently managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin, beta blockers, and inotropic agents. These patients may be excluded from heart transplantation because of advanced age (e.g., over 65 years), or other major comorbidities such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or chronic renal failure. LVADs are intended to prolong survival and improve functional status in comparison with medical management. A randomized trial on the use LVADs as permanent implants, or as destination therapy, showed they can increase median survival by 7.4 months, while potentially raising the cost of end-of-life care considerably. The present cost-effectiveness analysis addresses use of LVAD destination therapy, compared with optimal medical management, among patients who are not heart transplant candidates. This analysis takes a societal perspective; however, some elements of this perspective, such as use of indirect costs, were not strictly followed. The baseline cost-effectiveness analysis, using parameter estimates from published sources, showed that use of LVADs leads to an increase in cost of $802,700 to gain one QALY, compared with optimal medical management. Within the range of values used in this analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was fairly stable amid changes in these variables: utility for New York Heart Association (NYHA) category III/IV; utility discount rate; cost of outpatient care; and cost discount rate, cost of rehospitalization, and probability of rehospitalization for LVAD; and probability of rehospitalization for optimal medical management. Results were more sensitive to variations in utility for NYHA category I/II and the cost of LVAD implantation. ICERs of $500,000/QALY or less depended on improbable assumptions of very low costs for LVAD implantation, usually in combination with extreme values on other variables. Although utilities from a general population would be preferred, the estimates used here from LVAD recipients suffice, given the wide range of values surrounding them in the sensitivity analysis.

2391,Cost-effectiveness of combination peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin compared with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Sustained virological response (SVR) is the primary objective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Results from a recent clinical trial of patients with previously untreated CHC demonstrate that the combination of peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin produces a greater SVR than interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin combination therapy. However, the cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin in the U.S. setting has not been investigated. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate cost-effectiveness in patients with CHC using genotype to guide treatment duration. SVR and disease progression parameters were derived from the clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. The impact of treatment on life expectancy and costs were projected for a lifetime. Patients who had an SVR were assumed to remain virus-free for the rest of their lives. In genotype 1 patients, the SVRs were 46% for peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin and 36% for interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin. In genotype 2/3 patients, the SVRs were 76% for peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin and 61% for interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Quality of life and costs were based on estimates from the literature. All costs were based on published U.S. medical care costs and were adjusted to 2003 U.S. dollars. Costs and benefits beyond the first year were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: In genotype 1, peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin increases quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) by 0.70 yr compared to interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin, producing a cost-effectiveness ratio of $2,600 per QALY gained. In genotype 2/3 patients, peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin increases QALY by 1.05 yr in comparison to interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Peginterferon alpha-2a combination therapy in patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 is dominant (more effective and cost saving) compared to interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Results weighted by genotype prevalence (75% genotype 1; 25% genotype 2 or 3) also show that peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin is dominant. Peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin remained cost-effective (below $16,500 per QALY gained) under sensitivity analyses on key clinical and cost parameters.

2393,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A-B vaccine versus hepatitis B vaccine for healthcare and public safety workers in the western United States,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of substituting hepatitis A-B vaccine for hepatitis B vaccine when healthcare and public safety workers in the western United States are immunized to protect against occupational exposures to hepatitis B. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 100,000 hypothetical healthcare and public safety workers from 11 western states with hepatitis A rates twice the national average. DESIGN: A Markov model of hepatitis A was developed using estimates from U.S. government databases, published literature, and an expert panel. Added costs of hepatitis A-B vaccine were compared with savings from reduced hepatitis A treatment and work loss. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the ratio of net costs to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Substituting hepatitis A-B vaccine would prevent 29,796 work-loss-days, 222 hospitalizations, 6 premature deaths, and the loss of 214 QALYs. Added vaccination costs of $5.4 million would be more than offset by $1.9 million and $6.1 million reductions in hepatitis A treatment and work loss costs, respectively. Cost-effectiveness improves as the time horizon is extended, from $232,600 per QALY after 1 year to less than $0 per QALY within 11 years. Estimates are most sensitive to community-wide hepatitis A rates and the degree to which childhood vaccination may reduce future rates.

2395,Criteria of candidacy for unilateral cochlear implantation in postlingually deafened adults II: cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to estimate the cost-effectiveness of unilateral cochlear implantation for postlingually deafened adults; to study the impact on cost-effectiveness of relaxing criteria of candidacy to include patients who benefit from acoustic hearing aids; and to study the further impact of age at implantation and duration of profound deafness before implantation. DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was carried out in 13 hospitals with four groups of severely to profoundly hearing-impaired subjects distinguished by their preoperative ability to identify words in prerecorded sentences when aided acoustically. The groups represent a progressive relaxation of criteria of candidacy: Group I (N=134) scored 0% correct without lipreading and did not improve their lipreading score significantly when aided; group II (N=93) scored 0% without lipreading but did improve their lipreading score significantly when aided; group III (N=53) scored 0% without lipreading when the ear to be given an implant was aided but between 1% and approximately 50% when the other ear was aided; and group IV (N=31) scored between 1% and approximately 50% without lipreading when the ear to be given an implant was aided. Lifetime costs to the UK National Health Service of providing and maintaining a cochlear implant were estimated for each subject. The gain in health utility from cochlear implantation was estimated with the Mark III Health Utilities Index and was combined with life expectancy to estimate the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) that would be gained from cochlear implantation. Cost/QALY ratios were calculated by means of the Net Benefit technique and were compared with an upper limit of acceptability of 50,000 euros/QALY. RESULTS: Averaged over the whole cohort, the cost of gaining a QALY was 27,142 euros (95% confidence interval, 24,532 euros to 30,323 euros); 203 of 311 (67%) of the cohort displayed cost/QALY ratios more favorable than 50,000 euros/QALY. The average cost of gaining a QALY increased from group I (24,032 euros) to groups II (27,062 euros) and IV (27,092 euros) to group III (39,009 euros). Cost/QALY varied with age at implantation from 19,223 euros for subjects who were younger than 30 yr of age to 45,411 euros for subjects who were older than 70 yr of age. Cost/QALY was unacceptable because of minimal gain in health utility for the subset of groups I and II, who were given implants in ears that had been profoundly deaf for more then 40 yr and for the subset of groups III and IV, who were given implants in ears that had been profoundly deaf for more than 30 yr. CONCLUSIONS: Cochlear implantation was a cost-effective intervention for the majority of subjects, including the group given implants when older than 70 yr of age.

2399,Optimal follow-up strategies after aorto-iliac prosthetic reconstruction: a decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of ultrasound follow-up after aorto-iliac prosthetic reconstruction is to correct false aneurysms before rupture occurs. We investigated whether follow-up improves the life expectancy of patients and sought to identify the most cost-effective follow-up strategy. DESIGN OF THE STUDY: A Monte Carlo Markov decision model was constructed. The occurrence of false aneurysms was modelled as a time-dependent process for each anastomotic site, based on published series. Using this model, the impact of various follow-up strategies was investigated for three types of prostheses, aorto-distal tube, aorto-bi-iliac, and aorto-bi-femoral prostheses. Main outcome measures were discounted quality adjusted life years (dQALYs), discounted costs, and (discounted) cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios. RESULTS: Follow-up of patients with aorto-distal tube and aorto-bifemoral prostheses did not result in an improvement life expectancy and was not cost-effective, QALYs 7.53 and 7.62 years, respectively. The results for aorto-distal tube and aorto-bifemoral prostheses were not sensitive to any variation in the model parameters. In the base case analysis, the life expectancy of patients with aorto-bi-iliac prostheses was 7.50 QALYs (95% confidence interval 7.46-7.54) whether or not they underwent routine follow-up. However, patients aged 54 years or younger gained 0.11 QALYs with annual follow-up (p<0.05). The most cost-effective strategy was annual follow-up that starts 10 years after the initial operation, and continues up to 30 years after surgery (4600 Euro; CE ratio 21,000 Euro per QALY). When perioperative mortality of elective reconstruction of false aneurysms is 2% or lower (e.g. when endovascular treatment is used), a small improvement is observed (7.56 vs. 7.50 QALYs; p<0.05; CE ratio 35,000 Euro per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Annual follow-up of aorto-bi-iliac prostheses should be restricted to patients aged 54 or younger and not start before 10 years after surgery.

2400,Optimal follow-up strategies after aorto-iliac prosthetic reconstruction: a decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of ultrasound follow-up after aorto-iliac prosthetic reconstruction is to correct false aneurysms before rupture occurs. We investigated whether follow-up improves the life expectancy of patients and sought to identify the most cost-effective follow-up strategy. DESIGN OF THE STUDY: A Monte Carlo Markov decision model was constructed. The occurrence of false aneurysms was modelled as a time-dependent process for each anastomotic site, based on published series. Using this model, the impact of various follow-up strategies was investigated for three types of prostheses, aorto-distal tube, aorto-bi-iliac, and aorto-bi-femoral prostheses. Main outcome measures were discounted quality adjusted life years (dQALYs), discounted costs, and (discounted) cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios. RESULTS: Follow-up of patients with aorto-distal tube and aorto-bifemoral prostheses did not result in an improvement life expectancy and was not cost-effective, QALYs 7.53 and 7.62 years, respectively. The results for aorto-distal tube and aorto-bifemoral prostheses were not sensitive to any variation in the model parameters. In the base case analysis, the life expectancy of patients with aorto-bi-iliac prostheses was 7.50 QALYs (95% confidence interval 7.46-7.54) whether or not they underwent routine follow-up. However, patients aged 54 years or younger gained 0.11 QALYs with annual follow-up (p<0.05). The most cost-effective strategy was annual follow-up that starts 10 years after the initial operation, and continues up to 30 years after surgery (4600 Euro; CE ratio 21,000 Euro per QALY). When perioperative mortality of elective reconstruction of false aneurysms is 2% or lower (e.g. when endovascular treatment is used), a small improvement is observed (7.56 vs. 7.50 QALYs; p<0.05; CE ratio 35,000 Euro per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Annual follow-up of aorto-bi-iliac prostheses should be restricted to patients aged 54 or younger and not start before 10 years after surgery. The same strategy can only be considered for older patients if mortality for secondary intervention is lower than 2%.
