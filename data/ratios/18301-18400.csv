18301,Cost-effectiveness of intraoperative nerve monitoring in avoidance of bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) provides dynamic neural information and is recommended for high-risk thyroid surgery. In this analysis, the cost-effectiveness of IONM in preventing bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury was investigated. METHODS: A Markov chain model was constructed based on IONM use. The base-case patient was defined as a 40-year-old woman presenting with a 4.1-cm left-sided papillary thyroid cancer who developed RLN injury with loss of monitoring signal during planned bilateral thyroidectomy. It was hypothesized that, if the surgeon had used IONM, the RLN injury would have been detected and the operation would have been concluded as a thyroid lobectomy to avoid the risk of contralateral RLN injury. Cost in US dollars was converted to euros; probabilities and utility scores were identified from the literature and government resources. Length of follow-up was set as 20 years, and willingness-to-pay (WTP) as euro38 000 (US $50 000) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: At the end of year 20, the not using IONM strategy accrued euro163 995.40 (US $215 783.43) and an effectiveness of 14.15 QALYs, whereas use of the IONM strategy accrued euro170 283.68 (US $224 057.48) and an effectiveness of 14.33 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing use versus no use of IONM, was euro35 285.26 (US $46 427.97) per QALY, which is below the proposed WTP, indicating that IONM is the preferred and cost-effective management plan. A Monte Carlo simulation test that considered variability of the main study factors in a hypothetical sample of 10 000 patients showed IONM to be the preferred strategy in 85.8 per cent of the population.

18303,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ocrelizumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis,"AIM: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare ocrelizumab vs subcutaneous (SC) interferon beta-1a for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). METHODS: A Markov cohort model with a 20-year horizon was developed to compare ocrelizumab with SC interferon beta-1a from a US payer perspective. A cohort of patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 0-6, who initiated treatment with ocrelizumab or SC interferon beta-1a, were entered into the model. The model considered 21 health states: EDSS 0-9 in RRMS, EDSS 0-9 in secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), and death. Patients with RRMS could transition across EDSS scores, progress to SPMS, experience relapses, or die. Transition probabilities within RRMS while patients received ocrelizumab or SC interferon beta-1a were based on data from the two SC interferon beta-1a-controlled Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials of ocrelizumab in RMS. Transitions within RRMS when off-treatment, RRMS-to-SPMS transitions, transitions within SPMS, and transitions to death were based on the literature. Utilities of health states, disutilities of relapses, costs of therapies, and medical costs associated with health states, relapse, and adverse events were from the literature and publicly available data sources. The model estimated per-patient total costs, incremental cost per life year (LY) gained, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained. Deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: Ocrelizumab was associated with a cost savings of $63,822 and longer LYs (Delta = 0.046) and QALYs (Delta = 0.556) over a 20-year time horizon. The results of the model were robust in the DSA and PSA. LIMITATIONS: The model did not consider subsequent treatments and their impact on disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ocrelizumab is more cost-effective than SC interferon beta-1a for the treatment of RMS.",2017-01-25133,28703659,J Med Econ,Hongbo Yang,2017,20 / 10,1056-1065,Yes,28703659,"Hongbo Yang; Emilie Duchesneau; Rebekah Foster; Annie Guerin; Esprit Ma; Nina P Thomas; Cost-effectiveness analysis of ocrelizumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis, J Med Econ, 2017 Oct; 20(10):1369-6998; 1056-1065",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ocrelizumab vs. Subcutaneous interferon beta-1a,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-114787.77,United States,2016,-123781.13
18304,Overall effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: An economic analysis of PHiD-CV and PCV-13 in the immunization of infants in Italy,"Pneumococcal diseases are associated with a significant clinical and economic burden. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) has been used for the immunization of newborns against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in Italy while now, the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) are available. The aim of this analysis was to compare the estimated health benefits, cost and cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies vs. non-vaccination in Italy using the concept of overall vaccine effectiveness. A published Markov model was adapted using local data wherever available to compare the impact of neonatal pneumococcal vaccination on epidemiological and economic burden of invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal diseases, within a cohort of newborns from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective. A 18-year and a 5-year time horizon were considered for the base-case and scenario analysis, respectively. PHiD-CV and PCV-13 are associated with the most important reduction of the clinical burden, with a potential marginal advantage of PHiD-CV over PCV-13. Compared with no vaccination, PHiD-CV is found on the higher limit of the usually indicated willingness to pay range (30,000 - 50,000euro/quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained), while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PCV-13 is slightly above. Compared with PCV-13, PHiD-CV would provide better health outcomes and reduce costs even at parity price, solely due to its differential effect on the incidence of NTHi acute otitis media (AOM).

Model parameters were obtained from the Genetic Cancer Prediction through Population Screening trial and published literature. Model parameters and BRCA population prevalence for individuals with 3, 2, or 1 Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparent were adjusted for the relative frequency of BRCA mutations in the Ashkenazi-Jewish and general populations.

RESULTS: Population testing for BRCA mutations is cost-saving in Ashkenazi-Jewish women with 2, 3, or 4 grandparents (22-33 days life-gained) in the United Kingdom and 1, 2, 3, or 4 grandparents (12-26 days life-gained) in the United States populations, respectively.

18315,Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke,"BACKGROUND: Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines. METHODS: We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden). CONCLUSIONS: At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women.

18318,The cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation for patients with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder,"BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder with a 2% to 3% lifetime prevalence; in addition, 10% of OCD patients are resistant to conventional therapy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been an effective treatment for treatment resistant OCD patients (TROCD). We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of DBS for TROCD. METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DBS compared to conventional treatment for TROCD with a 10-year time horizon. Published data were used to estimate the rates of treatment response and complications. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the third-party payer. Data on quality of life were obtained from a literature review and a survey of OCD patients. We applied the model separately to Korea and the United Kingdom (UK) to enhance the validity. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$37,865 per quality-adjusted life-year in Korea and US$34,462 per quality-adjusted life-year in the UK. According to the World Health Organization''s criteria, DBS for TROCD was ""cost-effective"" in Korea (<3x GDP per capita) and ""highly cost-effective"" in the UK (<GDP per capita). One-way sensitivity analysis showed consistent cost-effectiveness results for most variables with the exception of short-term duration of treatment effect (<4 years in Korea; <3 years in the UK).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of currently approved anti-coagulant options, in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, for the prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with unprovoked events managed on an outpatient basis. METHODS: Microsoft Excel was used to develop a Markov model. Model parameters were determined using published literature, local hospital data, expert opinion, and chart review. The analysis considered the costs associated with pharmaceuticals, laboratory testing, hematologist fees, and treatment of recurrent VTE and major bleeding events. Effectiveness was measured in terms of QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: For treatment lasting 3 months, apixaban represented the most cost-effective DOAC relative to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) + vitamin K antagonist, with an ICER of $7379.66. For 6 months of treatment, apixaban again represented the most cost-effective treatment, with an ICER of $84.08 per QALY gained, and this drug dominated all the other strategies at 12 months. For lifetime treatment, DOACs were unlikely to be cost-effective, given a maximum willingness to pay of $50 000 to $100 000 per QALY. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis at 6 months, 46.4% of iterations resulted in apixaban having lower costs and better outcomes than LMWH + vitamin K antagonist, and 78.6% of iterations resulted in an ICER below $100 000. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that apixaban is likely cost-effective for treatment durations of 3, 6, and 12 months.

18323,Percutaneous laser disc decompression versus microdiscectomy for sciatica: Cost utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial,"Background Percutaneous laser disc decompression (PLDD) for patients with lumbar disc herniation is believed to be cheaper than surgery. However, cost-effectiveness has never been studied. Materials and Methods A cost utility analysis was performed alongside a randomized controlled trial comparing PLDD and conventional surgery. Patients reported their quality of life using the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D), 36-item short form health survey (SF-36 and derived SF-6D) and a visual analogue scale (VAS). Using cost diaries patients reported health care use, non-health care use and hours of absenteeism from work. The 1-year societal costs were compared with 1-year quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the United States (US) EQ-5D. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on the use of different utility measures (Netherland (NL) EQ-5D, SF-6D, or VAS) and on the perspective (societal or healthcare). Results On the US EQ-5D, conventional surgery provided a non-significant gain in QALYs of 0.033 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.026 to 0.093) in the first year. PLDD resulted in significantly lower healthcare costs (difference euro1771, 95% CI euro303 to euro3238) and non-significantly lower societal costs (difference euro2379, 95% CI -euro2860 to euro7618). For low values of the willingness to pay for a QALY, the probability of being cost-effective is in favor of PLDD. For higher values of the willingness to pay, between euro30,000 and euro70,000, conventional microdiscectomy becomes favorable. Conclusions From a healthcare perspective PLDD, followed by surgery when needed, results in significantly lower 1-year costs than conventional surgery. From a societal perspective PLDD appears to be an economically neutral innovation.",2017-01-25180,28679342,Interv Neuroradiol,M Elske van den Akker-van Marle,2017,23 / 5,538-545,No,28679342,"M Elske van den Akker-van Marle; Patrick A Brouwer; Ronald Brand; Bart Koes; Wilbert B van den Hout; Mark A van Buchem; Wilco C Peul; Percutaneous laser disc decompression versus microdiscectomy for sciatica: Cost utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial, Interv Neuroradiol, 2017 Oct; 23(5):2385-2011; 538-545",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Percutaneous laser disc decompression vs. Standard/Usual Care- Microdiscectomy,Not Stated,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,72121.21,Euro,2010,113287.24
18324,"Lower limb arthroplasty: can we produce a tool to predict outcome and failure, and is it cost-effective? An epidemiological study","Although hip and knee arthroplasties are considered to be common elective cost-effective operations, up to one-quarter of patients are not satisfied with the operation. A number of risk factors for implant failure are known, but little is known about the predictors of patient-reported outcomes. (1) Describe current and future needs for lower limb arthroplasties in the UK; (2) describe important risk factors for poor surgery outcomes and combine them to produce predictive tools (for hip and knee separately) for poor outcomes; (3) produce a Markov model to enable a detailed health economic analysis of hip/knee arthroplasty, and for implementing the predictive tool; and (4) test the practicality of the prediction tools in a pragmatic prospective cohort of lower limb arthroplasty. The programme was arranged into four work packages. The first three work packages used the data from large existing data sets such as Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and the National Joint Registry. Work package 4 established a pragmatic cohort of lower limb arthroplasty to test the practicality of the predictive tools developed within the programme. The estimated number of total knee replacements (TKRs) and total hip replacements (THRs) performed in the UK in 2015 was 85,019 and 72,418, respectively. Between 1991 and 2006, the estimated age-standardised rates (per 100,000 person-years) for a THR increased from 60.3 to 144.6 for women and from 35.8 to 88.6 for men. The rates for TKR increased from 42.5 to 138.7 for women and from 28.7 to 99.4 for men. The strongest predictors for poor outcomes were preoperative pain/function scores, deprivation, age, mental health score and radiographic variable pattern of joint space narrowing. We found a weak association between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes; however, increased BMI did increase the risk of revision surgery (a 5-kg/m2 rise in BMI increased THR revision risk by 10.4% and TKR revision risk by 7.7%). We also confirmed that osteoarthritis (OA) severity and migration pattern of the hip predicted patient-reported outcome measures. The hip predictive tool that we developed performed well, with a corrected R2 of 23.1% and had good calibration, with only slight overestimation of Oxford Hip Score in the lowest decile of outcome. The knee tool developed performed less well, with a corrected R2 of 20.2%; however, it had good calibration. The analysis was restricted by the relatively limited number of variables available in the extant data sets, something that could be addressed in future studies. We found that the use of bisphosphonates reduced the risk of revision knee and hip surgery by 46%. Hormone replacement therapy reduced the risk by 38%, if used for at least 6 months postoperatively. We found that an increased risk of postoperative fracture was prevented by bisphosphonate use. This result, being observational in nature, will require confirmation in a randomised controlled trial. The Markov model distinguished between outcome categories following primary and revision procedures. The resulting outcome prediction tool for THR and TKR reduced the number and proportion of unsatisfactory outcomes after the operation, saving NHS resources in the process. The highest savings per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) forgone were reported from the oldest patient subgroups (men and women aged >/= 80 years), with a reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of around pound1200 saved per QALY forgone for THRs. In the prospective cohort of arthroplasty, the performance of the knee model was modest (R2 = 0.14) and that of the hip model poor (R2 = 0.04). However, the addition of the radiographic OA variable improved the performance of the hip model (R2 = 0.125 vs. 0.110) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein improved the performance of the knee model (R2 = 0.230 vs. 0.216). These data will ideally need replication in an external cohort of a similar design. The data are not necessarily applicable to other health systems or countries. The number of total hip and knee replacements will increase in the next decade. High BMI, although clinically insignificant, is associated with an increased risk of revision surgery and postoperative complications. Preoperative pain/function, the pattern of joint space narrowing, deprivation index and level of education were found to be the strongest predictors for THR. Bisphosphonates and hormone therapy proved to be beneficial for patients undergoing lower limb replacement. The addition of new predictors collected from the prospective cohort of arthroplasty slightly improved the performance of the predictive tools, suggesting that the potential improvements in both tools can be achieved using the plethora of extra variables from the validation cohort. Although currently it would not be cost-effective to implement the predictive tools in a health-care setting, we feel that the addition of extensive risk factors will improve the performances of the predictive tools as well as the Markov model, and will prove to be beneficial in terms of cost-effectiveness. Future analyses are under way and awaiting more promising provisional results. Further research should focus on defining and predicting the most important outcome to the patient.

The knee tool developed performed less well, with a corrected R2 of 20.2%; however, it had good calibration. The analysis was restricted by the relatively limited number of variables available in the extant data sets, something that could be addressed in future studies. We found that the use of bisphosphonates reduced the risk of revision knee and hip surgery by 46%. Hormone replacement therapy reduced the risk by 38%, if used for at least 6 months postoperatively. We found that an increased risk of postoperative fracture was prevented by bisphosphonate use. This result, being observational in nature, will require confirmation in a randomised controlled trial. The Markov model distinguished between outcome categories following primary and revision procedures. The resulting outcome prediction tool for THR and TKR reduced the number and proportion of unsatisfactory outcomes after the operation, saving NHS resources in the process. The highest savings per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) forgone were reported from the oldest patient subgroups (men and women aged >/= 80 years), with a reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of around pound1200 saved per QALY forgone for THRs. In the prospective cohort of arthroplasty, the performance of the knee model was modest (R2 = 0.14) and that of the hip model poor (R2 = 0.04). However, the addition of the radiographic OA variable improved the performance of the hip model (R2 = 0.125 vs. 0.110) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein improved the performance of the knee model (R2 = 0.230 vs. 0.216). These data will ideally need replication in an external cohort of a similar design. The data are not necessarily applicable to other health systems or countries. The number of total hip and knee replacements will increase in the next decade. High BMI, although clinically insignificant, is associated with an increased risk of revision surgery and postoperative complications. Preoperative pain/function, the pattern of joint space narrowing, deprivation index and level of education were found to be the strongest predictors for THR. Bisphosphonates and hormone therapy proved to be beneficial for patients undergoing lower limb replacement. The addition of new predictors collected from the prospective cohort of arthroplasty slightly improved the performance of the predictive tools, suggesting that the potential improvements in both tools can be achieved using the plethora of extra variables from the validation cohort. Although currently it would not be cost-effective to implement the predictive tools in a health-care setting, we feel that the addition of extensive risk factors will improve the performances of the predictive tools as well as the Markov model, and will prove to be beneficial in terms of cost-effectiveness. Future analyses are under way and awaiting more promising provisional results. Further research should focus on defining and predicting the most important outcome to the patient.

18328,The cost-utility of sodium oxybate as narcolepsy treatment,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Based on class-I studies, sodium oxybate is regarded as a first-line treatment for both EDS and cataplexy. The cost-effectiveness of sodium oxybate is largely unknown, though. In this study, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of sodium oxybate as treatment for patients with narcolepsy as compared to standard treatment, by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per quality-adjusted life year, QALY) for patients in a Swedish setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calculations were performed using a Markov model with a 10-year time horizon. The study population consisted of adult patients treated for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Healthcare utilization and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each treatment alternative were calculated assuming no treatment effect on survival. Sensitivity analyses were performed for treatment effectiveness and healthcare cost parameters. RESULTS: The cost per additional quality-adjusted life year was estimated at SEK 563,481. The cost-effectiveness measure was demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to the duration of the relative quality-of-life improvements accruing to patients treated with sodium oxybate. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated cost per additional QALY for the sodium oxybate treatment alternative compared with standard treatment was estimated above the informal Swedish willingness-to-pay threshold (SEK 500,000). The estimated cost per additional QALY obtained here is likely to overestimate the true cost-effectiveness ratio as potentially beneficial effects on productivity of treatment with sodium oxybate were not included (due to lack of data).",2017-01-25186,28677318,Acta Neurol Scand,K Bolin,2017,136 / 6,715-720,No,28677318,"K Bolin; P Berling; P Wasling; H Meinild; J Kjellberg; P Jennum; The cost-utility of sodium oxybate as narcolepsy treatment, Acta Neurol Scand, 2017 Dec; 136(6):1600-0404; 715-720",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sodium oxybate/venlafaxin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Methylphenidate/Venlafaxine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,563481,Sweden,2016,71141.75
18329,Cost-effectiveness analysis of additional bevacizumab to pemetrexed plus cisplatin for malignant pleural mesothelioma based on the MAPS trial,"PURPOSE: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy, and pemetrexed/cisplatin (PC) is the gold standard first-line regime. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the addition of bevacizumab to PC (with maintenance bevacizumab) for unresectable MPM based on a phase III trial that showed a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. METHODS: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the incorporation of bevacizumab, a Markov model based on the MAPS trial, including the disease states of progression-free survival, progressive disease and death, was used. Total costs were calculated from a Chinese payer perspective, and health outcomes were converted into quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Model robustness was explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The addition of bevacizumab to PC was estimated to increase the cost by $81446.69, with a gain of 0.112 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $727202.589 per QALY. In both one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the ICER exceeded the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times the gross domestic product per capita of China ($23970.00 per QALY). The cost of bevacizumab had the most important impact on the ICER. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bevacizumab with PC chemotherapy is not a cost-effective treatment option for MPM in China. Given its positive clinical value and extremely low incidence of MPM, an appropriate price discount, assistance programs and medical insurance should be considered to make bevacizumab more affordable for this rare patient population.",2017-01-25187,28676211,Lung Cancer,Mei Zhan,2017,110 /,1-6,No,28676211,"Mei Zhan; Hanrui Zheng; Ting Xu; Yu Yang; Qiu Li; Cost-effectiveness analysis of additional bevacizumab to pemetrexed plus cisplatin for malignant pleural mesothelioma based on the MAPS trial, Lung Cancer, 2017 Aug; 110():0169-5002; 1-6",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pemetrexed/cisplatin plus bevacizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Pemetrexed/cisplatin,Naive to chemotherapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,727202.59,United States,2016,784177.25
18330,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fulvestrant versus anastrozole as first-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer,"Although recent studies demonstrated that fulvestrant is superior to anastrozole as first-line treatment for hormone receptor (HR)-positive advanced breast cancer, the cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant versus anastrozole remained uncertain. Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant compared with anastrozole in the first-line setting. A Markov model consisting of three health states (stable, progressive and dead) was constructed to simulate a hypothetical cohort of patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer. Costs were calculated from a Chinese societal perspective. Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was expressed as incremental cost per QALY gained. Model results suggested that fulvestrant provides an additional effectiveness gain of 0.11 QALYs at an incremental cost of $32,654 compared with anastrozole, resulting in an ICER of $296,855/QALY exceeding the willingness-to-pay threshold of $23,700/QALY.

18331,The 5-year cost-effectiveness of two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or cervical disc replacement: a Markov analysis,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and cervical disc replacement (CDR) are both acceptable surgical options for the treatment of cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy. To date, there are limited economic analyses assessing the relative cost-effectiveness of two-level ACDF versus CDR. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the 5-year cost-effectiveness of two-level ACDF versus CDR. STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients in the Prestige cervical disc investigational device exemption (IDE) study who underwent either a two-level CDR or a two-level ACDF were included in the study. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was used to evaluate data from the two-level Prestige cervical disc IDE study. Data from the 36-item Short Form Health Survey were converted into utilities using the short form (SF)-6D algorithm. Costs were calculated from the payer perspective. QALYs were used to represent effectiveness. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed using a Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: The base-case analysis, assuming a 40-year-old person who failed appropriate conservative care, generated a 5-year cost of $130,417 for CDR and $116,717 for ACDF. Cervical disc replacement and ACDF generated 3.45 and 3.23 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to be $62,337/QALY for CDR. The Monte Carlo simulation validated the base-case scenario. Cervical disc replacement had an average cost of $130,445 (confidence interval [CI]: $108,395-$152,761) with an average effectiveness of 3.46 (CI: 3.05-3.83). Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion had an average cost of $116,595 (CI: $95,439-$137,937) and an average effectiveness of 3.23 (CI: 2.84-3.59). The ICER was calculated at $62,133/QALY with respect to CDR. Using a $100,000/QALY willingness to pay (WTP), CDR is the more cost-effective strategy and would be selected 61.5% of the time by the simulation. CONCLUSIONS: Two-level CDR and ACDF are both cost-effective strategies at 5 years. Neither strategy was found to be more cost-effective with an ICER greater than the $50,000/QALY WTP threshold.

18332,Improving pregnancy outcome in obese women: the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity randomised controlled Trial,"Obesity in pregnancy is associated with insulin resistance, which underpins many common complications including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and fetal macrosomia. To assess the effect of a complex behavioural intervention based on diet and physical activity (PA) on the risk of GDM and delivery of a large-for-gestational age (LGA) infant. Three phases: (1) the development phase, (2) the pilot study and (3) a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a behavioural intervention to improve glycaemic control with standard antenatal care in obese pregnant women. A cost-utility analysis was undertaken to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the health training (intervention) over and above standard care (control). Pilot study: antenatal clinics in four inner-city UK hospitals. RCT: eight antenatal clinics in eight UK inner-city hospitals. Women were eligible for inclusion if they had a body mass index of >/= 30 kg/m2, were pregnant with a single fetus and at 15+0 to 18+6 weeks'' gestation, were able to give written informed consent and were without predefined disorders. The intervention comprised an initial session with a health trainer, followed by eight weekly sessions. Dietary advice recommended foods with a low dietary glycaemic index, avoidance of sugar-sweetened beverages and reduced saturated fats. Women were encouraged to increase daily PA. Development phase: intervention development, acceptability and optimal approach for delivery. Pilot study: change in dietary and PA behaviours at 28 weeks'' gestation. RCT: the primary outcome of the RCT was, for the mother, GDM [as measured by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)''s diagnostic criteria] and, for the infant, LGA delivery (i.e. customised birthweight >/= 90th centile for gestational age). Development phase: following a literature meta-analysis, a study of dietary intention questionnaires and semistructured interviews, an intervention based on behavioural science was developed that incorporated optimal and acceptable methods for delivery. Pilot study: the pilot study demonstrated improvement in dietary behaviours in the intervention compared with the standard care arm but no increase in objectively measured PA. Process evaluation demonstrated feasibility and general acceptability. RCT: the RCT showed no effect of the intervention on GDM in obese pregnant women or the number of deliveries of LGA infants. There was a reduction in dietary glycaemic load (GL) and reduced saturated fat intake, an increase in PA and a modest reduction in gestational weight gain, all secondary outcomes. Lower than expected was the number of LGA infant deliveries in all women, which suggested that universal screening for GDM with IADPSG''s diagnostic criteria, and subsequent treatment, may reduce the number of deliveries of LGA infants. According to the cost-utility analysis, the estimated probability that the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT) behavioural intervention is cost-effective at the pound30,000/quality-adjusted life-year willingness-to-pay threshold was 1%. Included the high refusal rate for participation and self-reported assessment of diet and PA. The UPBEAT intervention, an intense theoretically based intervention in obese pregnant women, did not reduce the risk of GDM in women or the number of LGA infant deliveries, despite successfully reducing the dietary GL. Based on total cost to the NHS provider and health gains, the UPBEAT intervention provided no supporting evidence to suggest that the intervention represents value for money based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. Alternative strategies for reducing the risk of GDM in obese pregnant women and the number of LGA infant deliveries should be considered, including development of clinically effective interventions to prevent obesity in women of reproductive age, of clinically effective interventions to reduce weight retention following pregnancy and of risk stratification tools in early pregnancy.

18333,Cost-utility analysis comparing laparoscopic vs open aortobifemoral bypass surgery,"OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass has become an established treatment option for symptomatic aortoiliac obstructive disease at dedicated centers. Minimally invasive surgical techniques like laparoscopic surgery have often been shown to reduce expenses and increase patients'' health-related quality of life. The main objective of our study was to measure quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs after totally laparoscopic and open aortobifemoral bypass. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a within trial analysis in a larger ongoing randomized controlled prospective multicenter trial, Norwegian Laparoscopic Aortic Surgery Trial. Fifty consecutive patients suffering from symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease suitable for aortobifemoral bypass surgery were randomized to either totally laparoscopic (n=25) or open surgical procedure (n=25). One patient dropped out of the study before surgery. We measured health-related quality of life using the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire at 4 different time points, before surgery and for 6 months during follow-up. We calculated the QALYs gained by using the area under the curve for both groups. Costs were calculated based on prices for surgical equipment, vascular prosthesis and hospital stay. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher increase in QALYs after laparoscopic vs open aortobifemoral bypass surgery, with a difference of 0.07 QALYs, (p=0.001) in favor of laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass. The total cost of surgery, equipment and hospital stay after laparoscopic surgery (9,953 euro) was less than open surgery (17,260 euro), (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass seems to be cost-effective compared with open surgery, due to an increase in QALYs and lower procedure-related costs.",2017-01-25200,28670132,Vasc Health Risk Manag,Anne Helene Krog,2017,13 /,217-224,No,28670132,"Anne Helene Krog; Mehdi Sahba; Erik M Pettersen; Torbjorn Wisloff; Jon O Sundhagen; Syed Sh Kazmi; Cost-utility analysis comparing laparoscopic vs open aortobifemoral bypass surgery, Vasc Health Risk Manag, 2017; 13():1178-2048; 217-224",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass (LABF) vs. Open aortobifemoral bypass surgery (OABF),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-104385.71,Euro,2014,-151741.24
18334,Nerve transfer versus muscle transfer to restore elbow flexion after pan-brachial plexus injury: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE Pan-brachial plexus injury (PBPI), involving C5-T1, disproportionately affects young males, causing lifelong disability and decreased quality of life. The restoration of elbow flexion remains a surgical priority for these patients. Within the first 6 months of injury, transfer of spinal accessory nerve (SAN) fascicles via a sural nerve graft or intercostal nerve (ICN) fascicles to the musculocutaneous nerve can restore elbow flexion. Beyond 1 year, free-functioning muscle transplantation (FFMT) of the gracilis muscle can be used to restore elbow flexion. The authors present the first cost-effectiveness model to directly compare the different treatment strategies available to a patient with PBPI. This model assesses the quality of life impact, surgical costs, and possible income recovered through restoration of elbow flexion. METHODS A Markov model was constructed to simulate a 25-year-old man with PBPI without signs of recovery 4.5 months after injury. The management options available to the patient were SAN transfer, ICN transfer, delayed FFMT, or no treatment. Probabilities of surgical success rates, quality of life measurements, and disability were derived from the published literature. Cost-effectiveness was defined using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) defined by the ratio between costs of a treatment strategy and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. A strategy was considered cost-effective if it yielded an ICER less than a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to address parameter uncertainty. RESULTS The base case model demonstrated a lifetime QALYs of 22.45 in the SAN group, 22.0 in the ICN group, 22.3 in the FFMT group, and 21.3 in the no-treatment group. The lifetime costs of income lost through disability and interventional/rehabilitation costs were $683,400 in the SAN group, $727,400 in the ICN group, $704,900 in the FFMT group, and $783,700 in the no-treatment group. Each of the interventional modalities was able to dramatically improve quality of life and decrease lifelong costs. A Monte Carlo PSA demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY gained, SAN transfer dominated in 88.5% of iterations, FFMT dominated in 7.5% of iterations, ICN dominated in 3.5% of iterations, and no treatment dominated in 0.5% of iterations.

18337,A Cost-Utility Analysis of 5 Strategies for the Management of Acute Otitis Media in Children,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether antimicrobial therapy in young children with acute otitis media reduces time to resolution of symptoms, overall symptom burden, and persistence of otoscopic evidence of infection. We used a cost-utility model to evaluate whether immediate antimicrobial treatment seems to be worthwhile, and if so, which antimicrobial agent is most cost effective. STUDY DESIGN: We compared the cost per quality-adjusted life-day of 5 treatment regimens in children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media: immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, immediate amoxicillin, immediate cefdinir, watchful waiting, and delayed prescription (DP) for antibiotic. RESULTS: The 5 treatment regimens, listed in order from least effective to most effective were DP, watchful waiting, immediate cefdinir, immediate amoxicillin, and immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate. Listed in order from least costly to most costly, the regimens were DP, immediate amoxicillin, watchful waiting, immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, and immediate cefdinir. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin compared with DP was $101.07 per quality-adjusted life-day gained. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate compared with amoxicillin was $2331.28 per quality-adjusted life-day gained.

18341,Cost-Effectiveness of Radiation and Chemotherapy for High-Risk Low-Grade Glioma,"BACKGROUND: The addition of PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine) chemotherapy to radiotherapy (RT) for patients with high-risk (>/= 40 years old or sub-totally resected) low-grade glioma (LGG) results in an absolute median survival benefit of over 5 years. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this treatment strategy. METHODS: A decision tree with an integrated three-state Markov model was created to follow patients with high risk LGG after surgery treated with RT vs. RT+PCV. Patients existed in one of 3 health states: stable, progressive, and dead. Survival and freedom from progression were modeled to reflect the results of RTOG 9802 using time-dependent transition probabilities. Health utility values and costs of care were derived from the literature and national registry databases. Analysis was conducted from the healthcare perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis explored uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: Modeled outcomes demonstrated agreement with clinical data in expected benefit of addition of PCV to RT. The addition of PCV to RT yielded an incremental benefit of 4.77 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (9.94 for RT+PCV vs. 5.17 for RT alone) at an incremental cost of $48,635 ($188,234 for RT+PCV vs. $139,598 for RT alone), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,186 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrates that within modeled distributions of parameters, RT+PCV has 99.96% probability of being cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: The addition of PCV to RT is a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with high-risk LGG.",2017-01-25211,28666368,Neuro-oncol,Yushen Qian,2017,/,,No,28666368,"Yushen Qian; Satoshi Maruyama; Haju Kim; Erqi L Pollom; Kiran A Kumar; Alexander L Chin; Jeremy P Harris; Daniel T Chang; Allison Pitt; Eran Bendavid; Douglas K Owens; Ben Y Durkee; Scott G Soltys; Cost-Effectiveness of Radiation and Chemotherapy for High-Risk Low-Grade Glioma, Neuro-oncol, 2017 Jun 28; ():1522-8517",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Radiotherapy (RT) +procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Radiotherapy (RT)",Not Stated,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,10186,United States,2016,10984.05
18342,Cost effectiveness of regorafenib as second-line therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has demonstrated prolonged survival by 2.8 months as a second-line agent in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who progress on sorafenib therapy. The objective of the current study was to examine the cost effectiveness of regorafenib for the treatment of HCC. METHODS: The authors constructed a Markov simulation model of patients with unresectable HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who received treatment with regorafenib versus best supportive care. Model inputs for regorafenib effectiveness and rates of adverse events in patients with HCC were based on published clinical trial data and literature review. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated along with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of regorafenib therapy. One-way sensitivity analyses also were conducted simultaneously on all model parameters and on various Monte-Carlo simulation parameters, and the regorafenib cost threshold at which cost effectiveness would be achieved was determined. RESULTS: Regorafenib provided an increase of 0.18 QALYs at a cost of $47,112. The ICER for regorafenib, compared with best supportive care, was $224,362. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, there were no scenarios in which regorafenib was cost effective. In cost threshold analysis, regorafenib would have to be priced at or below $67 per pill to be cost effective at an ICER of $100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Regorafenib is not cost effective as a second-line agent in the treatment of HCC, with a marginal increase in QALYs at a high cost. Lowering the cost of regorafenib or improving the selection of patients who can achieve maximal survival benefit would improve its value as a second-line treatment option for patients with HCC.

18343,Randomised controlled trial of transanal endoscopic microsurgery versus endoscopic mucosal resection for large rectal adenomas (TREND Study),"OBJECTIVE: Non-randomised studies suggest that endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is equally effective in removing large rectal adenomas as transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), but EMR might be more cost-effective and safer. This trial compares the clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of TEM and EMR for large rectal adenomas. DESIGN: Patients with rectal adenomas >/=3 cm, without malignant features, were randomised (1:1) to EMR or TEM, allowing endoscopic removal of residual adenoma at 3 months. Unexpected malignancies were excluded postrandomisation. Primary outcomes were recurrence within 24 months (aiming to demonstrate non-inferiority of EMR, upper limit 10%) and the number of recurrence-free days alive and out of hospital. RESULTS: Two hundred and four patients were treated in 18 university and community hospitals. Twenty-seven (13%) had unexpected cancer and were excluded from further analysis. Overall recurrence rates were 15% after EMR and 11% after TEM; statistical non-inferiority was not reached. The numbers of recurrence-free days alive and out of hospital were similar (EMR 609+/-209, TEM 652+/-188, p=0.16). Complications occurred in 18% (EMR) versus 26% (TEM) (p=0.23), with major complications occurring in 1% (EMR) versus 8% (TEM) (p=0.064). Quality-adjusted life years were equal in both groups. EMR was approximately euro3000 cheaper and therefore more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Under the statistical assumptions of this study, non-inferiority of EMR could not be demonstrated. However, EMR may have potential as the primary method of choice due to a tendency of lower complication rates and a better cost-effectiveness ratio.

18344,Laparoscopic Versus Open Resection for Colorectal Liver Metastases: The OSLO-COMET Randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE: To perform the first randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopic and open liver resection. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Laparoscopic liver resection is increasingly used for the surgical treatment of liver tumors. However, high-level evidence to conclude that laparoscopic liver resection is superior to open liver resection is lacking. METHODS: Explanatory, assessor-blinded, single center, randomized superiority trial recruiting patients from Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway from February 2012 to January 2016. A total of 280 patients with resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 133) or open (n = 147) parenchyma-sparing liver resection. The primary outcome was postoperative complications within 30 days (Accordion grade 2 or higher). Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, postoperative hospital stay, blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. RESULTS: The postoperative complication rate was 19% in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 31% in the open-surgery group (12 percentage points difference [95% confidence interval 1.67-21.8; P = 0.021]). The postoperative hospital stay was shorter for laparoscopic surgery (53 vs 96 hours, P < 0.001), whereas there were no differences in blood loss, operation time, and resection margins. Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly from the laparoscopic group (0 patients) to the open group (1 patient). In a 4-month perspective, the costs were equal, whereas patients in the laparoscopic-surgery group gained 0.011 quality-adjusted life years compared to patients in the open-surgery group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing parenchyma-sparing liver resection for colorectal metastases, laparoscopic surgery was associated with significantly less postoperative complications compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic resection was cost-effective compared to open resection with a 67% probability. The rate of free resection margins was the same in both groups.

18349,"Systemic Thrombolysis, Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis, and Anticoagulation for Intermediate-risk Pulmonary Embolism: A Simulation Modeling Analysis","OBJECTIVES: Decision making around the use of thrombolysis for patients with intermediate-risk (submassive) pulmonary embolism (PE) remains challenging. Studies indicate favorable clinical outcomes with systemic thrombolytics (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator [IV tPA]), but the risk of major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke is a deterrent. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) may be a preferable strategy, as it has been shown to have a lower risk of bleeding than systemic thrombolysis. However, a three-arm randomized control study comparing IV tPA, CDT, and anticoagulation alone, with long-term follow up, would be costly and is unlikely to be performed. The aim of this study was to use decision modeling to quantitatively estimate the differences between the three strategies. METHODS: We created an individual-level state-transition model to simulate long-term outcomes of a hypothetical patient cohort treated with IV tPA, CDT, or anticoagulation alone. Our model incorporated clinical randomized controlled trial and longitudinal study data to inform patient characteristics and outcomes specific to each study arm. The base case was a 65-year-old patient. Additionally, we utilized preliminary data published by the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Variance in model inputs was addressed with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Our primary endpoint was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Secondary endpoints included total cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Catheter-directed thrombolysis (mean, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.388 [7.381-7.396] QALYs) resulted in the most long-term utility for eligible patients compared to anticoagulation alone (7.352 [7.345-7.360] QALYs) or IV tPA (7.343 [7.336-7.351] QALYs). Patients receiving CDT had an elevated risk of hemorrhagic stroke in comparison to anticoagulation alone; however, patients treated with anticoagulation alone were more likely to experience recurrent PE associated adverse outcomes. Results were stable with sensitivity analyses varying age and sex. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessing joint variance predicts CDT to be the most effective strategy, when measured by mean QALYs, in 98.4% of runs, while systemic thrombolysis was favored over anticoagulation alone 34.4% of the time. The ICER of CDT compared to anticoagulation was $317,042 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: In our model, for those eligible, CDT results in the largest number of QALYs for patients with intermediate-risk PE, although it is relatively expensive and the absolute difference in QALYs between anticoagulation alone and CDT is small. Future studies that provide data on longitudinal quality-of-life outcomes of patients treated for PE and characteristics of CDT would be beneficial to augment model inputs, inform assumptions, and validate results.",2017-01-25250,28650086,Acad Emerg Med,Christopher Kabrhel,2017,24 / 10,1235-1243,No,28650086,"Christopher Kabrhel; Ayman Ali; Jin G Choi; Chin Hur; Systemic Thrombolysis, Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis, and Anticoagulation for Intermediate-risk Pulmonary Embolism: A Simulation Modeling Analysis, Acad Emerg Med, 2017 Oct; 24(10):1069-6563; 1235-1243",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Catheter-directed thrombolysis vs. Anticoagulation alone,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,317042,United States,2015,346194.4

This study aimed to evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir (IDet) compared with insulin glargine (IGlar) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from the Thai payer''s perspective. METHODS: Long-term costs and outcomes were projected using a validated IMS CORE Diabetes Model, version 8.5. Cohort characteristics, baseline risk factors, and costs of diabetes complications were derived from Thai data sources. Relative risk was derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis study. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was presented in 2015 US Dollars (USD). A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDet yielded slightly greater quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (8.921 vs 8.908), but incurred higher costs than IGlar (90,417.63 USD vs 66,674.03 USD), resulting in an ICER of approximately 1.7 million USD per QALY. The findings were very sensitive to the cost of IDet. With a 34% reduction in the IDet cost, treatment with IDet would become cost-effective according to the Thai threshold of 4,434.59 USD per QALY.

18356,Cost-Utility Analysis of Single-Fraction Versus Multiple-Fraction Radiotherapy in Patients with Painful Bone Metastases: An Iranian Patient's Perspective Study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate two of the various treatment strategies of bone metastasis- single-fraction radiotherapy and multiple-fraction radiotherapy. METHODS: A multistage Markov decision model was applied to assess the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of single fraction against multiple fractions. The model had a monthly cycle length over a lifetime horizon with 1000 hypothetical cohort samples. The EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire was used to estimate the health-related quality of life in patients. To cope with parameters of uncertainty, we conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. Both cost and utility variables were discounted by 3% in the base model. Strategies were assessed considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $6578 per QALY gained. RESULTS: The expected mean cost and quality-adjusted life-years were, respectively, US $447.28 and 5.95 months for patients receiving single-fraction radiotherapy and US $1269.66 and 7.87 months for those receiving multiple-fraction radiotherapy. The incremental cost-utility ratio was US $428.38 per QALY. Considering the Iranian gross domestic product per capita (US $6578) as the recommended willingness to pay for 1 QALY gained, the multiple-fraction method was found to be a cost-effective strategy.

18357,Cost-Effectiveness of Edoxaban vs. Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Based on Results of the ENGAGE AF - TIMI 48 Trial: Taiwanese Perspective,"BACKGROUND: Novel anticoagulants, such as factor Xa inhibitors, have entered clinical practice as alternatives to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic event (SEE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). It is not known whether edoxaban, the fourth-to-market factor Xa inhibitor approved for this indication, will be cost-effective in Taiwan, where the cost of warfarin monitoring is prohibitive. METHODS: A Markov model projecting lifetime results of edoxaban 60 mg/30 mg dose-reduced versus warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF, based on the ENGAGE AF - TIMI 48 trial, found edoxaban to be of high value relative to warfarin, from the perspective of the US health care system. We applied Taiwan-specific cost inputs to this model structure to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of edoxaban versus warfarin from the perspective of the Taiwanese health care system. Event rates and hazard ratios from the ENGAGE AF - TIMI 48 East Asian subpopulation were explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Edoxaban was found to be highly cost-effective compared with warfarin, based on guidelines proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $12,902 per quality-adjusted life year gained. These results were robust to variation of key model parameters, including assumptions regarding the cost and quality-of-life impact of stroke and bleeding events, and assuming East Asian-specific (as opposed to full-trial-population) rates for combinations of ischemic stroke, SEE, and major bleeding.

As efficacy and safety rates converge, prescribers and payers need to consider value for money. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the health economic value of daclatasvir + asunaprevir versus sofosbuvir/ledipasvir via a cost-effectiveness analysis, and determine the optimal treatment considering both costs and health outcomes in Japan. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir + asunaprevir compared with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir on the basis of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of pivotal trials and modeling inputs specific to the Japanese setting. A de novo budget impact model was developed and used to predict the cost implications of differing treatment sequences. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results demonstrated minimal difference in terms of benefit (0.037 fewer QALYs and 0.014 fewer life-years with daclatasvir + asunaprevir); nevertheless, a significant difference in cost was predicted (estimated yen2,299,700 [US $21,695] reduction with daclatasvir + asunaprevir). The budget impact analysis estimated that treatment with daclatasvir + asunaprevir is expected to be less expensive than treatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (as the proportion of patients initially treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir increased from 0% to 100%, total costs increased from yen206 to yen403 billion [US $1.94 billion to US $3.80 billion]). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of results from an established cost-effectiveness model and a conventional budget impact analysis, treatment with daclatasvir + asunaprevir is expected to be cost-saving compared with treatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in Japan with similar health outcomes, regardless of treatment sequence.",2017-01-25256,28648305,Value Health Reg Issues,Thomas Ward,2017,12 /,1-6,No,28648305,"Thomas Ward; Samantha Webster; Sari Mishina; Phil McEwan; Gail Wygant; Feng Wang; Assessing the Budget Impact and Economic Outcomes of the Introduction of Daclatasvir + Asunaprevir and Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Japan, Value Health Reg Issues, 2017 May; 12():2212-1099; 1-6",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Daclatasvir + asunaprevir vs. Standard/Usual Care- Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,2.00,2.00,592448,United States,2015,646924.31
18359,Cost-effectiveness analysis of two treatment strategies for chronic hepatitis C before and after access to direct-acting antivirals in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a strategy based on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) following the marketing of simeprevir and sofosbuvir (post-DAA) versus a pre-direct-acting antiviral strategy (pre-DAA) in patients with chronic hepatitis C, from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. METHODS: A decision tree combined with a Markov model was used to estimate the direct health costs (euro, 2016) and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) throughout the patient''s life, with an annual discount rate of 3%. The sustained virological response, percentage of patients treated or not treated in each strategy, clinical characteristics of the patients, annual likelihood of transition, costs of treating and managing the disease, and utilities were obtained from the literature. The cost-effectiveness analysis was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental cost per QALY gained). A deterministic sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: The post-DAA strategy showed higher health costs per patient (euro30,944 vs. euro23,707) than the pre-DAA strategy. However, it was associated with an increase of QALYs gained (15.79 vs. 12.83), showing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2,439 per QALY. The deterministic sensitivity analysis and the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of the results, with the post-DAA strategy being cost-effective in 99% of cases compared to the pre-DAA strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the pre-DAA strategy, the post-DAA strategy is efficient for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Spain, resulting in a much lower cost per QALY than the efficiency threshold used in Spain (euro30,000 per QALY).",2017-01-25264,28645446,Gastroenterol Hepatol,Juan Turnes,2017,40 / 7,433-446,No,28645446,"Juan Turnes; Raquel Dominguez-Hernandez; Miguel Angel Casado; Cost-effectiveness analysis of two treatment strategies for chronic hepatitis C before and after access to direct-acting antivirals in Spain, Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2017 Aug - Sep; 40(7):0210-5705; 433-446",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Post Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAA) strategy vs. Pre Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAA) strategy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2439.6,Euro,2016,2911.07

METHODS: An economic analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial in which patients suspected of advanced stage ovarian cancer who qualified for primary cytoreductive surgery were randomized to either laparoscopy or primary cytoreductive surgery. Direct medical costs from a health care perspective over a 6-month time horizon were analyzed. Health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and utility was based on patient''s response to the EQ-5D questionnaires. We primarily focused on direct medical costs based on Dutch standard prices. RESULTS: We studied 201 patients, of whom 102 were randomized to laparoscopy and 99 to primary cytoreductive surgery. No significant difference in QALYs (utility=0.01; 95% CI 0.006 to 0.02) was observed. Laparoscopy reduced the number of futile laparotomies from 39% to 10%, while its costs were euro 1400 per intervention, making the overall costs of both strategies comparable (difference euro -80 per patient (95% CI -470 to 300)). Findings were consistent across various sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected advanced stage ovarian cancer, a diagnostic laparoscopy reduced the number of futile laparotomies, without increasing total direct medical health care costs, or adversely affecting complications or quality of life.",2017-01-25265,28645428,Gynecol Oncol,Roelien van de Vrie,2017,146 / 3,449-456,No,28645428,"Roelien van de Vrie; Hannah S van Meurs; Marianne J Rutten; Christiana A Naaktgeboren; Brent C Opmeer; Katja N Gaarenstroom; Toon Van Gorp; Henk G Ter Brugge; Ward Hofhuis; Henk W R Schreuder; Henriette J G Arts; Petra L M Zusterzeel; Johanna M A Pijnenborg; Maarten van Haaften; Mirjam J A Engelen; Erik A Boss; M Caroline Vos; Kees G Gerestein; Eltjo M J Schutter; Gemma G Kenter; Patrick M M Bossuyt; Ben Willem Mol; Marrije R Buist; Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopy as diagnostic tool before primary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer, Gynecol Oncol, 2017 Sep; 146(3):0090-8258; 449-456",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopy before surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Primary surgery,Suspected advanced stage ovarian cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-8000,Euro,2014,-11629.27
18361,Economic Evaluation of Tobramycin Inhalation Powder for the Treatment of Chronic Pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs in approximately 50% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This infection further compromises lung function, and significantly contributes to the increased healthcare costs. OBJECTIVES: Inhaled tobramycin, used to manage P. aeruginosa infection in CF patients, is available as powder (tobramycin inhalation powder, TIP) and solution (tobramycin inhalation solution, TIS). Evidence suggests increased adherence with the use of TIP over TIS. Hence, this analysis aimed to evaluate the potential pharmacoeconomic benefit of increased adherence with TIP over TIS in the US setting. METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was developed to compare TIP with TIS. Both costs and benefits were predicted over a 10-year time horizon from a payer''s perspective, and were discounted annually at 3%. All costs were presented in 2016 US dollars. RESULTS: TIP was associated with greater quality-adjusted life-years (by 0.27) and lower total costs (by US$36,168) as compared with TIS over a 10-year time horizon. TIP-treated patients experienced a decreased mean number of exacerbations than TIS-treated patients (39.24 vs 50.20). Furthermore, administration of TIP via the T-326 Inhaler was associated with significant cost savings per patient, because of the nebulizer required for administering TIS (by US$1596) and exacerbation costs (by US$76,531). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that TIP was dominant over TIS in 100% of the simulations. CONCLUSION: TIP is likely to be a more cost-effective treatment than TIS, and therefore may reduce the economic burden of CF.",2017-01-25271,28643178,Clin Drug Investig,Srilekha Panguluri,2017,37 / 8,795-805,Yes,28643178,"Srilekha Panguluri; Praveen Gunda; Laurie Debonnett; Kamal Hamed; Economic Evaluation of Tobramycin Inhalation Powder for the Treatment of Chronic Pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis, Clin Drug Investig, 2017 Aug; 37(8):1173-2563; 795-805",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tobramycin Inhalation Powder vs. Standard/Usual Care- Tobramycin inhalation solution,Chronic Pulmonary Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infection,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-133195,United States,2016,-143630.52
18362,Cost-effectiveness analysis of consolidation with brentuximab vedotin for high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplantation,"BACKGROUND: In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial, consolidation treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) decreased the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) progression after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, the impact of BV consolidation on overall survival, quality of life, and health care costs remain unclear. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to measure the costs and clinical outcomes for BV consolidation therapy compared with active surveillance in a cohort of patients aged 33 years who were at risk for HL relapse after ASCT. Life-time costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each post-ASCT strategy. RESULTS: After quality-of-life adjustments and standard discounting, upfront BV consolidation was associated with an improvement of 1.07 QALYs compared with active surveillance plus BV as salvage. However, the strategy of BV consolidation led to significantly higher health care costs ($378,832 vs $219,761), resulting in an ICER for BV consolidation compared with active surveillance of $148,664/QALY. If indication-specific pricing was implemented, then the model-estimated BV price reductions of 18% to 38% for the consolidative setting would translate into ICERs of $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY, respectively. These findings were consistent on 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: BV as consolidation therapy under current US pricing is unlikely to be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. However, indication-specific price reductions for the consolidative setting could reduce ICERs to widely acceptable values. Cancer 2017. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society. Cancer 2017;123:3763-3771.

18363,Cost-Effectiveness of Risk Score-Stratified Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening in Patients with Cirrhosis,"OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance with biannual ultrasound is currently recommended for all patients with cirrhosis. However, clinical implementation of this ""one-size-fits-all"" approach is challenging as evidenced by its low application rate. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified HCC surveillance strategies in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic modeling was performed to simulate a cohort of 50-year-old subjects with compensated cirrhosis. Risk-stratified HCC surveillance strategies was implemented, in which patients were stratified into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk groups by HCC risk biomarker-based scores and assigned to surveillance modalities tailored to HCC risk (2 non-risk-stratified and 14 risk-stratified strategies) and compared with non-stratified biannual ultrasound. RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life expectancy gains for biannual ultrasound in all patients and risk-stratified strategies compared with no surveillance were 1.3 and 0.9-2.1 years, respectively. Compared with the current standard of biannual ultrasound in all cirrhosis patients, risk-stratified strategies applying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasound only in high- and intermediate-risk patients, without screening in low-risk patients, were cost-effective.

However, clinical implementation of this ""one-size-fits-all"" approach is challenging as evidenced by its low application rate. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified HCC surveillance strategies in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic modeling was performed to simulate a cohort of 50-year-old subjects with compensated cirrhosis. Risk-stratified HCC surveillance strategies was implemented, in which patients were stratified into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk groups by HCC risk biomarker-based scores and assigned to surveillance modalities tailored to HCC risk (2 non-risk-stratified and 14 risk-stratified strategies) and compared with non-stratified biannual ultrasound.

18395,Cost-effectiveness of neck-specific exercise with or without a behavioral approach versus physical activity prescription in the treatment of chronic whiplash-associated disorders: Analyses of a randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Fifty percent of people injured by whiplash still report neck pain after 1 year and costs associated with whiplash associated disorders (WAD) are mostly attributed to health service and sick-leave costs in chronic conditions. With increasing health care expenditures the economic impact of interventions needs to be considered. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of physiotherapist-led neck-specific exercise without (NSE) or with a behavioral approach (NSEB), or prescription of physical activity (PPA) in chronic WAD, grade 2 to 3. METHODS: This is a secondary cost-effectiveness analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 216 participants with chronic WAD grade 2 to 3. The interventions were physiotherapist-led neck-specific exercise without or with a behavioral approach, or prescription of physical activity for 12 weeks. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were determined after 1 year and bootstrapped cost-effectiveness planes and sensitivity analyses of physiotherapy visits were performed. Health care and production loss costs were included and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated, using the Euroqol-5D questionnaire. Comparisons with the Short Form-6D, and neck disability index (NDI) were also made. RESULTS: The 1-year follow-up was completed by 170 participants (79%). Both physiotherapist-led groups improved in health related quality of life. The intervention cost alone, per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain in the NSE group was US$ 12,067. A trend for higher QALY gains were observed in the NSEB group but the costs were also higher. The ICERs varied depending on questionnaire used, but the addition of a behavioral approach to neck-specific exercise alone was not cost-effective from a societal perspective (ICER primary outcome $127,800 [95% confidence interval [CI], 37,816-711,302]). The sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. The prescription of physical activity did not result in any QALY gain and the societal costs were not lower. CONCLUSION: Neck-specific exercise was cost-effective from a societal perspective in the treatment of chronic WAD compared with the other exercise interventions.
