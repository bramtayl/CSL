31701,Mobile Technology for Community Health in Ghana: Is Maternal Messaging and Provider Use of Technology Cost-Effective in Improving Maternal and Child Health Outcomes at Scale?,"BACKGROUND: Mobile technologies are emerging as tools to enhance health service delivery systems and empower clients to improve maternal, newborn, and child health. Limited evidence exists on the value for money of mobile health (mHealth) programs in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to forecast the incremental cost-effectiveness of the Mobile Technology for Community Health (MOTECH) initiative at scale across 170 districts in Ghana. METHODS: MOTECH''s ""Client Data Application"" allows frontline health workers to digitize service delivery information and track the care of patients. MOTECH''s other main component, the ""Mobile Midwife,"" sends automated educational voice messages to mobile phones of pregnant and postpartum women. We measured program costs and consequences of scaling up MOTECH over a 10-year analytic time horizon. Economic costs were estimated from informant interviews and financial records. Health effects were modeled using the Lives Saved Tool with data from an independent evaluation of changes in key services coverage observed in Gomoa West District. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were presented overall and for each year of implementation. Uncertainty analyses assessed the robustness of results to changes in key parameters. RESULTS: MOTECH was scaled in clusters over a 3-year period to reach 78.7% (170/216) of Ghana''s districts. Sustaining the program would cost US $17,618 on average annually per district. Over 10 years, MOTECH could potentially save an estimated 59,906 lives at a total cost of US $32 million. The incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year averted ranged from US $174 in the first year to US $6.54 in the tenth year of implementation and US $20.94 (95% CI US $20.34-$21.55) over 10 years. Uncertainty analyses suggested that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to changes in health effects, followed by personnel time. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that MOTECH had a 100% probability of being cost-effective above a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $50. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to estimate the value for money of the supply- and demand-side of an mHealth initiative. The adoption of MOTECH to improve MNCH service delivery and uptake represents good value for money in Ghana and should be considered for expansion. Integration with other mHealth solutions, including e-Tracker, may provide opportunities to continue or combine beneficial components of MOTECH to achieve a greater impact on health.",2019-XX-30399,30758296,J Med Internet Res,Michelle Willcox,2019,21 / 2,e11268,No,30758296,"Michelle Willcox; Anitha Moorthy; Diwakar Mohan; Karen Romano; David Hutchful; Garrett Mehl; Alain Labrique; Amnesty LeFevre; Mobile Technology for Community Health in Ghana: Is Maternal Messaging and Provider Use of Technology Cost-Effective in Improving Maternal and Child Health Outcomes at Scale?, J Med Internet Res, 2019 Feb 19; 21(2):1438-8871; e11268",DALY,Ghana,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care",Mobile technology for community maternal health vs. None,Pregnant women,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,173.62,United States,2014,189.81

31704,"The impact and cost-effectiveness of combined HIV prevention scenarios among transgender women sex-workers in Lima, Peru: a mathematical modelling study","BACKGROUND: HIV incidence remains high among transgender women in Lima, Peru, most of whom report sex work. On the basis of a stakeholder analysis and health system capacity assessment, we designed a mathematical model to guide HIV programmatic planning among transgender women sex workers (TWSW) in Lima. METHODS: Using a deterministic compartmental model, we modelled HIV transmission among TWSW, their stable partners, and their clients to estimate the impact and cost-effectiveness of combinations of interventions compared with the standard of care on reducing HIV incidence over a 10-year period. We simulated HIV transmission accounting for differences in sexual positioning in anal intercourse and condom use by partner type and fitted the model to HIV surveillance data using Latin hypercube sampling. The interventions we considered were 15% relative increase in condom use with clients and 10% relative increase with stable partners; increase in antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage at CD4 count lower than 500 cells per mm(3) and greater than or equal to 500 cells per mm(3); and 15% pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) coverage using generic and branded formulations. We considered a basic scenario accounting for current limitations in the Peruvian HIV services and an enhanced scenario assuming achievement of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets and general improvements in HIV services. The 50 best fits according to log-likelihood were used to give the minimum and maximum values of intervention effect for each combination. We used disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to measure the negative health outcomes associated with HIV infection that could be averted through the interventions investigated and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to compare their cost-effectiveness. FINDINGS: Under the basic scenario, combining the four interventions of increasing condom use with clients and stable partners, extending ART to people with CD4 count greater than or equal to 500 cells per mm(3), and 15% PrEP coverage with generic drugs would avert 47% (range 27-51) of new infections in TWSW, their clients, and their stable partners over 10 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$509 per DALY averted. Under the enhanced scenario, this strategy would avert 61% (44-64) of new infections among this population with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1003 per DALY averted. Under both scenarios, implementation of this strategy approaches or surpasses the 50% incidence reduction goal and would represent a cost-effective use of country resources if generic PrEP drugs are used. The total cost of implementing this strategy under the enhanced scenario would be approximately $1.2 million per year over 10 years, corresponding to 10% of the current Global Fund''s yearly contribution in Peru. INTERPRETATION: Investments in HIV services among TWSW in Lima would be cost-effective, even under stringent cost-effectiveness criteria when accounting for setting-specific resource constraints. Notable improvements in HIV testing rates, innovative interventions to increase condom use, and reduced PrEP costs will be key to achieving the 50% incidence reduction goal.

31709,Cost-Effectiveness of Accelerated HIV Response Scenarios in Cote d'Ivoire,"BACKGROUND: Despite Cote d''Ivoire epidemic being labeled as ""generalized,"" key populations (KPs) are important to overall transmission. Using a dynamic model of HIV transmission, we previously estimated the impact of several treatment-as-prevention strategies that reached-or missed-the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets in different populations groups, including KP and clients of female sex workers (CFSWs). To inform program planning and resources allocation, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of these scenarios. METHODS: Costing was performed from the provider''s perspective. Unit costs were obtained from the Ivorian Programme national de lutte contre le Sida (USD 2015) and discounted at 3%. Net incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per adult HIV infection prevented and per disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) averted were estimated over 2015-2030. RESULTS: The 3 most cost-effective and affordable scenarios were the ones that projected current programmatic trends [ICER = $210; 90% uncertainty interval (90% UI): $150-$300], attaining the 90-90-90 objectives among KP and CFSW (ICER = $220; 90% UI: $80-$510), and among KP only (ICER = $290; 90% UI: $90-$660).

Mongolia must self-finance new vaccines and does not automatically access Gavi prices for vaccines. Given the country''s limited resources for health, it is critical to assess potential new vaccine programs. This evaluation estimates the impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget implications associated with a nationwide rotavirus vaccine introduction targeting infants as part of the national immunization program in Mongolia, in order to inform decision-making around introduction. METHODS: The analysis examines the use of the two-dose vaccine ROTARIX(R), and three-dose vaccines ROTAVAC(R) and RotaTeq(R) compared to no vaccination from the government and the societal perspective. We use a modelling approach informed by local data and published literature to analyze the impact and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination over a ten-year time period starting in 2019, using a 3% discount rate. Our main outcome measure is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as US dollar per DALY averted. We assessed uncertainty around a series of parameters through univariate sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Rotavirus vaccination in Mongolia could avert more than 95,000 rotavirus cases and 271 deaths, over 10years. Averted visits and hospitalizations represent US$2.4million in health care costs saved by the government. The vaccination program cost ranges from $6 to $11million depending on vaccine choice. From the governmental perspective, ICER ranged from $412 to $1050 and from $77 to $715 when considering the societal perspective. Sensitivity analysis highlights vaccine price as the main driver of uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Introduction of rotavirus vaccination is likely to be highly cost-effective in Mongolia, with ICERs estimated at only a fraction of Mongolia''s per capita GDP.

Our main outcome measure is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as US dollar per DALY averted. We assessed uncertainty around a series of parameters through univariate sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Rotavirus vaccination in Mongolia could avert more than 95,000 rotavirus cases and 271 deaths, over 10years. Averted visits and hospitalizations represent US$2.4million in health care costs saved by the government. The vaccination program cost ranges from $6 to $11million depending on vaccine choice. From the governmental perspective, ICER ranged from $412 to $1050 and from $77 to $715 when considering the societal perspective. Sensitivity analysis highlights vaccine price as the main driver of uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Introduction of rotavirus vaccination is likely to be highly cost-effective in Mongolia, with ICERs estimated at only a fraction of Mongolia''s per capita GDP.

31720,"Projected impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget implications of rotavirus vaccination in Mongolia","INTRODUCTION: Rotavirus disease in Mongolia is estimated to cause more than 50 deaths yearly and many more cases and hospitalizations. Mongolia must self-finance new vaccines and does not automatically access Gavi prices for vaccines. Given the country''s limited resources for health, it is critical to assess potential new vaccine programs. This evaluation estimates the impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget implications associated with a nationwide rotavirus vaccine introduction targeting infants as part of the national immunization program in Mongolia, in order to inform decision-making around introduction.

We estimate and compare the impact, cost and cost-effectiveness of a variety of prevent, test and treat strategies for HCV in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: A mathematical model. RESULTS: Without intervention, the HCV epidemic in Dar es Salaam was estimated to result in US$29.1 million in disease costs between 2018 and 2030. Maintaining existing harm reduction coverage (4% needle and syringe program, 42% opioid substitution therapy) over this period was estimated to prevent 22% of injecting drug use-acquired HCV infections compared to a zero coverage scenario. Implementing antibody/RNA, serum-based HCV core antigen (HCVcAg) and dry blood spot (DBS) HCVcAg test/treat programs among PWID increased the total cost by US$0.7 million, US$3.1 million and US$6.5 million respectively by 2030; however this expenditure led to 57%, 61% and 73% reductions in annual incidence among PWID, 25%, 27% and 33% reductions overall annual incidence (PWID+non-PWID), and reduced HCV prevalence among PWID from 27% to 9%, 8% and 5%, respectively. The Ab/RNA, serum-based and DBS HCVcAg test/treat programs cost US$689, US$2857 and US$5400 per disability-adjusted life year averted, respectively, compared to no test/treat program. CONCLUSION: Primary prevention among PWID can provide important reductions in HCV transmission in the absence of treatment availability. HCV Ab/RNA or serum-based HCVcAg test/treat programs among PWID are likely to be cost-effective in Dar es Salaam, with serum-based HCVcAg test/treat achieving greater impact due to a simpler diagnostic process and better retention in care.

Malaria is a major public health burden in sub-Saharan Africa. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of adding four-dose malaria vaccination in infants or children to existing interventions in 41 endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods. A static Markov cohort model followed a simulated 2017 birth cohort (36.5 million children) for 15 years in 5-day cycles, comparing three strategies: child vaccination (doses at ages 6, 7.5, 9, and 27 months); infant vaccination (doses at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks and 21 months); no malaria vaccination. The base-case analysis was conducted from the health system perspective with vaccine price assumed at USD5/dose and annual discounting of 3% for costs and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Efficacy was based on the Phase III RTS,S clinical trial. Results. The model projected that 24.6 million children, or 26.2 million infants, would be vaccinated. Compared with no vaccination, child (infant) vaccination was projected to avert 16.8 million (16 million) cases of malaria and 113,000 (107,000) malaria deaths in the birth cohort over the 15-year period. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was USD200/DALY averted (USD225/DALY averted) for child (infant) vaccination, which represents 14% (17%) of the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita threshold.

31730,The projected impact of geographic targeting of oral cholera vaccination in sub-Saharan Africa: A modeling study,"BACKGROUND: Cholera causes an estimated 100,000 deaths annually worldwide, with the majority of burden reported in sub-Saharan Africa. In May 2018, the World Health Assembly committed to reducing worldwide cholera deaths by 90% by 2030. Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) plays a key role in reducing the near-term risk of cholera, although global supplies are limited. Characterizing the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of mass OCV deployment strategies is critical for setting expectations and developing cholera control plans that maximize the chances of success. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We compared the projected impacts of vaccination campaigns across sub-Saharan Africa from 2018 through 2030 when targeting geographically according to historical cholera burden and risk factors. We assessed the number of averted cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years and the cost-effectiveness of these campaigns with models that accounted for direct and indirect vaccine effects and population projections over time. Under current vaccine supply projections, an approach optimized to targeting by historical burden is projected to avert 828,971 (95% CI 803,370-859,980) cases (equivalent to 34.0% of projected cases; 95% CI 33.2%-34.8%). An approach that balances logistical feasibility with targeting historical burden is projected to avert 617,424 (95% CI 599,150-643,891) cases. In contrast, approaches optimized for targeting locations with limited access to water and sanitation are projected to avert 273,939 (95% CI 270,319-277,002) and 109,817 (95% CI 103,735-114,110) cases, respectively. We find that the most logistically feasible targeting strategy costs US$1,843 (95% CI 1,328-14,312) per DALY averted during this period and that effective geographic targeting of OCV campaigns can have a greater impact on cost-effectiveness than improvements to vaccine efficacy and moderate increases in coverage. Although our modeling approach does not project annual changes in baseline cholera risk or directly incorporate immunity from natural cholera infection, our estimates of the relative performance of different vaccination strategies should be robust to these factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that geographic targeting substantially improves the cost-effectiveness and impact of oral cholera vaccination campaigns. Districts with the poorest access to improved water and sanitation are not the same as districts with the greatest historical cholera incidence. While OCV campaigns can improve cholera control in the near term, without rapid progress in developing water and sanitation services or dramatic increases in OCV supply, our results suggest that vaccine use alone is unlikely to allow us to achieve the 2030 goal.",2019-99-31077,31825965,PLoS Med,Elizabeth C Lee,2019,16 / 12,e1003003,No,31825965,"Elizabeth C Lee; Feng Wen; Hanrui Zheng; Pengfei Zhang; Jing Zhou; Hongdou Chen; Kexun Zhou; Qiu Li; Feng Bi; The projected impact of geographic targeting of oral cholera vaccination in sub-Saharan Africa: A modeling study, PLoS Med, 2019 Dec; 16(12):1549-1676; e1003003",DALY,"Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Democratic Republic, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe",Not Stated,Immunization,Cholera vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,Not Stated,1843,United States,2017,1945.94
31731,Cost-effectiveness of reflex laboratory-based cryptococcal antigen screening for the prevention and treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in Botswana,"Background: Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening for antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults with advanced HIV/AIDS can reduce the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and all-cause mortality. We modeled the cost-effectiveness of laboratory-based ""reflex"" CrAg screening for ART-naive CrAg-positive patients with CD4<100 cells/microL (those currently targeted in guidelines) and ART-experienced CrAg-positive patients with CD4<100 cells/microL (who make up an increasingly large proportion of individuals with advanced HIV/AIDS). Methods: A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate CrAg screening and treatment based on local CD4 count and CrAg prevalence data, and realistic assumptions regarding programmatic implementation of the CrAg screening intervention. We modeled the number of CrAg tests performed, the number of CrAg positives stratified by prior ART experience, the proportion of patients started on pre-emptive antifungal treatment, and the number of incident CM cases and CM-related deaths. Screening and treatment costs were evaluated, and cost per death or disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted estimated. Results: We estimated that of 650,000 samples undergoing CD4 testing annually in Botswana, 16,364 would have a CD4<100 cells/microL and receive a CrAg test, with 70% of patients ART-experienced at the time of screening. Under base model assumptions, CrAg screening and pre-emptive treatment restricted to ART-naive patients with a CD4<100 cells/microL prevented 20% (39/196) of CM-related deaths in patients undergoing CD4 testing at a cost of US$2 per DALY averted. Expansion of preemptive treatment to include ART-experienced patients with a CD4<100 cells/microL resulted in 55 additional deaths averted (a total of 48% [94/196]) and was cost-saving compared to no screening. Findings were robust across a range of model assumptions.

Parenting interventions are commonly used to prevent such problems, but little is known about their possible longer-term economic benefits. This study modelled the longer-term cost-effectiveness of five parenting interventions delivered in a Swedish context: Comet, Connect, the Incredible Years (IY), COPE, bibliotherapy, and a waitlist control, for the prevention of persistent behavior problems. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed and used to forecast the cost per averted disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) by each parenting intervention and the waitlist control, for children aged 5-12 years. Age-specific cohorts were modelled until the age of 18. Educational and health care sector costs related to behavior problems were included. Active interventions were compared to the waitlist control as well as to each other. RESULTS: Intervention costs ranged between US$ 14 (bibliotherapy) to US$ 1,300 (IY) per child, with effects of up to 0.23 averted DALYs per child (IY). All parenting interventions were cost-effective at a threshold of US$ 15,000 per DALY in relation to the waitlist control.

31738,Cost-effectiveness of introducing the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children under 5 years in the Islamic Republic of Iran,"Background: Pneumococcal disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae results in considerable mortality and morbidity. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), such as PCV-13, can prevent invasive pneumococcal disease and avoid disability and death. The cost of introducing PCV-13 in childhood immunization schedules should be assessed against the cost of pneumococcal diseases for each community. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing PCV-13 in the national immunization programme for children under 5 years in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods: The TRIVAC decision support model was used to estimate total costs of introducing PCV-13 and the disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The main pneumococcal diseases were considered-pneumonia, meningitis, acute otitis media, and non-pneumonia, non-meningitis infections-in terms of hospital admissions, outpatient visits and deaths. Local data were used to estimate costs. Results: Pneumococcal disease is estimated to affect 18 713 211 children under 5 years (519 412 pneumonia, 18 148 116 acute otitis media, 6884 meningitis, and 38 799 non-pneumonia, non-meningitis) in 10 years (2014-2023) without use of the vaccine.

DESIGN: Health economic modelling using the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model populated with China-specific data. SETTING: Individual cervical cancer prevention in China using the 9-valent HPV vaccine from the perspective of private sector purchasers in relation to receiving other HPV vaccines and not receiving vaccination for 16-year-old girls in China who had not been previously infected with HPV. PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination using the 9-valent, the quadrivalent and the bivalent vaccines. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental costs per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) prevented. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental costs per DALY prevented were, respectively, US$35 000 and US$50 455 compared with the quadrivalent and the bivalent vaccines, both of which were above the cost-effective threshold of US$25 920/DALY prevented. To be cost-effective in these comparisons, the 9-valent vaccine should be priced at $550 and $450 for the full doses, respectively. To be highly cost-effective, the price thresholds were $435 and $335. The incremental costs per DALY prevented in relation to no vaccination was US$23 012, making the 9-valent vaccine marginally cost-effective.

DESIGN: Health economic modelling using the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model populated with China-specific data. SETTING: Individual cervical cancer prevention in China using the 9-valent HPV vaccine from the perspective of private sector purchasers in relation to receiving other HPV vaccines and not receiving vaccination for 16-year-old girls in China who had not been previously infected with HPV. PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination using the 9-valent, the quadrivalent and the bivalent vaccines. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental costs per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) prevented. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental costs per DALY prevented were, respectively, US$35 000 and US$50 455 compared with the quadrivalent and the bivalent vaccines, both of which were above the cost-effective threshold of US$25 920/DALY prevented. To be cost-effective in these comparisons, the 9-valent vaccine should be priced at $550 and $450 for the full doses, respectively. To be highly cost-effective, the price thresholds were $435 and $335.

However, updated evidence is now available for several inputs (ie, rotavirus disease mortality rates, rotavirus age distributions, vaccine timeliness, and vaccine efficacy by duration of follow-up), new rotavirus vaccines have entered the market, vaccine prices have decreased, and cost-effectiveness thresholds have been re-examined. We aimed to provide updated cost-effectiveness estimates to inform national decisions about the new introduction and current use of rotavirus vaccines in Gavi countries. METHODS: We calculated the potential costs and effects of rotavirus vaccination for ten successive birth cohorts in 73 countries previously and currently eligible for Gavi support, compared with no vaccination. We used a deterministic cohort model to calculate numbers of rotavirus gastroenteritis cases, outpatient visits, hospitalisations, and deaths between birth and 5 years, with and without rotavirus vaccination. We calculated treatment costs from the government and societal perspectives. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (discounted US$ per disability-adjusted life-year averted). Country-specific model input parameters were based on the scientific literature, published meta-analyses, and international databases. We ran deterministic and probabilistic uncertainty analyses. FINDINGS: Over the period 2018-27, rotavirus vaccination has the potential to prevent nearly 600 000 deaths in Gavi countries. Averted outpatient visits and hospitalisations could lead to treatment savings of approximately $484.1 million from the government perspective and $878.0 million from the societal perspective.

31752,Heterogeneity in potential impact and cost-effectiveness of ETEC and Shigella vaccination in four sub-Saharan African countries,"Diarrheal disease burden has become more heterogenous in low- and lower middle-income countries as access to clean water, sanitation and health care has increased in wealthier urban populations. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Shigella are among the top five causes of diarrheal mortality in children living in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we explored how accounting for subnational and economic heterogeneity in ETEC and Shigella disease burden affects projected vaccine impact and cost-effectiveness of standalone ETEC and Shigella vaccines during the first decade after introduction in four sub-Saharan African countries. We developed dynamic models for provincial areas and socioeconomic subpopulations of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. We estimated deaths and morbidity due to ETEC and Shigella diarrhea plus additional deaths from other infectious diseases attributable to ETEC- and Shigella-induced stunting. We analyzed cost-effectiveness using Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) with Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Moderate-and-Severe Diarrheal episodes (MSD) averted as denominators. Other infectious disease deaths due to induced stunting accounted for 9-28% and 9-32% of the total provincial level ETEC and Shigella disease burden, respectively, across these four countries from years 2025 to 2034. Our results indicated that the lowest and most cost-effective provincial DALYs averted ICERs were below $600 and $500/DALY averted for ETEC and Shigella vaccination, respectively in Zimbabwe.

31764,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Mucosal Leishmaniasis diagnosis with PCR-based vs parasitological tests in Colombia,"To estimate the cost-effectiveness of available diagnosis alternatives for Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML) in Colombian suspected patients. A simulation model of the disease''s natural history was built with a decision tree and Markov models. The model s parameters were identified by systematic review and validated by expert consensus. A bottom-up cost analysis to estimate the costs of diagnostic strategies and treatment per case was performed by reviewing 48 clinical records of patients diagnosed with ML. The diagnostic strategies compared were as follows: 1) no diagnosis; 2) parasite culture, biopsy, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and Montenegro skin test (MST) combined ; 3) parasite culture, biopsy, and IFA combined; 4) PCR-miniexon; and 5) PCR-kDNA. Three scenarios were modeled in patients with ML clinical suspicion, according to ML prevalence scenarios: high, medium and low. Adjusted sensitivity and specificity parameters of a combination of diagnostic tests were estimated with a discrete event simulation (DES) model. For each alternative, the costs and health outcomes were estimated. The time horizon was life expectancy, considering the average age at diagnosis of 31 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated per Disability Life Year (DALY) avoided, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. A threshold of willingness to pay (WTP) of three-time gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) (US$ 15,795) and a discount rate of 3% was considered. The analysis perspective was the third payer (Health System). All costs were reported in American dollars as of 2015.

31765,"The cost-effectiveness of incentive-based active case finding for tuberculosis (TB) control in the private sector Karachi, Pakistan","BACKGROUND: In Asia, over 50% of patients with symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) access health care from private providers. These patients are usually not notified to the National TB Control Programs, which contributes to low notification rates in many countries. METHODS: From January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012, Karachi''s Indus Hospital - a private sector partner to the National TB Programme - engaged 80 private family clinics in its catchment area in active case finding using health worker incentives to increase notification of TB disease. The costs incurred were estimated from the perspective of patients, health facility and the program providing TB services. A Markov decision tree model was developed to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the active case finding as compared to case detection through the routine passive TB centers. Pakistan has a large private health sector, which can be mobilized for TB screening using an incentivized active case finding strategy. Currently, TB screening is largely performed in specialist public TB centers through passive case finding. Active and passive case finding strategies are assumed to operate independently from each other. RESULTS: The incentive-based active case finding program costed USD 223 per patient treated. In contrast, the center based non-incentive arm was 23.4% cheaper, costing USD 171 per patient treated. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the incentive-based active case finding program was more effective and less expensive per DALY averted when compared to the baseline passive case finding as it averts an additional 0.01966 DALYs and saved 15.74 US$ per patient treated.

31767,The cost-effectiveness of controlling cervical cancer using a new 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine among school-aged girls in Australia,"INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer imposes a substantial health burden worldwide including in Australia and is caused by persistent infection with one of 13 sexually transmitted high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding a nonavalent new Gardasil-9(R) (9vHPV) vaccine to the national immunisation schedule in Australia across three different delivery strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV vaccine introduction to prevent HPV infection. Academic literature and anecdotal evidence were included on the demographic variables, cervical cancer incidence and mortality, treatment costs, and vaccine delivery costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Analyses and data from international agencies were used in scenario analysis from the health system and societal perspectives. RESULTS: The 9vHPV vaccination was estimated to prevent 113 new cases of cervical cancer (discounted) during a 20-year period. From the health system and societal perspectives, the 9vHPV vaccination was very cost-effective in comparison with the status quo, with an ICER of A$47,008 and A$44,678 per DALY averted, respectively, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold level. Considering delivery strategies, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$47,605, A$46,682, and A$46,738 for school, health facilities, and outreach-based vaccination programs from the health system perspective, wherein, from the societal perspective, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$46,378, A$43,729, A$43,930, respectively. All estimates of ICERs fell below the threshold level (A$73,267). CONCLUSIONS: This cost-effectiveness evaluation suggests that the routine two-dose 9vHPV vaccination strategy of preadolescent girls against HPV is very cost-effective in Australia from both the health system and societal perspectives.

Health technology assessment is one important tool to support such decision making. The International Decision Support Initiative worked with the Ghanaian Ministry of Health to strengthen health technology assessment capacity building, identifying hypertension as a priority topic area for a relevant case study. METHODS: Based on guidance from a national technical working group of researchers and policy makers, an economic evaluation and budget impact analysis were undertaken for the main antihypertensive medicines used for uncomplicated, essential hypertension. The analysis aimed to address specific policy questions relevant to the National Health Insurance Scheme. RESULTS: The evaluation found that first-line management of essential hypertension with diuretics has an incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-year avoided of GH cent 276 ($179 in 2017, 4% of gross national income per capita) compared with no treatment. Calcium channel blockers were more effective than diuretics but at a higher incremental cost: GH cent 11 061 per disability-adjusted life-year avoided ($7189 in 2017; 160% of gross national income per capita).

Health technology assessment is one important tool to support such decision making. The International Decision Support Initiative worked with the Ghanaian Ministry of Health to strengthen health technology assessment capacity building, identifying hypertension as a priority topic area for a relevant case study. METHODS: Based on guidance from a national technical working group of researchers and policy makers, an economic evaluation and budget impact analysis were undertaken for the main antihypertensive medicines used for uncomplicated, essential hypertension. The analysis aimed to address specific policy questions relevant to the National Health Insurance Scheme.

31780,Potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Afghanistan,"INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has not been introduced in many countries in South-Central Asia, including Afghanistan, despite the sub-region having the highest incidence rate of cervical cancer in Asia. This study estimates the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in Afghanistan to inform national decision-making. METHOD: An Excel-based static cohort model was used to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes of vaccinating a single cohort of 9-year-old girls in the year 2018 with the bivalent HPV vaccine, compared to no vaccination. We also explored a scenario with a catch-up campaign for girls aged 10-14 years. Input parameters were based on local sources, published literature, or assumptions when no data was available. The primary outcome measure was the discounted cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, evaluated from both government and societal perspectives. RESULTS: Vaccinating a single cohort of 9-year-old girls against HPV in Afghanistan could avert 1718 cervical cancer cases, 125 hospitalizations, and 1612 deaths over the lifetime of the cohort. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$426 per DALY averted from the government perspective and US$400 per DALY averted from the societal perspective. The estimated annual cost of the HPV vaccination program (US$3,343,311) represents approximately 3.53% of the country''s total immunization budget for 2018 or 0.13% of total health expenditures. CONCLUSION: In Afghanistan, HPV vaccine introduction targeting a single cohort is potentially cost-effective (0.7 times the GDP per capita of $586) from both the government and societal perspective with additional health benefits generated by a catch-up campaign, depending on the government''s willingness to pay for the projected health outcomes.",2019-99-30944,31870571,Vaccine,Palwasha Anwari,2019,/,,Yes,31870571,"Palwasha Anwari; Florie E van Beek; Lonneke M A Wijnhoven; Femke Jansen; Jose A E Custers; Eline J Aukema; Veerle M H Coupe; Pim Cuijpers; Marije L van der Lee; Birgit I Lissenberg-Witte; Ben Wijnen; Judith B Prins; Irma M Verdonck-de Leeuw; Potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Afghanistan, Vaccine, 2019 Jan 30; ():1873-2518",DALY,Afghanistan,Not Stated,Immunization,HPV vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,9 Years,9 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,400,United States,2018,412.27

31786,Cost-effectiveness of the introduction of two-dose bi-valent (Cervarix) and quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccination for adolescent girls in Bangladesh,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in women caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) that leads to a substantial disease burden for health systems. Prevention through vaccination can significantly reduce the prevalence of cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential health and economic impacts of introducing two-dose bivalent (Cervarix) and quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccines in Bangladesh. METHODS: The study uses the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model to assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing HPV vaccination. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted using the cost-effectiveness threshold (CET). The analyses were done from a health system perspective in terms of vaccine delivery routes. RESULTS: Introduction of bi-valent HPV vaccination was found highly cost-effective (ICER=US$488/DALY) at Gavi (The Vaccine Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations) negotiated prices. The value of ICERs were US$710, US$356 and US$397 per DALY averted for school-based, health facility-based, and outreach-based programs, respectively, which is consistent with the CET range (US$67 to US$854). However, bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines at listed prices were not found cost-effective, with ICERs of US$1405 and US$3250 per DALY averted, respectively, that exceeds the CETs values. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing a two-dose bi-valent HPV vaccination program is cost-effective in Bangladesh at Gavi negotiated prices.

Prevention through vaccination can significantly reduce the prevalence of cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential health and economic impacts of introducing two-dose bivalent (Cervarix) and quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccines in Bangladesh. METHODS: The study uses the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model to assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing HPV vaccination. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted using the cost-effectiveness threshold (CET). The analyses were done from a health system perspective in terms of vaccine delivery routes. RESULTS: Introduction of bi-valent HPV vaccination was found highly cost-effective (ICER=US$488/DALY) at Gavi (The Vaccine Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations) negotiated prices. The value of ICERs were US$710, US$356 and US$397 per DALY averted for school-based, health facility-based, and outreach-based programs, respectively, which is consistent with the CET range (US$67 to US$854).

The evaluation highlights that introducing the two-dose bivalent HPV vaccine at Gavi negotiated prices into a national immunization program in Bangladesh is economically viable to reduce the burden of cervical cancer.",2020-99-31532,31668820,Vaccine,Rashidul Alam Mahumud,2020,38 / 2,165-172,Yes,31668820,"Rashidul Alam Mahumud; Linnaea Schuttner; Ashok Reddy; Ann-Marie Rosland; Karin Nelson; Edwin S Wong; Cost-effectiveness of the introduction of two-dose bi-valent (Cervarix) and quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccination for adolescent girls in Bangladesh, Vaccine, 2020 Jan 10; 38(2):1873-2518; 165-172",DALY,Bangladesh,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Immunization",Quadrivalent Gardasil (4vHPV)-vaccine vs. None,Pre-adolescent girls,10 Years,10 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,47874.19,United States,2017,50548.17
31798,Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Campaigns,"BACKGROUND: Data to inform evidence-based policy of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine delivery strategies in low- and middle-income countries are limited. We examined the cost-effectiveness of campaign compared with routine delivery strategies of adolescent female HPV vaccination in Uganda. METHODS: We used a multiple modeling approach that captured HPV transmission, cervical carcinogenesis, and population demographics to project health and economic outcomes associated with HPV vaccination. Costs included vaccination and operational costs and cervical cancer costs over the lifetimes of the current female population in Uganda. Health outcomes included number of cervical cancer cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., cost per DALY averted) were calculated and compared against gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. RESULTS: Compared with routine HPV vaccination of 9-year-old girls at 70% coverage, campaign vaccination yielded greater health benefits if campaigns occurred frequently and targeted a wide age range. Campaign delivery strategies were both less costly and more effective than routine HPV vaccination. Campaign vaccination of 9- to 30-year-old girls/women at a 3-year frequency (40% coverage) was considered cost-effective compared with the GDP per capita threshold for Uganda ($674 in U.S. 2015 dollars). CONCLUSIONS: We projected that campaign HPV vaccination would provide substantial population health benefits compared with routine vaccination. Expanding the target age range of campaign vaccination up to age 30 years may be an efficient strategy, depending on the achievable coverage level and campaign frequency. IMPACT: In settings where routine health systems infrastructure may be limited, reaching adolescent populations with a campaign delivery strategy may be an efficient use of resources.",2019-99-31537,31666282,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,Allison Portnoy,2019,/,,No,31666282,"Allison Portnoy; Bustanul Arifin; Antoinette D I van Asselt; Didik Setiawan; Jarir Atthobari; Maarten J Postma; Qi Cao; Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Campaigns, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2019 Jun 11; ():1055-9965",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Immunization",Campaign HPV vaccination strategies every 4 years. vs. Standard/Usual Care- One- and two-dose vaccination strategies without campaign approach,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,100000,United States,2015,109195.12
31799,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Point-of-Care Rapid Testing Versus Laboratory-Based Testing for Antenatal Screening of Syphilis in Brazil,"OBJECTIVES: Severe consequences of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis and high increasing incidence of congenital syphilis remains an important public health problem in Brazil. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a rapid point-of-care test (RT) and treatment of positive mothers immediately compared with a laboratory-based standard test (ST) with treatment at next follow-up visit. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between antenatal syphilis screening strategies. The model was built with lifetime horizon from Brazilian health system perspective using 3% and 5% discount rates. A hypothetical cohort of pregnant women at reproductive age were used in the model. Health outcomes: low birth weight, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and congenital syphilis were estimated in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Microcosting study and secondary data provided parameters of direct medical costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: For base case, the mean cost per pregnant woman screened was $2.63 (RT) and $2.48 (ST), respectively. Maternal syphilis was associated with a loss of 0.0043 DALYs (RT) and 0.0048 DALYs (ST) per mother screened. Expected value of incremental cost per DALY averted was $298.08. After 10?000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis model runs, incremental cost and health benefits were $0.15 (95% credible interval -1.56 to 1.92) and 0.00042 DALYs (95% credible interval -0.0036 to 0.0044), respectively, with a mean ICER of $357.44 per DALY. Screening with RT has a 58% chance of being the optimal strategy at a threshold of $3,200 per DALY. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, antenatal screening with syphilis RT and immediate treatment is likely to be cost-effective compared with standard screening and must be prioritized in local settings.",2020-99-36044,32841902,Value Health Reg Issues,Carmen Phang Romero,2020,23 /,61-69,No,32841902,"Carmen Phang Romero; Daniel S Marinho; Rodolfo Castro; Claudia Cristina de Aguiar Pereira; Everton Silva; Rosângela Caetano; Flavia Tavares Silva Elias; James Chilcott; Simon Dixon; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Point-of-Care Rapid Testing Versus Laboratory-Based Testing for Antenatal Screening of Syphilis in Brazil, Value Health Reg Issues, 2020 Dec; 23():2212-1099; 61-69",DALY,Brazil,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Diagnostic, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Pharmaceutical, Screening",rapid test for antenatal syphilis screening + immediate treatment with penicillin vs. Standard/Usual Care- lab-based test for antenatal syphilis screening + treatment with penicillin at follow-up,Not Stated,64 Years,6 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,298.08,United States,2015,325.49
31800,Cost-effectiveness of post-treatment follow-up examinations and secondary prevention of tuberculosis in a high-incidence setting: a model-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: In settings of high tuberculosis incidence, previously treated individuals remain at high risk of recurrent tuberculosis and contribute substantially to overall disease burden. Whether tuberculosis case finding and preventive interventions among previously treated people are cost-effective has not been established. We aimed to estimate costs and health benefits of annual post-treatment follow-up examinations and secondary preventive therapy for tuberculosis in a tuberculosis-endemic setting. METHODS: We developed a transmission-dynamic mathematical model and calibrated it to data from two high-incidence communities of approximately 40?000 people in suburban Cape Town, South Africa. We used the model to estimate overall cost and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with annual follow-up examinations and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), alone and in combination, among individuals completing tuberculosis treatment. We investigated scenarios under which these interventions were restricted to the first year after treatment completion, or extended indefinitely. For each intervention scenario, we projected health system costs and DALYs averted with respect to the current status quo of tuberculosis control. All estimates represent mean values derived from 1000 epidemic trajectories simulated over a 10-year period (2019-28), with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) calculated as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile values. FINDINGS: We estimated that a single follow-up examination at the end of the first year after treatment completion combined with 12 months of secondary IPT would avert 2472 DALYs (95% UI -888 to 7801) over a 10-year period and is expected to be cost-saving compared with current control efforts. Sustained annual follow-up and continuous secondary IPT beyond the first year after treatment would avert an additional 1179 DALYs (-1769 to 4377) over 10 years at an expected additional cost of US$18·2 per DALY averted. Strategies of follow-up without secondary IPT were dominated (ie, expected to result in lower health impact at higher costs) by strategies that included secondary IPT. INTERPRETATION: In this high-incidence setting, post-treatment follow-up and secondary preventive therapy can accelerate declines in tuberculosis incidence and potentially save resources for tuberculosis control. Empirical trials to assess the feasibility of these interventions in settings most severely affected by tuberculosis are needed.
