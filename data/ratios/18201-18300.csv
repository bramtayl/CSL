18201,Reaching hepatitis C virus elimination targets requires health system interventions to enhance the care cascade,"BACKGROUND: Modelling suggests that achieving the World Health Organization''s elimination targets for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is possible by scaling up use of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. However, poor linkage to health services and retention in care presents a major barrier, in particular among people who inject drugs (PWID). We identify and assess the cost-effectiveness of additional health system interventions required to achieve HCV elimination targets in Australia, a setting where all people living with HCV have access to DAA therapy. METHODS: We used a dynamic HCV transmission and liver-disease progression mathematical model among current and former PWID, capturing testing, treatment and other features of the care cascade. Interventions tested were: availability of point-of-care RNA testing; increased testing of PWID; using biomarkers in place of liver stiffness measurement; and scaling up primary care treatment delivery. RESULTS: The projected treatment uptake in Australia reduced the number of people living with HCV from approximately 230,000 in 2015 to approximately 24,000 by 2030 and reduced incidence by 45%. However, the majority (74%) of remaining infections were undiagnosed and among PWID. Scaling up primary care treatment delivery and using biomarkers in place of liver stiffness measurement only reduced incidence by a further 1% but saved AU$32 million by 2030, with no change to health outcomes. Additionally replacing HCV antibody testing with point-of-care RNA testing increased healthcare cost savings to AU$62 million, increased incidence reduction to 64% and gained 11,000 quality-adjusted life years, but critically, additional screening of PWID was required to achieve HCV elimination targets. CONCLUSION: Even with unlimited and unrestricted access to HCV DAA treatment, interventions to improve the HCV cascade of care and target PWID will be required to achieve elimination targets.",2017-01-24918,28797497,Int J Drug Policy,Nick Scott,2017,47 /,107-116,No,28797497,"Nick Scott; Joseph S Doyle; David P Wilson; Amanda Wade; Jess Howell; Alisa Pedrana; Alexander Thompson; Margaret E Hellard; Reaching hepatitis C virus elimination targets requires health system interventions to enhance the care cascade, Int J Drug Policy, 2017 Sep; 47():1873-4758; 107-116",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,All health system interventions vs. Standard/Usual Care- Usual Care plus direct-acting antiviral,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,14 Years,3.00,3.00,47,Australia,2015,38.6
18202,Implications of Coronary Artery Calcium Testing for Treatment Decisions Among Statin Candidates According to the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Management Guidelines: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"This review evaluates the cost-effectiveness of using coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide long-term statin therapy compared with treating all patients eligible for statins according to 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol management guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The authors used a microsimulation model to compare costs and effectiveness from a societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. Both strategies resulted in similar costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). CAC resulted in increased costs (+$81) and near-equal QALY (+0.01) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $8,100/QALY compared with the treat-all strategy. For 10,000 patients, the treat-all strategy would theoretically avert 21 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, but would add 47,294 person-years of statins. With CAC costs <$100, and higher cost and/or disutility associated with statin therapy, CAC strategy was favored. These findings suggest the economic value of both approaches were similar. Clinicians should account for individual preferences in context of shared decision making when choosing the most appropriate strategy to guide statin decisions.",2017-01-24919,28797417,JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,Jonathan C Hong,2017,10 / 8,938-952,No,28797417,"Jonathan C Hong; Ron Blankstein; Leslee J Shaw; William V Padula; Alejandro Arrieta; Jonathan A Fialkow; Roger S Blumenthal; Michael J Blaha; Harlan M Krumholz; Khurram Nasir; Implications of Coronary Artery Calcium Testing for Treatment Decisions Among Statin Candidates According to the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Management Guidelines: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, JACC Cardiovasc Imaging, 2017 Aug; 10(8):1876-7591; 938-952",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide long-term statin therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Treat all patients eligible for statins,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,8100,United States,2016,8734.62
18203,Adjuvant Trastuzumab Therapy for Early HER2-Positive Breast Cancer in Iran: A Cost-Effectiveness and Scenario Analysis for an Optimal Treatment Strategy,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines have recommended a 1-year trastuzumab regimen as standard care for early human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer; however, this recommendation can have a dramatic impact on total drug expenditures in middle-income countries (MICs). We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from the Iranian healthcare perspective to find an optimum duration of trastuzumab use in Iran. METHOD: We compared four treatment strategies comprising chemotherapy and varying durations of trastuzumab use (no trastuzumab, 6, 9 months, and 1 year), and a Markov model and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were used to estimate the costs and effects of the strategies. We then examined the cost effectiveness of the strategies at different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds and ages at onset of treatment. RESULTS: Incremental costs (versus no trastuzumab) were euro8826 (6 months), euro13,808 (9 months) and euro18,588 (12 months), while incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 0.65 (6 months), 0.87 (9 months) and 1.14 (12 months). At a threshold of 3 x gross domestic product (GDP)/capita (euro21,000/QALY) and for patients younger than 59 years, the 6-month protocol was most likely to be cost effective (probability of 42%). At a threshold of 4 x GDP/capita (euro28,000/QALY), the 6-month and 1-year regimens were essentially equal in cost effectiveness (37 and 35%, respectively). At this WTP threshold, the 6-month and 1-year regimens were optimal strategies only for patients up to 66 and 44 years of age, respectively. CONCLUSION: In contrast to clinical guidelines, 6 months of trastuzumab may be the most cost-effective option for Iran. The lower absolute WTP threshold and lower life expectancy compared with high-income countries are two crucial parameters in the cost effectiveness of interventions in MICs.

18206,Can hydrophilic coated catheters be beneficial for the public healthcare system in Brazil? - A cost-effectiveness analysis in patients with spinal cord injuries,"INTRODUCTION: Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia affects 70% to 80% of all spinal cord injury patients, resulting in increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and potential exposure to antimicrobial resistance. In Brazil, local guidelines recommend intermittent catheterization as the best method for bladder emptying, and two catheter types are available: the conventional uncoated PVC and the hydrophilic coated catheters. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two types of catheters for intermittent catheterization from the perspective of the Brazilian public healthcare system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness in those with spinal cord injuries. A primary analysis was conducted on all possible adverse events, and a secondary analysis was performed with urinary tract infections as the only relevant parameter. The results were presented as cost per life years gained (LYG), per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and per number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) avoided. RESULTS: The base scenario of all adverse events shows a cost-effective result of hydrophilic coated catheters compared to uncoated PVC catheters at 57,432 BRL (Brazilian Reais) per LYG and 122,330 BRL per QALY. The secondary scenario showed that the use of hydrophilic coated catheters reduces the total number of UTIs, indicating that an additional cost of hydrophilic coated catheters of 31,240 BRL over a lifetime will reduce lifetime UTIs by 6%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher unit value, the use of hydrophilic coated catheters is a cost-effective treatment from the perspective of the Brazilian public healthcare system.",2017-01-24933,28792195,Int Braz J Urol,Jose Carlos Truzzi,2017,43 /,,No,28792195,"Jose Carlos Truzzi; Vanessa Teich; Camila Pepe; Can hydrophilic coated catheters be beneficial for the public healthcare system in Brazil? - A cost-effectiveness analysis in patients with spinal cord injuries, Int Braz J Urol, 2017 Aug 08; 43():1677-6119",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hydrophilic coated polyvinylchloride vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conventional uncoated polyvinylchloride,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,122330,Brazil,2015,40732.06
18207,Cost-effectiveness analysis of potentially curative and combination treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma with person-level data in a Canadian setting,"Patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are potential candidates for curative treatments such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), surgical resection (SR), or liver transplantation (LT), which have demonstrated a significant survival benefit. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of curative and combination treatment strategies among patients diagnosed with HCC during 2002-2010. This study used Ontario Cancer Registry-linked administrative data to estimate effectiveness and costs (2013 USD) of the treatment strategies from the healthcare payer''s perspective. Multiple imputation by logistic regression was used to handle missing data. A net benefit regression approach of baseline important covariates and propensity score adjustment were used to calculate incremental net benefit to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and uncertainty measures. Among 2,222 patients diagnosed with HCC, 10.5%, 14.1%, and 10.3% received RFA, SR, and LT monotherapy, respectively; 0.5-3.1% dual treatments; and 0.5% triple treatments. Compared with no treatment (53.2%), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) + RFA (average $2,465, 95% CI: -$20,000-$36,600/quality-adjusted life years [QALY]) or RFA monotherapy ($15,553, 95% CI: $3,500-$28,500/QALY) appears to be the most cost-effective modality with lowest ICER value. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that if the relevant threshold was $50,000/QALY, RFA monotherapy and TACE+ RFA would have a cost-effectiveness probability of 100%. Strategies using LT delivered the most additional QALYs and became cost-effective at a threshold of $77,000/QALY. Our findings found that TACE+ RFA dual treatment or RFA monotherapy appears to be the most cost-effective curative treatment for patients with potential early stage of HCC in Ontario.

METHODS: We developed a compartmental model to project HPV epidemic trajectories in MSM for three vaccination scenarios: a boys program, a targeted program for young MSM only and the combination of the two over 2017-2036. We assessed the gain in quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) in 190,000 Australian MSM. RESULTS: A targeted program for young MSM only that achieved 20% coverage per year, without a boys program, will prevent 49,283 (31,253-71,500) cases of anogenital warts, 191 (88-319) person-years living with anal cancer through 2017-2036 but will only stablise anal cancer incidence.

18222,Targeted human papillomavirus vaccination for young men who have sex with men in Australia yields significant population benefits and is cost-effective,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a targeted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program for young (15-26) men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: We developed a compartmental model to project HPV epidemic trajectories in MSM for three vaccination scenarios: a boys program, a targeted program for young MSM only and the combination of the two over 2017-2036. We assessed the gain in quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) in 190,000 Australian MSM. RESULTS: A targeted program for young MSM only that achieved 20% coverage per year, without a boys program, will prevent 49,283 (31,253-71,500) cases of anogenital warts, 191 (88-319) person-years living with anal cancer through 2017-2036 but will only stablise anal cancer incidence.

18225,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy as induction and maintenance therapy for metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: The BEYOND trial found that the addition of bevacizumab (B) to paclitaxel-carboplatin (PC) chemotherapy provided a significant clinical benefit to Chinese patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding B to first-line PC induction and continuation maintenance therapy from a Chinese perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost and effectiveness of B + PC in the induction and maintenance therapy of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Costs were calculated in the Chinese setting, and health outcomes derived from the BEYOND trial were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the impact of various parameters in the study. RESULTS: The B + PC treatment was more costly ($112,943.40 versus $32,171.43) and more effective (1.07 QALYs versus 0.80 QALYs) compared with the PC treatment. Adding B to the PC regimen for non-squamous NSCLC results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $299,155.44 per QALY, which exceeded the accepted societal willingness-to-pay threshold ($23,970.00) for China. In the sensitivity analysis, the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) for the B + PC group, the cost of the PFS state for B + PC group and the price of B were considered the most sensitive factors in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of B to first-line PC induction and maintenance therapy was not determined to be a cost-effective strategy for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in China, even when an assistance program was provided.",2017-01-24943,28785913,Clin Transl Oncol,H Zheng,2017,/,,No,28785913,"H Zheng; L Xie; M Zhan; F Wen; T Xu; Q Li; Cost-effectiveness analysis of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy as induction and maintenance therapy for metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, Clin Transl Oncol, 2017 Mar 28; ():1699-048X",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bevacizumab+paclitaxel–carboplatin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Placebo +paclitaxel–carboplatin (PC),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,299155.44,United States,2015,326663.14
18226,Cost-effectiveness of pediatric bilateral cochlear implantation in Spain,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of bilateral versus unilateral cochlear implantation for 1-year-old children suffering from bilateral sensorineural severe to profound hearing loss from the perspective of the Spanish public health system. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. METHODS: We conducted a general-population survey to estimate the quality-of-life increase contributed by the second implant. We built a Markov influence diagram and evaluated it for a life-long time horizon with a 3% discount rate in the base case. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of simultaneous bilateral implantation with respect to unilateral implantation for 1-year-old children with severe to profound deafness is euro10,323 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). For sequential bilateral implantation, it rises to euro11,733/QALY. Both options are cost-effective for the Spanish health system, whose willingness to pay is estimated at around euro30,000/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the probability of bilateral implantation being cost-effective reaches 100% for that cost-effectiveness threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral implantation is clearly cost-effective for the population considered. If possible, it should be done simultaneously (i.e., in one surgical operation), because it is as safe and effective as sequential implantation, and saves costs for the system and for users and their families. Sequential implantation is also cost-effective for children who have received the first implant recently, but it is difficult to determine when it ceases to be so because of the lack of detailed data. These results are specific for Spain, but the model can easily be adapted to other countries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2C.

18227,Cost-utility analysis of bariatric surgery compared with conventional medical management in Germany: a decision analytic modeling,"BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate cost-utility of bariatric surgery in Germany for a lifetime and 10-year horizon from a health care payer perspective. METHODS: State-transition Markov model provided absolute and incremental clinical and monetary results. In the model, obese patients could undergo surgery, develop post-surgery complications, experience diabetes type II, cardiovascular diseases or die. German Quality Assurance in Bariatric Surgery Registry and literature sources provided data on clinical effectiveness and safety. The model considered three types of surgeries: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. The model was extensively validated, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainty. Cost data were obtained from German sources and presented in 2012 euros (euro). RESULTS: Over 10 years, bariatric surgery led to the incremental cost of euro2909, generated additional 0.03 years of life and 1.2 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2457 per QALY. Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of euro8522 and generated an increment of 0.7 years of life or 3.2 QALYs. The analysis also depicted an association between surgery and a reduction of obesity-related adverse events (diabetes, cardiovascular disorders). Delaying surgery for up to 3 years, resulted in a reduction of life years and QALYs gained, in addition to a moderate reduction in associated healthcare costs. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and may result in a substantial reduction in the financial burden on the healthcare system over the lifetime of the treated individuals. It is also observed that delays in the provision of surgery may lead to a significant loss of clinical benefits.",2017-01-24976,28774333,BMC Surg,Oleg Borisenko,2017,17 / 1,87,No,28774333,"Oleg Borisenko; Oliver Mann; Anna Dupree; Cost-utility analysis of bariatric surgery compared with conventional medical management in Germany: a decision analytic modeling, BMC Surg, 2017 Aug 03; 17(1):1471-2482; 87",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bariatric surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conventional medical management,BMI range 30–60 units,65 Years,25 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"10 Years, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,2457,Euro,2012,3561.44
18228,Imaging Strategies for Suspected Acute Cranial Shunt Failure: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: We compared cost-effectiveness of cranial computed tomography (CT), fast sequence magnetic resonance imaging (fsMRI), and ultrasonography measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) for suspected acute shunt failure from the perspective of a health care organization. METHODS: We modeled 4 diagnostic imaging strategies: (1) CT scan, (2) fsMRI, (3) screening ONSD by using point of care ultrasound (POCUS) first, combined with CT, and (4) screening ONSD by using POCUS first, combined with fsMRI. All patients received an initial plain radiographic shunt series (SS). Short- and long-term costs of radiation-induced cancer were assessed with a Markov model. Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life-years. Utilities and inputs for clinical variables were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: At a previous probability of shunt failure of 30%, a screening POCUS in patients with a normal SS was the most cost-effective. For children with abnormal SS or ONSD measurement, fsMRI was the preferred option over CT. Performing fsMRI on all patients would cost $269 770 to gain 1 additional quality-adjusted life-year compared with POCUS.

18231,Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral versus total knee arthroplasty in younger patients,"AIMS: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs. This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-effectiveness of PFA versus TKA for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-effectiveness between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case) and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates of revision were derived from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. RESULTS: PFA was more expensive ($49 811 versus $46 632) but more effective (14.3 QALYs versus 13.3 QALYs) over a lifetime horizon. The ICER associated with the additional effectiveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility values, with PFA remaining cost-effective when its utility exceeded that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits at no increased cost when annual rates of revision decreased by 24.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Recent improvements in rates of implant of survival have made PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger patients, delaying TKA until implant failure or tibiofemoral OA progression. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal benefit for PFA to be cost-effective compared with TKA and identified survivorship targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more effective. These benchmarks might be used to assess clinical outcomes of PFA from an economic standpoint within the United States healthcare system.

18233,Cost-effectiveness of screening for HIV in primary care: a health economics modelling analysis,"BACKGROUND: Early HIV diagnosis reduces morbidity, mortality, the probability of onward transmission, and their associated costs, but might increase cost because of earlier initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART). We investigated this trade-off by estimating the cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in primary care. METHODS: We modelled the effect of the four-times higher diagnosis rate observed in the intervention arm of the RHIVA2 randomised controlled trial done in Hackney, London (UK), a borough with high HIV prevalence (>/=0.2% adult prevalence). We constructed a dynamic, compartmental model representing incidence of infection and the effect of screening for HIV in general practices in Hackney. We assessed cost-effectiveness of the RHIVA2 trial by fitting model diagnosis rates to the trial data, parameterising with epidemiological and behavioural data from the literature when required, using trial testing costs and projecting future costs of treatment. FINDINGS: Over a 40 year time horizon, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were pound22 201 (95% credible interval 12 662-132 452) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, pound372 207 (268 162-1 903 385) per death averted, and pound628 874 (434 902-4 740 724) per HIV transmission averted. Under this model scenario, with UK cost data, RHIVA2 would reach the upper National Institute for Health and Care Excellence cost-effectiveness threshold (about pound30 000 per QALY gained) after 33 years. Scenarios using cost data from Canada (which indicate prolonged and even higher health-care costs for patients diagnosed late) suggest this threshold could be reached in as little as 13 years. INTERPRETATION: Screening for HIV in primary care has important public health benefits as well as clinical benefits. We predict it to be cost-effective in the UK in the medium term. However, this intervention might be cost-effective far sooner, and even cost-saving, in settings where long-term health-care costs of late-diagnosed patients in high-prevalence regions are much higher (>/=60%) than those of patients diagnosed earlier. Screening for HIV in primary care is cost-effective and should be promoted.

18234,The cost-utility of point-of-care troponin testing to diagnose acute coronary syndrome in primary care,"BACKGROUND: The added value of using a point-of-care (POC) troponin test in primary care to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is debated because test sensitivity is inadequate early after symptom onset. This study investigates the potential cost-utility of diagnosing ACS by a general practitioner (GP) when a POC troponin test is available versus GP assessment only. METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was developed, representing a hypothetical cohort of the Dutch population (>35 years) consulting the GP with chest complaints. All health related consequences as well as cost consequences were included. Both symptom duration, selection of patients in whom the POC troponin test is performed, and test performance at different time points were incorporated. Health outcomes were expressed as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The main outcome parameters involve the effect of POC troponin testing on (in)correct hospital referrals, QALYs, and costs. RESULTS: The POC troponin strategy decreases the referral rate in non-ACS patients from 38.46% to 31.85%. Despite a small increase in non-referral among ACS patients from 0.22% to 0.27%, the overall health effect is negligible. Costs will decrease with euro77.25/patient (95% CI euro-126.81 to euro-33.37). CONCLUSIONS: The POC troponin strategy is likely cost-saving, by reducing hospital referrals. The small increase in missed ACS patients can be partly explained by conservative assumptions used in the analysis. Besides, current developments in POC troponin tests will likely further improve their diagnostic performance. Therefore, future prospective studies are warranted to investigate whether those developments make the POC troponin test to a safe and cost-effective diagnostic tool for diagnosing ACS in general practices.",2017-01-24988,28768475,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,Michelle M A Kip,2017,17 / 1,213,No,28768475,"Michelle M A Kip; Hendrik Koffijberg; Marco J Moesker; Maarten J Ijzerman; Ron Kusters; The cost-utility of point-of-care troponin testing to diagnose acute coronary syndrome in primary care, BMC Cardiovasc Disord, 2017 May 11; 17(1):1471-2261; 213",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Point-of-care troponin testing to diagnose acute coronary syndrome vs. Standard/Usual Care- General practitioner test,Not Stated,Not Stated,36 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,Not Stated,Euro,2015,Not Stated
18235,Cost-utility of collaborative care for the treatment of comorbid major depressive disorder in outpatients with chronic physical conditions. A randomized controlled trial in the general hospital setting (CC-DIM),"PURPOSE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent in patients with a chronic physical condition, and this comorbidity has a negative influence on quality of life, health care costs, self-care, morbidity, and mortality. Research has shown that collaborative care (CC) may be a cost-effective treatment. However, its cost-effectiveness in this patient group has not yet been established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of CC for the treatment of comorbid MDD in chronically ill patients in the outpatient general hospital setting. The study was conducted from a health care and societal perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 81 patients with moderate-to-severe MDD were included; 42 were randomly assigned to the CC group and 39 to the care as usual (CAU) group. We applied the TiC-P, short-form Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire, and EuroQol EQ-5D 3 level version, measuring the use of health care, informal care, and household work, respectively, at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: The mean annual direct medical costs in the CC group were euro6,718 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3,541 to 10,680) compared to euro4,582 (95% CI: 2,782 to 6,740) in the CAU group. The average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were 0.07 higher in the CC group, indicating that CC is more costly but also more effective than CAU. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro24,690/QALY. CONCLUSION: This first cost-utility analysis in chronically ill patients with comorbid MDD shows that CC may be a cost-effective treatment depending on willingness-to-pay levels. Nevertheless, the low utility scores emphasize the need for further research to improve the cost-effectiveness of CC in this highly prevalent and costly group of patients.",2017-01-24998,28765710,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,Maartje Goorden,2017,13 /,1881-1893,No,28765710,"Maartje Goorden; Christina M van der Feltz-Cornelis; Kirsten M van Steenbergen-Weijenburg; Eva K Horn; Aartjan Tf Beekman; Leona Hakkaart-van Roijen; Cost-utility of collaborative care for the treatment of comorbid major depressive disorder in outpatients with chronic physical conditions.

18236,Cost-utility and budget impact analyses of the use of NEPA for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting prophylaxis in Italy,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of resources allocation and sustainability of the use of netupitant+palonosetron (NEPA) for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prophylaxis assuming the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective. A published Markov model was adapted to assess the incremental cost-utility ratio of NEPA compared with aprepitant (APR) + palonosetron (PALO), fosaprepitant (fAPR) + PALO, APR + ondansetron (ONDA), fAPR + ONDA in patients receiving a highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and with APR + PALO and fAPR + PALO in patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). SETTING: Oncology hospital department in Italy. METHODS: A Markov model was used to determine the impact of NEPA on the budget of the Italian NHS on a 5-day time horizon, corresponding to the acute and delayed CINV prophylaxis phases. Direct medical costs considered were related to antiemetic drugs, adverse events management, CINV episodes management. Clinical and quality of life data referred to previously published works. The budget impact analysis considered the aforementioned therapies plus PALO alone (for HEC and MEC) on a 5-year time horizon, comparing two scenarios: one considering the use of NEPA and one not considering its use. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and differential economic impact for the Italian NHS between the two scenarios considered. RESULTS: NEPA is more effective and less expensive (dominant) compared with APR + PALO (for HEC and MEC), fAPR + PALO (for HEC and MEC), APR + ONDA (for HEC), fAPR + ONDA (for HEC). The use of NEPA would lead to a 5-year cost decrease of euro63.7 million (euro42.7 million for HEC and euro20.9 million for MEC). CONCLUSIONS: NEPA allows an efficient allocation of resources for the Italian NHS and it is sustainable, leading to a cost decrease compared with a scenario which does not consider its use.",2017-01-25000,28765126,BMJ Open,Umberto Restelli,2017,7 / 7,e015645,No,28765126,"Umberto Restelli; Gabriella Saibene; Patrizia Nardulli; Roberta Di Turi; Erminio Bonizzoni; Francesca Scolari; Tania Perrone; Davide Croce; Luigi Celio; Cost-utility and budget impact analyses of the use of NEPA for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting prophylaxis in Italy, BMJ Open , 2017 Aug 01; 7(7):2044-6055; e015645",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Netupitant + palonosetron vs. Aprepitant + ondasetron,Receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Week,Not Stated,Not Stated,64329,Euro,2016,76760.99

It has been tested in phase-3 trials, but no data on its cost-effectiveness have been published. PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of PP3M compared with once-monthly paliperidone (PP1M), haloperidol long-acting therapy (HAL-LAT), risperidone microspheres (RIS-LAT), and oral olanzapine (oral-OLZ) for treating chronic schizophrenia in The Netherlands. METHODS: A previous 1-year decision tree was adapted, based on local inputs supplemented with data from published literature. The primary analysis used DRG costs in 2016 euros from the insurer perspective, as derived from official lists. A micro-costing analysis was also conducted. For the costing scenario, official list prices were used. Clinical outcomes included relapses (treated as outpatients, requiring hospitalization, total), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Rates and utility scores were derived from the literature. Economic outcomes were the incremental cost/QALY-gained or relapse-avoided. Model robustness was examined in scenario, 1-way, and probability sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The expected cost was lowest with PP3M (8,781euro), followed by PP1M (10,325euro), HAL-LAT (11,278euro), RIS-LAT (11,307euro), and oral-OLZ (13,556euro). PP3M had the fewest total relapses/patient (0.36, 0.94, 1.39, 1.21, and 1.70, respectively), hospitalizations (0.11, 0.46, 0.40, 0.56, and 0.57, respectively), emergency room visits (0.25, 0.48. 0.99, 0.65, and 1.14, respectively) and the most QALYs (0.847, 0.735, 0.709, 0.719, and 0.656, respectively). In both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, PP3M dominated all other drugs. Sensitivity analyses confirmed base case findings. In the costing analysis, total costs were, on average, 31.9% higher than DRGs. CONCLUSIONS: PP3M dominated all commonly used drugs.

18241,Using Genomic Information to Guide Ibrutinib Treatment Decisions in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Genomic tests may improve the stratification of patients to receive new therapies in several disease areas. However, the use of expensive targeted therapies can impact on the cost effectiveness of these tests. This study presents an economic evaluation of genomic testing in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the context of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses (using life-years and quality-adjusted life-years) were undertaken from a National Health Service and societal perspective. Five strategies were evaluated across several age groups using Markov modelling: three strategies that reflected varying current genetic testing practice and two configurations of genomic testing (including ibrutinib treatment). RESULTS: Genomic testing strategies yielded the most life-years/quality-adjusted life-years per patient, but were not cost effective compared with a threshold of pound30,000 per life-year/quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that there was some uncertainty surrounding this result. A genomic testing strategy becomes the most cost-effective option if a higher end-of-life cost-effectiveness threshold of pound50,000 is applied, if a societal costing perspective is considered in 25-year-old patients or if the cost of ibrutinib treatment falls. CONCLUSION: Stratifying patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to targeted treatment using genomic testing improves health outcomes, but will likely only represent a cost-effective use of limited National Health Service resources if a higher cost-effectiveness threshold or societal costing perspective is applied, or if the price of ibrutinib treatment is reduced.

18244,Using Genomic Information to Guide Ibrutinib Treatment Decisions in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Genomic tests may improve the stratification of patients to receive new therapies in several disease areas. However, the use of expensive targeted therapies can impact on the cost effectiveness of these tests. This study presents an economic evaluation of genomic testing in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the context of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses (using life-years and quality-adjusted life-years) were undertaken from a National Health Service and societal perspective. Five strategies were evaluated across several age groups using Markov modelling: three strategies that reflected varying current genetic testing practice and two configurations of genomic testing (including ibrutinib treatment). RESULTS: Genomic testing strategies yielded the most life-years/quality-adjusted life-years per patient, but were not cost effective compared with a threshold of pound30,000 per life-year/quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that there was some uncertainty surrounding this result. A genomic testing strategy becomes the most cost-effective option if a higher end-of-life cost-effectiveness threshold of pound50,000 is applied, if a societal costing perspective is considered in 25-year-old patients or if the cost of ibrutinib treatment falls.

18245,The cost utility and budget impact of adjuvant racecadotril for acute diarrhea in children in Thailand,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost utility and the budget impact of adjuvant racecadotril for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children in Thailand. METHODS: A cost utility model has been adapted to the context of Thailand to evaluate racecadotril plus oral rehydration solution (R+ORS) versus oral rehydration solution (ORS) alone for acute diarrhea in children <5 years old. The decision tree Excel model evaluates the costs and effects (quality-adjusted life years) over a 6-day time horizon from a public health care payer''s perspective in Thailand. Deterministic sensitivity analysis and budget impact analysis have been undertaken. RESULTS: According to the cost utility model, the intervention (R+ORS) is less costly and more effective than the comparator (ORS) for the base case with a dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -2,481,390 for the intervention. According to the budget impact analysis (assuming an increase of 5% market share for R+ORS over 5 years), the year-on-year reduction for diarrhea as a percentage of the total health care expenditure is -0.0027%, resulting in potential net cost savings of -35,632,482 over 5 years. CONCLUSION: Subject to the assumptions and limitations of the models, adjuvant racecadotril versus ORS alone is potentially cost-effective for children in Thailand and uptake could translate into savings for the Thailand public health care system.",2017-01-25009,28761363,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Tamlyn Anne Rautenberg,2017,9 /,411-422,No,28761363,"Tamlyn Anne Rautenberg; Ute Zerwes; The cost utility and budget impact of adjuvant racecadotril for acute diarrhea in children in Thailand, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2017; 9():1178-6981; 411-422",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Racecadotril plus oral rehydration solution (R+ORS) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Oral rehydration solution,Not Stated,5 Years,1 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Week,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2481390,Thailand,2012,-90088.39
18246,Cost-effectiveness of treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding,"BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding affects up to one third of women in the United States, resulting in a reduced quality of life and significant cost to the health care system. Multiple treatment options exist, offering different potential for symptom control at highly variable initial costs, but the relative value of these treatment options is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of 4 treatment options for heavy menstrual bleeding: hysterectomy, resectoscopic endometrial ablation, nonresectoscopic endometrial ablation, and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. STUDY DESIGN: We formulated a decision tree evaluating private payer costs and quality-adjusted life years over a 5 year time horizon for premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding and no suspected malignancy. For each treatment option, we used probabilities derived from literature review to estimate frequencies of minor complications, major complications, and treatment failure resulting in the need for additional treatments. Treatments were compared in terms of total average costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand the range of possible outcomes if model inputs were varied. RESULTS: The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system had superior quality-of-life outcomes to hysterectomy with lower costs. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was cost-effective compared with hysterectomy in the majority of scenarios (90%). Both resectoscopic and nonresectoscopic endometrial ablation were associated with reduced costs compared with hysterectomy but resulted in a lower average quality of life. According to standard willingness-to-pay thresholds, resectoscopic endometrial ablation was considered cost effective compared with hysterectomy in 44% of scenarios, and nonresectoscopic endometrial ablation was considered cost effective compared with hysterectomy in 53% of scenarios. CONCLUSION: Comparing all trade-offs associated with 4 possible treatments of heavy menstrual bleeding, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was superior to both hysterectomy and endometrial ablation in terms of cost and quality of life. Hysterectomy is associated with a superior quality of life and fewer complications than either type of ablation but at a higher cost.

18249,Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Term Ticagrelor in Patients With Prior Myocardial Infarction: Results From the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 Trial,"BACKGROUND: In patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) 1 to 3 years earlier, treatment with ticagrelor + low-dose aspirin (ASA) reduces the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI, or stroke compared with low-dose aspirin alone, but at an increased risk of major bleeding. OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluated cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor + low-dose ASA in patients with prior MI within the prior 3 years. METHODS: The authors performed a prospective economic substudy alongside the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 54) trial, which randomized 21,162 patients to ASA alone, ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily + low-dose ASA, or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily + low-dose ASA. Medical resource use data were collected over a median 33-month follow-up. Costs were assessed from the U.S. health care system perspective. In-trial data relating to survival, utility, and costs were combined with lifetime projections to evaluate lifetime cost-effectiveness of the Food and Drug Administration-approved lower-dose ticagrelor regimen (60 mg twice daily). RESULTS: Hospitalization costs were similar for ticagrelor 60 mg and placebo ($2,262 vs. $2,333; 95% confidence interval for difference -$303 to $163; p = 0.54); after inclusion of a daily ticagrelor 60 mg cost of $10.52, total costs were higher for ticagrelor ($10,016 vs. $2,333; 95% CI: $7,441 to $7,930; p < 0.001). In-trial quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were similar (2.28 vs. 2.27; p = 0.34). Over a lifetime horizon, ticagrelor was associated with QALY gains of 0.078 and incremental costs of $7,435, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $94,917/QALY gained. Several high-risk groups had more favorable ICERs, including patients with >1 prior MI, multivessel disease, diabetes, renal dysfunction (all with ICERs $50,000 to $70,000/QALY gained), patients age <75 years (ICER = $44,779/QALY gained), and patients with peripheral artery disease (ICER = $13,427/QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with a history of MI >1 year previously, long-term treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg + low-dose ASA yields a cost-effectiveness ratio suggesting intermediate value based on current guidelines. Ticagrelor appears to provide higher value for patients in several recognized high-risk subgroups.

18250,Cost-effectiveness of molecular point-of-care testing for influenza viruses in elderly patients at ambulatory care setting,"BACKGROUND: Early initiation of antiviral therapy in elderly patients with influenza is associated with reduced risk of extra clinic visit, hospitalization and death. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of molecular POCT for detection of influenza viruses in Hong Kong elderly patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) in the outpatient clinics. METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to simulate outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of elderly patients presented with ILI at outpatient clinics during peak season of influenza with two diagnostic approaches: Rapid molecular assay (POCT-PCR group) and clinical judgement with no POCT. Outcome measures included influenza-associated direct medical cost, hospitalization and mortality rates, quality-adjusted life year loss (QALY loss), and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER). RESULTS: In base-case analysis, POCT-PCR group was expected to reduce hospitalization (1.38% versus 2.85%) and mortality rate (0.08% versus 0.16%) and save 0.00112 QALYs at higher cost (by USD33.2 per ILI patient), comparing with clinical judgement group. The ICER of POCT-PCR was 29,582 USD/QALY saved. One-way sensitivity analyses found ICER sensitive to: Hospitalization rate without prompt antiviral therapy; odds ratio of hospitalization with prompt therapy; influenza prevalence; patient age and mortality rate of hospitalized patients. POCT-PCR was cost-effective in 60.6% and 99.4% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations at willingness-to-pay threshold of 1x and 3x gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong, respectively.

Thus, it becomes important to analyze the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccine. The objective of this model is to examine the potential long-term epidemiologic and economic impact of quadrivalent HPV(qHPV;6/11/16/18) vaccination program in Indonesia. Methods: A previously validated transmission dynamic model was used to estimate the long-term epidemiologic and economic consequences of quadrivalent HPV vaccination by comparing cost-effectiveness of 2 dose qHPV vaccination strategy for girls 11-12 years old (with or without catch up; catch up dose for 12-26 years) versus Screening Only (Pap Smear) for reducing cost related to HPV type 6,11,16,18 (cervical cancer, CIN 1, CIN 2/3, and genital warts). Costs of an HPV disease episode-of-care (diagnosis and treatment) were calculated for base case analysis using local Indonesian cost. Result: 2-dose qHPV vaccination strategies without catch up reduce the overall incidence of HPV 16/18-related cervical cancer relative to screening by 54.4% over the 100 year following vaccine introduction. Likewise, vaccination strategies reduce the incidence of HPV type 16/18 CIN 2/3, CIN 1 by 69.1% and 71.8% respectively, also reducing HPV type 6/11 CIN 1, genital warts in female, genital warts in male by 82.9%,84.2%,82.1% respectively, at this time point.

18253,Cost-effectiveness of G5 Mobile continuous glucose monitoring device compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose alone for people with type 1 diabetes from the Canadian societal perspective,"AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) alone in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) using multiple daily injections (MDI) from the Canadian societal perspective. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (v.9.0) was used to assess the long-term (50 years) cost-effectiveness of real-time CGM (G5 Mobile CGM System; Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) compared with SMBG alone for a cohort of adults with poorly-controlled T1DM. Treatment effects and baseline characteristics of patients were derived from the DIAMOND randomized controlled clinical trial; all other assumptions and costs were sourced from published research. The accuracy and clinical effectiveness of G5 Mobile CGM is the same as the G4 Platinum CGM used in the DIAMOND randomized clinical trial. Base case assumptions included (a) baseline HbA1c of 8.6%, (b) change in HbA1c of -1.0% for CGM users vs -0.4% for SMBG users, and (c) disutilities of -0.0142 for non-severe hypoglycemic events (NSHEs) and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs) not requiring medical intervention, and -0.047 for SHEs requiring medical resources. Treatment costs and outcomes were discounted at 1.5% per year. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the base case G5 Mobile CGM vs SMBG was $33,789 CAD/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses showed that base case results were most sensitive to changes in percentage reduction in hypoglycemic events and disutilities associated with hypoglycemic events.

This study aimed at estimating the CE of LVAD compared with medical management in the French health system. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual patient data from the ''French hospital discharge database'' (Medicalization of information systems program) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier method. Outcomes were time to death, time to heart transplantation (HTx), and time to death after HTx. A micro-costing method was used to calculate the monthly costs extracted from the Program for the Medicalization of Information Systems. A multistate Markov monthly cycle model was developed to assess CE. The analysis over a lifetime horizon was performed from the perspective of the French healthcare payer; discount rates were 4%. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental CE ratio (ICER). Mean QALY for an LVAD patient was 1.5 at a lifetime cost of euro190 739, delivering a probabilistic ICER of euro125 580/QALY [95% confidence interval: 105 587 to 150 314]. The sensitivity analysis showed that the ICER was mainly sensitive to two factors: (i) the high acquisition cost of the device and (ii) the device performance in terms of patient survival.

18263,"Modeling cost-effectiveness and health gains of a ""universal"" versus ""prioritized"" hepatitis C virus treatment policy in a real-life cohort","We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of two alternative direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment policies in a real-life cohort of hepatitis C virus-infected patients: policy 1, ""universal,"" treat all patients, regardless of fibrosis stage; policy 2, treat only ""prioritized"" patients, delay treatment of the remaining patients until reaching stage F3. A liver disease progression Markov model, which used a lifetime horizon and health care system perspective, was applied to the PITER cohort (representative of Italian hepatitis C virus-infected patients in care). Specifically, 8,125 patients naive to DAA treatment, without clinical, sociodemographic, or insurance restrictions, were used to evaluate the policies'' cost-effectiveness. The patients'' age and fibrosis stage, assumed DAA treatment cost of euro15,000/patient, and the Italian liver disease costs were used to evaluate quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of policy 1 versus policy 2. To generalize the results, a European scenario analysis was performed, resampling the study population, using the mean European country-specific health states costs and mean treatment cost of euro30,000. For the Italian base-case analysis, the cost-effective ICER obtained using policy 1 was euro8,775/QALY. ICERs remained cost-effective in 94%-97% of the 10,000 probabilistic simulations. For the European treatment scenario the ICER obtained using policy 1 was euro19,541.75/QALY. ICER was sensitive to variations in DAA costs, in the utility value of patients in fibrosis stages F0-F3 post-sustained virological response, and in the transition probabilities from F0 to F3. The ICERs decrease with decreasing DAA prices, becoming cost-saving for the base price (euro15,000) discounts of at least 75% applied in patients with F0-F2 fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Extending hepatitis C virus treatment to patients in any fibrosis stage improves health outcomes and is cost-effective; cost-effectiveness significantly increases when lowering treatment prices in early fibrosis stages.

18264,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir + sofosbuvir versus sofosbuvir + ribavirin for patients with genotype 3 hepatitis C virus,"BACKGROUND: As treatments for chronic hepatitis C are moving away from interferon-containing regimens, the most appropriate allocation of resources to higher cost, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens needs to be assessed. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 is associated with faster disease progression and has fewer treatment options, historically, than other HCV genotypes. This analysis aims to estimate the comparative cost-effectiveness of two recently licenced interferon-free regimens for the treatment of HCV genotype 3. METHODS: Utilising a published Markov model and results of a matching-adjusted indirect comparison of recently published clinical trial data (ALLY-3 and VALENCE, respectively), 12 weeks of treatment with daclatasvir + sofosbuvir (DCV + SOF) was compared to 24 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin (SOF + RBV). UK-specific model inputs were used to inform a cost-utility analysis of these regimens. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, DCV + SOF was found to be dominant over SOF + RBV in treatment-naive patients, patients that had previously been treated, and patients that are intolerant to, or ineligible for, interferon-containing regimens. Given the low rates of treatment currently observed in the UK, DCV + SOF was also compared to no treatment in the interferon-ineligible/intolerant patients, and may be considered cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound8817.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 is associated with faster disease progression and has fewer treatment options, historically, than other HCV genotypes. This analysis aims to estimate the comparative cost-effectiveness of two recently licenced interferon-free regimens for the treatment of HCV genotype 3.

18268,Incremental net monetary benefit of ocrelizumab relative to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a,"AIM: Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) impact the natural history of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by reducing annual relapse rates and slowing disability progression. The effect of DMTs on indirect costs has not been consistently explored in cost-effectiveness studies thus far. The value to patients of an emerging DMT, ocrelizumab, was quantified in comparison to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (IFNbetaSC) for the prevalent RRMS population with mild-to-moderate disability in the US, based on two Phase 3 trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, of ocrelizumab vs IFNbetaSC in RRMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare disability progression as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and relapse outcomes over a 30-year horizon for ocrelizumab vs IFNbetaSC. Direct, indirect, and informal costs (2016 US dollars) and utilities for EDSS health states were obtained from the literature. Hazard ratios for disability progression and relapse rates were estimated from clinical trials. Value was assessed by calculating the net monetary benefit (NMB), defined as the monetary value of discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) minus total costs, where the value of a QALY was $150,000. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Ocrelizumab was associated with an incremental gain of 0.84 QALYs and cost savings of $287,713 relative to IFNbetaSC, resulting in an incremental NMB (INMB) of $413,611 per person over 30 years. The INMB increased by $151,763 for those initiating ocrelizumab at EDSS level 1 vs level 4. Influential parameters were QALY value, treatment costs, and disability progression; however, all sensitivity analyses indicated that the INMB for ocrelizumab relative to IFNbetaSC was >/=$300,000 per person. CONCLUSIONS: Ocrelizumab provides greater value to RRMS patients compared with IFNbetaSC. Initiating ocrelizumab at lower EDSS levels leads to a greater cumulative value due to slower disability progression, which extends years with higher quality-of-life.",2017-01-25083,28726530,J Med Econ,Melissa A Frasco,2017,20 / 10,1074-1082,Yes,28726530,"Melissa A Frasco; Tiffany Shih; Devin Incerti; Oliver Diaz Espinosa; Diana K Vania; Nina Thomas; Incremental net monetary benefit of ocrelizumab relative to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, J Med Econ, 2017 Oct; 20(10):1369-6998; 1074-1082",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ocrelizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Interferon b-1a subcutaneous.,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-346642.17,United States,2016,-373800.79

The study aimed at determining the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the use of DTG+backbone compared with raltegravir (RAL)+backbone, darunavir (DRV)+ritonavir(r)+backbone and efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC) in HIV-positive treatment-naive patients and compared with RAL+backbone in treatment-experienced patients, from the Italian National Health Service''s point of view. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A published Monte Carlo Individual Simulation Model (ARAMIS-DTG model) was used to perform the analysis. Patients pass through mutually exclusive health states (defined in terms of diagnosis of HIV with or without opportunistic infections [OIs] and cardiovascular disease [CVD]) and successive lines of therapy.

18283,Cost-Effectiveness of Surveillance for Distant Recurrence in Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma,"BACKGROUND: Optimal distant recurrence (DR) surveillance strategies for extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are unknown. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of different imaging modalities performed at guideline-specified intervals. METHODS: We developed a Markov model simulating lifetime outcomes for 54-year-old patients after definitive treatment for American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II-III extremity STS using four surveillance strategies: watchful waiting (WW), chest X-ray (CXR), chest computed tomography (CCT), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT). Probabilities, utilities, and costs were extracted from the literature and Medicare claims to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). RESULTS: CCT was the most effective and most costly strategy with CXR the most cost-effective strategy at a societal willing-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER was $12,113/QALY for CXR versus $104,366/QALY for CCT while PET/CT was never cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated CCT becomes the preferred imaging modality as the lifetime risk of DR increases beyond 33% or as the WTP increases beyond $120,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal DR surveillance imaging for stage II-III extremity STS should be individualized based on patients'' risks for DR.

The aim of this study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin treatment for patients with ACS based on the recently completed IMPROVE-IT trial. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to evaluate the costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) associated with co-therapy compared with simvastatin alone from a health care perspective. We ran separate base-case analyses assuming a trial-length and longer term follow-up. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: In the trial-length model, the ICERs compared with simvastatin alone were $114,400 per QALY for the combination therapy. In 5- and 10-year time horizons, the ICERs remained above the cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 per QALY.

18289,Cost-Effectiveness of Simvastatin Plus Ezetimibe for Cardiovascular Prevention in Patients With a History of Acute Coronary Syndrome: Analysis of Results of the IMPROVE-IT Trial,"BACKGROUND: Simvastatin plus ezetimibe reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International (IMPROVE-IT) study. The aim of this study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin treatment for patients with ACS based on the recently completed IMPROVE-IT trial. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to evaluate the costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) associated with co-therapy compared with simvastatin alone from a health care perspective. We ran separate base-case analyses assuming a trial-length and longer term follow-up. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: In the trial-length model, the ICERs compared with simvastatin alone were $114,400 per QALY for the combination therapy. In 5- and 10-year time horizons, the ICERs remained above the cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 per QALY. In the lifetime horizon model, The ICER was $45,046 per QALY for combination treatment compared with simvastatin alone. The combination therapy is cost-effective at an 80% decrease in the current branded simvastatin and ezetimibe cost. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested simvastatin and ezetimibe co-therapy would be a cost-effective alternative to simvastatin monotherapy 60.7% of the time.

18290,Routine intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy is a cost-effective approach when analysing the cost of iatrogenic bile duct injuries,"BACKGROUND: The total cost of bile duct injuries (BDIs) in an unselected national cohort of patients undergoing cholecystectomy are unknown. The aim was to evaluate costs associated with treatment of cholecystectomy-related BDIs and to calculate cost effectiveness of routine vs. on-demand intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). METHODS: Data from Swedish patients suffering a BDI during a 5 year period were analysed. Questionnaires to investigate loss-of-production and health status (EQ-5D) were distributed to patients who suffered a BDI during cholecystectomy and who underwent uneventful cholecystectomy (matched control group). Costs per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained by intraoperative diagnosis were estimated for two strategies: routine versus on-demand IOC during cholecystectomy. RESULTS: Intraoperative diagnosis, immediate intraoperative repair, and minor BDI were all associated with reduced direct treatment costs compared to postoperative diagnosis, delayed repair, and major BDI (all p < 0.001). No difference was noted in loss-of-production for minor versus major BDIs or between different treatment strategies. The cost per QALY gained with routine intraoperative cholangiography (ICER-incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) to achieve intraoperative diagnosis was euro50,000. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative detection and immediate intraoperative repair is the superior strategy with less than half the cost and superior functional patient outcomes than postoperative diagnosis and delayed repair.

18299,Would a Large tPA Trial for Those 4.5 to 6.0 Hours from Stroke Onset Be Good Value for Information?,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the potential value of new research in patients treated with thrombolytic treatment (tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]) in the 4.5- to 6.0-hour time window after stroke onset and to determine the optimal size of a future trial using value of information analysis. METHODS: Expected value of partial perfect and sample information (EVPPI and EVSI) analyses were conducted using a probabilistic Markov model. Data for modified Rankin Scale (mRS) distributions in patients 4.5 to 6.0 hours since stroke onset for tPA (n = 576) and placebo (n = 543) were obtained from pooled randomized controlled trials. EVSI was quantified with net monetary benefit (assuming willingness to pay for health as $100,000/QALY). We calculated discounted population-level EVSI by multiplying per-person EVSI by the annual number of eligible patients with stroke in the United States and assuming a 10-year time frame of treatment use. Study costs were based on administrative costs and the costs of tPA. RESULTS: The base-case lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis showed that tPA was dominated by placebo in this patient group. EVPPI for mRS distributions was $1003 per person. On the basis of EVSI, the optimal sample size of a new trial collecting data on tPA efficacy in these patients would be 5600 across study arms with expected population-level societal returns (EVSI minus study costs) of $68.7 million. CONCLUSIONS: Expanding research attention to the 4.5- to 6.0-hour time window for tPA treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke is justified because the expected returns are substantial.

18300,Cost-effectiveness of intraoperative nerve monitoring in avoidance of bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) provides dynamic neural information and is recommended for high-risk thyroid surgery. In this analysis, the cost-effectiveness of IONM in preventing bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury was investigated. METHODS: A Markov chain model was constructed based on IONM use. The base-case patient was defined as a 40-year-old woman presenting with a 4.1-cm left-sided papillary thyroid cancer who developed RLN injury with loss of monitoring signal during planned bilateral thyroidectomy. It was hypothesized that, if the surgeon had used IONM, the RLN injury would have been detected and the operation would have been concluded as a thyroid lobectomy to avoid the risk of contralateral RLN injury. Cost in US dollars was converted to euros; probabilities and utility scores were identified from the literature and government resources. Length of follow-up was set as 20 years, and willingness-to-pay (WTP) as euro38 000 (US $50 000) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: At the end of year 20, the not using IONM strategy accrued euro163 995.40 (US $215 783.43) and an effectiveness of 14.15 QALYs, whereas use of the IONM strategy accrued euro170 283.68 (US $224 057.48) and an effectiveness of 14.33 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing use versus no use of IONM, was euro35 285.26 (US $46 427.97) per QALY, which is below the proposed WTP, indicating that IONM is the preferred and cost-effective management plan. A Monte Carlo simulation test that considered variability of the main study factors in a hypothetical sample of 10 000 patients showed IONM to be the preferred strategy in 85.8 per cent of the population.
