21001,Cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for Clostridioides difficile infection -an evaluation of the 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). However, there is little guidance regarding which treatments are cost-effective. METHODS: We used a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with an initial CDI diagnosis. We used the model to estimate the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the recently published 2018 IDSA guidelines. The model includes stratification by the severity of the initial infection, and subsequent likelihood of cure, recurrence, mortality, and outcomes of subsequent recurrences. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Use of fidaxomicin for non-severe initial CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and FMT for subsequent recurrence (Strategy 44) cost an additional $478 for 0.009 QALYS gained per CDI patient, resulting in an ICER of $31,751 per QALY, below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. This is the optimal, cost-effective CDI treatment strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Metronidazole is suboptimal for non-severe CDI as it is less beneficial than alternative strategies. The preferred treatment regimen is fidaxomicin for non-severe CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and FMT for subsequent recurrence. The most effective treatments, with highest cure rates, are also cost-effective due to averted mortality, utility loss, and costs of re-hospitalization and/or further treatments for recurrent CDI.",2019-01-29784,31001619,Clin Infect Dis,Radha Rajasingham,2019,/,,No,31001619,"Radha Rajasingham; Eva A Enns; Alexander Khoruts; Byron P Vaughn; Cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for Clostridioides difficile infection -an evaluation of the 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, Clin Infect Dis, 2019 Jun 18; ():1537-6591",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"Vancomycin vs. Metronidazole and Vancomycin; Metronidazole for nonsevere CDI, Vancomycin for severe CDI, Vancomycin for First Recurrence and second or last recurrence",Not Stated,Not Stated,68 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 1 year",3.00,3.00,2537,United States,2018,2614.84

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each NOAC in a Thai health care environment, a country with upper middle-income economies based on the World Bank''s classification. METHOD: A lifetime Markov model was created from a Thai societal perspective. The model consisted of 19 health states separated into two cycles: event cycle and consequence cycle. The consequences of AF included in the model were ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, extracranial haemorrhage, and myocardial infarction. All NOACs available in Thailand (dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily; rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily; apixaban 5 mg twice daily; edoxaban 60 mg and 30 mg once daily) were assessed using warfarin with an international normalised ratio of 2-3 as the reference. Inputs were a combination of published literature and local data when available. A willingness-to-pay of 160,000 Thai baht (THB)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used as the threshold of being cost-effective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. RESULTS: All NOACs were not cost-effective strategies for the Thai AF population. The ranking of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from lowest to highest were apixaban 5 mg twice daily (THB 692,136 or US$21,862) followed by edoxaban 60 mg once daily (THB 911,772 or US$28,799), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (THB 913,749 or US$28,861), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (THB 1,102,106 or US$34,811), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (THB 1,195,347 or US$37,756), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (THB 1,347,650 or US$42,566). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that apixaban had the highest potential to be a cost-effective strategy versus other NOACs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that all NOACs were not cost-effective in the Thai AF population. Of the NOACs, apixaban may be the most likely to be cost-effective.

METHOD: A lifetime Markov model was created from a Thai societal perspective. The model consisted of 19 health states separated into two cycles: event cycle and consequence cycle. The consequences of AF included in the model were ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, extracranial haemorrhage, and myocardial infarction. All NOACs available in Thailand (dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily; rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily; apixaban 5 mg twice daily; edoxaban 60 mg and 30 mg once daily) were assessed using warfarin with an international normalised ratio of 2-3 as the reference. Inputs were a combination of published literature and local data when available. A willingness-to-pay of 160,000 Thai baht (THB)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used as the threshold of being cost-effective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. RESULTS: All NOACs were not cost-effective strategies for the Thai AF population. The ranking of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from lowest to highest were apixaban 5 mg twice daily (THB 692,136 or US$21,862) followed by edoxaban 60 mg once daily (THB 911,772 or US$28,799), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (THB 913,749 or US$28,861), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (THB 1,102,106 or US$34,811), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (THB 1,195,347 or US$37,756), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (THB 1,347,650 or US$42,566). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that apixaban had the highest potential to be a cost-effective strategy versus other NOACs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that all NOACs were not cost-effective in the Thai AF population. Of the NOACs, apixaban may be the most likely to be cost-effective. These data may be useful for policymakers to perform a comprehensive evaluation of these agents for formulary decision and pricing negotiation.",2019-01-29786,31000364,Heart Lung Circ,Piyameth Dilokthornsakul,2019,/,,No,31000364,"Piyameth Dilokthornsakul; Surakit Nathisuwan; Rungroj Krittayaphong; Aurauma Chutinet; Unchalee Permsuwan; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Versus Warfarin in Thai Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation, Heart Lung Circ, 2019 Mar 27; ():1444-2892",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Edoxaban 30 mg vs. Warfarin (INR 2 - 3),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,913749,Thailand,2017,28448.64
21012,The Cost-Effectiveness of Bimodal Stimulation Compared to Unilateral and Bilateral Cochlear Implant Use in Adults with Bilateral Severe to Profound Deafness,"OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of severe-profoundly deaf adult unilateral cochlear implant (CI) users receive bimodal stimulation; that is, they use a conventional acoustic hearing aid (HA) in their nonimplanted ear. The combination of electric and contralateral acoustic hearing provides additional benefits to hearing and also to general health-related quality of life compared with unilateral CI use. Bilateral CI is a treatment alternative to both unilateral CI and bimodal stimulation in some healthcare systems. The objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of bimodal stimulation compared with other management options for adults with bilateral severe to profound deafness. DESIGN: The economic evaluation took the form of a cost-utility analysis and compared bimodal stimulation (CI+HA) to two treatment alternatives: unilateral and bilateral CI. The analysis used a public healthcare system perspective based on data from the United Kingdom and the United States. Costs and health benefits were identified for both alternatives and estimated across a patient''s lifetime using Markov state transition models. Utilities were based on Health Utilities Index estimates, and health outcomes were expressed in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The results were presented using the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio and the Net Monetary Benefit approach to determine the cost-effectiveness of bimodal stimulation. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored the degree of overall uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation. Deterministic sensitivity analyses and analysis of covariance identified parameters to which the model was most sensitive; that is, whose values had a strong influence on the intervention that was determined to be most cost-effective. A value of information analysis was performed to determine the potential value to be gained from additional research on bimodal stimulation. RESULTS: The base case model showed that bimodal stimulation was the most cost-effective treatment option with a decision certainty of 72 and 67% in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively. Despite producing more QALYs than either unilateral CI or bimodal stimulation, bilateral CI was found not to be cost-effective because it was associated with excessive costs. Compared with unilateral CI, the increased costs of bimodal stimulation were outweighed by the gain in quality of life. Bimodal stimulation was found to cost an extra pound174 per person in the United Kingdom ($937 in the US) and yielded an additional 0.114 QALYs compared with unilateral CI, resulting in an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of pound1521 per QALY gained in the United Kingdom ($8192/QALY in the United States). The most influential variable was the utility gained from the simultaneous use of both devices (CI+HA) compared with Unilateral CI. The value of further research was pound4,383,922 at pound20,000/QALY ($86,955,460 at $50,000/QALY in the United States). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the most cost-effective treatment alternative for adults with bilateral severe to profound deafness from publicly funded healthcare perspectives of the United Kingdom and United States.

21014,Estimating the potential impact of the UK government's sugar reduction programme on child and adult health: modelling study,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of the UK government''s sugar reduction programme on child and adult obesity, adult disease burden, and healthcare costs. DESIGN: Modelling study. SETTING: Simulated scenario based on National Diet and Nutrition Survey waves 5 and 6, England. PARTICIPANTS: 1508 survey respondents were used to model weight change among the population of England aged 4-80 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Calorie change, weight change, and body mass index change were estimated for children and adults. Impact on non-communicable disease incidence, quality adjusted life years, and healthcare costs were estimated for adults. Changes to disease burden were modelled with the PRIMEtime-CE Model, based on the 2014 population in England aged 18-80. RESULTS: If the sugar reduction programme was achieved in its entirety and resulted in the planned sugar reduction, then the calorie reduction was estimated to be 25 kcal/day (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ) for 4-10 year olds (95% confidence interval 23 to 26), 25 kcal/day (24 to 28) for 11-18 year olds, and 19 kcal/day (17 to 20) for adults. The reduction in obesity could represent 5.5% of the baseline obese population of 4-10 year olds, 2.2% of obese 11-18 year olds, and 5.5% of obese 19-80 year olds.

21016,Cost-Utility Analysis of Imaging for Surveillance and Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to compare imaging-based surveillance and diagnostic strategies in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) while taking into account technically inadequate examinations and patient compliance. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A Markov model simulated seven strategies for HCC surveillance and diagnosis in patients with cirrhosis: strategy A, ultrasound (US) for surveillance and CT for diagnosis; strategy B, US for surveillance and complete MRI for diagnosis; strategy C, US for surveillance and CT for inadequate or positive surveillance; strategy D, US for surveillance and complete MRI for inadequate or positive surveillance; strategy E, surveillance and diagnosis with CT followed by complete MRI for inadequate surveillance; strategy F, surveillance and diagnosis with complete MRI followed by CT for inadequate surveillance; and strategy G, surveillance with abbreviated MRI followed by CT for inadequate surveillance or complete MRI for positive surveillance. Two compliance scenarios were evaluated: optimal and conservative. For each scenario, the most cost-effective strategy was based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 (Canadian) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS. Base-case analysis revealed that strategy E was the most cost-effective when compliance was optimal ($13,631/QALY), and strategy G was the most cost-effective when compliance was conservative ($39,681/QALY).

Massive amounts of medical and health resources have been devoted to patients with osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of alendronate, zoledronate, raloxifene, teriparatide, and calcium/vitamin D as treatments for osteoporosis in elderly postmenopausal women in China from the medical system perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed by using TreeAge Pro 2015 software. This model simulated the disease process over 40 years in response to the five investigated therapeutic strategies. Each cycle lasted for 1 year. The model parameters included Chinese epidemiological data, clinical effectiveness, cost, and utility. Total treatment costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated, and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the model. RESULTS: The calcium/vitamin D strategy, zoledronate, alendronate, teriparatide, and raloxifene offered patients 10.24, 10.83, 10.70, 10.88, and 10.54 QALYs at the cost of $3,799.72, $8,425.61, $9,849.89, $34,843.72, and $13,353.33 for over 40 years, respectively. The alendronate and raloxifene strategies were eliminated because they were less effective and more expensive than the other strategies. The base-case analysis revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the zoledronate strategy relative to those of the calcium/vitamin D strategy were $7,864.59/QALY. This result indicated that the zoledronate strategy was more cost-effective than other strategies and was within the willingness-to-pay threshold of China ($28,624/QALY). The ICERs of the teriparatide versus zoledronate strategies were $4,70,797.08/QALY, which exceeded the threshold. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Chinese medical system, zoledronate is more cost-effective than the calcium/vitamin D strategy, alendronate, raloxifene, and teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis in elderly postmenopausal women. Not factoring the parameters of adherence and persistence in, and consequent variability in treatment effectiveness relative risks, seems like a major limitation, but it can be speculated that it would not change the conclusion that zoledronate is the most economical strategy.",2019-01-29811,30994577,Menopause,Na Li,2019,/,,No,30994577,"Na Li; Bin Zheng; Maobai Liu; Haimei Zhou; Lingfen Zhao; Hongfu Cai; Jingze Huang; Cost-effectiveness of antiosteoporosis strategies for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in China, Menopause, 2019 Jul 1; ():1072-3714",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Zoledronate vs. Standard/Usual Care- Calcium/vitamin D,postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,Not Stated,60 Years,Female,Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,7864.59,United States,2017,8303.86

This result indicated that the zoledronate strategy was more cost-effective than other strategies and was within the willingness-to-pay threshold of China ($28,624/QALY). The ICERs of the teriparatide versus zoledronate strategies were $4,70,797.08/QALY, which exceeded the threshold. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Chinese medical system, zoledronate is more cost-effective than the calcium/vitamin D strategy, alendronate, raloxifene, and teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis in elderly postmenopausal women. Not factoring the parameters of adherence and persistence in, and consequent variability in treatment effectiveness relative risks, seems like a major limitation, but it can be speculated that it would not change the conclusion that zoledronate is the most economical strategy.",2019-01-29811,30994577,Menopause,Na Li,2019,/,,No,30994577,"Na Li; Bin Zheng; Maobai Liu; Haimei Zhou; Lingfen Zhao; Hongfu Cai; Jingze Huang; Cost-effectiveness of antiosteoporosis strategies for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in China, Menopause, 2019 Jul 1; ():1072-3714",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Alendronate vs. Other,postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,Not Stated,60 Years,Female,Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,-10956,United States,2017,-11567.94

Massive amounts of medical and health resources have been devoted to patients with osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of alendronate, zoledronate, raloxifene, teriparatide, and calcium/vitamin D as treatments for osteoporosis in elderly postmenopausal women in China from the medical system perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed by using TreeAge Pro 2015 software. This model simulated the disease process over 40 years in response to the five investigated therapeutic strategies. Each cycle lasted for 1 year. The model parameters included Chinese epidemiological data, clinical effectiveness, cost, and utility.

21027,Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in patients 60 years and older with Clostridium difficile infection: cost-effectiveness analysis in Spain,"The cost of treating Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Spain is substantial. Findings from the randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3b/4 EXTEND study showed that an extended-pulsed fidaxomicin (EPFX) regimen was associated with improved sustained clinical cure and reduced recurrence of CDI versus vancomycin in patients aged 60 years and older. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of EPFX versus vancomycin for the treatment of CDI in patients aged 60 years and older from the perspective of the National Health System (NHS) in Spain. We used a Markov model with six health states and 1-year time horizon. Health resources, their unit costs and utilities were based on published sources. Key efficacy data and transition probabilities were obtained from the EXTEND study and published sources. A panel of Spanish clinical experts validated all model assumptions. In the analysis, 0.638 and 0.594 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient were obtained with EPFX and vancomycin, respectively, with a gain of 0.044 QALYs with EPFX. The cost per patient treated with EPFX and vancomycin was estimated to be euro10,046 and euro10,693, respectively, with a saving of euro647 per patient treated with EPFX. For willingness-to-pay thresholds of euro20,000, euro25,000 and euro30,000 per QALY gained, the probability that EPFX was the most cost-effective treatment was 99.3%, 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively. According to our economic model and the assumptions based on the Spanish NHS, EPFX is cost-effective compared with vancomycin for the first-line treatment of CDI in patients aged 60 years and older.",2019-01-29817,30989419,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,Carlos Rubio-Terres,2019,38 / 6,1105-1111,No,30989419,"Carlos Rubio-Terres; Jose Maria Aguado; Benito Almirante; Javier Cobo; Santiago Grau; Miguel Salavert; Elena Gonzalez Antona Sanchez; Cristina Lopez Gutierrez; Dario Rubio-Rodriguez; Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in patients 60 years and older with Clostridium difficile infection: cost-effectiveness analysis in Spain, Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis, 2019 Jun; 38(6):0934-9723; 1105-1111",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin vs. Vancomycin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-14704.55,Euro,2017,-17545.01
21028,Cost-effectiveness of faecal calprotectin used in primary care in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease,"OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, autoimmune, gastrointestinal disorder. Canada has one of the highest prevalence and incidence rates of IBD in the world. Diagnosis is challenging due to the similarity of symptoms to functional gastrointestinal disorders. Faecalcalprotectin (FC) is a biomarker for active mucosal inflammation and has proven effective in the diagnosis of IBD. Our study objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding an FC test compared with standard practice (blood test) in primary care among adult patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. DESIGN: We constructed a decision analytic tree with a 1-year time horizon. The cut-off level of 100 microg/g was used for FC testing. Probabilistic analyses were conducted for the base case and all scenarios. SETTING: Canadian health sector perspective. POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of adult patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms in the primary care setting. INTERVENTIONS: FC test compared with blood test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of FC test expressed as cost per QALY gained compared with blood test and time to IBD diagnosis. RESULTS: FC testing is expected to cost more ($C295.1 vs $C273.9) than standard practice but yield little higher QALY (0.751vs0.750). The ICER of FC test was $C20 323 per QALY. Probabilistic analysis demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $C50 000 per QALY, there was 81.3% probability of FC test being cost-effective. The use of FC test in primary care reduced the time to IBD diagnosis by 40.0 days (95% CI 16.3 to 65.3 days), compared with blood testing alone. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis of short-term outcomes, screening adult patients in primary care using FC test at a cut-off level of 100 microg/g is expected to be cost-effective in Canada.",2019-01-29818,30987989,BMJ Open,Wei Zhang,2019,9 / 4,e027043,No,30987989,"Wei Zhang; Chiew Hsia Wong; Mallory Chavannes; Tima Mohammadi; Greg Rosenfeld; Cost-effectiveness of faecal calprotectin used in primary care in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, BMJ Open , 2019 Apr 25; 9(4):2044-6055; e027043",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Screening",Faecal calprotectin testing strategy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Blood test,adult cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in primary care,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,20323.35,Canada,2017,16527.2
21029,Cost-Effectiveness of Cervical Epidural Steroid Injections: A 3-Month Pilot Study,"Study Design: Retrospective cohort. Objectives: There are conflicting reports on the short- and long-term quality of life (QOL) outcomes and cost-effectiveness of cervical epidural steroid injections (ESIs). The present study analyzes the cost-effectiveness analysis of ESIs versus conservative management for patients with radiculopathy or neck pain in the short term. Methods: Fifty patients who underwent cervical ESI and 29 patients who received physical therapy and pain medication alone for cervical radiculopathy and neck pain of <6 months duration were included. Three-month postoperative health outcomes were assessed based on EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D; measured in quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). Medical costs were estimated using Medicare national payment amounts. Cost/utility ratios and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated to assess for cost-effectiveness. Results: The ESI cohort experienced significant (P < .01) improvement in the EQ-5D score while the control cohort did not (0.13 vs 0.02 QALYs, respectively; P = .01). There were no significant differences in costs between the cohorts. The cost-utility ratio for the ESI cohort was significantly lower ($21 884/QALY gained) than that for the control cohort ($176 412/QALY gained) (P < .01). The ICER for an ESI versus conservative management was negative, indicating that ESIs provide greater improvement in QOL at a lower cost. Conclusions: ESIs provide significant improvement in QOL within 3 months for patients with cervical radiculopathy and neck pain. ESIs are more cost-effective compared than conservative management alone in the shor -term. The durability of these results must be analyzed with longer term cost-utility analysis studies.",2019-01-29825,30984492,Global Spine J,Matthew D Alvin,2019,9 / 2,143-149,No,30984492,"Matthew D Alvin; Vikram Mehta; Hadi Al Halabi; Daniel Lubelski; Edward C Benzel; Thomas E Mroz; Cost-Effectiveness of Cervical Epidural Steroid Injections: A 3-Month Pilot Study, Global Spine J, 2019 Apr; 9(2):2192-5682; 143-149",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Epidural steroid injection vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conservative management,patients with cervical radiculopathy and neck pain,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-5490.62,United States,2017,-5797.29
21030,Cost-Effectiveness of the US Food and Drug Administration Added Sugar Labeling Policy for Improving Diet and Health,"BACKGROUND: Excess added sugars, particularly from sugar-sweetened beverages, are a major risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration mandated the labeling of added sugar content on all packaged foods and beverages. Yet, the potential health impacts and cost-effectiveness of this policy remain unclear. METHODS: A validated microsimulation model (US IMPACT Food Policy model) was used to estimate cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus cases averted, quality-adjusted life-years, policy costs, health care, informal care, and lost productivity (health-related) savings and cost-effectiveness of 2 policy scenarios: (1) implementation of the US Food and Drug Administration added sugar labeling policy (sugar label), and (2) further accounting for corresponding industry reformulation (sugar label+reformulation). The model used nationally representative demographic and dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, disease data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder Database, policy effects and diet-disease effects from meta-analyses, and policy and health-related costs from established sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis accounted for model parameter uncertainties and population heterogeneity. RESULTS: Between 2018 and 2037, the sugar label would prevent 354 400 cardiovascular disease (95% uncertainty interval, 167 000-673 500) and 599 300 (302 400-957 400) diabetes mellitus cases, gain 727 000 (401 300-1 138 000) quality-adjusted life-years, and save $31 billion (15.7-54.5) in net healthcare costs or $61.9 billion (33.1-103.3) societal costs (incorporating reduced lost productivity and informal care costs). For the sugar label+reformulation scenario, corresponding gains were 708 800 (369 200-1 252 000) cardiovascular disease cases, 1.2 million (0.7-1.7) diabetes mellitus cases, 1.3 million (0.8-1.9) quality-adjusted life-years, and $57.6 billion (31.9-92.4) and $113.2 billion (67.3-175.2), respectively.

For the sugar label+reformulation scenario, corresponding gains were 708 800 (369 200-1 252 000) cardiovascular disease cases, 1.2 million (0.7-1.7) diabetes mellitus cases, 1.3 million (0.8-1.9) quality-adjusted life-years, and $57.6 billion (31.9-92.4) and $113.2 billion (67.3-175.2), respectively. Both scenarios were estimated with >80% probability to be cost saving by 2023.

21032,Cost-effectiveness of Short-Course Radiation Therapy vs Long-Course Chemoradiation for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer,"Importance: Although both short-course radiotherapy and long-course chemoradiotherapy have been practiced in parallel for more than 15 years, no cost-effectiveness analysis comparing these 2 approaches in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer has been published. Objective: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of short-course radiotherapy vs long-course chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation used a cost-effectiveness model simulating 10-year outcomes for 1 million hypothetical patients aged 65 years with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with either short-course radiotherapy or long-course chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgery and chemotherapy. Utilities and probabilities from the literature and costs from the Healthcare Bluebook and Medicare fee schedules were used to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. It was assumed that long-course chemoradiotherapy would result in higher rates of low anterior resection (LAR). To model preference-sensitive care, a 2-way sensitivity analysis was conducted in which the utilities of the no-evidence-of-disease (NED) states with LAR and abdominoperineal resection (APR) were simultaneously varied. The analysis was repeated for patients with distal rectal tumors. Analysis was conducted from January to October 2018. Exposures: Short-course radiotherapy and long-course chemoradiotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: Short-course radiotherapy was the cost-effective strategy compared with long-course chemoradiotherapy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $133495 per quality-adjusted life-year). Two-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the cost-effective approach for a given patient depended on the utilities for the NED-LAR and NED-APR states. Assuming that a greater proportion of patients with locally advanced distal tumors undergoing long-course chemoradiotherapy (39%) would proceed to LAR compared with those treated with short-course radiotherapy (19%), long-course chemoradiotherapy was the cost-effective approach (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $61123 per quality-adjusted life-year). Conclusions and Relevance: Short-course radiotherapy was the cost-effective strategy compared with long-course chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

21036,A bronchial-airway gene-expression classifier to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer: Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis,"Bronchoscopy is the safest procedure for lung cancer diagnosis when an invasive evaluation is required after imaging procedures. However, its sensitivity is relatively low, especially for small and peripheral lesions. We assessed benefits and costs of introducing a bronchial gene-expression classifier (BGC) to improve the performance of bronchoscopy and the overall diagnostic process for early detection of lung cancer. We used discrete-event simulation to compare clinical and economic outcomes of two different strategies with the standard practice in former and current smokers with indeterminate nodules: (i) location-based strategy-integrated the BGC to the bronchoscopy indication; (ii) simplified strategy-extended use of bronchoscopy plus BGC also on small and peripheral lesions. Outcomes modeled were rate of invasive procedures, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Compared to the standard practice, the location-based strategy (i) reduced absolute rate of invasive procedures by 3.3% without increasing costs at the current BGC market price. It resulted in savings when the BGC price was less than $3,000. The simplified strategy (ii) reduced absolute rate of invasive procedures by 10% and improved quality-adjusted life expectancy, producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,109 per QALY. In patients with indeterminate nodules, both BGC strategies reduced unnecessary invasive procedures at high risk of adverse events.

We performed a study to project the potential cost-effectiveness of THP vs. TH. STUDY DESIGN: Trial-based cost-utility modeling analysis. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation from a payer perspective using a Markov model with six health states: invasive disease-free survival, non-metastatic recurrence, remission, first-line metastatic, subsequent line metastatic, and death. We parameterized the model using data from both arms in APHINITY extrapolated to a patient''s lifetime horizon. Estimates of health state utilities were based on EQ-5D trial data and the literature, and costs were estimated from government sources and the published literature. The primary outcomes of the model were life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Uncertainty was addressed via univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat population, the model projected improved outcomes (by 0.50 LYs and 0.45 QALYs) and increased costs (by $74 420) for ICERs of $147 774/LY gained and $167 185/QALY gained for PHT vs. HT patients. In the node-positive patient population, the model projected improved outcomes (by 0.86 LYs and 0.76 QALYs) and increased costs (by $66 647) for ICERs of $77 684/LY gained and $87 929/QALY gained. For the hormone-receptor-negative patient population, the model projected health gains, increased costs, and ICERs of $147 022/LY gained and $166 518/QALY gained.

21042,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pertuzumab With Trastuzumab and Chemotherapy Compared to Trastuzumab and Chemotherapy in the Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: The APHINITY trial assessed the effectiveness and the safety of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab and chemotherapy (THP) compared to trastuzumab and chemotherapy (TH) in the adjuvant management of human epidermal growth factor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. We performed a study to project the potential cost-effectiveness of THP vs. TH. STUDY DESIGN: Trial-based cost-utility modeling analysis. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation from a payer perspective using a Markov model with six health states: invasive disease-free survival, non-metastatic recurrence, remission, first-line metastatic, subsequent line metastatic, and death. We parameterized the model using data from both arms in APHINITY extrapolated to a patient''s lifetime horizon. Estimates of health state utilities were based on EQ-5D trial data and the literature, and costs were estimated from government sources and the published literature. The primary outcomes of the model were life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Uncertainty was addressed via univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat population, the model projected improved outcomes (by 0.50 LYs and 0.45 QALYs) and increased costs (by $74 420) for ICERs of $147 774/LY gained and $167 185/QALY gained for PHT vs. HT patients. In the node-positive patient population, the model projected improved outcomes (by 0.86 LYs and 0.76 QALYs) and increased costs (by $66 647) for ICERs of $77 684/LY gained and $87 929/QALY gained. For the hormone-receptor-negative patient population, the model projected health gains, increased costs, and ICERs of $147 022/LY gained and $166 518/QALY gained. The results were sensitive to changes in the model time horizon.

21043,Does the rapid response of an antidepressant contribute to better cost-effectiveness? Comparison between mirtazapine and SSRIs for first-line treatment of depression in Japan,"AIM: Previous studies indicate that mirtazapine is unique in its quick responsiveness compared to other antidepressants. Although some other studies have evaluated its cost-effectiveness, they have not considered its early stage remission rate. The aim of this study was to address this research gap by using precise clinical data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mirtazapine in Japan. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to reflect the week-by-week transition probabilities. The Markov cycle was set as 1 week. While our clinical parameters were obtained largely from existing meta-analyses, cost data were derived from government reports. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year estimated based on the probability sensitivity analyses. The ICERs were estimated at 2, 8, 26, and 52 weeks. RESULTS: In severe depression, the ICERs ranged between JPY 872 153 and 1 772 723. The probability of mirtazapine being cost-effective ranged from 0.75 to 0.99 when the ICER threshold was JPY 5 000 000. In moderate depression, the ICERs ranged between JPY 2 356 499 and 4 770 145. The probability of mirtazapine being cost-effective ranged from 0.55 to 0.83 when the ICER threshold was JPY 5 000 000. CONCLUSION: When considering the early stage efficacy of mirtazapine, it appeared to be cost-effective compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, especially for severe depression and in the early stage treatment in the Japanese setting.

21051,A cohort study of functional electrical stimulation in people with multiple sclerosis demonstrating improvements in quality of life and cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the impact on health-related quality of life of functional electrical stimulation used to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis and to explore cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of patient records was conducted. SETTING: This study used outpatient therapy service as the study setting. SUBJECTS: Data from 82 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis attending for set up with functional electrical stimulation were analysed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were seen at baseline, three and six months for support in use of functional electrical stimulation, and data were collected at baseline and six months. MAIN MEASURES: The EQ-5D-5L and walking speed were collected at baseline and six months after using functional electrical stimulation. The Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Device Scale was collected at six months. EQ-5D-3L utilities were derived and cost-effectiveness analysis was completed utilizing a five-year time horizon and methodology published by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. RESULTS: Significant differences (P < 0.001) were seen in walking speed (baseline 0.670 m/s; with stimulation 0.768 m/s) and maintained over six months (0.772 m/s with stimulation). EQ-5D data significantly improved over six months (baseline 0.486, six months 0.596, P < 0.001) and meaningful mean scores were seen in all aspects of the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Device Scale. However, there were no correlations between measures. In the cost utility analysis, compared to standard care, functional electrical stimulation was more expensive and more effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound6137.

21052,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Lopinavir/Ritonavir Monotherapy Versus Standard Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-1 Infected Patients with Viral Suppression in France (ANRS 140 DREAM),"BACKGROUND: Protease inhibitor monotherapy is a simplified treatment strategy for virally suppressed HIV-positive patients that has the potential for cost savings, as fewer drugs are used than with combination therapy. However, evidence for its economic value is limited. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy followed by treatment intensification in case of viral load rebound versus combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir in HIV-1 infected patients with viral suppression in the ANRS 140 DREAM trial. METHODS: DREAM was conducted in 36 French Hospitals between 2009 and 2013. For each treatment strategy, we estimated the unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted mean costs (in euro, year 2010 values) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient, as well as incremental costs and QALYs per patient. We then assessed uncertainty using the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, scenario analyses and cost-effectiveness price-threshold (CEPT) analysis. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis considering 2009-2013 antiretroviral drug (ARV) prices, adjusted incremental costs and QALYs were - euro3296 (95% confidence interval [CI] - 5202 to - 1391) and 0.006 (95% CI - 0.021 to 0.033), respectively, over 2 years, suggesting that monotherapy was cost-effective with a probability of 100% at various cost-effectiveness thresholds. In scenario analyses considering 2018 ARV prices, monotherapy remained cost-effective but with a lower probability (94% vs. 100% in the base-case analysis). The current price of cART would have to decrease by 34% to be cost-effective with a probability of 95%. CONCLUSION: Monotherapy appears to be cost-effective compared with cART for virologically suppressed HIV-positive patients in France. CEPT analysis is a useful tool to identify the preferred strategy to adopt given that ARV prices change rapidly.

These targets require testing and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). OBJECTIVES: To estimate the ability and costs of testing and treatment for LTBI to reach pre-elimination and elimination targets in California. METHODS: We created an individual-based epidemic model of TB, calibrated to historical cases. We evaluated the effects of increased testing (QuantiFERON-TB Gold) and treatment (three months of isoniazid and rifapentine). We analyzed four test and treat targeting strategies: (1) individuals with medical risk factors (MRF), (2) non-USB, (3) both non-USB and MRF, and (4) all Californians. For each strategy, we estimated the effects of increasing test and treat by a factor of 2, 4, or 10 from the base case. We estimated the number of TB cases occurring and prevented, and net and incremental costs from 2017 to 2065 in 2015 U.S. dollars. Efficacy, costs, adverse events, and treatment dropout were estimated from published data. We estimated the cost per case averted and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the base case, 106,000 TB cases are predicted to 2065. Pre-elimination was achieved by 2065 in three scenarios: a 10-fold increase in the non-USB and persons with MRF (by 2052), and 4- or 10-fold increase in all Californians (by 2058 and 2035, respectively). TB elimination was not achieved by any intervention scenario. The most aggressive strategy, 10-fold in all Californians, achieved a case rate of 8 (95% UI 4-16) per million by 2050. Of scenarios that reached pre-elimination, the incremental net cost was $20 billion (non-USB and MRF) to $48 billion. These had an incremental cost per QALY of $657,000 to $3.1 million.

TB elimination was not achieved by any intervention scenario. The most aggressive strategy, 10-fold in all Californians, achieved a case rate of 8 (95% UI 4-16) per million by 2050. Of scenarios that reached pre-elimination, the incremental net cost was $20 billion (non-USB and MRF) to $48 billion. These had an incremental cost per QALY of $657,000 to $3.1 million. A more efficient but somewhat less effective single-lifetime test strategy reached as low as $80,000 per QALY.

These targets require testing and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). OBJECTIVES: To estimate the ability and costs of testing and treatment for LTBI to reach pre-elimination and elimination targets in California. METHODS: We created an individual-based epidemic model of TB, calibrated to historical cases. We evaluated the effects of increased testing (QuantiFERON-TB Gold) and treatment (three months of isoniazid and rifapentine). We analyzed four test and treat targeting strategies: (1) individuals with medical risk factors (MRF), (2) non-USB, (3) both non-USB and MRF, and (4) all Californians. For each strategy, we estimated the effects of increasing test and treat by a factor of 2, 4, or 10 from the base case.

METHODS: A Markov model with limited societal perspective was used to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of reslizumab add-on therapy with standard-of-care (high-dose ICS/LABA) and standard-of-care alone. The model adopted a 4 week cycle with the following six health states over a lifetime (60 years): controlled asthma, uncontrolled asthma, moderate exacerbation, severe exacerbation, all-cause death and asthma-related death. The population comprised adult patients (age >/=18 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma (eosinophils >/=400 cells/muL) at Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 4 or 5 who had experienced at least three exacerbations in the preceding year. Model inputs were sourced from individual patient-level data from two 52 week randomized controlled trials of reslizumab (NCT01287039, NCT01285323). The model included discontinuation rules where patients uncontrolled with reslizumab add-on therapy were transitioned to the standard-of-care arm. Costs and QALYs were annually discounted at 5%. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Reslizumab add-on therapy was associated with increased cost (US$119,394) and improved QALYs (5.17) compared with standard-of-care alone, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$23,081 per QALY gained.

METHODS: Prior to a 4-month pulmonary rehabilitation programme, 81 muscle-wasted COPD patients (51% males, aged 62.5 +/- 0.9 years) with moderate airflow obstruction (FEV1 55.1 +/- 2.2% predicted) and impaired exercise capacity (Wmax 63.5 +/- 2.4% predicted) were randomized to 3 portions of nutritional supplementation per day (enriched with leucine, vitamin D and polyunsaturated fatty acids) [NUTRITION] or PLACEBO (phase 1). In the unblinded 8-month maintenance phase (phase 2), both groups received structured feedback on their physical activity level assessed by accelerometry. NUTRITION additionally received 1 portion of supplemental nutrition per day and motivational interviewing-based nutritional counselling. A 3-month follow-up (phase 3) was included. RESULTS: After 12 months, physical capacity measured by quadriceps muscle strength and cycle endurance time were not different, but physical activity was higher in NUTRITION than in PLACEBO (Delta1030 steps/day, p = 0.025). Plasma levels of the enriched nutrients (p < 0.001) were higher in NUTRITION than PLACEBO. Trends towards weight gain in NUTRITION and weight loss in PLACEBO led to a significant between-group difference after 12 months (Delta1.54 kg, p = 0.041). The HADS anxiety and depression scores improved in NUTRITION only (Delta-1.92 points, p = 0.037). Generic quality of life (EQ-5D) was decreased in PLACEBO but not in NUTRITION (between-group difference after 15 months 0.072 points, p = 0.009). Overall motivation towards exercising and healthy eating was high and did not change significantly after 12 months; only amotivation towards healthy eating yielded a significant between-group difference (Delta1.022 points, p = 0.015). The cost per quality-adjusted life-year after 15 months was EUR 16,750.

NUTRITION additionally received 1 portion of supplemental nutrition per day and motivational interviewing-based nutritional counselling. A 3-month follow-up (phase 3) was included. RESULTS: After 12 months, physical capacity measured by quadriceps muscle strength and cycle endurance time were not different, but physical activity was higher in NUTRITION than in PLACEBO (Delta1030 steps/day, p = 0.025). Plasma levels of the enriched nutrients (p < 0.001) were higher in NUTRITION than PLACEBO. Trends towards weight gain in NUTRITION and weight loss in PLACEBO led to a significant between-group difference after 12 months (Delta1.54 kg, p = 0.041). The HADS anxiety and depression scores improved in NUTRITION only (Delta-1.92 points, p = 0.037). Generic quality of life (EQ-5D) was decreased in PLACEBO but not in NUTRITION (between-group difference after 15 months 0.072 points, p = 0.009). Overall motivation towards exercising and healthy eating was high and did not change significantly after 12 months; only amotivation towards healthy eating yielded a significant between-group difference (Delta1.022 points, p = 0.015). The cost per quality-adjusted life-year after 15 months was EUR 16,750.

21074,"Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an adjunctive personalised psychosocial intervention in treatment-resistant maintenance opioid agonist therapy: a pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder is a chronic, debilitating, and costly disorder that has increased in prevalence in many countries, with an associated sharp rise in mortality. Maintenance opioid agonist therapy is the first-line treatment, but many patients do not stop using illicit or non-prescribed drugs concomitantly. We aimed to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a personalised psychosocial intervention implemented with a toolkit of behaviour-change techniques as an adjunct to opioid agonist therapy. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial at a specialist UK National Health Service community addictions clinic in London, UK. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, met criteria for opioid or cocaine dependence, or both, in the past 12 months, and voluntarily sought continued oral maintenance opioid agonist therapy, which they had been prescribed for at least 6 weeks. All participants were treatment resistant (ie, had used illicit or non-prescribed opioids or cocaine on one or more days in the past 28 days at study screening, which was verified by positive urine drug screen). Participants were allocated (1:1) by a web-accessed randomisation sequence (stratified by opioid agonist medication, current cocaine use, and current rug use) to receive a personalised psychosocial intervention (comprising a flexible toolkit of psychological-change methods, including contingency management to reinforce abstinence, recovery activities, and clinic attendance) in addition to treatment as usual, or treatment as usual only (control group). The primary outcome was treatment response at 18 weeks, which was defined as abstinence from illicit and non-prescribed opioids and cocaine in the past 28 days, as measured with treatment outcomes profiles and urine drug screening. Taking a societal cost perspective, we did an evaluation of cost-effectiveness with a wide range of willingness-to-pay values for a unit improvement in the probability of treatment response. We also calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Efficacy was analysed in a modified-intention-to-treat population, including all participants who were randomly allocated but excluding those who had previously completed the intervention. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN69313751. The trial is completed. FINDINGS: Between June 7, 2013, and Dec 21, 2015, we randomly allocated 136 participants to the psychosocial intervention group and 137 to the control group. The trial database was locked on April 19, 2017. Three patients (one in the psychosocial intervention group and two in the control group) who were re-randomised in error were excluded from the analysis. 22 (16%) of 135 patients in the psychosocial intervention group had a treatment response, compared with nine (7%) of 135 in the control group (adjusted log odds 1.20 [95% CI 0.01-2.37]; p=0.048). The psychosocial intervention had a higher probability of being cost-effective than treatment as usual. There was a probability range of 47-87% for willingness-to-pay thresholds of pound0-1000 for a unit improvement in the probability of treatment response. QALYs were higher in the psychosocial intervention group than in the control group (mean difference 0.048 [95% CI 0.016-0.080]; p=0.004) in adjusted analyses, with 60% and 67% probabilities of cost-effectiveness at the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence''s willingness-to-pay thresholds of pound20 000 and pound30 000 per QALY, respectively. The number of adverse events was similar between groups, and no severe adverse events in either group were judged to be treatment related. One participant in the control group was hospitalised with drug-injection-related sepsis and died. INTERPRETATION: In maintenance opioid agonist therapy, an adjunctive personalised psychosocial intervention in addition to standard therapy was efficacious and cost-effective compared with standard therapy alone at helping treatment-resistant patients abstain from using illicit and non-prescribed opioids and cocaine.

21075,A Cost-Effectiveness Model for Adjunctive Smoked Cannabis in the Treatment of Chronic Neuropathic Pain,"Background: A recent meta-analysis affirmed the benefit of medicinal cannabis for chronic neuropathic pain, a disabling and difficult-to-treat condition. As medicinal cannabis use is becoming increasingly prevalent among Americans, an exploration of its economic feasibility is warranted. We present this cost-effectiveness analysis of adjunctive cannabis pharmacotherapy for chronic peripheral neuropathy. Materials and Methods: A published Markov model comparing conventional therapies for painful diabetic neuropathy was modified to include arms for augmenting first-line, second-line (if first-line failed), or third-line (if first- and second-line failed) therapies with smoked cannabis. Microsimulation of 1,000,000 patients compared the cost (2017 U.S. dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of usual care with and without adjunctive cannabis using a composite of third-party and out-of-pocket costs. Model efficacy inputs for cannabis were adapted from clinical trial data. Adverse event rates were derived from a prospective study of cannabis for chronic noncancer pain and applied to probability inputs for conventional therapies. Cannabis cost was derived from retail market pricing. Parameter uncertainty was addressed with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Adding cannabis to first-line therapy was incrementally less effective and costlier than adding cannabis to second-line and third-line therapies. Third-line adjunctive cannabis was subject to extended dominance, that is, the second-line strategy was more effective with a more favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $48,594 per QALY gained, and therefore, third-line adjunctive cannabis was not as cost-effective. At a modest willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained, second-line adjunctive cannabis was the strategy most likely to be cost-effective. Conclusion: As recently proposed willingness-to-pay thresholds for the United States health marketplace range from $110,000 to $300,000 per QALY, cannabis appears cost-effective when augmenting second-line treatment for painful neuropathy.

21078,Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injection regimens in children and young people at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: pragmatic randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost utility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens during the first year following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young people. DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation. SETTING: 15 paediatric National Health Service (NHS) diabetes services in England and Wales. The study opened to recruitment in May 2011 and closed in January 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged between 7 months and 15 years, with a new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were eligible to participate. Patients who had a sibling with the disease, and those who took drug treatments or had additional diagnoses that could have affected glycaemic control were ineligible. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised, stratified by age and treating centre, to start treatment with CSII or MDI within 14 days of diagnosis. Starting doses of aspart (CSII and MDI) and glargine or detemir (MDI) were calculated according to weight and age, and titrated according to blood glucose measurements and according to local clinical practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was glycaemic control (as measured by glycated haemoglobin; HbA1c) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were percentage of patients in each treatment arm with HbA1c within the national target range, incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, change in height and body mass index (as measured by standard deviation scores), insulin requirements (units/kg/day), partial remission rate (insulin dose adjusted HbA1c <9), paediatric quality of life inventory score, and cost utility based on the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from an NHS costing perspective. RESULTS: 294 participants were randomised and 293 included in intention to treat analyses (CSI, n=144; MDI, n=149). At 12 months, mean HbA1c was comparable with clinically unimportant differences between CSII and MDI participants (60.9 mmol/mol v 58.5 mmol/mol, mean difference 2.4 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval -0.4 to 5.3), P=0.09). Achievement of HbA1c lower than 58 mmol/mol was low among the two groups (66/143 (46%) CSII participants v 78/142 (55%) MDI participants; relative risk 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.06)). Incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were low in both groups. Fifty four non-serious and 14 serious adverse events were reported during CSII treatment, and 17 non-serious and eight serious adverse events during MDI treatment. Parents (but not children) reported superior PedsQL scores for those patients treated with CSII compared to those treated with MDI. CSII was more expensive than MDI by pound1863 (euro2179; $2474; 95% confidence interval pound1620 to pound2137) per patient, with no additional QALY gains (difference -0.006 (95% confidence interval -0.031 to 0.018)). CONCLUSION: During the first year following type 1 diabetes diagnosis, no clinical benefit of CSII over MDI was identified in children and young people in the UK setting, and treatment with either regimen was suboptimal in achieving HbA1c thresholds. CSII was not cost effective.

21079,Randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation of a task-based weight management group programme,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a rising global threat to health and a major contributor to health inequalities. Weight management programmes that are effective, economical and reach underprivileged groups are needed. We examined whether a multi-modal group intervention structured to cater for clients from disadvantaged communities (Weight Action Programme; WAP) has better one-year outcomes than a primary care standard weight management intervention delivered by practice nurses (PNI). METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, 330 obese adults were recruited from general practices in London and allocated (2:1) to WAP (N = 221) delivered over eight weekly group sessions or PNI (N = 109) who received four sessions over eight weeks. Both interventions covered diet, physical activity and self-monitoring. The primary outcome was the change in weight from baseline at 12 months. To indicate value to the NHS, a cost effectiveness analysis estimated group differences in cost and Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) related to WAP. RESULTS: Participants were recruited from September 2012 to January 2014 with follow-up completed in February 2015. Most participants were not in paid employment and 60% were from ethnic minorities. 88% of participants in each study arm provided at least one recorded outcome and were included in the primary analysis. Compared with the PNI, WAP was associated with greater weight loss overall (- 4.2 kg vs. - 2.3 kg; difference = - 1.9 kg, 95% CI: -3.7 to - 0.1; P = 0.04) and was more likely to generate a weight loss of at least 5% at 12 months (41% vs. 27%, OR = 14.61 95% CI: 2.32 to 91.96, P = 0.004). With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound7742/QALY, WAP would be considered highly cost effective compared to PNI. CONCLUSIONS: The task-based programme evaluated in this study can provide a template for an effective and economical approach to weight management that can reach clients from disadvantaged communities.

The database included patients ages 65 to 89 who received a Boston Scientific device from 2006 to 2010. Parametric survival equations were derived for rehospitalization and mortality to predict outcomes over a maximum time horizon of 25 years. The analysis assessed rehospitalization, mortality, and the cost-effectiveness (expressed as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year) of remote monitoring versus no remote monitoring. Remote monitoring was associated with reduced mortality; average life expectancy and average quality-adjusted life years increased by 0.77 years and 0.64, respectively (6.85 life years and 5.65 quality-adjusted life years). When expressed per patient-year, remote monitoring patients had fewer subsequent rehospitalizations (by 0.08 per patient-year) and lower hospitalization costs (by $554 per patient year). With longer life expectancies, remote monitoring patients experienced an average of 0.64 additional subsequent rehospitalizations with increased average lifetime hospitalization costs of $2784. Total costs of outpatient and physician claims were higher with remote monitoring ($47 515 vs $42 792), but average per patient-year costs were lower ($6232 vs $6244). The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $10 752 per quality-adjusted life year, making remote monitoring high-value care. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring is a cost-effective approach for the lifetime management of patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.",2019-01-29938,30938894,J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol,James P Hummel,2019,/,,No,30938894,"James P Hummel; Robert J Leipold; Stacey L Amorosi; Haikun Bao; Kristen A Deger; Paul W Jones; Anuraag R Kansal; Lesli S Ott; Sean Stern; Kenneth Stein; Jeptha P Curtis; Joseph G Akar; Outcomes and costs of remote patient monitoring among patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators: An economic model based on the PREDICT RM database, J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, 2019 May 22; ():1540-8167",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Device",Remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,89 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,10752,United States,2017,11352.55
21081,Cost-effectiveness and screening performance of ECG handheld machine in a population screening programme: The Belgian Heart Rhythm Week screening programme,"AIMS: Overall, 40% of patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic. The usefulness and cost-effectiveness of atrial fibrillation screening programmes are debated. We evaluated whether an atrial fibrillation screening programme with a handheld electrocardiogram (ECG) machine in a population-wide cohort has a high screening yield and is cost-effective. METHODS: We used a Markov-model based modelling analysis on 1000 hypothetical individuals who matched the Belgian Heart Rhythm Week screening programme. Subgroup analyses of subjects >/=65 and >/=75 years old were performed. Screening was performed with one-lead ECG handheld machine Omron(R) HeartScan HCG-801. RESULTS: In both overall population and subgroups, the use of the screening procedure diagnosed a consistently higher number of diagnosed atrial fibrillation than not screening. In the base-case scenario, the screening procedure resulted in 106.6 more atrial fibrillation patient-years, resulting in three fewer strokes, 10 more life years and five more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The number needed-to-screen (NNS) to avoid one stroke was 361. In subjects >/=65 years old, we found 80.8 more atrial fibrillation patient-years, resulting in three fewer strokes, four more life-years and five more QALYs. The NNS to avoid one stroke was 354. Similar results were obtained in subjects >/=75 years old, with a NNS to avoid one stroke of 371. In the overall population, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for any gained QALY showed that the screening procedure was cost-effective in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-wide screening cohort, the use of a handheld ECG machine to identify subjects with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was cost-effective in the general population, as well as in subjects >/=65 and subjects >/=75 years old.",2019-01-29943,30935219,Eur J Prev Cardiol,Marco Proietti,2019,26 / 9,964-972,No,30935219,"Marco Proietti; Alessio Farcomeni; Peter Goethals; Christophe Scavee; Johan Vijgen; Ivan Blankoff; Yves Vandekerckhove; Gregory Yh Lip; Georges H Mairesse; Belgian Heart Rhythm Week Invest; Cost-effectiveness and screening performance of ECG handheld machine in a population screening programme: The Belgian Heart Rhythm Week screening programme, Eur J Prev Cardiol , 2019 Jun; 26(9):2047-4881; 964-972",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Screening",Atrial fibrillation screening programme with a handheld electrocardiogram (ECG) machine vs. None,Voluntarily screened,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,24344.5,Euro,2017,29047.11

21100,Cost-Effectiveness and National Effects of Initiating Colorectal Cancer Screening for Average-Risk Persons at Age 45 Years Instead of 50 Years,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The American Cancer Society has recommended initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening at age 45 years instead of 50 years. We estimated the cost effectiveness and national effects of adopting this recommendation. METHODS: We compared screening strategies and alternative resource allocations in a validated Markov model. We based national projections on screening participation rates by age and census data. RESULTS: Screening colonoscopy initiation at age 45 years instead of 50 years in 1000 persons averted 4 CRCs and 2 CRC deaths, gained 14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cost $33,900/QALY gained, and required 758 additional colonoscopies. These 758 colonoscopies could instead be used to screen 231 currently unscreened 55-year-old persons or 342 currently unscreened 65-year-old persons, through age 75 years. These alternatives averted 13-14 CRC cases and 6-7 CRC deaths and gained 27-28 discounted QALYs while saving $163,700-$445,800. Improving colonoscopy completion rates after abnormal results from a fecal immunochemical test yielded greater benefits and savings. Initiation of fecal immunochemical testing at age 45 years instead of 50 years cost $7700/QALY gained. Shifting current age-specific screening rates to 5 years earlier could avert 29,400 CRC cases and 11,100 CRC deaths over the next 5 years but would require 10.7 million additional colonoscopies and cost an incremental $10.4 billion. Improving screening rates to 80% in persons who are 50-75 years old would avert nearly 3-fold more CRC deaths at one third the incremental cost. CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model analysis, we found that starting CRC screening at age 45 years is likely to be cost effective. However, greater benefit, at lower cost, could be achieved by increasing participation rates for unscreened older and higher-risk persons.",2019-01-29954,30930021,Gastroenterology,Uri Ladabaum,2019,157 / 1,137-148,No,30930021,"Uri Ladabaum; Ajitha Mannalithara; Reinier G S Meester; Samir Gupta; Robert E Schoen; Cost-Effectiveness and National Effects of Initiating Colorectal Cancer Screening for Average-Risk Persons at Age 45 Years Instead of 50 Years, Gastroenterology, 2019 Jul; 157(1):0016-5085; 137-148",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Screening","screening starting at age 45 years, colonoscopy every 10 years vs. Colonoscopy every 10 years, ages 50–75 years",Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,33900,United States,2018,34940.06
