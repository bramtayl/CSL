9901,"Comparison of lifetime incremental cost:utility ratios of surgery relative to failed medical management for the treatment of hip, knee and spine osteoarthritis modelled using 2-year postsurgical values","Demand for surgery to treat osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip, knee and spine has risen dramatically. Whereas total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been widely accepted as cost-effective, spine surgeries (decompression, decompression with fusion) to treat degenerative conditions remain underfunded compared with other surgeries.An incremental cost-utility analysis comparing decompression and decompression with fusion to THA and TKA, from the perspective of the provincial health insurance system, was based on an observational matched-cohort study of prospectively collected outcomes and retrospectively collected costs. Patient outcomes were measured using short-form (SF)-36 surveys over a 2-year follow-up period. Utility was modelled over the lifetime, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were determined. We calculated the incremental cost per QALY gained by estimating mean incremental lifetime costs and QALYs of surgery compared with medical management of each diagnosis group after discounting costs and QALYs at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted.The lifetime incremental cost:utility ratios (ICURs) discounted at 3% were $5321 per QALY for THA, $11,275 per QALY for TKA, $2307 per QALY for spinal decompression and $7153 per QALY for spinal decompression with fusion.

9903,Cost utility of tumour necrosis factor-a inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis: an application of Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis in a Markov model,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1.5?million people in the US. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a inhibitors have been shown to effectively treat and maintain remission in patients with moderately to severely active RA compared with conventional agents. The high acquisition cost of TNF-a inhibitors prohibits access, which mandates economic investigations into their affordability. The lack of head-to-head comparisons between these agents makes it difficult to determine which agent is the most cost effective.This study aimed to determine which TNF-a inhibitor was the most cost-effective agent for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA from the US healthcare payer's perspective.A Markov model was constructed to analyse the cost utility of five TNF-a inhibitors (in combination with methotrexate [+MTX]) versus MTX monotherapy using Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis. The model had a cycle length of 3 months and an overall time horizon of 5 years. Transition probabilities and utility scores were based on published studies. Total direct costs were adjusted to year 2009 $US using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. All costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Patient response to the different strategies was determined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)50 criteria. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed to test the robustness of the base-case scenario. The base-case scenario was changed to ACR20 criteria (scenario 1) and ACR70 criteria (scenario 2) to determine the model's robustness. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and cost-effectiveness frontiers were used to estimate the cost-effectiveness probability of each treatment strategy. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was defined as three times the US GDP per capita ($US139,143 per additional QALY gained). Primary results were presented as incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs).Etanercept+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy in the base-case scenario up to a WTP threshold of $US2 185,497 per QALY gained. At a WTP threshold of greater than $US2 185,497 per QALY gained, certolizumab+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy. One-way analyses showed that the base-case scenario was sensitive to the probability of achieving ACR50 criteria for MTX and each TNF-a inhibitor, and changes in the utility score for patients who achieved the ACR50 criteria. With the exception of infliximab, all of the TNF-a inhibitors were sensitive to drug cost per cycle.

9910,Cost utility of tumour necrosis factor-a inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis: an application of Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis in a Markov model,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1.5?million people in the US. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a inhibitors have been shown to effectively treat and maintain remission in patients with moderately to severely active RA compared with conventional agents. The high acquisition cost of TNF-a inhibitors prohibits access, which mandates economic investigations into their affordability. The lack of head-to-head comparisons between these agents makes it difficult to determine which agent is the most cost effective.This study aimed to determine which TNF-a inhibitor was the most cost-effective agent for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA from the US healthcare payer's perspective.A Markov model was constructed to analyse the cost utility of five TNF-a inhibitors (in combination with methotrexate [+MTX]) versus MTX monotherapy using Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis. The model had a cycle length of 3 months and an overall time horizon of 5 years. Transition probabilities and utility scores were based on published studies. Total direct costs were adjusted to year 2009 $US using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. All costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Patient response to the different strategies was determined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)50 criteria. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed to test the robustness of the base-case scenario. The base-case scenario was changed to ACR20 criteria (scenario 1) and ACR70 criteria (scenario 2) to determine the model's robustness. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and cost-effectiveness frontiers were used to estimate the cost-effectiveness probability of each treatment strategy. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was defined as three times the US GDP per capita ($US139,143 per additional QALY gained). Primary results were presented as incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs).Etanercept+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy in the base-case scenario up to a WTP threshold of $US2 185,497 per QALY gained. At a WTP threshold of greater than $US2 185,497 per QALY gained, certolizumab+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy. One-way analyses showed that the base-case scenario was sensitive to the probability of achieving ACR50 criteria for MTX and each TNF-a inhibitor, and changes in the utility score for patients who achieved the ACR50 criteria.

9920,Improving the cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular disease prevention in Australia: a modelling study,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Like many countries, Australia is currently changing its guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention from drug treatment for everyone with 'high blood pressure' or 'high cholesterol', to prevention based on a patient's absolute risk. In this research, we model cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular disease prevention with blood pressure and lipid drugs in Australia under three different scenarios: (1) the true current practice in Australia; (2) prevention as intended under the current guidelines; and (3) prevention according to proposed absolute risk levels. We consider the implications of changing to absolute risk-based cardiovascular disease prevention, for the health of the Australian people and for Government health sector expenditure over the long term. METHODS: We evaluate cost-effectiveness of statins, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers, for Australian men and women, aged 35 to 84 years, who have never experienced a heart disease or stroke event. Epidemiological changes and health care costs are simulated by age and sex in a discrete time Markov model, to determine total impacts on population health and health sector costs over the lifetime, from which we derive cost-effectiveness ratios in 2008 Australian dollars per quality-adjusted life year. RESULTS: Cardiovascular disease prevention based on absolute risk is more cost-effective than prevention under the current guidelines based on single risk factor thresholds, and is more cost-effective than the current practice, which does not follow current clinical guidelines. Recommending blood pressure-lowering drugs to everyone with at least 5% absolute risk and statin drugs to everyone with at least 10% absolute risk, can achieve current levels of population health, while saving $5.4 billion for the Australian Government over the lifetime of the population. But savings could be as high as $7.1 billion if Australia could match the cheaper price of statin drugs in New Zealand.

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a technology that is increasingly used to screen newborns for an increasing number of hereditary metabolic diseases. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is among these diseases. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing MCADD screening in France.We developed a decision model to evaluate, from a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon, the cost-effectiveness of expanding the French newborn screening programme to include MCADD.

One-way sensitivity analyses and worst-case scenario simulation were performed.We estimate that MCADD newborn screening in France would prevent each year five deaths and the occurrence of neurological sequelae in two children under 5 years, resulting in a gain of 128 life years or 138 quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The incremental cost per year is estimated at ?2.5 million, down to ?1 million if this expansion is combined with a replacement of the technology currently used for phenylketonuria screening by MS/MS.

9934,Cost analysis of erlotinib versus chemotherapy for first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer in frail elderly patients participating in a prospective phase 2 study (GFPC 0505),"BACKGROUND: A large proportion of elderly patients (>70 years) with newly diagnosed NSCLC are shown to be frail by a comprehensive geriatric assessment. This population is more vulnerable to adverse effects of chemotherapy and might thus benefit more from targeted therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib followed by chemotherapy after progression, compared with the reverse strategy, in frail elderly patients with advanced NSCLC participating in a prospective randomized phase II trial (GFPC 0505). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outcomes (progression-free survival and overall survival) and costs (limited to direct medical costs, from the third-party payer perspective) were collected prospectively until second progression. Costs after progression and health utilities (based on disease states and grade 3-4 toxicities) were derived from the literature. RESULTS: Median overall survival, QALYs, and total costs for the erlotinib-first strategy were 3.9 months, 0.33, and euro15,233, respectively, compared with 4.4 months, 0.35, and euro15,363 for the chemotherapy-first strategy. There was no significant difference between the 2 strategies in term of cost-effectiveness (respectively euro47,381 and euro44,350 per QALY).

9935,Can simvastatin improve erectile function and health-related quality of life in men aged >/=40 years with erectile dysfunction? Results of the Erectile Dysfunction and Statins Trial [ISRCTN66772971],"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of simvastatin on erectile function and health-related quality of life in men aged >/=40 years with erectile dysfunction (ED). PATIENTS AND METHODS: ED is common in men aged >/=40 years and impacts upon their overall health-related quality of life and that of their partners. Men aged >/=40 years who were not receiving lipid lowering or anti-hypertensive medication and not at high cardiovascular risk were recruited from 10 general practices in the East of England. In total, 173 eligible men with untreated ED were randomized to double-blind treatment with 40 mg of simvastatin or placebo once daily for 6 months. Data were collected at three points over 30 weeks. The main outcome was erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function-5 score). Secondary outcomes included male ED-specific quality of life (MED-QoL), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the generic Euroqol measure (EQ-5D), endothelial function, cardiovascular risk, cholesterol and health service costs. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in erectile function between the simvastatin and placebo groups (mean change, 1.28 vs 0.07, z = 1.1, p = 0.27), although a significant improvement in MED-QoL was observed (5% vs 2%, z = 2.09, p = 0.04). Both 10-year cardiovascular risk and low-density lipoprotein were reduced (cardiovascular risk, z = -3.67, p < 0.001; low-density lipoprotein, z = -5.46, p < 0.001), with no consistent change in endothelial function. The frequency of sexual encounters is correlated with improved erectile function. The joint distribution of costs and QALY benefits indicates that the probability of simvastatin being cost-effective for willingness-to-pay thresholds of pound20,000 and pound30,000 is 86% and 83%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying men with ED provides an opportunity to modify future cardiovascular risk and to improve MED-QoL by treating them with 40 mg of simvastatin. The joint analysis of costs and QALY benefits suggests that there is high probability that simvastatin is a cost-effective strategy in men with ED. The findings could influence urological and primary care practice by including questions on ED during routine consultations and relevant clinical protocols.

9936,Health economic assessment of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with iron deficiency and chronic heart failure based on the FAIR-HF trial: an analysis for the UK,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of iron repletion using intravenous (i.v.) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with iron deficiency with or without anaemia. Cost-effectiveness was studied from the perspective of the National Health Service in the UK.A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was used to compare iron repletion with FCM with no iron treatment. Using data from the FAIR-HF trial and publicly available sources and publications, per patient costs and clinical effectiveness of FCM were estimated compared with placebo. Cost assessment was based on study drug and administration costs, cost of CHF treatment, and hospital length of stay. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of FCM use was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and sensitivity analyses were performed on the base case. The time horizon of the analysis was 24 weeks. Mean QALYs were higher in the FCM arm (difference 0.037 QALYs; bootstrap-based 95% confidence interval 0.017-0.060). The ICER of FCM compared with placebo was ?4414 per QALY gained for the FAIR-HF dosing regimen. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the base case result to be robust.From the UK payers' perspective, managing iron deficiency in CHF patients using i.v. FCM was cost-effective in this analysis. The base case ICER was clearly below the threshold of ?22 200-?33 300/QALY gained (?20 000-?30 000) typically used by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and proved to be robust in sensitivity analysis.

9937,Methods for estimating subgroup effects in cost-effectiveness analyses that use observational data,"Decision makers require cost-effectiveness estimates for patient subgroups. In nonrandomized studies, propensity score (PS) matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) can address overt selection bias, but only if they balance observed covariates between treatment groups. Genetic matching (GM) matches on the PS and individual covariates using an automated search algorithm to directly balance baseline covariates. This article compares these methods for estimating subgroup effects in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA). The motivating case study is a CEA of a pharmaceutical intervention, drotrecogin alfa (DrotAA), for patient subgroups with severe sepsis (n = 2726). Here, GM reported better covariate balance than PS matching and IPTW. For the subgroup at a high level of baseline risk, the probability that DrotAA was cost-effective ranged from 30% (IPTW) to 90% (PS matching and GM), at a threshold of ?20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We then compared the methods in a simulation study, in which initially the PS was correctly specified and then misspecified, for example, by ignoring the subgroup-specific treatment assignment. Relative performance was assessed as bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) in the estimated incremental net benefits. When the PS was correctly specified and inverse probability weights were stable, each method performed well; IPTW reported the lowest RMSE. When the subgroup-specific treatment assignment was ignored, PS matching and IPTW reported covariate imbalance and bias; GM reported better balance, less bias, and more precise estimates. We conclude that if the PS is correctly specified and the weights for IPTW are stable, each method can provide unbiased cost-effectiveness estimates.

9939,Changes to the statin prescribing policy in Belgium: potential impact in clinical and economic terms,"New policies in Belgium encourage prescribing of generic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), but may lead to non-equivalent switching of patients from more potent second generation statins, as has occurred elsewhere. We sought to assess the potential health economic impact of the new policies.This was a cost-effectiveness analysis.A Markov model was constructed to simulate the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death among a representative cohort of 80 Belgian patients initially free of CVD and taking atorvastatin. Cardiovascular risks were estimated from calibrated Framingham equations, and utilities and costs from published data. Decision analysis assessed the potential impact of switching all 80 patients to simvastatin. Changes in lipid levels expected to arise from switching were based on a published meta-analysis.If the 80 patients remained on atorvastatin, the model predicted that 23 (29%) would develop CVD over 20 years. If they were switched to simvastatin, the predicted number was 25 (31%), equating to a 'number needed to harm' of 52. Switching would lead to a net cost saving of ?131 (2012) per subject, but also a loss of 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per subject. These equated to a decremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ?4777 per QALY lost. Sensitivity analyses indicated this result to be robust.Recently introduced statin prescribing policies in Belgium are likely, as intended, to reduce statin costs, but also increase the burden of CVD due to non-equivalent switching.

9940,Economic impact of using additional diagnostic tests to better select patients with stroke for intravenous thrombolysis in the United kingdom,"Eligibility for thrombolysis as an acute stroke treatment is determined through the use of unenhanced noncontrast computed tomography (CT), time since stroke onset, and patient history. Assessing penumbral patterns, which can be examined only through the use of diagnostic technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and perfusion CT (CTP), may be able to better select patients for thrombolysis. However, trade-offs in terms of administration time and cost may affect the value of using these diagnostic studies.We examined the trade-offs among patient selection via usual care with CT, usual care plus MRI using diffusion-weighted and perfusion imaging, and usual care plus CTP for their effect on costs and outcomes when diagnosing stroke and selecting candidates for thrombolysis in the United Kingdom.A decision-analytic model was developed. Efficacy and utilities were obtained from published studies. Costs were obtained from standard UK costing sources and were supplemented with data from the published literature. Outcomes included a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score <2), costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Compared with usual care selection, adding CTP or MRI to better select patients for thrombolysis reduced the number of patients receiving thrombolysis by 9 and 14.6 per 1000 patients treated, respectively, while improving favorable outcome (19.2 and 17.6 per 1000 patients treated, respectively). In both scenarios, costs were decreased slightly. Both CTP and MRI selection were cost saving (more efficacious and less costly) compared with unenhanced CT selection; CTP selection was found to dominate MRI selection.Adding diagnostic tests such as CTP and MRI to select UK patients for thrombolysis may be a good value for the money and may improve patient outcomes.

9944,Cost effectiveness of intrathecal drug therapy in management of chronic nonmalignant pain,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of intrathecal drug therapy (IDT) compared with conventional medical management (CMM) for patients with refractory chronic noncancer pain. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of IDT versus CMM from the perspective of a Canadian provincial Ministry of Health using data from our pain clinic. The model followed costs and outcomes in 6-month cycles. Health effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Resources use included drugs, physician visits, laboratory tests, scans, and hospitalizations. Unit costs were gathered from public sources and were expressed in 2011 Canadian dollars. Costs and effects were evaluated over a time horizon of 10 years and discounted at 5% per annum after the first year. Cost effectiveness was identified by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (50,000 Monte Carlo iterations). RESULTS: Over 10 years, total costs were $61,442 for IDT and $48,408 for CMM. Thus, the incremental effectiveness of IDT was 1.1508 QALYs at an incremental cost of $13,034, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $11,326/QALY gained. The probability of IDT providing a cost-effective alternative to CMM was 50% and 84% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $14,200 and $20,000/QALY, respectively. The results were most sensitive to the cost of CMM, the probability of reaching an optimal health state with dual-drug IDT, and the effectiveness of CMM therapy. Sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust to plausible variations in model costs and effectiveness inputs. DISCUSSION: IDT is cost effective compared with CMM in the management of chronic noncancer pain.",2012-01-09348,22699140,Clin J Pain,Krishna Kumar,2013,29 / 2,,No,22699140,"Krishna Kumar; Syed Rizvi; Sharon Bishop; Cost effectiveness of intrathecal drug therapy in management of chronic nonmalignant pain, Clin J Pain, 2013 Feb; 29(2):0749-8047",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intrathecal drug therapy (IDT) vs. Conventional medical management (CMM),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,11326,Canada,2009,12028.42

The within-trial CEA, including 7,250 patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was performed alongside the 1-yr international randomised controlled Prevention of Exacerbations with Tiotropium (POET)-COPD trial comparing tiotropium with salmeterol regarding the effect on exacerbations. Main end-points of the trial-based analysis were costs, number of exacerbations and exacerbation days. The model-based analysis was conducted to extrapolate results to 5 yrs and to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 1-yr costs per patient from the German statutory health insurance (SHI) perspective and the societal perspective were euro126 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) euro55-195) and euro170 (95% UI euro77-260) higher for tiotropium, respectively.

9947,Cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in prostate cancer,"To compare the costs and effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for the radical treatment of localised prostate cancer at elevated doses (>70 Gy).A cost-effectiveness analysis model was developed using clinical effectiveness estimates from a systematic review. The base case analysis assumes equal biochemical survival for IMRT and 3DCRT, but lower frequency of gastrointestinal toxicity for IMRT. The costs of IMRT and 3DCRT were estimated through activity-based costing, incorporating input from radiation oncologists, physicists and treatment planners.The delivery of IMRT produced 0.023 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) than 3DCRT at an additional cost of $621 (QALY and costs discounted at 5% per year), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $26 768 per QALY gained. The treatment cost of IMRT was $1019 more than 3DCRT, but IMRT resulted in less frequent gastrointestinal toxicity, thus avoiding $402 in the treatment of toxicity. In the scenario that compared a higher dose of IMRT (75.6 Gy) to 3DCRT (68.4 Gy), IMRT improved disease control with equal toxicity incidence, and the IMRT strategy dominated (less costly and more effective). In the base case scenario (no survival difference), the cost-effectiveness of IMRT was most sensitive to the treatment cost difference between IMRT and 3DCRT.For radical radiation treatment (>70 Gy) of prostate cancer, IMRT seems to be cost-effective when compared with an equivalent dose of 3DCRT.",2012-01-09354,22705100,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),J H E Yong,2012,24 / 7,521-31,No,22705100,"J H E Yong; J Beca; T McGowan; K E Bremner; P Warde; J S Hoch; Cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in prostate cancer, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol), ; 24(7):0936-6555; 521-31",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) vs. Conformal rediotherapy (CRT),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,27000,Canada,2009,28674.49

Cost-effectiveness is one of the issues when evaluating LBC. Based on the results of a Dutch randomised controlled trial, we conducted cost-effectiveness threshold analyses to investigate under what circumstances manually screened ThinPrep LBC is cost-effective for screening.The MISCAN-Cervix microsimulation model and data from the Dutch NETHCON trial (including 89,784 women) were used to estimate the costs and (quality-adjusted) life years ((QA)LYs) gained for EU screening schedules, varying cost-effectiveness threshold values.

9950,Economic analysis of epoetin alfa in critically ill trauma patients,"Recent randomized control trials (RCTs) suggest that epoetin alfa reduces mortality in critically ill trauma patients; however, epoetin alfa is also costly and associated with adverse events. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of epoetin alfa in surgical trauma patients in an intensive care unit setting.We constructed a decision analytic model to compare adjunctive use of epoetin alfa with standard care in trauma patients from the perspective of a Canadian payer. Baseline risks of events, relative efficacy, and resource use were obtained from RCTs and observational studies. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted and longer time horizons explored through Markov models.Epoetin alfa was associated with a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $89,958 compared with standard care at 1 year. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that results were sensitive to plausible ranges of mortality risk, risk of thrombosis, relative risk of mortality, relative risk of thrombosis, and quality of life estimates. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves generated from probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the probability that epoetin alfa would be considered attractive ranged from 0% to 85% over a willingness-to-pay range of $25,000 to $120,000/QALY. Consideration of lifetime time horizons reduced the cost per QALY gained to $7,203, but results were sensitive to the effect of epoetin alfa on mortality.Although the cost per QALY gained with epoetin alfa use may fall into an acceptable range, there is significant uncertainty about its true cost-effectiveness.

9951,A cost-utility study of the use of pregabalin added to usual care in refractory neuropathic pain patients in a Swedish setting,"Abstract Objectives: Patients refractory to older therapies for neuropathic pain (NeP) have few remaining therapeutic options. This study evaluates the cost-utility of pregabalin in the treatment of patients with refractory neuropathic pain in Sweden, from a healthcare and a societal perspective. Study limitations: The use of non-randomized (observational) data to determine the effectiveness of treatments for NeP. The use of non-Swedish data for some input parameters in the model. Methods: A previously constructed discrete event simulation model was adapted to compare pregabalin combined with usual care to usual care alone in a Swedish setting. Pain profiles were generated using clinical data from five non-randomized pregabalin studies in refractory NeP patients. Utility data were generated from a UK survey of patients with NeP. Cost data were generated from the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Board (TLV's) product price database, a national NeP register, and a regional registry study. Indirect costs were estimated from published sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty in the model's output. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pregabalin plus usual care treatment compared to usual care was 51,616 SEK/?5364 and 123,993 SEK/?12,886 with and without indirect costs, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses confirmed the clinical input data as the main driver of the model; even considerable changes to all other input parameters had only a modest effect on the ICER. The ICER remained well below a conservative threshold of 347,495 SEK /?36,113/?30,000 in all scenarios modelled.

9953,Simulating school closure policies for cost effective pandemic decision making,"ABSTRACT:Around the globe, school closures were used sporadically to mitigate the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. However, such closures can detrimentally impact economic and social life.Here, we couple a decision analytic approach with a mathematical model of influenza transmission to estimate the impact of school closures in terms of epidemiological and cost effectiveness. Our method assumes that the transmissibility and the severity of the disease are uncertain, and evaluates several closure and reopening strategies that cover a range of thresholds in school-aged prevalence (SAP) and closure durations.Assuming a willingness to pay per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) threshold equal to the US per capita GDP ($46,000), we found that the cost effectiveness of these strategies is highly dependent on the severity and on a willingness to pay per QALY. For severe pandemics, the preferred strategy couples the earliest closure trigger (0.5% SAP) with the longest duration closure (24?weeks) considered.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating ACS patients for 12 months with ticagrelor compared with generic clopidogrel. METHODS AND RESULTS: Event rates, health-care costs, and health-related quality of life during 12 months of therapy with either ticagrelor or generic clopidogrel were estimated from PLATO. Beyond 12 months, quality-adjusted survival and costs were estimated conditional on whether a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), a non-fatal stroke, or no MI or stroke occurred during the 12 months of therapy. Lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for both treatment strategies. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were presented from a health-care perspective in 2010 Euros (euro) applying unit costs and life tables from a Swedish setting in the base-case analysis. Treatment with ticagrelor was associated with increased health-care costs of euro362 and a QALY gain of 0.13 compared with generic clopidogrel, yielding a cost per QALY gained with ticagrelor of euro2753. The cost per life year gained was euro2372. The results were consistent in major subgroups. Sensitivity analyses showed a cost per QALY gained with ticagrelor of approximately euro7300 under certain scenarios. CONCLUSION: Based on clinical and health-economic evidence from the PLATO study, treating ACS patients with ticagrelor for 12 months is associated with a cost per QALY below generally accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating ACS patients for 12 months with ticagrelor compared with generic clopidogrel. METHODS AND RESULTS: Event rates, health-care costs, and health-related quality of life during 12 months of therapy with either ticagrelor or generic clopidogrel were estimated from PLATO. Beyond 12 months, quality-adjusted survival and costs were estimated conditional on whether a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), a non-fatal stroke, or no MI or stroke occurred during the 12 months of therapy. Lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for both treatment strategies. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were presented from a health-care perspective in 2010 Euros (euro) applying unit costs and life tables from a Swedish setting in the base-case analysis. Treatment with ticagrelor was associated with increased health-care costs of euro362 and a QALY gain of 0.13 compared with generic clopidogrel, yielding a cost per QALY gained with ticagrelor of euro2753. The cost per life year gained was euro2372. The results were consistent in major subgroups.

9985,Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation in Sweden,"AIMS: Patients with atrial fibrillation have a significantly increased risk of thromboembolic events such as ischaemic stroke, and patients are therefore recommended to be treated with anticoagulation treatment. The most commonly used anticoagulant consists of vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin. A new oral anticoagulation treatment, dabigatran, has recently been approved for stroke prevention among patients with atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran as preventive treatment of stroke and thromboembolic events compared with warfarin in 65-year-old patients with atrial fibrillation in Sweden. METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision analytic simulation model was used to estimate the long-term (20-year) costs and effects of the different treatments. The outcome measures are the number of strokes prevented, life years gained, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Costs and effect data are adjusted to a Swedish setting. Patients below 80 years of age are assumed to start with dabigatran 150 mg twice a day and switch to 110 mg twice a day at the age of 80 years due to higher bleeding risk. The price of dabigatran in Sweden is euro2.82 (Swedish kronor 25.39) per day for both doses. The cost per QALY gained for dabigatran compared with warfarin is estimated at euro7742, increasing to euro12 449 if dabigatran is compared with only well-controlled warfarin treatment. CONCLUSION: Dabigatran is a cost-effective treatment in Sweden, as its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is below the normally accepted willingness to pay limit.",2012-01-09393,22733833,Eur Heart J,Thomas Davidson,2013,34 / 3,,No,22733833,"Thomas Davidson; Magnus Husberg; Magnus Janzon; Jonas Oldgren; Lars-Ake Levin; Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation in Sweden, Eur Heart J, 2013 Jan; 34(3):0195-668X",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) vs. Warfarin,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,7742,Euro,2010,12161.05

The costs of IMRT and 3DCRT were estimated through activity-based costing, incorporating input from radiation oncologists, physicists and radiation therapists. We obtained clinical effectiveness estimates from published studies and calculated the number needed to treat to avoid a case of severe long-term xerostomia using data from a randomised controlled trial.The delivery of IMRT produced 0.48 more QALYs than 3DCRT at an additional cost of $2447 (QALY and costs discounted at 5% a year), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5084 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness of IMRT was sensitive to the costs of radiotherapy and the effect of IMRT on health-related quality of life.

We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus aspirin.Using the Apixaban versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin-K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial and other studies, we constructed a Markov model to evaluate the costs (2011US$), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus aspirin from the Medicare perspective. Our base-case assumed a 70-year-old AF patient cohort with a CHADS(2) score=2 and a lower-risk of bleeding. We used a 1-month cycle-length and ran separate base-case analyses assuming a trial-length (1-year) and a longer-term (10-year) follow-up. Total costs/patient were $3454 and $1805 for apixaban and aspirin in the trial-length and $44 232 and $50 066 in the 10-year model. Corresponding QALYs were 0.96 and 0.96 in the trial-length and 6.87 and 6.51 in the 10-year model, making apixaban inferior in the first model but dominant in the latter. Conclusions were sensitive to baseline stroke rate in both models, and the monthly cost of major stroke, relative risk of stroke, and prior vitamin-K antagonist use in the life-time model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested apixaban would only be a cost-effective alternative (<$50 000/QALY) to aspirin 11% of the time in the trial-length model, but cost-effective or dominant 96.7% and 87.5% of iterations in the 10-year model.In our trial-length model, apixaban was more costly and no more effective than aspirin; however, as follow-up was extended, apixaban became cost-effective and eventually dominant.",2012-01-09405,22740012,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,Soyon Lee,2012,5 / 4,472-9,No,22740012,"Soyon Lee; Moise W Anglade; Joy Meng; Kelly Hagstrom; Jeffrey Kluger; Craig I Coleman; Cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared with aspirin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation among patients unsuitable for warfarin, Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, Jul/1/2012; 5(4):1941-7705; 472-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Aspirin,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-16205.55,United States,2011,-18645.84

9995,Cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients: a Canadian payer perspective,"Hyperphosphatemia is a common and potentially harmful condition in patients with end-stage kidney disease. In Canada, first-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia consists primarily of calcium carbonate (CC). Lanthanum carbonate (LC) and sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) are non-calcium phosphate binders that have been used as second-line therapy in patients intolerant of or not responsive to CC.The primary objective of the present study was to assess the costs and clinical benefits of second-line use of LC after therapy failure with CC in patients receiving dialysis, from a Canadian payer perspective. The secondary objective was to perform an economic comparison between second-line LC therapy and second-line SH therapy, from a Canadian payer perspective. Short-term outcomes were treatment response and cost per additional responder, and long-term outcomes were survival, number of all-cause hospitalizations, and quality of life.A cost-effectiveness Markov model was populated with simulated cohorts of 1000 patients receiving incident dialysis, followed life-long. Patients not responsive to CC with a serum phosphate concentration >1.78 mmol/L (>5.5 mg/dL) received a trial regimen with LC. Patients not responsive to LC returned to CC therapy. Patient data from a randomized controlled trial of 800 patients receiving dialysis were used. Extensive (probabilistic) sensitivity analyses were performed. When available, model parameters were based on Canadian data or from a Canadian perspective. All costs are in 2010 Canadian dollars (C$).Results of the model estimated that in patients responsive to second-line LC therapy, survival increased, on average, 0.44 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.54) per patient when compared with continued CC therapy. The mean (range) costs per patient in the first year of treatment with LC was C$2600 (C$2400-C$2800). Over patients' lifetimes, the second-line LC strategy resulted in a gain of 48.8 (37.1-61.3) life-years and 29.3 (21.4-38.1) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost-effectiveness of the second-line LC strategy was C$7900 (C$1800-C$14,600) per life-year and C$13,200 (C$3000-C$25,100) per QALY gained. Most sensitivity analyses did not change the cost-effectiveness outcomes; however, including unrelated future costs raised the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to C$159,500 (95% confidence interval, C$133,300-C$191,600) per QALY gained. Compared with second-line SH therapy, second-line LC therapy had similar effectiveness and was 23% less expensive.Second-line treatment with LC is cost-effective in the treatment of end-stage kidney disease in patients with hyperphosphatemia, from a Canadian payer perspective. Second-line treatment with LC is less expensive, with similar effectiveness as second-line treatment with SH.

The aim of this research was to carry out a post hoc cost-effectiveness analysis of the effect of pregabalin versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in treated benzodiazepine-refractory outpatients with GAD.This post hoc cost-effectiveness analysis used secondary data extracted from the 6-month cohort, prospective, noninterventional ADAN study, which was conducted to ascertain the cost of illness in GAD subjects diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Benzodiazepine-refractory subjects were those who claimed persistent symptoms of anxiety and showed a suboptimal response (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale = 16) to benzodiazepines, alone or in combination, over 6 months. Patients could switch to pregabalin (as monotherapy or addon) or to an SSRI or SNRI, alone or in combination. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life years gained, and the perspective was that of the National Health System in the year 2008. A sensitivity analysis was performed using bootstrapping techniques (10,000 resamples were obtained) in order to obtain a cost-effectiveness plane and a corresponding acceptability curve.A total of 282 subjects (mean Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score 25.8) were identified, comprising 157 in a pregabalin group and 125 in an SSRI/SNRI group. Compared with SSRI/SNRI, pregabalin (average dose 163 mg/day) was associated with higher quality-adjusted life years gained (0.1086 ? 0.0953 versus 0.0967 ? 0.1003, P = 0.334), but increased health care costs (?1014 ? 762 versus ?846 ? 620, P = 0.166) and drug costs (?376 ? 252 versus 220 ? 140, P < 0.001), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ?25,304 (95% confidence interval dominant 149,430) per quality-adjusted life years gained for health care costs and ?25,454 (dominant 124,562) when drug costs were considered alone. Eighty-six percent of resamples fell below the threshold of ?30,000 per quality-adjusted life years.This evaluation suggests that pregabalin may be cost-effective in comparison with SSRIs/SNRIs in benzodiazepine-refractory outpatients with GAD treated in mental health care settings under usual medical practice in Spain.",2012-01-09416,22745564,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Marina de Salas-Cansado,2012,4 /,157-68,No,22745564,"Marina de Salas-Cansado; Jos?

9997,Cost-effectiveness of adding cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer,"To assess the cost effectiveness of adding cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system.We developed a Markov state transition model to project the lifetime clinical and economic consequences of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Transition probabilities were derived from a phase III trial of cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Cost estimates were obtained from London Health Sciences Centre and the Ontario Case Costing Initiative, and expressed in 2011 CAD. A three year time horizon was used. Future costs and health benefits were discounted at 5%.In the base case, cetuximab plus platinum-based chemotherapy compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone led to an increase of 0.093 QALY and an increase in cost of $36,000 per person, resulting in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $386,000 per QALY gained. The cost effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to the cost per mg of cetuximab and the absolute risk of progression among patients receiving cetuximab.The addition of cetuximab to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC has an ICER that exceeds $100,000 per QALY gained. Cetuximab can only be economically attractive in this patient population if the cost of cetuximab is substantially reduced or if future research can identify predictive markers to select patients most likely to benefit from the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy.",2012-01-09417,22745668,PLoS One,Malek B Hannouf,2007,7 / 6,e38557,No,22745668,"Malek B Hannouf; Chander Sehgal; Jeffrey Q Cao; Joseph D Mocanu; Eric Winquist; Gregory S Zaric; Cost-effectiveness of adding cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, PLoS One , ; 7(6):1932-6203; e38557",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cetuximab + platinum-based chemotherapy vs. Platinum-based chemotherapy alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,5.00,5.00,386000,Canada,2011,449216.51
