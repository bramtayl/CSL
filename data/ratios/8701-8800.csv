8701,Dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation: a NICE single technology appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of dronedarone (Multaq?, Sanofi-Aventis Limited, UK) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter, as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics, both at the University of York, were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions regarding the use of dronedarone within the UK NHS. The ERG review comprised a critique of the submitted evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of dronedarone. The ERG examined the search strategy used to obtain relevant evidence, the selection of studies included in the assessment, outcome measures chosen and statistical methods employed. The ERG also validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model and used it to explore the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results to key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness evidence supporting the use of dronedarone as a treatment for AF came from four randomized controlled trials. These trials were compared with a broader set of trials examining the effectiveness of other AADs for AF: amiodarone, sotalol and class 1c agents (flecainide and propafenone). The evidence suggested that all AADs decreased the recurrence of AF but dronedarone had the smallest effect. A mixed treatment comparison analysis of the trials showed that dronedarone was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality than other AADs, but this was highly uncertain. There was limited evidence to assess the effect of dronedarone on stroke, and no statistically significant differences between dronedarone and other AADs were found for treatment discontinuation. From the evidence presented by the manufacturer, dronedarone appeared highly cost effective in each of the population groups examined compared with using standard baseline therapy alone as first-line treatment, or compared with sotalol or amiodarone as first-line AAD, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) well below ?20,000 per QALY gained. The ICER for dronedarone relative to class 1c agents was around ?19,000 per QALY. Although the evidence presented by the manufacturer indicated that dronedarone was cost effective, the estimates of treatment effect relative to other AADs and safety in the longer term were highly uncertain. The NICE Appraisal Committee in its preliminary guidance did not recommend the use of dronedarone for AF. However, following the response from a large number of consultees and commentators, NICE revised its preliminary guidance to allow the use of the drug in a specific subgroup of AF patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors.",2011-01-08368,22136303,Pharmacoeconomics,Claire McKenna,2011,30 /,35-46,Yes,22136303,"Claire McKenna; Emma Maund; Muhammad Sarowar; David Fox; Matt Stevenson; Chris Pepper; Nerys Woolacott; Stephen Palmer; Dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation: a NICE single technology appraisal, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 30 ():1179-2027; 35-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dronedarone + standard baseline first-line therapy of beta-blockers and anticoagulation vs. Standard baseline first-line therapy of beta-blockers and anticoagulation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,3577,United Kingdom,2008,7973.96

The main clinical effectiveness evidence supporting the use of dronedarone as a treatment for AF came from four randomized controlled trials. These trials were compared with a broader set of trials examining the effectiveness of other AADs for AF: amiodarone, sotalol and class 1c agents (flecainide and propafenone). The evidence suggested that all AADs decreased the recurrence of AF but dronedarone had the smallest effect. A mixed treatment comparison analysis of the trials showed that dronedarone was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality than other AADs, but this was highly uncertain. There was limited evidence to assess the effect of dronedarone on stroke, and no statistically significant differences between dronedarone and other AADs were found for treatment discontinuation. From the evidence presented by the manufacturer, dronedarone appeared highly cost effective in each of the population groups examined compared with using standard baseline therapy alone as first-line treatment, or compared with sotalol or amiodarone as first-line AAD, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) well below ?20,000 per QALY gained. The ICER for dronedarone relative to class 1c agents was around ?19,000 per QALY. Although the evidence presented by the manufacturer indicated that dronedarone was cost effective, the estimates of treatment effect relative to other AADs and safety in the longer term were highly uncertain. The NICE Appraisal Committee in its preliminary guidance did not recommend the use of dronedarone for AF. However, following the response from a large number of consultees and commentators, NICE revised its preliminary guidance to allow the use of the drug in a specific subgroup of AF patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors.",2011-01-08368,22136303,Pharmacoeconomics,Claire McKenna,2011,30 /,35-46,Yes,22136303,"Claire McKenna; Emma Maund; Muhammad Sarowar; David Fox; Matt Stevenson; Chris Pepper; Nerys Woolacott; Stephen Palmer; Dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation: a NICE single technology appraisal, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 30 ():1179-2027; 35-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dronedarone as first-line therapy vs. Amiodarone as first-line therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,2349,United Kingdom,2008,5236.46

8720,A trial-based economic evaluation of 2 nurse-led disease management programs in heart failure,"Although previously conducted meta-analyses suggest that nurse-led disease management programs in heart failure (HF) can improve patient outcomes, uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of such programs remains.To compare the relative merits of 2 variants of a nurse-led disease management program (basic or intensive support by a nurse specialized in the management of patients with HF) against care as usual (routine follow-up by a cardiologist), a trial-based economic evaluation was conducted alongside the COACH study.In terms of costs per life-year, basic support was found to dominate care as usual, whereas the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between intensive support and basic support was found to be equal to ?532,762 per life-year; in terms of costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), basic support was found to dominate both care as usual and intensive support. An assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these findings showed that, at a threshold value of ?20,000 per life-year/?20,000 per QALY, basic support was found to have a probability of 69/62% of being optimal against 17/30% and 14/8% for care as usual and intensive support, respectively.

8727,An Economic Analysis between Entecavir and Lamivudine for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B in Hong Kong,"Background Ttremendous healthcare resources have been spent on the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and its related complications. Therefore, a proper evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy is vital in aid of decision-making. Aim To study the long-term economic and clinical impact if lamivudine was replaced by entecavir in a group of CHB patients. Methods A recently published decision analytic model was adapted to study the cost-effectiveness of 2 years of treatment of entecavir in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 HBeAg-negative CHB patients from a public hospital perspective. Compensated Cirrhosis (CC) and de-compensated cirrhosis (DC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) events were projected to 10 years. Hong Kong-specific health care costs were used. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were calculated using the utility values obtained from a local study. Results In the base case analysis, compared to lamivudine, the use of entecavir was expected to reduce the incidences of CC, DC and HCC by 41.8%, 57.1% and 49.3%, respectively and lead to a saving of USD 1.17 million in medical cost, The overall disease management cost for entecavir which was 67.7% higher than lamivudine for 2 years treatment was reduced to 17.2% after projecting 2-year treatment duration to 10 years. The incremental cost per QALY gained for entecavir compared with lamivudine was USD 13,759. Conclusions Based on the recommended cost-effectiveness threshold of World Health Organization, entecavir is considered cost-effective compared with lamivudine in treating CHB in Hong Kong when long term medical consequences were considered.",2011-01-08379,22141402,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Kenneth K C Lee,2011,/,,No,22141402,"Kenneth K C Lee; David Bin Chia Wu; Pui Yu Chow; Vivian Wing Yan Lee; Hong Li; An Economic Analysis between Entecavir and Lamivudine for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B in Hong Kong, J Gastroenterol Hepatol, ; ():0815-9319",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Entecavir vs. Lamivudine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,13759,United States,2008,16539.39

8738,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cisplatin plus etoposide and carboplatin plus paclitaxel in a phase III randomized trial for non-small cell lung cancer,"Carboplatin plus paclitaxel is a more costly chemotherapy regimen than cisplatin plus etoposide; however there have been reports of higher efficacy and less toxicity of this regimen. Thus, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these two chemotherapy regimens in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Using the perspective of Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Thailand, direct medical costs, including chemotherapy, drugs, medical service charges, costs of adverse events, concomitant medication and survival time were directly gathered from 65 patients enrolled from August 2005 to November 2008. A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was also calculated.Of these 65 patients, 30 received cisplatin plus etoposide (Arm I) and 35 received carboplatin plus paclitaxel (Arm II). The median survival time was not statistically significant (8.23 months vs 8.80 months in Arm I and II, respectively; P = 0.99). The total cost per patient in Arm II was about three times that in Arm I (95,548 Baht vs 29,692 Baht) while quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) in Arm II were slightly above those in Arm I (0.587 vs 0.412). The ICER was equal to 375,958 Baht per QALY.With a cost-effectiveness threshold of 100,000 Baht in Thailand, carboplatin plus paclitaxel was still not cost-effective. While the selection of a suitable regimen for individual patients should not rely on drug and hospital costs alone, the overall cost, including the burden on patients, should be taken into consideration.",2011-01-08387,22151987,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Sumitra Thongprasert,2011,7 /,369-75,No,22151987,"Sumitra Thongprasert; Unchalee Permsuwan; Chidchanok Ruengorn; Chaiyut Charoentum; Busyamas Chewaskulyong; Cost-effectiveness analysis of cisplatin plus etoposide and carboplatin plus paclitaxel in a phase III randomized trial for non-small cell lung cancer, Asia Pac J Clin Oncol, ; 7 ():1743-7563; 369-75",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carboplatin plus paclitaxel (200mg/m2) vs. Cisplatin (80mg/m2) plus vinblastine and mitomycin (MVP),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,39 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,375958,Thailand,2009,13226.9
8739,Cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate versus sevelamer hydrochloride for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease: a US payer perspective,"To assess the cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate (LC) versus sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) as a treatment for hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.A Markov model was developed to estimate health outcomes; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life-years saved (LYS), as well as associated costs. The model incorporated patient-level data from a randomized head-to-head crossover study that compared the reduction of serum phosphorus using LC and SH for 4 weeks each. The model included patients previously treated with calcium-based binders. Both the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and the cohort of patients who completed treatment in both periods of the study (i.e., completer population) were assessed. The baseline risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), all-cause mortalities for CVD, and non-CVD patients were derived from a large US renal database. Patient outcomes were modeled for 10 years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for LC relative to SH. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to test the robustness of the base-case model.For the ITT population, the ICERs of LC versus SH were $24,724/QALY and $15,053/LYS, respectively (in US dollars). When the completer population was considered, the ICERs of LC versus SH were $15,285/QALY and $9,337/LYS (Table 2), respectively. The PSA indicated 61.9% and 85.8% probabilities for ITT and completer populations of LC being cost-effective at the $50,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, respectively.LC is a cost-effective strategy compared with SH in the treatment of ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia who were previously treated with calcium-based binders.

8740,Developing and applying a stochastic dynamic population model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"To develop a stochastic population model of disease progression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that includes the effects of COPD exacerbations on health-related quality of life, costs, disease progression, and mortality and can be used to assess the effects of a wide range of interventions.The model is a multistate Markov model with time varying transition rates specified by age, sex, smoking status, COPD disease severity, and/or exacerbation type. The model simulates annual changes in COPD prevalence due to COPD incidence, exacerbations, disease progression (annual decline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second as percentage of the predicted value), and mortality. The main outcome variables are quality-adjusted life years, total exacerbations, and COPD-related health care costs. Exacerbation-related input parameters were based on quantitative meta-analysis. All important model parameters are entered into the model as probability distributions. To illustrate the potential use of the model, costs and effects were calculated for 3-year implementation of three different COPD interventions, one pharmacologic, one on smoking cessation, and one on pulmonary rehabilitation using a time horizon of 10 years for reporting outcomes.Compared with minimal treatment the cost/quality-adjusted life year was ?8,300 for the pharmacologic intervention, ?10,800 for the smoking cessation therapy, ?8,700 for the combination of the pharmacologic intervention and the smoking cessation therapy, and ?17,200 for the pulmonary rehabilitation program. The probability of the interventions to be cost-effective at a ceiling ratio of ?20,000 varied from 58% to 100%.The COPD model provides policy makers with information about the long-term costs and effects of interventions over the entire chain of care, from primary prevention to care for very severe COPD and includes uncertainty around the outcomes.",2011-01-08391,22152172,Value Health,Martine Hoogendoorn,0,14 /,1039-47,Yes,22152172,"Martine Hoogendoorn; Maureen P M H Rutten-van M?lken; Rudolf T Hoogenveen; Maiwenn J Al; Talitha L Feenstra; Developing and applying a stochastic dynamic population model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Value Health, ; 14 ():1098-3015; 1039-47",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pharmacologic combination therapy of long-acting B2 antagonist with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS/LABA) for 50% of moderate and severe COPD patients vs. Minimal treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,1.50,9935.56,Euro,2007,17003.78

8752,Structural frameworks and key model parameters in cost-effectiveness analyses for current and future treatments of chronic hepatitis C,"Published economic evaluations have reported available treatments for chronic hepatitis C to be cost-effective as part of the current approach to disease management, but as standards of care evolve, their approach to modeling should be reconsidered. This study aimed to review structural frameworks and key model parameters as reported in current economic evaluations for treatments for chronic hepatitis C, and model the impact of variability across parameters on results.A systematic review of studies published from 2000 to 2011 was performed. Studies were retrieved from five electronic databases using relevant search strategies. Model structures, disease progression rates, utilities, and costs were extracted from included studies, and were qualitatively reviewed and incorporated into a cost-utility model.Thirty-four studies were appropriate for data extraction. A common pathway of six disease states was identified. In some studies the early disease stages and/or the decompensated cirrhosis state were further subdivided. Large variability in values used for disease progression rates, utilities, and costs were identified. When incorporated into a model, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) varied: in the least favorable scenario, peginterferon plus ribavirin was dominated by interferon plus ribavirin; and in the most favorable scenario, peginterferon plus ribavirin dominated interferon plus ribavirin ($8,544 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]; costs are given in 2008 US dollar amounts). Using mean values the ICER was $15,198 per QALY.Current models use a simplistic structure resulting from the lack of available data reflecting patient heterogeneity.

8753,The cost-effectiveness and value of information of three influenza vaccination dosing strategies for individuals with human immunodeficiency virus,"Influenza vaccine immunogenicity is diminished in patients living with HIV/AIDS. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and expected value of perfect information (EVPI) of three alternative influenza vaccine dosing strategies intended to increase immunogenicity in those patients.A randomized, multi-centered, controlled, vaccine trial was conducted at 12 CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network sites. Three dosing strategies with seasonal, inactivated trivalent, non-adjuvanted intramuscular vaccine were used in HIV infected adults: two standard doses over 28 days (Strategy A), two double doses over 28 days (Strategy B) and a single standard dose of influenza vaccine (Strategy C), administered prior to the 2008 influenza season. The comparator in our analysis was practice in the previous year, in which 82.8% of HIV/AIDS received standard-dose vaccination (Strategy D). A Markov cohort model was developed to estimate the monthly probability of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over one influenza season. Costs and quality-adjusted life years, extrapolated to the lifetime of the hypothetical study cohorts, were estimated in calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and EVPI in conducting further research.298 patients with median CD4 of 470 cells/?l and 76% with viral load suppression were randomized. Strategy C was the most cost-effective strategy for the overall trial population and for suppressed and unsuppressed individuals.

In the setting of chronic diseases, cost-utility analysis, which takes into account the beneficial effects of a given treatment/health care intervention in terms of health-related quality of life, is likely to be the most appropriate approach.The aim of this study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy with plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates versus on-demand treatment with recombinant-activated FVIIa (rFVIIa) in hemophilia A with high titer inhibitors from an Iranian Ministry of Health perspective.This study was based on the study of Knight et al, which evaluated the cost- effectiveness ratios of different treatments for hemophilia A with high-responding inhibitors. To adapt Knight et al's results to the Iranian context, a few clinical parameters were varied, and cost data were replaced with the corresponding Iranian estimates of resource use. The time horizon of the analysis was 10 years. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed, varying the cost of the clotting factor, the drug dose, and the administration frequency, to test the robustness of the analysis.Comparison of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the three ITI protocols and the on-demand regimen with rFVIIa shows that all three ITI protocols dominate the on-demand regimen with rFVIIa. Between the ITI protocols the low-dose ITI protocol dominates both the Bonn ITI protocol and the Malm? ITI protocol and would be the preferred ITI protocol.

For genotype 1 patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, the ICERs are $5,400/QALY (men) and $6,300/QALY (women) compared to FibroTest only; the ICERs increase to $27,200/QALY (men) and $30,000/QALY (women) with the addition of telaprevir. For genotypes 2 and 3, treatment is more effective and less costly than all alternatives. In clinical settings where testing is required prior to treatment, FibroTest only is more effective and less costly than liver biopsy.
