23301,Neoadjuvant treatment strategies for HER2-positive breast cancer: cost-effectiveness and quality of life outcomes,"Purpose: Achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) with neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with less recurrence and improved clinical outcomes compared to having residual cancer at surgery. However, recent data have demonstrated favorable outcomes for patients with residual HER2-positive cancer who received adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1). Therefore, we sought to determine the optimal chemotherapy/anti-HER2 treatment strategy. Methods: We created a decision-analytic model for patients with stage II–III HER2-positive cancer that incorporated utilities based on toxicity and recurrence. We separately modeled hormone receptor-negative (HR-) and positive (HR+) disease and calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs through 5 years. Simulated patients received one of the following neoadjuvant treatments: three ‘intensive’ regimens (TCHP: docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab; THP + AC: taxol, trastuzumab, pertuzumab then doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; THP: taxol, trastuzumab, pertuzumab) and two ‘de-escalated’ regimens (TH: taxol, trastuzumab; TDM-1) followed by adjuvant treatment based on pathologic response. Results: Among ‘intensive’ neoadjuvant strategies, treatment with THP was more effective and less costly than TCHP or THP + AC. When ‘de-escalated’ strategies were included, TH became the most cost-effective. For HR-negative cancer, TH had 0.003 fewer quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than THP but was less costly by $55,831, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of over $18M/QALY for THP, well above any threshold. For HR-positive cancer, neoadjuvant TH dominated the THP strategy. Conclusion: An adaptive-treatment strategy beginning with neoadjuvant THP or TH followed by tailoring post-operative therapy reduces treatment costs, and spares toxicity compared to more intensive chemotherapy regimens for women with HER2-positive breast cancer. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020-01-32903,32185586,Breast Cancer Res.

23307,Cost-Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Denervation for Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: The MINT Randomized Clinical Trials,"Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation when added to a standardized exercise program for patients with chronic low back pain. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside 3 pragmatic multicenter, nonblinded randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in The Netherlands with a follow up of 52 weeks. Eligible participants were included between January 1, 2013, and October 24, 2014, and had chronic low back pain; a positive diagnostic block at the facet joints (n = 251), sacroiliac (SI) joints (n = 228), or a combination of facet joints, SI joints, and intervertebral discs (n = 202); and were unresponsive to initial conservative care. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and societal costs were measured using self-reported questionnaires. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Bootstrapping was used to estimate statistical uncertainty. Results: After 52 weeks, no difference in costs between groups was found in the facet joint or combination RCT. The total costs were significantly higher for the intervention group in the SI joint RCT. The maximum probability of radiofrequency denervation being cost-effective when added to a standardized exercise program ranged from 0.10 in the facet joint RCT to 0.17 in the SI joint RCT irrespective of the ceiling ratio, and 0.65 at a ceiling ratio of €30 000 per QALY in the combination RCT. Conclusions: Although equivocal among patients with symptoms in a combination of the facet joints, SI joints, and intervertebral discs, evidence suggests that radiofrequency denervation combined with a standardized exercise program cannot be considered cost-effective from a societal perspective for patients with chronic low back pain originating from either facet or SI joints in a Dutch healthcare setting. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2020-01-32904,32389224,Value Health,T Maas,2020,23 / 5,585-594,Yes,32389224,"T Maas; N Juch; W Ostelo; G Groeneweg; -W Kallewaard; W Koes; P Verhagen; Dongen van; Tulder van; J Huygen; Cost-Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Denervation for Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: The MINT Randomized Clinical Trials, Value Health, 2020; 23(5):1098-3015; 585-594",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,radiofrequency denervation of facet joint vs. Standard/Usual Care- standardized exercise program,no improvement in symptoms after conservative care,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-52272.73,Euro,2014,-75986.72

23310,From trivalent to quadrivalent influenza vaccines: Public health and economic burden for different immunization strategies in Spain,"Purpose Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) includes the same strains as trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) plus an additional B strain of the other B lineage. The aim of the study was to analyse the public health and economic impact of replacing TIV with QIV in different scenarios in Spain. Methods A dynamic transmission model was developed to estimate the number of influenza B cases prevented under TIV and QIV strategies (<65 years (high risk) and =65 years). This model considers cross-protective immunity induced by different lineages of influenza B. The output of the transmission model was used as input for a decision tree model that estimated the economic impact of switching TIV to QIV. The models were populated with Spanish data whenever possible. Deterministic univariate and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed. Results Replacing TIV with QIV in all eligible patients with current vaccine coverage in Spain may have prevented 138,707 influenza B cases per season and, therefore avoided 10,748 outpatient visits, 3,179 hospitalizations and 192 deaths. The replacement could save €532,768 in outpatient visit costs, €13 million in hospitalization costs, and €3 million in costs of influenza-related deaths per year. An additional €5 million costs associated with productivity loss could be saved per year, from the societal perspective. The budget impact from societal perspective would be €6.5 million, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) €1,527 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses showed robust results. In additional scenarios, QIV also showed an impact at public health level reducing influenza B related cases, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Conclusions Our results show public health and economic benefits for influenza prevention with QIV. It would be an efficient intervention for the Spanish National Health Service with major health benefits especially in the population =65-year. © 2020 Crépey et al.

23311,A non-stationary Markov model for economic evaluation of grass pollen allergoid immunotherapy,"Introduction Allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (ARC) is an IgE-mediated disease that occurs after exposure to indoor or outdoor allergens, or to non-specific triggers. Effective treatment options for seasonal ARC are available, but the economic aspects and burden of these therapies are not of secondary importance, also considered that the prevalence of ARC has been estimated at 23% in Europe. For these reasons, we propose a novel flexible cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) model, intended to provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with useful information aimed at cost-effective interventions for grass-pollen induced allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (ARC). Methods Treatments compared are: 1. no AIT, first-line symptomatic drug-therapy with no allergoid immunotherapy (AIT). 2. SCIT, subcutaneous immunotherapy. 3. SLIT, sublingual immunotherapy. The proposed model is a non-stationary Markovian model, that is flexible enough to reflect those treatment-related problems often encountered in real-life and clinical practice, but that cannot be adequately represented in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). At the same time, we described in detail all the structural elements of the model as well as its input parameters, in order to minimize any issue of transparency and facilitate the reproducibility and circulation of the results among researchers. Results Using the no AIT strategy as a comparator, and the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) as a statistic to summarize the cost-effectiveness of a health care intervention, we could conclude that: • SCIT systematically outperforms SLIT, except when a full societal perspective is considered.

23315,Cost-effectiveness of introducing an MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine for older adults in Argentina,"Introduction: Influenza surveillance in Argentina reported influenza-like illness at a rate of 3500/100,000, a hospitalization rate of 15.5/100,000, and a death rate of 0.32/100,000 annually in adults aged over 65 years. The high burden of disease may be due to a combination of immunosenescence and the suboptimal clinical effectiveness of conventional, non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines in this age group. There is a clinical need for more effective influenza vaccines in this population. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of an MF59®-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) in adults aged over 65 years in Argentina compared with the non-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) used under the current national vaccination policy. Methods: A decision tree cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of switching from TIV to aTIV in Argentinian older adults. The model compared cost and health benefits of vaccination in one influenza season from the payer perspective. The main predictions included survival, quality-adjusted survival, and costs. Model inputs were sourced from Argentina or internationally where local data was considered inaccurate. Vaccine efficacy assumptions were extracted from recently published, peer-reviewed scientific literature. Results: Switching from TIV to aTIV would result in 170 deaths averted and 1310 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY was US $2660.59 from the payer perspective. In all sensitivity analyses, aTIV remained highly cost-effective. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed a 95% CI per QALY of US $113.74–7721.67. Conclusion: Introducing an adjuvanted influenza vaccine in Argentina is potentially beneficial and cost-effective relative to the currently-used TIV through the reduction of disease burden and utilization of healthcare resources. © 2020 The Authors",2020-01-32912,32249017,Vaccine,H Nguyen,2020,38 / 20,3682-3689,Yes,32249017,"H Nguyen; C Vizzotti; A Uruena; N Giglio; C Magneres; H Richmond; Cost-effectiveness of introducing an MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine for older adults in Argentina, Vaccine, 2020; 38(20):1873-2518; 3682-3689",QALY,Argentina,Not Stated,Immunization,mf59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine vs. Standard/Usual Care- non-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,21667.17,United States,2016,23364.74
23316,Cost-effectiveness analysis of low-dose direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for the prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis in the United States,"Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that low-dose direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including rivaroxaban and apixaban, may help reduce the incidence of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: A cost-utility analysis was performed from the health sector perspective using a Markov state-transition model in patients with cancer who are at intermediate-to-high risk for VTE. Transition probability, relative risk, cost, and utility inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of the RCTs and relevant epidemiology studies. Differences in cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per patient were calculated over a lifetime horizon. One-way, probabilistic, and scenario sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: In patients with cancer at intermediate-to-high risk for VTE, treatment with low-dose DOAC thromboprophylaxis for 6 months, compared with placebo, was associated with 32 per 1000 fewer VTE and 11 per 1000 more major bleeding episodes over a lifetime. The incremental cost and QALY increases were $1445 and 0.12, respectively, with an ICER of $11,947 per QALY gained. Key drivers of ICER variations included the relative risks of VTE and bleeding as well as drug cost. This strategy was 94% cost effective at the threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The selection of patients with Khorana scores =3 yielded the greatest value, with an ICER of $5794 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Low-dose DOAC thromboprophylaxis for 6 months appears to be cost-effective in patients with cancer who are at intermediate-to-high risk for VTE.

23318,"Clinical and cost effectiveness of staff training in the delivery of Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) for adults with intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder and challenging behaviour - randomised trial","Background: Although Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) is a widely used intervention for ameliorating challenging behaviour (CB), evidence for its use in adults with intellectual disability (ID) and comorbid autism (ASD) is lacking. We report a planned subsidiary analysis of adults with both ASD and ID who participated in a randomised trial of PBS delivered by health professionals. Methods: The study was a multicentre, cluster randomised trial conducted in 23 community ID services in England, participants were randomly allocated to either the delivery of PBS (n = 11 clusters) or to treatment as usual (TAU; n = 12). One-hundred and thirteen participants (46% of all participants in the trial) had a diagnosis of ID, autism spectrum disorder and CB (ASD+); (47 allocated to the intervention arm, and 66 to the control). CB (primary outcome) was measured with the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist total score (ABC-CT). Secondary outcomes included mental health status, psychotropic medication use, health and social care costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over 12 months. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in ABC-CT between ASD+ groups randomised to the two arms over 12 months (adjusted mean difference =-2.10, 95% CI:-11.3 7.13, p = 0.655) or other measures. The mean incremental cost of the intervention per participant was £628 (95% CI-£1004 to £2013). There was a difference of 0.039 (95% CI-0.028 to 0.103) for QALYs and a cost per QALY gained of £16,080. Conclusions: Results suggest lack of clinical effectiveness for PBS delivered by specialist ID clinical teams. Further evidence is needed from larger trials, and development of improved interventions.

23319,Cost-effectiveness of introducing national seasonal influenza vaccination for adults aged 60 years and above in mainland China: a modelling analysis,"Background: China has an aging population with an increasing number of adults aged = 60 years. Influenza causes a heavy disease burden in older adults, but can be alleviated by vaccination. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a potential government-funded seasonal influenza vaccination program in older adults in China. Methods: We characterized the health and economic impact of a fully funded influenza vaccination program for older adults using China-specific influenza disease burden, and related cost data, etc. Using a decision tree model, we calculated the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of vaccination from the societal perspective, at a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to GDP per capita (US$8840). Moreover, we estimated the threshold vaccination costs, under which the fully funded vaccination program is cost-effective using GDP per capita as the willingness-to-pay threshold. Results: Compared to current self-paid vaccination, a fully funded vaccination program is expected to prevent 19,812 (95% uncertainty interval, 7150-35,783) influenza-like-illness outpatient consultations per year, 9418 (3386-17,068) severe acute respiratory infection hospitalizations per year, and 8800 (5300-11,667) respiratory excess deaths due to influenza per year, and gain 70,212 (42,106-93,635) QALYs per year. Nationally, the incremental costs per QALY gained of the vaccination program is US$4832 (3460-8307), with a 98% probability of being cost-effective. The threshold vaccination cost is US$10.19 (6.08-13.65). However, variations exist between geographical regions, with Northeast and Central China having lower probabilities of cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: Our results support the implementation of a government fully funded older adult vaccination program in China.

23321,Cost-effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccination in children with medical risk conditions in the Netherlands,"Background: In many countries, annual immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is recommended for children with medical risk conditions. Prior cost-effectiveness analyses found such immunization to be cost saving, but assumed effectiveness against non-severe influenza outcomes and a higher effectiveness against severe influenza outcomes than recent studies would suggest. However, recent vaccine studies do not indicate any reduction in community or outpatient disease episodes in IIV immunized individuals. We therefore evaluated cost-effectiveness of IIV immunization in children with medical risk conditions in the Netherlands, assuming that IIV reduces influenza-related hospitalization and death, but has no meaningful impact on non-severe health outcomes. Methods: A health economic decision tree model was developed to evaluate health effects and costs of annual IIV immunization versus no immunization. Model inputs were based on our study on influenza-related primary care visits and other literature. Immunization was considered cost effective if associated costs were less than €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of results, and one-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were done to assess the influence of individual parameters. Results: Annual IIV prevents an average of 1.59 influenza-related hospitalizations and 0.02 deaths per 1,000 children with medical risk conditions. This results in an expected QALY gain of 0.43 at incremental costs of €21,564 per 1,000 children, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €50,297/QALY compared to no immunization. Under base case assumptions, immunization had a 5% probability of being cost effective. Results were most influenced by vaccine efficacy against fatal influenza, QALY loss due to death, and mortality rate. Conclusions: If IIV only reduces severe disease outcomes, as current evidence suggests, annual immunization of medical risk children is unlikely to be cost effective. Results should however be interpreted with caution as cost-effectiveness is largely dependent on incidence and QALY losses for fatal influenza, for which evidence is scarce. © 2020 The Authors",2020-01-32920,32115297,Vaccine,K Naber,2020,38 / 17,3387-3396,Yes,32115297,"K Naber; C Bruijning-Verhagen; Hoog de; Giessen van; Cost-effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccination in children with medical risk conditions in the Netherlands, Vaccine, 2020; 38(17):1873-2518; 3387-3396",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Immunization,influenza vaccine vs. None,"respiratory condition + cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, immunocompromising conditions",18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-50268.07,Euro,2017,-59978.31
23322,"Modelling the impact of multiple sclerosis on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years and total lifetime costs: Evidence from Australia","Objectives: To quantify life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and total lifetime societal costs for a hypothetical cohort of Australians with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: A 4-state Markov model simulated progression from no/mild to moderate and severe disability and death for a cohort of 35-year-old women over a lifetime horizon. Death risks were calculated from Australian life tables, adjusted by disability severity. State-dependent relapse probabilities and associated disutilities were considered. Probabilities of MS progression and relapse were estimated from AusLong and TasMSL MS epidemiological databases. Annual societal (direct and indirect) costs (2017 Australian dollars) and health-state utilities for each state were derived from the Australian MS Longitudinal Study. Costs were discounted at 5% annually. Results: Mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) LE from age 35 years was 42.7 (41.6–43.8) years. This was 7.5 years less than the general Australian population. Undiscounted QALYs were 28.2 (26.3–30.0), a loss of 13.1 QALYs versus the Australian population. Discounted lifetime costs were $942,754 ($347,856–$2,820,219). Conclusion: We have developed a health economics model of the progression of MS, calculating the impact of MS on LE, QALYs and lifetime costs in Australia. It will form the basis for future cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions for MS. © The Author(s), 2019.",2020-01-32931,30806569,Mult. Scler.

23323,Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background: In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and a non-high pretest probability, the use of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff (AADD, <500 ng/mL up to 50 years, then <age × 10 ng/mL) was shown to further reduce the need for computed tomography pulmonary angiography while safely ruling out PE. Our objective was to evaluate its cost-effectiveness. Methods: We created a decision tree to compare the use of the AADD with the standard D-dimer cutoff. The model included short-term venous thromboembolism-related events and long-term complications, their associated morbidity/mortality, and costs. Probabilities were derived from published literature and the ADJUST-PE study, and costs from US estimates. The time horizon was lifetime, with a health care system perspective. Results: Using the AADD cutoff, compared with the standard cutoff, was associated with a loss of 0.0001 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and an average cost reduction of $33.4. The decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was +$282 881/lost QALY (95% confidence interval from +$43 209/lost QALY to a dominant strategy). The probability that the use of the AADD cutoff was either dominant or gained >$200 000/lost QALY was 79.4%. In sensitivity analyses, the DCER became <+$200 000/lost QALY only if, among patients with D-dimer below the AADD cutoff, the mortality of an undiagnosed PE was >6% or the prevalence of PE was >0.6%. Conclusions: The AADD cutoff results in a clinically nonsignificant decrease in QALY but important costs reductions. It is a decrementally cost-effective innovation, with a potential of cost savings of >$80 million per year for the United States health care system. © 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis",2020-01-32933,31925875,J.

23324,Cost-Effectiveness of Intranasal Naloxone Distribution to High-Risk Prescription Opioid Users,"Objectives: To determine the cost-effectiveness of pharmacy-based intranasal naloxone distribution to high-risk prescription opioid (RxO) users. Methods: We developed a Markov model with an attached tree for pharmacy-based naloxone distribution to high-risk RxO users using 2 approaches: one-time and biannual follow-up distribution. The Markov structure had 6 health states: high-risk RxO use, low-risk RxO use, no RxO use, illicit opioid use, no illicit opioid use, and death. The tree modeled the probability of an overdose happening, the overdose being witnessed, naloxone being available, and the overdose resulting in death. High-risk RxO users were defined as individuals with prescription opioid doses greater than or equal to 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day. We used a monthly cycle length, lifetime horizon, and US healthcare perspective. Costs (2018) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted 3% annually. Microsimulation was performed with 100 000 individual trials. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: One-time distribution of naloxone prevented 14 additional overdose deaths per 100 000 persons, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $56 699 per QALY. Biannual follow-up distribution led to 107 additional lives being saved with an ICER of $84 799 per QALY compared with one-time distribution. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that a biannual follow-up approach would be cost-effective 50% of the time at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Naloxone effectiveness and proportion of overdoses witnessed were the 2 most influential parameters for biannual distribution. Conclusion: Both one-time and biannual follow-up naloxone distribution in community pharmacies would modestly reduce opioid overdose deaths and be cost-effective at a WTP of $100 000 per QALY. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2020-01-32935,32327162,Value Health,M Acharya,2020,23 / 4,451-460,Yes,32327162,"M Acharya; D Chopra; J Hayes; B Teeter; C Martin; Cost-Effectiveness of Intranasal Naloxone Distribution to High-Risk Prescription Opioid Users, Value Health, 2020; 23(4):1098-3015; 451-460",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",one time naloxone distribution vs. Standard/Usual Care- current naloxone distribution rate,90+ morphine milligram equivalents per day at least 1x/month,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,49500,United States,2018,51018.67

23326,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Four Common Diagnostic Methods for Clostridioides difficile Infection,"Background: No studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of single and two-step different diagnostic test strategies for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), including direct and indirect costs. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of commonly available diagnostic tests for CDI including nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) alone, glutamate dehydrogenase followed by enzyme immunoassay for toxin (GDH/EIA), GDH then NAAT (GDH/NAAT), and NAAT then EIA (NAAT/EIA). Design: Decision tree model from the US societal perspective with inputs derived from the literature. Willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. To assess the impact of uncertainty in model inputs on the findings, we performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Participants: We conducted the analysis to represent a population aged 65 years old with diarrhea who received a CDI diagnostic test. Main Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and incremental net monetary benefits (INMB). Key Results: NAAT alone was the most cost-effective approach overall; GDH/NAAT was the most cost-effective two-step option. NAAT alone led to the highest QALYs gained, at an incremental cost of $54,547 (vs. GDH/NAAT), $55,410 (vs. GDH/EIA), and $50,231 (vs. NAAT/EIA) per QALY gained. NAAT/EIA was not cost-effective compared to any other strategy. GDH/NAAT resulted in a higher QALY compared to GDH/EIA, at an incremental cost of $96,841 per QALY gained. Variability in the likelihood of comorbidities, CDI probability, and age at disease onset did not substantially change the results. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that results were most sensitive to likelihood of recurrence, followed by CDI mortality rate and probability of severe CDI. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored known uncertainties in the base case and confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusions: NAAT alone and GDH/NAAT (among the two-step options) were the most cost-effective diagnostic test approaches for CDI. © 2020, Society of General Internal Medicine.",2020-01-32936,32016703,J.

23332,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil for induction chemotherapy of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma","Background: Recently, patients who received induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma were found to have survival advantages compared with those receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone in two large randomized trials. Based on these two trials, we present a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) versus cisplatin, fluorouracil, and docetaxel (TPF) for induction chemotherapy to treat locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods: We constructed a Markov model to compare the cost and effectiveness of GP versus TPF. Clinical data including the frequency of adverse events, recurrence and death obtained from two randomized phase III trials were used to calculate transition probabilities and costs. Health utilities were estimated from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, expressed as dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), were calculated, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than $27,534.25/QALY (3 × the per capita GDP of China, 2018) were considered cost-effective. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored the robustness of the model. Results: Our base case model found that the total cost was $53,082.68 in the GP group and $45,482.66 in the TPF group. The QALYs were 6.82 and 4.11, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio favoured the GP regimen, at an incremental cost of $2,804.44 per QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that treatment with the GP regimen was cost-effective 100% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $27,534.25?/QALY. Conclusion: In this model, GP was estimated to be cost-effective compared with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and docetaxel for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma from the payer''s perspectives in the China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020-01-32937,32070923,Oral Oncol.,Q Wu,2020,103 /,-,No,32070923,"Q Wu; W Liao; J Huang; P Zhang; N Zhang; Q Li; Cost-effectiveness analysis of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil for induction chemotherapy of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Oral Oncol., 2020; 103():; -",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,gemcitabine + cisplatin vs. docetaxel + cisplatin + fluorouracil,locoregionally advanced,64 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,2804.44,United States,2019,2839.04
23333,A cost-effectiveness analysis of consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab in stage III NSCLC responding to definitive radiochemotherapy in Switzerland,"Background: Consolidation immunotherapy with the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor durvalumab improves survival in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer responding to radiochemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in Switzerland based on the most recent PACIFIC survival follow-up. Materials and methods: We constructed a Markov model based on the 3-year follow-up data of the PACIFIC trial and compared consolidation durvalumab with observation. We used published utility values and assessed costs for treatment strategies from the perspective of the Swiss health care payers. Cost-effectiveness was tested both in the intention-to-treat population of the PACIFIC trial unselected for PD-L1 tumor expression and in patients with PD-L1-expressing tumors (=1%). Results: In the unselected/PD-L1-positive patients, durvalumab showed an incremental effectiveness of 0.76/1.18 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental costs of Swiss Francs (CHF) 67 239/78 177, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of CHF 88 703/66 131 per QALY gained, respectively. The most influential factors for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the utility before first progression, costs for durvalumab, and the hazard ratio for overall survival under durvalumab versus observation. The cost-effectiveness of durvalumab was better than CHF 100 000 per QALY gained in 75% of the simulations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100 000 per QALY gained, consolidation durvalumab is likely to be cost-effective both in patients with inoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) unselected for PD-L1 status and in patients with PD-L1-expressing tumors in Switzerland. © 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology",2020-01-32938,32107097,Ann.

The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-utility of available screening modalities starting at 40 years in the general population compared to standard screening at 50 years old. A decision tree modeling average-risk of CRC in the United States population was constructed for the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the five most common and effective CRC screening modalities in average-risk 40-year olds versus deferring screening until 50 years old (standard of care) under a limited societal perspective. All parameters were derived from existing literature. We evaluated the incremental cost-utility ratio of each comparator at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY and included multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analysis. All screening modalities assessed were more cost-effective with increased QALYs than current standard care (no screening until 50). The most favorable intervention by net monetary benefit was flexible sigmoidoscopy ($3284 per person). Flexible sigmoidoscopy, FOBT, and FIT all dominated the current standard of care. Colonoscopy and FIT-DNA were both cost-effective (respectively, $4777 and $11,532 per QALY). The cost-effective favorability of flexible sigmoidoscopy diminished relative to colonoscopy with increasing willingness-to-pay. Regardless of screening modality, CRC screening at 40 years old is cost-effective with increased QALYs compared to current screening initiation at 50 years old, with flexible sigmoidoscopy most preferred.

23339,Economic Evaluation of Sequences of Biological Treatments for Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis and Inadequate Response or Intolerance to Methotrexate in France,"Objectives: Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are prescribed sequentially in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Healthcare decision makers continue to debate their use, mainly because of their high costs. Our aim was to perform an economic evaluation for France of bDMARD sequences for treatment of moderate-to-severe RA after inadequate response or intolerance to conventional DMARDs (eg, methotrexate). Methods: A discretely integrated condition event simulation was developed to track the course of patients from first bDMARD through switches to further lines in a sequence. The model included 11 events, 91 conditions, and 21 controlling equations. Inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of clinical trials, a French registry, national drug lists, and databases. Survival, time with minimal activity, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs were output. Structural and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Sequences starting with etanercept biosimilars (ETB) cost less, with ETB–abatacept–infliximab the least expensive: the mean lifetime discounted total cost was €116 912 per patient, with a mean of 11.166 QALYs. Most other strategies were dominated or led to small QALY gains (0.0008-0.0329). Only ETB–tocilizumab–abatacept made it onto the efficiency frontier, but at €955 778 per QALY gained. These results were confirmed in several scenarios and uncertainty analyses. Conclusion: Given minor differences in QALYs gained between bDMARD sequences with large cost differences, starting with biosimilars was more efficient than starting with branded products.

The model included 11 events, 91 conditions, and 21 controlling equations. Inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of clinical trials, a French registry, national drug lists, and databases. Survival, time with minimal activity, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs were output. Structural and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Sequences starting with etanercept biosimilars (ETB) cost less, with ETB–abatacept–infliximab the least expensive: the mean lifetime discounted total cost was €116 912 per patient, with a mean of 11.166 QALYs. Most other strategies were dominated or led to small QALY gains (0.0008-0.0329). Only ETB–tocilizumab–abatacept made it onto the efficiency frontier, but at €955 778 per QALY gained. These results were confirmed in several scenarios and uncertainty analyses. Conclusion: Given minor differences in QALYs gained between bDMARD sequences with large cost differences, starting with biosimilars was more efficient than starting with branded products.

23351,Cost-effectiveness of Practice Team-Supported Exposure Training for Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia in Primary Care: a Cluster-Randomized Trial,"Background: Primary care is the main treatment setting for panic disorder and should be supplemented by collaborative care programs. However, shortage of mental health professionals prevents collaborative care programs from being effectively implemented. The PARADISE study showed the efficacy of a self-managed, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-oriented exposure training for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care delivered by the family practice team. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the PARADISE intervention. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective based on data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial over a time horizon of 12 months. Participants: Four hundred nineteen adult panic disorder patients with or without agoraphobia. Interventions: A self-managed, CBT-oriented exposure training for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care delivered by the primary care practice team in comparison to routine care. Main Measures: Total costs from the societal perspective. Direct costs and disease-specific costs. Quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D-3L. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Key Results: Patients in the intervention group caused lower costs (mean, €1017; 95% confidence interval [-€3306; €1272]; p = 0.38) and gained on average more QALY (mean, 0.034 QALY (95% confidence interval [0.005; 0.062]; p = 0.02). Therefore, the intervention dominated the control treatment. The probability of cost-effectiveness of the intervention at a willingness-to-pay margin of €50,000 per QALY was 96%. Results from supplementary analyses considering direct or disease-specific costs instead of total costs showed comparable results. Conclusion: The PARADISE intervention is cost effective. This conclusion is valid for total costs, generic health care (direct) costs, disease-specific health care costs.

23352,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of The Daily Mile on childhood weight outcomes and wellbeing: a cluster randomised controlled trial,"Background: The Daily Mile is designed to increase physical activity levels with children running or walking around school grounds for 15-min daily. It has been adopted by schools worldwide and endorsed as a solution to tackle obesity, despite no robust evidence of its benefits. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial to determine its clinical and cost-effectiveness. Methods: Forty schools were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the Daily Mile intervention or control group in which only the usual school health and wellbeing activities were implemented. The primary outcome was BMI z-score (BMIz) at 12 months follow-up from baseline, with planned subgroup analysis to examine differential effects. Primary economic analysis outcome was incremental cost per Quality-Adjusted-Life-Year (QALY) gained. Results: Using a constrained randomisation approach, balanced on school size, baseline BMIz and proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals, 20 schools were allocated to intervention (n = 1,153 participants) and 20 to control (n = 1,127); 3 schools withdrew (2 intervention, 1 control). At 12 months, BMIz data were available for 18 intervention schools (n = 850) and 19 control schools (n = 820 participants). Using intention-to-treat analysis the adjusted mean difference (MD) in BMIz (intervention - control) was -0.036 (95% CI: -0.085 to 0.013, p = 0.146). Pre-specified subgroup analysis showed a significant interaction with sex (p = 0.001) suggesting a moderate size benefit of The Daily Mile in girls (MD -0.097, 95% CI -0.156 to -0.037). This was consistent with the exploratory economic results that showed The Daily Mile to be highly cost-effective in girls (£2,492 per QALY), but not in boys, and overall to have a 76% chance of cost-effectiveness for the whole sample, at the commonly applied UK threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Conclusions: Overall the Daily Mile had a small but non-significant effect on BMIz, however, it had a greater effect in girls suggesting that it might be considered as a cost-effective component of a system-wide approach to childhood obesity prevention. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020-01-32950,31988481,Int.

23353,Canadian cost-effectiveness model of BRCA-driven surgical prevention of breast/ovarian cancers compared to treatment if cancer develops,"Objectives To assess the cost effectiveness from a Canadian perspective of index patient germline BRCA testing and then, if positive, family members with subsequent risk-reducing surgery (RRS) in as yet unaffected mutation carriers compared with no testing and treatment of cancer when it develops.Methods A patient level simulation was developed comparing outcomes between two groups using Canadian data. Group 1: no mutation testing with treatment if cancer developed. Group 2: cascade testing (index patient BRCA tested and first-/second-degree relatives tested if index patient/first-degree relative is positive) with RRS in carriers. End points were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and budget impact.Results There were 29,102 index patients: 2,786 ovarian cancer and 26,316 breast cancer (BC). Using the base-case assumption of 44 percent and 21 percent of women with a BRCA mutation receiving risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and risk-reducing mastectomy, respectively, testing was cost effective versus no testing and treatment on cancer development, with an ICER of CAD 14,942 (USD 10,555) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), 127 and 104 fewer cases of ovarian and BC, respectively, and twenty-one fewer all-cause deaths. Testing remained cost effective versus no testing at the commonly accepted North American threshold of approximately CAD 100,000 (or USD 100,000) per QALY gained in all scenario analyses, and cost effectiveness improved as RRS uptake rates increased.Conclusions Prevention via testing and RRS is cost effective at current RRS uptake rates; however, optimization of uptake rates and RRS will increase cost effectiveness and can provide cost savings.

23354,Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors: Analysis of real-world data in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan,"Introduction Comparison of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) would improve patients'' clinical benefits and save costs. Using realworld data, this study attempted to directly compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of first-line afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib. Methods During May 2011-December 2017, all patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) visiting a tertiary center were invited to fill out the EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaires and World Health Organization Quality of Life, brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), and received follow-ups for survival and direct medical costs. A total of 379 patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC under first-line TKIs were enrolled for analysis. After propensity score matching for the patients receiving afatinib (n = 48), erlotinib (n = 48), and gefitinib (n = 96), we conducted the study from the payers'' perspective with a lifelong time horizon. Results Patients receiving afatinib had the worst lifetime psychometric scores, whereas the differences in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) were modest. Considering 3 treatments together, afatinib was dominated by erlotinib. Erlotinib had an incremental cost-effectiveness of US$17,960/life year and US$12,782/QALY compared with gefitinib. Acceptability curves showed that erlotinib had 58.6% and 78.9% probabilities of being cost-effective given a threshold of 1 Taiwanese per capita GDP per life year and QALY, respectively. Conclusion Erlotinib appeared to be cost-effective. Lifetime psychometric scores may provide additional information for effectiveness evaluation. © 2020 Yang et al.

A total of 379 patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC under first-line TKIs were enrolled for analysis. After propensity score matching for the patients receiving afatinib (n = 48), erlotinib (n = 48), and gefitinib (n = 96), we conducted the study from the payers'' perspective with a lifelong time horizon. Results Patients receiving afatinib had the worst lifetime psychometric scores, whereas the differences in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) were modest. Considering 3 treatments together, afatinib was dominated by erlotinib. Erlotinib had an incremental cost-effectiveness of US$17,960/life year and US$12,782/QALY compared with gefitinib. Acceptability curves showed that erlotinib had 58.6% and 78.9% probabilities of being cost-effective given a threshold of 1 Taiwanese per capita GDP per life year and QALY, respectively. Conclusion Erlotinib appeared to be cost-effective. Lifetime psychometric scores may provide additional information for effectiveness evaluation. © 2020 Yang et al.

23356,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Cannabinoid Oromucosal Spray Use for the Management of Spasticity in Subjects with Multiple Sclerosis,"Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly symptomatic disease, with a wide range of disabilities affecting many bodily functions, even in younger persons with a short disease history. The availability of a cannabinoid oromucosal spray (Sativex) for the management of treatment-resistant MS spasticity has provided a new opportunity for many patients. Objective: Our study aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of Sativex in Italian patients with treatment-resistant MS spasticity. The analysis was based on the real-world data of a large registry of Italian patients. Methods: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using data collected prospectively from an electronic registry of all patients who began to use Sativex for MS-resistant spasticity between January 2014 and February 2015 in 30 specialized MS units across Italy and were followed up for = 6 months. Data on drug consumption and spasticity/utility were used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Sativex, as compared with no intervention. No costs or spasticity/utility changes were assumed for no treatment intervention. The ICER was expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, using the Italian NHS perspective and a 6-month time horizon. Results: Sativex effectiveness and consumption was estimated analyzing data of 1350 patients from the registry. These patients reported a mean (SD) utility increment of 0.087 (0.069) after 1 month of treatment, 0.118 (0.073) after 3 months’ treatment and 0.127 (0.080) after 6 months’ treatment. The 6-month cost of treating the entire population with Sativex was €1,361,266, with a €1008 cost and 0.0284 QALYs gained per patient. The estimated ICER was €35,516 per QALY gained, with little variability around the central estimate of cost-effectiveness, as shown by the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Conclusion: The use of Sativex could improve the quality of life of patients with a reasonable incremental cost resulting as a cost-effective option for patients with MS-resistant spasticity. These results could help clinicians and decision makers to develop improved management strategies for spasticity in patients with MS, optimizing the use of available resources. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020-01-32961,32130684,Clin Drug Investig,G Mantovani,2020,40 / 4,319-326,Yes,32130684,"G Mantovani; P Cozzolino; A Cortesi; F Patti; F Patti; S Messina; C Solaro; P Amato; R Bergamaschi; S Bonavita; Bossio Bruno; Morra Brescia; F Costantino; P Cavalla; D Centonze; G Comi; S Cottone; M Danni; A Francia; Gajofat; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Cannabinoid Oromucosal Spray Use for the Management of Spasticity in Subjects with Multiple Sclerosis, Clin Drug Investig, 2020; 40(4):1179-1918; 319-326",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,sativex vs. None,"treatment-resistant, moderate-to-severe (NRS score >=4) multiple sclerosis spasticity",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,35516,Euro,2017,42376.6
23357,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Frailty Assessment in Older Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery,"Background: In perioperative settings, frailty assessment has been shown to reduce mortality. This study examined the cost effectiveness of frailty assessment among patients aged 65 with coronary artery disease under consideration for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Methods: A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 21-year time horizon. Clinical parameters were obtained from published literature. Utilities were derived from the literature and the Canadian Community Health Survey. Costs were obtained from the Ontario fee schedule and published literature. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis was conducted to estimate the value of further research. Results: The frailty assessment initiative had a lower average cost than no frailty assessment ($19,567 compared with $20,062). QALYs with frailty assessment were 0.47 years more than with no frailty assessment. Thus, frailty assessment was dominant compared with no frailty assessment. Results were robust to changes in the input parameters. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY, there was 100% probability of frailty assessment being cost-effective, and the EVPI per patient was $0. Scenario and sensitivity analysis showed frailty screening remained cost effective when changing the cohort average age, removing health benefits for nonfrail patients, and using subjective judgement to modify effectiveness parameters. Conclusions: Frailty assessment may be good value for money. However, limited availability of geriatric consultation services, may hinder implementation. Thus, the estimated benefits of frailty screening may not be achievable in practice. © 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society",2020-01-32964,32220386,Can. J.

23358,Cost-effectiveness of psychological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder in adults,"Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition that may lead to functional impairment and reduced productivity. Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of interventions for adults with PTSD. Methods A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 10 interventions and no treatment for adults with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion. Results Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) appeared to be the most cost-effective intervention for adults with PTSD (with a probability of 0.34 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY), followed by combined somatic/cognitive therapies, self-help with support, psychoeducation, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), self-help without support, non-TF-CBT and combined TF-CBT/SSRIs. Counselling appeared to be less cost-effective than no treatment. TF-CBT had the largest evidence base. Conclusions A number of interventions appear to be cost-effective for the management of PTSD in adults. EMDR appears to be the most cost-effective amongst them. TF-CBT has the largest evidence base. There remains a need for well-conducted studies that examine the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of a range of treatments for adults with PTSD. © 2020 Mavranezouli et al.

23367,Cost-effectiveness of psychological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder in adults,"Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition that may lead to functional impairment and reduced productivity. Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of interventions for adults with PTSD. Methods A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 10 interventions and no treatment for adults with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion. Results Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) appeared to be the most cost-effective intervention for adults with PTSD (with a probability of 0.34 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY), followed by combined somatic/cognitive therapies, self-help with support, psychoeducation, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), self-help without support, non-TF-CBT and combined TF-CBT/SSRIs. Counselling appeared to be less cost-effective than no treatment. TF-CBT had the largest evidence base. Conclusions A number of interventions appear to be cost-effective for the management of PTSD in adults. EMDR appears to be the most cost-effective amongst them. TF-CBT has the largest evidence base.

23368,Survival and costs of colorectal cancer treatment and effects of changing treatment strategies: a model approach,"New and emerging advances in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment combined with limited healthcare resources highlight the need for detailed decision-analytic models to evaluate costs, survival and quality-adjusted life years. The objectives of this article were to estimate the expected lifetime treatment cost of CRC for an average 70-year-old patient and to test the applicability and flexibility of a model in predicting survival and costs of changing treatment scenarios. The analyses were based on a validated semi-Markov model using data from a Norwegian observational study (2049 CRC patients) to estimate transition probabilities and the proportion resected. In addition, inputs from the Norwegian Patient Registry, guidelines, literature, and expert opinions were used to estimate resource use. We found that the expected lifetime treatment cost for a 70-year-old CRC patient was €47,300 (CRC stage I €26,630, II €38,130, III €56,800, and IV €69,890). Altered use of palliative chemotherapy would increase the costs by up to 29%. A 5% point reduction in recurrence rate for stages I–III would reduce the costs by 5.3% and increase overall survival by 8.2 months. Given the Norwegian willingness to pay threshold per QALY gained, society’s willingness to pay for interventions that could result in such a reduction was on average €28,540 per CRC patient. The life years gained by CRC treatment were 6.05 years. The overall CRC treatment costs appear to be low compared to the health gain, and the use of palliative chemotherapy can have a major impact on cost. The model was found to be flexible and applicable for estimating the cost and survival of several CRC treatment scenarios. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020-01-32967,31707584,Eur.

Methods: Data for this analysis came from the Collaborative Care to Preserve Performance in Cancer (COPE) trial, a randomized control trial of 516 patients assigned to: (a) a control group (arm A), (b) tele-rehabilitation (arm B), and (c) tele-rehabilitation plus pharmacological pain management (arm C). Patient quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D-3L at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Direct intervention costs were measured from the experience of the trial. Participants’ hospitalization data were obtained from their medical records, and costs associated with these encounters were estimated from unit cost data and hospital-associated utilization information found in the literature. A secondary analysis of total utilization costs was conducted for the subset of COPE trial patients for whom comprehensive cost capture was possible. Results: In the intervention-only model, tele-rehabilitation (arm B) was found to be the dominant strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $15 494/QALY. At the $100 000 willingness-to-pay threshold, this tele-rehabilitation was the cost-effective strategy in 95.4% of simulations. It was found to be cost saving compared to enhanced usual care once the downstream hospitalization costs were taken into account. In the total cost analysis, total inpatient hospitalization costs were significantly lower in both tele-rehabilitation (arm B) and tele-rehabilitation plus pain management (arm C) compared to control (arm A), (P =.048). Conclusion: The delivery of a CCM-based, centralized tele-rehabilitation intervention to patients with advanced stage cancer is highly cost-effective.

23374,Five-year cost-effectiveness analysis of the European Fans in Training (EuroFIT) physical activity intervention for men versus no intervention,"Objectives: Increasing physical activity reduces the risk of chronic illness including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Lifestyle interventions can increase physical activity but few successfully engage men. This study aims to investigate the 5 year cost-effectiveness of EuroFIT, a program to improve physical activity tailored specifically for male football (soccer) fans compared to a no intervention comparison group. Methods: We developed a Markov cohort model in which the impact of improving physical activity on five chronic health conditions (colorectal cancer, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and depression) and mortality was modelled. We estimated costs from a societal perspective and expressed benefits as quality adjusted life years (QALYs). We obtained data from a 4-country (England, Netherlands, Portugal and Norway) pragmatic randomised controlled trial evaluating EuroFIT, epidemiological and cohort studies, and meta-analyses. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of uncertainty in the model''s parameter values on the cost-effectiveness results. We used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate uncertainty and presented this using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). We tested the robustness of the base case analysis using five scenario analyses. Results: Average costs over 5 years per person receiving EuroFIT were €14,663 and per person receiving no intervention €14,598. Mean QALYs over 5 years were 4.05 per person for EuroFIT and 4.04 for no intervention. Thus, the average incremental cost per person receiving EuroFIT was €65 compared to no intervention, while the average QALY gain was 0.01. This resulted in an ICER of €5206 per QALY gained. CEACs show that the probability of EuroFIT being cost-effective compared to no intervention is 0.53, 0.56 and 0.58 at thresholds of €10,000, €22,000 and €34,000 per QALY gained, respectively. When using a time horizon of 10 years, the results suggest that EuroFIT is more effective and less expensive compared to (i.e. dominant over) no intervention with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 0.63 at a threshold of €22,000 per QALY gained. Conclusions: We conclude the EuroFIT intervention is not cost-effective compared to no intervention over a period of 5 years from a societal perspective, but is more effective and less expensive (i.e. dominant) after 10 years. We thus suggest that EuroFIT can potentially improve public health in a cost-effective manner in the long term. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020-01-32976,32131849,Int. J. Behav. Nutr. Phys.

23375,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with PD-L1 test for the first-line treatment of NSCLC,"Background: Pembrolizumab (Pembro) in combination with chemotherapy has been approved for the treatment of pretreated advanced NSCLC in the United States and China for its significant efficacy. However, the cost-effectiveness is unknown considering Pembro''s high price. The impact of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) test on the cost-effectiveness is also unknown. The current study assessed the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for nonsquamous NSCLC from the United States and China public payers’ perspective. Materials and Methods: A literature-based Markov model was conducted using KEYNOTE-189 trial data to compare cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of three treatment strategies for nonsquamous NSCLC: Pembro-chemotherapy combination and chemotherapy strategy without PD-L1 test, and treatment strategy according to their PD-L1 status. Results: In base case analysis, the combination strategy generated an additional 0.78 QALYs and 0.59 QALYs over chemotherapy in the United States and China respectively, resulting in an ICER of $132 392/QALY in the United States and $92 533/QALY in China. In the PD-L1 =1% base case, the ICERs were $77 754/QALY and $56 768/QALY respectively in the United States and China for PD-L1 test strategy. In the PD-L1 =50% base case, the ICERs were $44 731/QALY and $34 388/QALY respectively in the United States and China for PD-L1 test strategy. Lowering Pembro price can also partly decrease the ICERs. Conclusion: Compared with chemotherapy, the combination strategy is not cost-effective for the treatment of NSCLC in the American and Chinese health care system at WTP threshold of $100 000/QALY for the United States and $27 351/QALY for China.

In the PD-L1 =50% base case, the ICERs were $44 731/QALY and $34 388/QALY respectively in the United States and China for PD-L1 test strategy. Lowering Pembro price can also partly decrease the ICERs. Conclusion: Compared with chemotherapy, the combination strategy is not cost-effective for the treatment of NSCLC in the American and Chinese health care system at WTP threshold of $100 000/QALY for the United States and $27 351/QALY for China. Using PD-L1 test for patient selection and price reduction could improve the cost-effective probabilities of immunotherapy for nonsquamous NSCLC. © 2019 The Authors.

23385,An Economic Evaluation of Voretigene Neparvovec for the Treatment of Biallelic RPE65-Mediated Inherited Retinal Dystrophies in the UK,"Introduction: Voretigene neparvovec (VN) is a gene therapy and the first approved pharmacological treatment for biallelic RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD), a rare condition that starts in early life and causes vision to progressively deteriorate towards complete blindness. In a phase III trial, treatment with VN significantly improved functional vision and visual function, and in October 2019 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Highly Specialised Technologies (HST) process recommended VN for patients in England and Wales. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of VN compared with best supportive care (BSC) in individuals with biallelic RPE65-mediated IRD in the UK. Methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for VN compared with BSC, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services. Phase III trial data were used to inform transition probabilities up to year 1, after which the treatment effect was assumed to be maintained for 40 years, followed by a decline in vision. A bespoke elicitation exercise involving clinical experts, patients and carers was conducted to estimate utility values for each model health state. Results: At list price, VN is associated with incremental costs of £612,404 and incremental QALYs of 6.4, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £95,072 per QALY gained. Voretigene neparvovec is associated with a significant undiscounted QALY gain (20.5) and is therefore eligible for additional QALY weighting under the NICE HST process; an ICER of up to £205,000 per QALY gained could be considered cost-effective under this framework. Conclusion: The results of the model show VN to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources in the UK at list price. The availability of a commercial discount in the UK (as considered in the NICE appraisal) means that in reality the ICER will be even lower.

23386,The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis strategies for individuals with advanced HIV starting treatment in Africa,"Introduction: Many HIV-positive individuals in Africa have advanced disease when initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) so have high risks of opportunistic infections and death. The REALITY trial found that an enhanced-prophylaxis package including fluconazole reduced mortality by 27% in individuals starting ART with CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of this enhanced-prophylaxis package versus other strategies, including using cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing, in individuals with CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm3 or &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation and all individuals regardless of CD4 count. Methods: The REALITY trial enrolled from June 2013 to April 2015. A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of six management strategies in individuals initiating ART in the REALITY trial countries. Strategies included standard-prophylaxis, enhanced-prophylaxis, standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole; and three CrAg testing strategies, the first stratifying individuals to enhanced-prophylaxis (CrAg-positive) or standard-prophylaxis (CrAg-negative), the second to enhanced-prophylaxis (CrAg-positive) or enhanced-prophylaxis without fluconazole (CrAg-negative) and the third to standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole (CrAg-positive) or without fluconazole (CrAg-negative). The model estimated costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) over 48 weeks using three competing mortality risks: cryptococcal meningitis; tuberculosis, serious bacterial infection or other known cause; and unknown cause. Results: Enhanced-prophylaxis was cost-effective at cost-effectiveness thresholds of US$300 and US$500 per QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$157 per QALY in the CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm3 population providing enhanced-prophylaxis components are sourced at lowest available prices. The ICER reduced in more severely immunosuppressed individuals (US$113 per QALY in the CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 population) and increased in all individuals regardless of CD4 count (US$722 per QALY). Results were sensitive to prices of the enhanced-prophylaxis components. Enhanced-prophylaxis was more effective and less costly than all CrAg testing strategies as enhanced-prophylaxis still conveyed health gains in CrAg-negative patients and savings from targeting prophylaxis based on CrAg status did not compensate for costs of CrAg testing. CrAg testing strategies did not become cost-effective unless the price of CrAg testing fell below US$2.30. Conclusions: The REALITY enhanced-prophylaxis package in individuals with advanced HIV starting ART reduces morbidity and mortality, is practical to administer and is cost-effective. Efforts should continue to ensure that components are accessed at lowest available prices. © 2020 The Authors.

Strategies included standard-prophylaxis, enhanced-prophylaxis, standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole; and three CrAg testing strategies, the first stratifying individuals to enhanced-prophylaxis (CrAg-positive) or standard-prophylaxis (CrAg-negative), the second to enhanced-prophylaxis (CrAg-positive) or enhanced-prophylaxis without fluconazole (CrAg-negative) and the third to standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole (CrAg-positive) or without fluconazole (CrAg-negative). The model estimated costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) over 48 weeks using three competing mortality risks: cryptococcal meningitis; tuberculosis, serious bacterial infection or other known cause; and unknown cause. Results: Enhanced-prophylaxis was cost-effective at cost-effectiveness thresholds of US$300 and US$500 per QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$157 per QALY in the CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm3 population providing enhanced-prophylaxis components are sourced at lowest available prices. The ICER reduced in more severely immunosuppressed individuals (US$113 per QALY in the CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 population) and increased in all individuals regardless of CD4 count (US$722 per QALY). Results were sensitive to prices of the enhanced-prophylaxis components. Enhanced-prophylaxis was more effective and less costly than all CrAg testing strategies as enhanced-prophylaxis still conveyed health gains in CrAg-negative patients and savings from targeting prophylaxis based on CrAg status did not compensate for costs of CrAg testing. CrAg testing strategies did not become cost-effective unless the price of CrAg testing fell below US$2.30. Conclusions: The REALITY enhanced-prophylaxis package in individuals with advanced HIV starting ART reduces morbidity and mortality, is practical to administer and is cost-effective. Efforts should continue to ensure that components are accessed at lowest available prices. © 2020 The Authors.

23395,The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis strategies for individuals with advanced HIV starting treatment in Africa,"Introduction: Many HIV-positive individuals in Africa have advanced disease when initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) so have high risks of opportunistic infections and death. The REALITY trial found that an enhanced-prophylaxis package including fluconazole reduced mortality by 27% in individuals starting ART with CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of this enhanced-prophylaxis package versus other strategies, including using cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing, in individuals with CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm3 or &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation and all individuals regardless of CD4 count. Methods: The REALITY trial enrolled from June 2013 to April 2015. A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of six management strategies in individuals initiating ART in the REALITY trial countries. Strategies included standard-prophylaxis, enhanced-prophylaxis, standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole; and three CrAg testing strategies, the first stratifying individuals to enhanced-prophylaxis (CrAg-positive) or standard-prophylaxis (CrAg-negative), the second to enhanced-prophylaxis (CrAg-positive) or enhanced-prophylaxis without fluconazole (CrAg-negative) and the third to standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole (CrAg-positive) or without fluconazole (CrAg-negative). The model estimated costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) over 48 weeks using three competing mortality risks: cryptococcal meningitis; tuberculosis, serious bacterial infection or other known cause; and unknown cause. Results: Enhanced-prophylaxis was cost-effective at cost-effectiveness thresholds of US$300 and US$500 per QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$157 per QALY in the CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm3 population providing enhanced-prophylaxis components are sourced at lowest available prices. The ICER reduced in more severely immunosuppressed individuals (US$113 per QALY in the CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 population) and increased in all individuals regardless of CD4 count (US$722 per QALY). Results were sensitive to prices of the enhanced-prophylaxis components. Enhanced-prophylaxis was more effective and less costly than all CrAg testing strategies as enhanced-prophylaxis still conveyed health gains in CrAg-negative patients and savings from targeting prophylaxis based on CrAg status did not compensate for costs of CrAg testing. CrAg testing strategies did not become cost-effective unless the price of CrAg testing fell below US$2.30. Conclusions: The REALITY enhanced-prophylaxis package in individuals with advanced HIV starting ART reduces morbidity and mortality, is practical to administer and is cost-effective. Efforts should continue to ensure that components are accessed at lowest available prices. © 2020 The Authors.
