25201,Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Ruptures: A Pilot Economic Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The operative treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures has been associated with lower rerupture rates and better function but also a risk of surgery-related complications compared with nonoperative treatment, which may provide improved outcomes with accelerated rehabilitation protocols. However, economic decision analyses integrating the updated costs of both treatment options are limited in the literature. PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of operative and nonoperative treatment of acute Achilles tendon tears. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: An economic decision model was built to assess the cost-utility ratio (CUR) of open primary repair versus nonoperative treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures, based on direct costs from the practices of sports medicine and foot and ankle surgeons at a single tertiary academic center, with published outcome probabilities and patient utility data. Multiway sensitivity analyses were performed to reflect the range of data. RESULTS: Nonoperative treatment was more cost-effective in the average scenario (nonoperative CUR, US$520; operative CUR, US$1995), but crossover occurred during the sensitivity analysis (nonoperative CUR range, US$224-US$2079; operative CUR range, US$789-US$8380). Operative treatment cost an extra average marginal CUR of US$1475 compared with nonoperative treatment, assuming uneventful healing in both treatment arms. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated a decreased marginal CUR of operative treatment when the outcome utility was maximized, and rerupture rates were minimized compared with nonoperative treatment. CONCLUSION: Nonoperative treatment was more cost-effective in average scenarios. Crossover indicated that open primary repair would be favorable for maximized outcome utility, such as that for young athletes or heavy laborers. The treatment decision for acute Achilles tendon ruptures should be individualized. These pilot results provide inferences for further longitudinal analyses incorporating future clinical evidence.",2020-01-35483,32284940,Orthop J Sports Med,Alvin W Su,2020,8 / 3,2325967120909918,No,32284940,"Alvin W Su; Ljiljana Bogunovic; Jeffrey Johnson; Sandra Klein; Matthew J Matava; Jeremy McCormick; Matthew V Smith; Rick W Wright; Robert H Brophy; Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Ruptures: A Pilot Economic Decision Analysis, Orthop J Sports Med, 2020 Mar; 8(3):2325-9671; 2325967120909918",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Surgical,operative treatment vs. nonoperative treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,31256.67,United States,2018,32215.63
25202,Cost-effectiveness of grass pollen allergen immunotherapy in adults,"BACKGROUND: Major scientific societies, such as the EAACI or the AAAAI, do not express any suggestion on which form of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is to be preferred (subcutaneous immunotherapy, SCIT, vs sublingual immunotherapy, SLIT). This choice could depend on their relative pharmacoeconomic value. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of AIT for grass pollen, administered as SCIT or SLIT. METHODS: We created a Markovian Model, to evaluate, in a hypothetical cohort of adult patients suffering from moderate-to-severe rhino-conjunctivitis with or without allergic asthma, the cost-effectiveness of SLIT (tablets, Grazax(®) and Oralair(®) ) or SCIT (various currently available products, plus indirect nonmedical costs, such as travel and productivity costs) in addition to pharmacological therapy, assuming a 9-year horizon to capture AIT long-term effects. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated assuming pharmacological therapy as the reference comparator. RESULTS: In the base case, SCIT was slightly more expensive, but more effective than SLIT, being the most cost-effective option (ICER for SCIT, €11 418; ICER for SLIT, €15 212). ICERs greater than €120 000 for both SCIT and SLIT were demonstrated in a scenario assuming that low treatment persistence rates, which are common in real-life, lead to absence of long-term AIT clinical benefit. Considering indirect nonmedical costs SLIT resulted more cost-effective than SCIT (ICER for SCIT, €17 318; ICER for SLIT, €15 212). CONCLUSION: In daily practice, AIT for grass pollens may be a cost-effective option only in patients with low discontinuation rates.

The cost-effectiveness of person-centred care in a longer time perspective is largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the mid-term cost-effectiveness of person-centred care compared to usual care for patients (<?65) with acute coronary syndrome, using a 2-year and a 5-year time perspective.

25210,Evaluating different adoption scenarios for TIL-therapy and the influence on its (early) cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) is an innovative therapy for advanced melanoma with promising clinical phase I/II study results and likely beneficial cost-effectiveness. As a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of TIL therapy in advanced melanoma compared to ipilimumab is still ongoing, adoption of TIL therapy by the field is confronted with uncertainty. To deal with this, scenario drafting can be used to identify potential barriers and enables the subsequent anticipation on these barriers. This study aims to inform adoption decisions of TIL by evaluating various scenarios and evaluate their effect on the cost-effectiveness. METHODS: First, 14 adoption scenarios for TIL-therapy were drafted using a Delphi approach with a group of involved experts. Second, the likelihood of the scenarios taking place within 5?years was surveyed among international experts using a web-based questionnaire. Third, based on the questionnaire results and recent literature, scenarios were labeled as being either ""likely"" or ""-unlikely"". Finally, the cost-effectiveness of TIL treatment involving the ""likely"" scored scenarios was calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-nine experts from 12 countries completed the questionnaire. The scenarios showed an average likelihood ranging from 29 to 58%, indicating that future developments of TIL-therapy were surrounded with quite some uncertainty. Eight of the 14 scenarios were labeled as ""likely"". The net monetary benefit per patient is presented as a measure of cost-effectiveness, where a positive value means that a scenario is cost-effective. For six of these scenarios the cost-effectiveness was calculated: ""Commercialization of TIL production"" (the price was assumed to be 3 times the manufacturing costs in the academic setting) (-€51,550), ""Pharmaceutical companies lowering the prices of ipilimumab"" (€11,420), ""Using TIL-therapy combined with ipilimumab"" (-€10,840), ""Automatic TIL production"" (€22,670), ""TIL more effective"" (€23,270), ""Less Interleukin-2"" (€20,370). CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating possible future developments, TIL-therapy was calculated to be cost-effective compared to ipilimumab in the majority of ""likely"" scenarios. These scenarios could function as facilitators for adoption. Contrary, TIL therapy was expected to not be cost-effective when sold at commercial prices, or when combined with ipilimumab. These scenarios should be considered in the adoption decision as these may act as crucial barriers.",2020-01-35713,32736535,BMC Cancer,Melanie Lindenberg,2020,20 / 1,712,No,32736535,"Melanie Lindenberg; Valesca Retèl; Maartje Rohaan; Joost van den Berg; John Haanen; Wim van Harten; Evaluating different adoption scenarios for TIL-therapy and the influence on its (early) cost-effectiveness, BMC Cancer, 2020 Jun 26; 20(1):1471-2407; 712",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",tumor infiltrating lymphocytes + nivolumab / vemurafenib vs. Standard/Usual Care- ipilimumab,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,151520,Euro,2018,184543.75
25211,Cost effectiveness of strategies for cervical cancer prevention in India,"The establishment of link between high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and occurrence of cervical cancer has resulted in development of various HPV related control strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer. The objective of the present study was to assess the cost effectiveness of various screening strategies for cervical cancer and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination in India. A Markov model based on societal perspective was designed to estimate the lifetime costs and consequences of screening (with either visual inspect with acetic acid (VIA), Papanicolaou test or HPV DNA test at various time intervals) in a hypothetical cohort of 30-65 years age women or vaccination among adolescent girls. Diagnostic accuracy of the screening strategies, efficacy of HPV vaccination and data on transition probabilities was based on the results of the existing meta-analyses. Primary data was collected for assessing per person cost of screening, cost of treating cervical cancer and quality of life. We found that introduction of different screening strategies leads to reduction in lifetime occurrence of cervical cancer cases caused by HPV 16/18 from 20% to 61%, and cervical cancer deaths from 28% to 70%, as compared to no screening. Among various screening strategies, screening with both VIA 5 yearly and VIA 10 yearly came out to be cost effective at 1-time per capita GDP, with VIA every 5 years providing greater health benefits as compared to VIA 10 years. Hence, screening with VIA 5 years at an incremental cost of US$ 829 (INR 54,881) per QALY gained is the recommended strategy for India. Further, with regards to HPV vaccination, it leads to 60% reduction in cancer cases and mortality caused by HPV 16/18 as compared to no vaccination. Moreover, when this vaccinated cohort of adolescent girls is also screened later in their life (with VIA every 10 years and VIA 5 years), it leads to 69%-76% reduction in cancer cases and 71%-81% reduction in cancer deaths. As compared to no vaccination and no screening, both HPV vaccination alone and vaccination plus screening (with VIA every 5 yearly and VIA 10 yearly) appears to be cost effective with ICERs in the range of US$ 86 (INR 5,693) to US$ 476 (INR 31,511) per QALY gained.

The objective of the present study was to assess the cost effectiveness of various screening strategies for cervical cancer and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination in India. A Markov model based on societal perspective was designed to estimate the lifetime costs and consequences of screening (with either visual inspect with acetic acid (VIA), Papanicolaou test or HPV DNA test at various time intervals) in a hypothetical cohort of 30-65 years age women or vaccination among adolescent girls. Diagnostic accuracy of the screening strategies, efficacy of HPV vaccination and data on transition probabilities was based on the results of the existing meta-analyses. Primary data was collected for assessing per person cost of screening, cost of treating cervical cancer and quality of life. We found that introduction of different screening strategies leads to reduction in lifetime occurrence of cervical cancer cases caused by HPV 16/18 from 20% to 61%, and cervical cancer deaths from 28% to 70%, as compared to no screening. Among various screening strategies, screening with both VIA 5 yearly and VIA 10 yearly came out to be cost effective at 1-time per capita GDP, with VIA every 5 years providing greater health benefits as compared to VIA 10 years.

However, evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of information and communication technology in the context of integrated care models is relatively scarce. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to provide evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the BeyondSilos project for patients enrolled in the Badalona city pilot site in Spain. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of information and communication technology-enhanced integration of health and social care, including the third sector (intervention), compared to basic health and social care coordination (comparator). The study was conducted in Badalona between 2015 and 2016. Participants were followed for 8 months. RESULTS: The study included 198 patients: 98 in the intervention group and 100 in the comparator group. The mean Barthel index remained unchanged in the intervention group (mean change 0.14, 95% CI -4.51 to 4.78; P=.95) but decreased in the comparator group (mean change -3.23, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.11; P=.003). Instrumental Activities of Daily Living significantly decreased in both groups: mean changes of -0.23 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.02; P=.03) and -0.33 (95% CI -0.46 to -0.20; P<.001) in the intervention and comparator groups, respectively. No differences were found in the Geriatric Depression Scale (intervention: mean change 0.28, 95% CI -0.44 to 1.01, P=.44; comparator: mean change -0.29, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.01, P=.06). The intervention showed cost-effectiveness (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio €6505.52, approximately US $7582). CONCLUSIONS: The information and communication technology-enhanced integrated domiciliary care program was cost-effective. The beneficial effects of this approach strongly rely upon the commitment of the professional staff involved.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of OSA management before CA for symptomatic AF. Methods and Results: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 OSA detection strategies before CA: no screening; Type 3 portable monitor (PM)-guided screening; and polysomnography (PSG)-guided screening. The target population consisted of a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 65 years with symptomatic AF, with 50% prevalence of OSA. We used a 5-year horizon, with sensitivity analyses for significant variables and scenario analyses for lower and higher OSA prevalence (30% and 70%, respectively). In the base-case, both types of OSA screening were dominant (less costly and more effective) relative to no screening. Although PSG-guided management was more effective than PM-guided management, it was more costly and therefore did not show clear benefit. These findings were replicated in cohorts with lower and higher OSA risks. Conclusions: OSA screening before CA is cost-effective in patients with symptomatic AF, with PM screening being the most cost-effective.

25223,Cost-Effectiveness of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Screening and Treatment Before Catheter Ablation for Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation,"Background: Although management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recommended to improve outcomes of catheter ablation (CA) in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF), the most cost-effective way of preprocedural OSA screening is undetermined. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of OSA management before CA for symptomatic AF. Methods and Results: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 OSA detection strategies before CA: no screening; Type 3 portable monitor (PM)-guided screening; and polysomnography (PSG)-guided screening. The target population consisted of a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 65 years with symptomatic AF, with 50% prevalence of OSA. We used a 5-year horizon, with sensitivity analyses for significant variables and scenario analyses for lower and higher OSA prevalence (30% and 70%, respectively). In the base-case, both types of OSA screening were dominant (less costly and more effective) relative to no screening. Although PSG-guided management was more effective than PM-guided management, it was more costly and therefore did not show clear benefit. These findings were replicated in cohorts with lower and higher OSA risks. Conclusions: OSA screening before CA is cost-effective in patients with symptomatic AF, with PM screening being the most cost-effective.

25224,Cost effectiveness of trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines in 50- to 64-year-old adults in Korea,"BACKGROUND: Influenza causes severe complications in at-risk populations, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent infection and complications caused by seasonal influenza. However, no study has analyzed the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccines in 50- to 64-year-olds in South Korea. OBJECTIVE: We examined the application of the National Immunization Program (NIP) in 50- to 64-year-olds and compared the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) with that of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in South Korea. METHODS: One-year static model was assumed by constructing separate decision trees for age subgroups: 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64. Each subgroup was divided into at-risk and not-at-risk groups. Using circulation data from previous studies and Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we estimated the probabilities of influenza infection, outpatient treatment, hospitalization, and deaths. Medical cost was estimated from 2015 to 2017 National Health Insurance Sharing Service claim data, while productivity losses from work absenteeism or death were estimated from labor and economic surveys of Korean government. Disutility was estimated based on previous studies. RESULTS: Compared with non-vaccination, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 age groups for TIV were US$2010.90, US$2004.58, and US$1865.55, respectively, while for QIV were US$2187.17, US$2190.89, and US$2074.52, respectively. Compared with TIV, ICERs for QIV were US$4445.66, US$4578.06, and US$4751.93, respectively. All the aforementioned ICER values were lower than the 2017 Korean GDP per capita of US$29,742.839.

25233,"Management of adults with primary frozen shoulder in secondary care (UK FROST): a multicentre, pragmatic, three-arm, superiority randomised clinical trial","BACKGROUND: Manipulation under anaesthesia and arthroscopic capsular release are costly and invasive treatments for frozen shoulder, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. We compared these two surgical interventions with early structured physiotherapy plus steroid injection. METHODS: In this multicentre, pragmatic, three-arm, superiority randomised trial, patients referred to secondary care for treatment of primary frozen shoulder were recruited from 35 hospital sites in the UK. Participants were adults (=18 years) with unilateral frozen shoulder, characterised by restriction of passive external rotation (=50%) in the affected shoulder. Participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive manipulation under anaesthesia, arthroscopic capsular release, or early structured physiotherapy. In manipulation under anaesthesia, the surgeon manipulated the affected shoulder to stretch and tear the tight capsule while the participant was under general anaesthesia, supplemented by a steroid injection. Arthroscopic capsular release, also done under general anaesthesia, involved surgically dividing the contracted anterior capsule in the rotator interval, followed by manipulation, with optional steroid injection. Both forms of surgery were followed by postprocedural physiotherapy. Early structured physiotherapy involved mobilisation techniques and a graduated home exercise programme supplemented by a steroid injection. Both early structured physiotherapy and postprocedural physiotherapy involved 12 sessions during up to 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS; 0-48) at 12 months after randomisation, analysed by initial randomisation group. We sought a target difference of 5 OSS points between physiotherapy and either form of surgery, or 4 points between manipulation and capsular release. The trial registration is ISRCTN48804508. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2017, we screened 914 patients, of whom 503 (55%) were randomly assigned. At 12 months, OSS data were available for 189 (94%) of 201 participants assigned to manipulation (mean estimate 38·3 points, 95% CI 36·9 to 39·7), 191 (94%) of 203 participants assigned to capsular release (40·3 points, 38·9 to 41·7), and 93 (94%) of 99 participants assigned to physiotherapy (37·2 points, 35·3 to 39·2). The mean group differences were 2·01 points (0·10 to 3·91) between the capsular release and manipulation groups, 3·06 points (0·71 to 5·41) between capsular release and physiotherapy, and 1·05 points (-1·28 to 3·39) between manipulation and physiotherapy. Eight serious adverse events were reported with capsular release and two with manipulation. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20?000 per quality-adjusted life-year, manipulation under anaesthesia had the highest probability of being cost-effective (0·8632, compared with 0·1366 for physiotherapy and 0·0002 for capsular release). INTERPRETATION: All mean differences on the assessment of shoulder pain and function (OSS) at the primary endpoint of 12 months were less than the target differences. Therefore, none of the three interventions were clinically superior. Arthoscopic capsular release carried higher risks, and manipulation under anaesthesia was the most cost-effective.

This study investigated the (cost)effectiveness of Dementia Care Mapping™ (DCM) for reducing agitation in this population.Method: Pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness analysis in 50 care homes, follow-up at 6 and 16 months and stratified randomisation to intervention (n?=?31) and control (n?=?19). Residents with dementia were recruited at baseline (n?=?726) and 16 months (n?=?261). Clusters were not blinded to allocation. Three DCM cycles were scheduled, delivered by two trained staff per home. Cycle one was supported by an external DCM expert. Agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)) at 16 months was the primary outcome.Results: DCM was not superior to control on any outcomes (cross-sectional sample n?=?675: 287 control, 388 intervention).

25236,Cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact of rivaroxaban compared with dalteparin in patients with cancer at risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism,"OBJECTIVES: In the ''Comparison of an Oral Factor Xa Inhibitor With Low Molecular Weight Heparin in Patients With Cancer With Venous Thromboembolism'' (SELECT-D) trial, rivaroxaban showed relatively low venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence but higher bleeding compared with dalteparin in patients with cancer. We aim to calculate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of rivaroxaban compared with dalteparin in patients with cancer at risk of recurrent VTE. SETTING: We built a Markov model to calculate the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective over a 5-year time horizon for the Dutch healthcare setting. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 cancer patients with VTE entered the model with baseline characteristics based on the SELECT-D trial. INTERVENTION: Six months of treatment with rivaroxaban (15?mg two times per day for first 3?weeks followed by 20?mg once daily) was compared with 6?months of treatment with dalteparin (200?IU/kg daily during month 1 followed by 150?IU/kg daily). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the cost-effectiveness analysis was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The robustness of the model was evaluated in probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses. A budget impact analysis was performed to calculate the total annual financial consequences for a societal perspective in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In the base case and all scenarios, rivaroxaban were cost-saving while also slightly improving the patient''s health, resulting in economically dominant ICERs. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 77.8% and 98.7% of the simulations showed rivaroxaban to be cost-saving and more effective for a 5-year and 6-month time horizon, respectively. Rivaroxaban can save up to €11?326?763 (CI €5?164?254 to €17?363?231) in approximately 8000 cancer patients with VTE per year compared with dalteparin based on a 1-year time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with rivaroxaban is economically dominant over dalteparin in patients with cancer at risk for recurrent VTE in the Netherlands. The use of rivaroxaban instead of dalteparin can save over €10 million per year, primarily driven by the difference in drug costs.",2020-01-35942,33444193,BMJ Open,Lisa A de Jong,2020,10 / 11,e039057,No,33444193,"Lisa A de Jong; Annette W G van der Velden; Marinus van Hulst; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact of rivaroxaban compared with dalteparin in patients with cancer at risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism, BMJ Open , 2020 Nov 19; 10(11):2044-6055; e039057",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,rivaroxaban vs. Standard/Usual Care- dalteparin,at risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 6 months",4.00,1.50,-134181.82,Euro,2019,-152155.18
25237,Assessing the potential cost-effectiveness of a gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A,"Aim: Hemophilia A is a genetic, chronic disorder classified by deficient or defective coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) that puts those affected at risk for spontaneous bleeding episodes, which lead to joint damage and chronic pain over time. Currently, most severe hemophilia A patients are treated with prophylactic FVIII, which requires costly and frequent infusions and life-long adherence to medication. A gene therapy (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) is currently in development for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. This model assessed the potential cost-effectiveness of treating patients with valoctocogene roxaparvovec rather than prophylactic therapy.Materials and methods: We developed an individual-based, state-transition microsimulation model for assessing the likely cost-effectiveness of valoctocogene roxaparvovec compared to prophylactic FVIII. Men aged 30 with severe hemophilia A were modeled over a lifetime horizon, and costs were reported from the perspective of the United States health care system. Through microsimulation, patient-level heterogeneity was captured in starting weight, starting Pettersson score (PS), durability of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, and annual bleed rate (ABR).Results: The model projects that treatment with single-administration valoctocogene roxaparvovec would be cost-saving to people with hemophilia A at a price point comparable to other currently available gene therapy products due to its potential to reduce FVIII utilization, direct medical costs, lifetime bleeds, and accumulated joint damage.Limitations: The model relies upon evidence-based assumptions for clinical inputs due to limited data availability. Such uncertainty was mitigated by modeling heterogeneity across the population, specifically with regards to long-term gene therapy durability, lifetime bleed rates, and joint damage progression.Conclusion: Valoctocogene roxaparvovec was found to be cost-saving-on average by about $6.8 million per patient-and more effective than prophylactic therapy for treatment of hemophilia A. The comparative benefit of gene therapy was observed across a broad range of simulated patients that were representative of the real-world severe hemophilia A population.",2020-01-36046,31971453,J Med Econ,Keziah Cook,2020,23 / 5,501-512,Yes,31971453,"Keziah Cook; Shaun P Forbes; Kelly Adamski; Janice J Ma; Anita Chawla; Louis P Jr Garrison; Assessing the potential cost-effectiveness of a gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A, J Med Econ, 2020 May; 23(5):1369-6998; 501-512",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,valoctocogene roxaparvovec vs. Standard/Usual Care- prophylaxis,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 10 years",3.00,3.00,-9080500,United States,2019,-9192524.69
25238,Development of a long-acting direct-acting antiviral system for hepatitis C virus treatment in swine,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide and kills more Americans than 59 other infections, including HIV and tuberculosis, combined. While direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments are effective, limited uptake of therapy, particularly in high-risk groups, remains a substantial barrier to eliminating HCV. We developed a long-acting DAA system (LA-DAAS) capable of prolonged dosing and explored its cost-effectiveness. We designed a retrievable coil-shaped LA-DAAS compatible with nasogastric tube administration and the capacity to encapsulate and release gram levels of drugs while resident in the stomach. We formulated DAAs in drug-polymer pills and studied the release kinetics for 1 mo in vitro and in vivo in a swine model. The LA-DAAS was equipped with ethanol and temperature sensors linked via Bluetooth to a phone application to provide patient engagement. We then performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing LA-DAAS to DAA alone in various patient groups, including people who inject drugs. Tunable release kinetics of DAAs was enabled for 1 mo with drug-polymer pills in vitro, and the LA-DAAS safely and successfully provided at least month-long release of sofosbuvir in vivo. Temperature and alcohol sensors could interface with external sources for at least 1 mo. The LA-DAAS was cost-effective compared to DAA therapy alone in all groups considered (base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $39,800). We believe that the LA-DAA system can provide a cost-effective and patient-centric method for HCV treatment, including in high-risk populations who are currently undertreated.",2020-01-36167,32424082,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Malvika Verma,2020,117 / 22,11987-11994,No,32424082,"Malvika Verma; Jacqueline N Chu; John A F Salama; Mohammed T Faiz; Feyisope Eweje; Declan Gwynne; Aaron Lopes; Kaitlyn Hess; Vance Soares; Christoph Steiger; Rebecca McManus; Ryan Koeppen; Tiffany Hua; Alison Hayward; Joy Collins; Siddartha M Tamang; Keiko Ishida; Jonathan B Miller; Stephanie Katz; Alexander H Slocum; Mark S Sulkowski; David L Thomas; Robert Langer; Giovanni Traverso; Development of a long-acting direct-acting antiviral system for hepatitis C virus treatment in swine, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2020 Jun 2; 117(22):1091-6490; 11987-11994",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,long-acting direct-acting antiviral system vs. Standard/Usual Care- direct-acting antiviral alone,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,39800,United States,2019,40291.01
25239,Determining the cost-effectiveness requirements of an exoskeleton preventing second hip fractures using value of information,"BACKGROUND: Falls may lead to hip fractures, which have a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients as well as a considerable impact on healthcare expenditures. Since a secondary hip fracture (SHF) may lead to even higher costs than primary fractures, the development of innovative services is crucial to limit falls and curb costs in high-risk patients. An early economic evaluation assessed which patients with a second hip fracture could benefit most from an exoskeleton preventing falls and whether its development is feasible. METHODS: The life-course of hip fractured patients presenting with dementia or cardiovascular diseases was simulated using a Markov model relying on the United Kingdom administrative data and complemented by published literature. A group of experts provided the exoskeleton parameters. Secondary analyses included a threshold analysis to identify the exoskeleton requirements (e.g. minimum impact of the exoskeleton on patients'' quality of life) leading to a reimbursable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Similarly, the uncertainty around these requirements was modelled by varying their standard errors and represented alongside population Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI). RESULTS: Our base-case found the exoskeleton cost-effective when providing a statistically significant reduction in SHF risk. The secondary analyses identified 286 cost-effective combinations of the exoskeleton requirements. The uncertainty around these requirements was explored producing further 22,880 scenarios, which showed that this significant reduction in SHF risk was not necessary to support the exoskeleton adoption in clinical practice. Conversely, a significant improvement in women quality of life was crucial to obtain an acceptable population EVPI regardless of the cost of the exoskeleton. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the exoskeleton requisites to be cost-effective and the value of future research.

Secondary analyses included a threshold analysis to identify the exoskeleton requirements (e.g. minimum impact of the exoskeleton on patients'' quality of life) leading to a reimbursable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Similarly, the uncertainty around these requirements was modelled by varying their standard errors and represented alongside population Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI). RESULTS: Our base-case found the exoskeleton cost-effective when providing a statistically significant reduction in SHF risk. The secondary analyses identified 286 cost-effective combinations of the exoskeleton requirements. The uncertainty around these requirements was explored producing further 22,880 scenarios, which showed that this significant reduction in SHF risk was not necessary to support the exoskeleton adoption in clinical practice. Conversely, a significant improvement in women quality of life was crucial to obtain an acceptable population EVPI regardless of the cost of the exoskeleton. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the exoskeleton requisites to be cost-effective and the value of future research.

25251,Updated cost-effectiveness analysis of palivizumab (Synagis) for the prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus in infant populations in the UK,"AIMS: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory infection in infants and severe infection can result in hospitalization. The passive immunization, palivizumab, is used as prophylaxis against RSV, however, use in the UK is restricted to populations at high risk of hospitalization. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness (CE) of palivizumab in premature infants with and without risk factors for hospitalization (congenital heart disease [CHD], bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). METHODS: A decision tree model, based on earlier CE analyses, was updated using data derived from targeted literature reviews and advice gained from a Round Table meeting. All costs were updated to 2019 prices. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. RESULTS: Palivizumab is dominant (i.e. clinically superior and cost saving) when used in premature infants born =35?weeks gestational age (wGA) without CHD or BPD and aged <6?months at the start of the RSV season, infants aged <24?months with CHD and infants aged <24?months requiring treatment for BPD within the last 6?months. LIMITATIONS: One-way sensitivity analysis suggests that these results are highly sensitive to the efficacy of prophylaxis, number of doses, impact of long-term respiratory sequalae, rate of hospitalization and mortality due to RSV. A conservative approach has been taken toward long-term respiratory sequalae due to uncertainty around epidemiology and etiology and a lack of recent cost and utility data. CONCLUSIONS: Palivizumab prophylaxis is cost-effective in preventing severe RSV infection requiring hospital admission in a wider population than currently recommended in UK guidelines.

25254,The clinical and cost effectiveness of splints for thumb base osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled clinical trial,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical effectiveness, efficacy and cost effectiveness of splints (orthoses) in people with symptomatic basal thumb joint OA (BTOA). METHODS: A pragmatic, multicentre parallel group randomized controlled trial at 17 National Health Service (NHS) hospital departments recruited adults with symptomatic BTOA and at least moderate hand pain and dysfunction. We randomized participants (1:1:1) using a computer-based minimization system to one of three treatment groups: a therapist supported self-management programme (SSM), a therapist supported self-management programme plus a verum thumb splint (SSM+S), or a therapist supported self-management programme plus a placebo thumb splint (SSM+PS). Participants were blinded to group allocation, received 90?min therapy over 8?weeks and were followed up for 12?weeks from baseline. Australian/Canadian (AUSCAN) hand pain at 8?weeks was the primary outcome, using intention to treat analysis. We calculated costs of treatment. RESULTS: We randomized 349 participants to SSM (n?=?116), SSM+S (n?=?116) or SSM+PS (n?=?117) and 292 (84%) provided AUSCAN Osteoarthritis Hand Index hand pain scores at the primary end point (8?weeks). All groups improved, with no mean treatment difference between groups: SSM+S vs SSM -0.5 (95% CI: -1.4, 0.4), P?=?0.255; SSM+PS vs SSM -0.1 (95% CI: -1.0, 0.8), P?=?0.829; and SSM+S vs SSM+PS -0.4 (95% CI: -1.4, 0.5), P?=?0.378. The average 12-week costs were: SSM £586; SSM+S £738; and SSM+PS £685. CONCLUSION: There was no additional benefit of adding a thumb splint to a high-quality evidence-based, supported self-management programme for thumb OA delivered by therapists.

We randomized participants (1:1:1) using a computer-based minimization system to one of three treatment groups: a therapist supported self-management programme (SSM), a therapist supported self-management programme plus a verum thumb splint (SSM+S), or a therapist supported self-management programme plus a placebo thumb splint (SSM+PS). Participants were blinded to group allocation, received 90?min therapy over 8?weeks and were followed up for 12?weeks from baseline. Australian/Canadian (AUSCAN) hand pain at 8?weeks was the primary outcome, using intention to treat analysis. We calculated costs of treatment. RESULTS: We randomized 349 participants to SSM (n?=?116), SSM+S (n?=?116) or SSM+PS (n?=?117) and 292 (84%) provided AUSCAN Osteoarthritis Hand Index hand pain scores at the primary end point (8?weeks). All groups improved, with no mean treatment difference between groups: SSM+S vs SSM -0.5 (95% CI: -1.4, 0.4), P?=?0.255; SSM+PS vs SSM -0.1 (95% CI: -1.0, 0.8), P?=?0.829; and SSM+S vs SSM+PS -0.4 (95% CI: -1.4, 0.5), P?=?0.378. The average 12-week costs were: SSM £586; SSM+S £738; and SSM+PS £685. CONCLUSION: There was no additional benefit of adding a thumb splint to a high-quality evidence-based, supported self-management programme for thumb OA delivered by therapists.

25256,Development and validation of a serum microRNA biomarker panel for detecting gastric cancer in a high-risk population,"OBJECTIVE: An unmet need exists for a non-invasive biomarker assay to aid gastric cancer diagnosis. We aimed to develop a serum microRNA (miRNA) panel for identifying patients with all stages of gastric cancer from a high-risk population. DESIGN: We conducted a three-phase, multicentre study comprising 5248 subjects from Singapore and Korea. Biomarker discovery and verification phases were done through comprehensive serum miRNA profiling and multivariant analysis of 578 miRNA candidates in retrospective cohorts of 682 subjects. A clinical assay was developed and validated in a prospective cohort of 4566 symptomatic subjects who underwent endoscopy. Assay performance was confirmed with histological diagnosis and compared with Helicobacter pylori (HP) serology, serum pepsinogens (PGs), ''ABC'' method, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Cost-effectiveness was analysed using a Markov decision model. RESULTS: We developed a clinical assay for detection of gastric cancer based on a 12-miRNA biomarker panel. The 12-miRNA panel had area under the curve (AUC)=0.93 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.95) and AUC=0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.96) in the discovery and verification cohorts, respectively. In the prospective study, overall sensitivity was 87.0% (95% CI 79.4% to 92.5%) at specificity of 68.4% (95% CI 67.0% to 69.8%). AUC was 0.848 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.88), higher than HP serology (0.635), PG 1/2 ratio (0.641), PG index (0.576), ABC method (0.647), CEA (0.576) and CA19-9 (0.595). The number needed to screen is 489 annually. It is cost-effective for mass screening relative to current practice (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio=US$44 531/quality-of-life year). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a serum 12-miRNA biomarker assay, which may be a cost-effective risk assessment for gastric cancer.

25257,Collaborative care for depression and anxiety disorders: results and lessons learned from the Danish cluster-randomized Collabri trials,"BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses suggest that collaborative care (CC) improves symptoms of depression and anxiety. In CC, a care manager collaborates with a general practitioner (GP) to provide evidence-based care. Most CC research is from the US, focusing on depression. As research results may not transfer to other settings, we developed and tested a Danish CC-model (the Collabri-model) for depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder in general practice. METHODS: Four cluster-randomized superiority trials evaluated the effects of CC. The overall aim was to explore if CC significantly improved depression and anxiety symptoms compared to treatment-as-usual at 6-months'' follow-up. The Collabri-model was founded on a multi-professional collaboration between a team of mental-health specialists (psychiatrists and care managers) and GPs. In collaboration with GPs, care managers provided treatment according to a structured plan, including regular reassessments and follow-up. Treatment modalities (cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, and medication) were offered based on stepped care algorithms. Face-to-face meetings between GPs and care managers took place regularly, and a psychiatrist provided supervision. The control group received treatment-as-usual. Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression (BDI-II) and anxiety (BAI) at 6-months'' follow-up. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated based on 6-months'' follow-up. RESULTS: Despite various attempts to improve inclusion rates, the necessary number of participants was not recruited. Seven hundred thirty-one participants were included: 325 in the depression trial and 406 in the anxiety trials. The Collabri-model was implemented, demonstrating good fidelity to core model elements. In favor of CC, we found a statistically significant difference between depression scores at 6-months'' follow-up in the depression trial. The difference was not significant at 15-months'' follow-up. The anxiety trials were pooled for data analysis due to inadequate sample sizes. At 6- and 15-months'' follow-up, there was a difference in anxiety symptoms favoring CC. These differences were not statistically significant. The ICER was 58,280 Euro per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: At 6?months, a significant difference between groups was found in the depression trial, but not in the pooled anxiety trial. However, these results should be cautiously interpreted as there is a risk of selection bias and lacking statistical power. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02678624 and NCT02678845 .

25258,Targeting excessive worry with internet-based extinction therapy: a randomised controlled trial with mediation analysis and economical evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Excessive worry is a common phenomenon. Our research group has previously developed an online intervention for excessive worry based on operant principles of extinction (IbET; internet-based extinction therapy) and tested it against a waiting-list. The aim of this study was to evaluate IbET against an active control comparator (CTRL). METHODS: A 10-week parallel participant blind randomised controlled trial with health-economical evaluation and mediation analyses. Participants (N = 311) were randomised (ratio 4.5:4.5:1) to IbET, to CTRL (an internet-based stress-management training program) or to waiting-list. The nation-wide trial included self-referred adults with excessive worry. The primary outcome was change in worry assessed with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire from baseline to 10 weeks. RESULTS: IbET had greater reductions in worry compared to CTRL [-3.6 point difference, (95% CI -2.4 to -4.9)] and also a significantly larger degree of treatment responders [63% v. 51%; risk ratio = 1.24 (95% CI 1.01-1.53)]. Both IbET and CTRL made large reductions in worry compared to waiting-list and effects were sustained up to 1 year. Treatment credibility, therapist attention, compliance and working alliance were equal between IbET and CTRL. Data attrition was 4% at the primary endpoint. The effects of IbET were mediated by the hypothesized causal mechanism (reduced thought suppression) but not by competing mediators. Health-economical evaluation indicated that IbET had a 99% chance of being cost-effective compared to CTRL given societal willingness to pay of 1000€. CONCLUSIONS: IbET is more effective than active comparator to treat excessive worry.
