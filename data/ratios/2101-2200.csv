2101,Cost-effectiveness of a pneumococcal conjugate immunisation program for infants in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVE: To compare projected economic costs and health benefits associated with using pneumococcal conjugate heptavalent vaccine as routine immunisation in healthy children in Switzerland.DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was performed from both the societal as well as the sickness funds"" perspective.SETTING: Simulated birth cohorts of 80,000 children (the approximate size of a birth cohort in Switzerland) were followed from birth up to age of 5.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in disease burden, costs of vaccination, cost-utility ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)).RESULTS: With a vaccine coverage of 70% vaccination of newborns only would avert 4 deaths, 8 cases of meningitis, 37 cases of other invasive pneumococcal disease, 150 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia and about 2700 cases of otitis media (OM) per year. The net cost of the vaccination program would be 22 Mio. CHF per year for society and about 19 Mio. CHF for the sickness funds. This results in a cost-utility ratio of 35,700 CHF (approximately 26,300 USD (1)) per QALY from the societal perspective and 39,300 CHF (28,900 USD) per QALY from the sickness funds"" perspective. Additional catch-up vaccination of all infants <24 months in the years after vaccine introduction would result in additional benefits at a cost of 33,600 CHF per additional QALY gained. However, if the catch-up vaccination should include all children <60 months, each additional QALY would be gained at a very high cost (162,000 CHF per additional QALY).CONCLUSIONS: Routine vaccination of healthy infants <2 years in Switzerland can reduce mortality and long term neurologic impairment resulting from invasive pneumococcal disease at a reasonable cost-utility ratio.",2003-01-00674,12804858,Vaccine,Silvia M Ess,2003,21 / 23,3273-81,Yes,12804858,"Silvia M Ess; Urs B Schaad; Alain Gervaix; Seline PinÃ¶sch; Thomas D Szucs; Cost-effectiveness of a pneumococcal conjugate immunisation program for infants in Switzerland, Vaccine, 2003-Jul-04; 21(23):1873-2518; 3273-81",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine immunisation program using pneumococcal conjugate heptavalent vaccine vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,Not Stated,35710,Switzerland,2001,30928.83
2102,Cost-effectiveness of PET in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in community-dwelling patients with mild or moderate dementia who present to specialized AD centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with strategies involving single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and PET as functional imaging adjuncts to the standard clinical work-up. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine changes in test characteristics, health-related quality-of-life survey instruments, therapeutic effectiveness, and treatment rules. RESULTS: The use of PET to confirm the results of the standard clinical work-up cost more but yielded fewer benefits than a strategy in which dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced MR imaging was substituted for the typically performed structural computed tomography. This relationship remained stable in scenarios in which standard diagnostic work-up accuracy, drug treatment effectiveness, and version of the Health Utilities Index were altered. Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced MR imaging cost US dollars 598800 per QALY gained (range, US dollars 74400 to US dollars 1.9 million per QALY), compared with the cost of the standard diagnostic work-up. Treating all patients with dementia was the dominant imaging strategy, except when side effects in patients with non-AD-related dementia were modeled. In all scenarios, SPECT yielded fewer benefits than other strategies at a higher cost. CONCLUSION: PET may have high diagnostic accuracy, but adding it to the standard diagnostic regimen at AD clinics would yield limited, if any, benefits at very high costs.",2003-01-00677,12802006,Radiology,Pamela M McMahon,2003,228 / 2,515-22,No,12802006,"Pamela M McMahon; Sally S Araki; Eileen A Sandberg; Peter J Neumann; G Scott Gazelle; Cost-effectiveness of PET in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, Radiology, 2003-Aug; 228(2):0033-8419; 515-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material-enhanced (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging vs. Standard clinical workup,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,18 Months,3.00,3.00,598800,United States,1999,930228.25

2107,Cost utility analysis of first-line hormonal therapy in advanced breast cancer: comparison of two aromatase inhibitors to tamoxifen,"Recent randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara) to tamoxifen in the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone-sensitive breast cancer have demonstrated that both agents were at least as effective as tamoxifen. In addition, one RCT has revealed significant superiority of letrozole to tamoxifen with regard to tumor response rate and time to progression. Based on the efficacy and toxicity data, anastrozole or letrozole may replace tamoxifen. A cost effectiveness analysis was undertaken to determine whether the new agents are economically acceptable alternatives to tamoxifen. In the absence of a randomized three-arm trial, a decision model was developed to simulate and compare the most common therapeutic outcomes. The clinical data were obtained from a meta analysis of modern (i.e., post-1990) randomized trials. Clinical outcomes data from the various trials were statistically pooled using a random effects model to provide point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Total hospital resource consumption was collected from the charts of 87 patients with advanced disease who had failed tamoxifen therapy. The model suggested a comparable duration of quality-adjusted progression-free survival between letrozole and anastrozole, both being superior to tamoxifen (179 days vs. 172 days vs. 161 days). Letrozole and anastrozole had overall costs of Can2,883 dollars and 2,847 dollars per patient, respectively, which were marginally higher than tamoxifen at Can2,258 dollars per patient. When the costs and benefits were combined, the data generated an incremental cost per quality-adjusted progression-free year of 12,500 dollars and 19,600 dollars for letrozole and anastrozole, respectively, relative to tamoxifen. Letrozole and anastrozole are both economically acceptable alternatives to tamoxifen in the first-line treatment setting.

METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a 5-year Markov model. Probability estimates were derived from detailed data of 2 randomized trials and a systematic search of the medical literature. Utility estimates were obtained from 60 randomly selected members of the general public. Cost estimates were obtained from Canadian provincial databases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for patients at average risk of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) events and for high-risk patients with a prior history of a UGI event. Subjects were patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where a decision has been made to treat with NSAIDs but who do not require low-dose aspirin. Main outcome measures were proportion of patients with clinical or complicated UGI events, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and life expectancy. RESULTS: Evaluation of rofecoxib versus naproxen in patients with RA at average risk resulted in costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $Can271,188.

We evaluated the prescription of EPO to maintain target hemoglobin levels of 11.0 to 12.0, 12.0 to 12.5, and 14.0 g/dL, compared with 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL. Model outputs were quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs. RESULTS: The base case analysis estimated intravenous EPO requirements to be 3523, 5078, 6097, and 9341 units three times per week to maintain targets of 9.5 to 10.5, 11.0 to 12.0, 12.0 to 12.5, and 14.0 g/dL, respectively. The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL target vs. 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL was $55,295 US. For the 12.0 to 12.5 g/dL target compared to 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, and 14.0 g/dL target compared to 12.0 to 12.5 g/dL, the costs per QALY gained were $613,015 US and $828,215 US, respectively. In sensitivity analysis, clinically implausible reductions in hospitalization or EPO requirements associated with the two higher hemoglobin targets were required to make their incremental cost per QALY gained <$100,000 US. CONCLUSION: Dosing intravenous EPO to achieve hemoglobin targets of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL appears to be associated with incremental cost per QALY gained of $50,000 to $60,000, compared with a hemoglobin target of 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL.

2116,Cost-effectiveness targets for multi-detector row CT angiography in the work-up of patients with intermittent claudication,"PURPOSE: To determine the costs, sensitivity for detection of significant stenoses, and proportion of equivocal multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) angiography results in the work-up of patients with intermittent claudication that would make this imaging examination cost-effective compared with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was used to compare the societal cost-effectiveness of a new imaging modality with that of gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs. By using threshold analysis of a given willingness to pay per QALY, target values for costs, sensitivity for detection of significant stenoses, and proportion of cases requiring additional work-up with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography owing to equivocal results of the new modality were determined. The base case evaluated was that of 60-year-old men with severe intermittent claudication and assumed an incremental cost-effectiveness threshold of 100,000 US dollars per QALY. RESULTS: If treatment were limited to angioplasty, a new imaging modality would be cost-effective if the costs were 300 US dollars and the sensitivity was 85%, even if up to 35% of patients needed additional work-up. When both angioplasty and bypass surgery were considered as treatment options, a new imaging modality was cost-effective if the costs were 300 US dollars, the sensitivity was higher than 94%, and 20% of patients required additional work-up. CONCLUSION: Multi-detector row CT angiography, as compared with currently used imaging modalities such as MR angiography, has the potential to be cost-effective in the evaluation of patients with intermittent claudication.",2003-01-00689,12773672,Radiology,Karen Visser,2003,227 / 3,647-56,No,12773672,"Karen Visser; Marc C J M Kock; Karen M Kuntz; Magruder C Donaldson; G Scott Gazelle; M G Myriam Hunink; Cost-effectiveness targets for multi-detector row CT angiography in the work-up of patients with intermittent claudication, Radiology, 2003-Jun; 227(3):0033-8419; 647-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multi-detector row computer tomographic (CT) angiography vs. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,1998,Not Stated
2117,Cost-effectiveness of measuring fractional flow reserve to guide coronary interventions,"BACKGROUND: Most patients come to the catheterization laboratory without prior functional tests, which makes the cost-effective treatment of patients with intermediate coronary lesions a practical challenge. METHODS: We developed a decision model to compare the long-term costs and benefits of 3 strategies for treating patients with an intermediate coronary lesion and no prior functional study: 1) deferring the decision for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to obtain a nuclear stress imaging study (NUC strategy); 2) measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR) at the time of angiography to help guide the decision for PCI (FFR strategy); and 3) stenting all intermediate lesions (STENT strategy). On the basis of the literature, we estimated that 40% of intermediate lesions would produce ischemia, 70% of patients treated with PCI and 30% of patients treated medically would be free of angina after 4 years, and the quality-of-life adjustment for living with angina was 0.9 (1.0 = perfect health). We estimated the cost of FFR to be 761 dollars, the cost of nuclear stress imaging to be 1093 dollars, and the cost of medical treatment for angina to be 1775 dollars per year. The extra cost of splitting the angiogram and PCI as dictated by the NUC strategy was 3886 dollars by use of hospital cost-accounting data. Sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed to determine which variables affected our results. RESULTS: The FFR strategy saved 1795 dollars per patient compared with the NUC strategy and 3830 dollars compared with the STENT strategy. Quality-adjusted life expectancy was similar among the 3 strategies (NUC-FFR = 0.8 quality-adjusted days, FFR-STENT = 6 quality-adjusted life days). Compared with the FFR strategy, the NUC strategy was expensive (>800,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained). Both screening strategies were superior to (less cost, better outcomes) the STENT strategy. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the NUC strategy would only become attractive (<50,000 dollars/quality-adjusted life years compared with FFR) if the specificity of nuclear stress imaging was >25% better than FFR. Our results were not altered significantly by changing the other assumptions.

2119,Cost-benefit approach in evaluating investment into donor action: the German case,"Donor Action (DA) is an international initiative to help critical care units (CCUs) increase their own donation rates through improved-quality donation practices. Following a validated diagnostic review (DR), areas of weakness can be identified, and the appropriate changes introduced. Data gathered from a number of centers in nine European countries (including Germany) 1 year after the introduction of targeted improvement measures demonstrated a 59.2% (P=0.0015) increase in donation rates. This analysis computes the cost-benefit thresholds of implementing the DA methodology from a German health-economic point of view, taking into account the treatment alternatives for end-stage renal disease (dialysis and transplantation) and comparing the DA program with current organ-donation practice. Lifetime direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated for both arms, considering only changes in cadaveric renal transplantation rates. If DA leads to a 59% overall increase in organ donation in Germany, the program will result in 33 QALYs and 1.8-million euro cost savings per million population (PMP). Therefore, DA would be cost-effective below 2.66-million euro implementation cost PMP (or 218-million euro for the whole country). As the partial implementation cost of the program was far below the threshold, DA is more cost-effective than other publicly reimbursed medical intervention.",2003-01-00696,12759723,Transpl Int,Leo Roels,2003,16 / 5,321-6,No,12759723,"Leo Roels; Z Kalo; Detlef Boesebeck; James Whiting; Celia Wight; Cost-benefit approach in evaluating investment into donor action: the German case, Transpl Int, 2003-May; 16(5):0934-0874; 321-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transplantation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,-54762.81,Euro,2001,-71642.53
2120,Cost effectiveness of lung-volume-reduction surgery for patients with severe emphysema,"BACKGROUND: The National Emphysema Treatment Trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing lung-volume-reduction surgery with medical therapy for severe emphysema, included a prospective economic analysis. METHODS: After pulmonary rehabilitation, 1218 patients at 17 medical centers were randomly assigned to lung-volume-reduction surgery or continued medical treatment. Costs for the use of medical care, medications, transportation, and time spent receiving treatment were derived from Medicare claims and data from the trial. Cost effectiveness was calculated over the duration of the trial and was estimated for 10 years of follow-up with the use of modeling based on observed trends in survival, cost, and quality of life. RESULTS: Interim analyses identified a group of patients with excess mortality and little chance of improved functional status after surgery. When these patients were excluded, the cost-effectiveness ratio for lung-volume-reduction surgery as compared with medical therapy was 190,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 53,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 10 years. Subgroup analyses identified patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity after pulmonary rehabilitation who had lower mortality and better functional status than patients who received medical therapy. The cost-effectiveness ratio in this subgroup was 98,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 21,000 dollars at 10 years. Bootstrap analysis revealed substantial uncertainty for the subgroup and 10-year estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Given its cost and benefits over three years of follow-up, lung-volume-reduction surgery is costly relative to medical therapy.

2121,"The cost-effectiveness of NAT for HIV, HCV, and HBV in whole-blood donations","BACKGROUND: The risk of viral infection associated with blood transfusion is lower than ever before because of aggressive screening and testing practices. NAT technology has lowered that risk even further but at an additional cost to the health-care system. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Marginal cost-effectiveness of NAT for HIV, HCV, and HBV in whole-blood donations was calculated with a previously published Markov decision model. This model was updated with disease incidence data from all 2001 American Red Cross whole-blood donations as well as window-period data from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS). RESULTS: Whole-blood donation NAT for HIV and HCV is expected to cost between 155 US dollars million (minipool NAT) and 428 million US dollars(single-donation NAT) per year in the US and avert 4 to 7 HIV infections and 56 to 59 HCV infections. Adding HBV NAT would be expected to avert 9 to 37 HBV infections at an additional cost of between 39 million US dollars and 130 million US dollars per year. Overall, NAT would cost between 4.7 million US dollars and 11.2 million US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Discontinuing HIV p24 antigen and HBc testing would offset this somewhat.

2122,The cost-effectiveness of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors in the management of chronic arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Rofecoxib and celecoxib (coxibs) effectively treat chronic arthritis pain and reduce ulcer complications by 50% compared with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, their absolute risk reduction is small and the cost-effectiveness of treatment is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the degree of risk reduction in gastrointestinal complications by coxibs offsets their increased cost compared with a generic nonselective NSAID. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of MEDLINE and published abstracts. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis who are not taking aspirin and who require long-term NSAID therapy for moderate to severe arthritis pain. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. INTERVENTIONS: Naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, and coxib, once daily. Patients intolerant of naproxen were switched to a coxib. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Using a coxib instead of a nonselective NSAID in average-risk patients cost an incremental 275 809 dollars per year to gain 1 additional QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The incremental cost per QALY gained decreased to 55 803 dollars when the analysis was limited to the subset of patients with a history of bleeding ulcers. The coxib strategy became dominant when the cost of coxibs was reduced by 90% of the current average wholesale price. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, if a third-party payer was willing to pay 150 000 dollars per QALY gained, then 4.3% of average-risk patients would fall within the budget. CONCLUSIONS: The risk reduction seen with coxibs does not offset their increased costs compared with nonselective NSAIDs in the management of average-risk patients with chronic arthritis.

2123,The cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitors as first-line antihypertensive therapy,"BACKGROUND: Current hypertension guidelines differ in their recommendations for first-line antihypertensive therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy as antihypertensive first-line therapy as compared with conventional antihypertensive therapy with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists or diuretics. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from randomised trials and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor and conventional antihypertensive therapy, we constructed a Markov model to compare four strategies in the management of uncomplicated hypertension: (i) prescribing ACE inhibitor therapy to all patients; (ii) prescribing conventional therapy to all patients; (iii) individualised antihypertensive therapy based on the presence or absence of left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography (ECG); or (iv) individualised antihypertensive therapy based on the presence or absence of left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography. METHODS: Cost data were derived from the medical literature and focus groups, and utility values were derived from patients on antihypertensive monotherapy. All costs were calculated in 1999 Canadian dollars, but are reported in US dollars according to the 1999 purchasing power parity rate for medical and healthcare. The effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was derived from observational studies. The time horizon was over a lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of men aged 40 years without cardiovascular comorbidity requiring antihypertensive drug therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, all four strategies resulted in expected discounted QALYs that differed from each other only at the third decimal point (i.e. less than 0.003). Given the uncertainties in the variable estimates and the small size of the differences, these differences are extremely small and unlikely to represent real differences. Even accepting the small gains as real, the resulting cost-effectiveness ratios are unattractively high: $US 200,000 per QALY gained for the echocardiography strategy (compared with ECG), and $US 700,000 for the ""ACE inhibitor for all"" strategy (compared with ECG).

2124,The cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitors as first-line antihypertensive therapy,"BACKGROUND: Current hypertension guidelines differ in their recommendations for first-line antihypertensive therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy as antihypertensive first-line therapy as compared with conventional antihypertensive therapy with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists or diuretics. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from randomised trials and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor and conventional antihypertensive therapy, we constructed a Markov model to compare four strategies in the management of uncomplicated hypertension: (i) prescribing ACE inhibitor therapy to all patients; (ii) prescribing conventional therapy to all patients; (iii) individualised antihypertensive therapy based on the presence or absence of left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography (ECG); or (iv) individualised antihypertensive therapy based on the presence or absence of left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography. METHODS: Cost data were derived from the medical literature and focus groups, and utility values were derived from patients on antihypertensive monotherapy. All costs were calculated in 1999 Canadian dollars, but are reported in US dollars according to the 1999 purchasing power parity rate for medical and healthcare. The effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was derived from observational studies. The time horizon was over a lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of men aged 40 years without cardiovascular comorbidity requiring antihypertensive drug therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, all four strategies resulted in expected discounted QALYs that differed from each other only at the third decimal point (i.e. less than 0.003). Given the uncertainties in the variable estimates and the small size of the differences, these differences are extremely small and unlikely to represent real differences. Even accepting the small gains as real, the resulting cost-effectiveness ratios are unattractively high: $US 200,000 per QALY gained for the echocardiography strategy (compared with ECG), and $US 700,000 for the ""ACE inhibitor for all"" strategy (compared with ECG).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the cost utility of i.v. mitoxantrone hydrochloride administered every 3 months, s.c. interferon beta-1b administered every other day, and routine supportive care from the perspectives of both the insurer and society. METHODS: We used a Markov model with health states based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores from both an insurer""s and a societal perspective (including direct and total costs, respectively). Theoretical patients entered the model with an EDSS score of 3; their progression was followed for 10 years. Transition probabilities were derived from clinical trial data. Cost and utility inputs were taken from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on all variables. RESULTS: From the insurer""s perspective, the incremental cost-utility ratio of mitoxantrone hydrochloride therapy compared with routine supportive care was 58,272 dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. From a societal perspective, mitoxantrone hydrochloride was more effective and less costly than supportive care. From the perspectives of insurers and society, the cost-utility ratios of interferon beta-1b compared with routine supportive care were 338,738 dollars and 245,700 dollars per QALY gained, respectively. When compared with mitoxantrone hydrochloride, interferon beta-1b had an incremental cost-utility ratio of 741,331 dollars and 658,402 dollars per QALY from the insurer""s and society""s perspectives, respectively. Cost-utility ratios for mitoxantrone hydrochloride were sensitive to acquisition and administration costs of therapy and to effectiveness at slowing disease progression. Cost-utility ratios for interferon beta-1b were not sensitive to any of the variables included in the model.

2129,Costs and clinical outcomes of primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in patients with hepatic cirrhosis: a decision analytic model,"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend upper endoscopic screening for patients with hepatic cirrhosis and primary prophylaxis with a nonselective beta-blocker for those with large varices. METHODS: However, only 25% of cirrhotics develop large varices. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the most cost-effective approach for primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage. RESULTS: Using a Markov model, we compared the costs and clinical outcomes of three strategies for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. In the first strategy, patients were given a beta-blocker without undergoing upper endoscopy. In the second strategy, patients underwent upper endoscopic screening; those found to have large varices were treated with a beta-blocker. In the third strategy, no prophylaxis was used. Selected sensitivity analyses were performed to validate outcomes.Our results show screening prophylaxis was associated with a cost of $37,300 and 5.72 quality-adjusted life yr (QALYs). Universal prophylaxis was associated with a cost of $34,100 and 6.65 QALYs. The no prophylaxis strategy was associated with a cost of $36,600 and 4.84 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $800/QALY for the endoscopic strategy relative to the no prophylaxis strategy. Screening endoscopy was cost saving when the compliance, bleed risk without beta-blocker, and variceal bleed costs were increased, and when the discount rate, bleed risk on beta-blockers, and cost of upper endoscopy were decreased. In contrast, the universal prophylaxis strategy was persistently cost saving relative to the no prophylaxis strategy. In comparing the strategies, sensitivity analysis on the death rates from variceal hemorrhage did not alter outcomes.

2132,Fuels for urban transit buses: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Public transit agencies have begun to adopt alternative propulsion technologies to reduce urban transit bus emissions associated with conventional diesel (CD) engines.

2134,Cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies for patients with solitary pulmonary nodules,"BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a potentially useful but expensive test to diagnose solitary pulmonary nodules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for pulmonary nodule diagnosis and to specifically compare strategies that did and did not include FDG-PET. DESIGN: Decision model. DATA SOURCES: Accuracy and complications of diagnostic tests were estimated by using meta-analysis and literature review. Modeled survival was based on data from a large tumor registry. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement and other sources. TARGET POPULATION: All adult patients with a new, noncalcified pulmonary nodule seen on chest radiograph. TIME HORIZON: Patient lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: 40 clinically plausible combinations of 5 diagnostic interventions, including computed tomography, FDG-PET, transthoracic needle biopsy, surgery, and watchful waiting. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost-effectiveness of strategies depended critically on the pretest probability of malignancy. For patients with low pretest probability (26%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were possibly malignant cost as little as 20 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with high pretest probability (79%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were benign cost as little as 16 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with intermediate pretest probability (55%), FDG-PET strategies cost more than 220 000 dollars per QALY gained because they were more costly but only marginally more effective than computed tomography-based strategies. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The choice of strategy also depended on the risk for surgical complications, the probability of nondiagnostic needle biopsy, the sensitivity of computed tomography, and patient preferences for time spent in watchful waiting.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for pulmonary nodule diagnosis and to specifically compare strategies that did and did not include FDG-PET. DESIGN: Decision model. DATA SOURCES: Accuracy and complications of diagnostic tests were estimated by using meta-analysis and literature review. Modeled survival was based on data from a large tumor registry. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement and other sources. TARGET POPULATION: All adult patients with a new, noncalcified pulmonary nodule seen on chest radiograph.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost-effectiveness of strategies depended critically on the pretest probability of malignancy. For patients with low pretest probability (26%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were possibly malignant cost as little as 20 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with high pretest probability (79%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were benign cost as little as 16 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with intermediate pretest probability (55%), FDG-PET strategies cost more than 220 000 dollars per QALY gained because they were more costly but only marginally more effective than computed tomography-based strategies.

2142,Potential cost-effectiveness of C-reactive protein screening followed by targeted statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease among patients without overt hyperlipidemia,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that statin therapy reduces the rate of cardiovascular events among patients with low lipid levels but elevated C-reactive protein levels. However, no cost-effectiveness analyses have been performed to assist in determining whether large-scale randomized trials are merited to test this hypothesis. METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate the benefits, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness of C-reactive protein screening followed by targeted statin therapy for elevated C-reactive protein levels, compared with dietary counseling alone, for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels <149 mg/dL. All costs were in 2000 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: The potential incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for screening followed by statin therapy compared with no screening and no statin therapy was $48,100 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for 58-year-old men and $94,400 per QALY for 58-year-old women. Screening was most cost-effective for 65-year-old men ($42,600 per QALY) and least cost-effective for 35-year-old women ($207,300 per QALY). Our results were most sensitive to the baseline risk of coronary heart disease, the cost of statin therapy, and the efficacy of statin therapy for preventing myocardial infarction in patients with high C-reactive protein levels. If a 58-year-old man who smokes and is hypertensive was considered, screening for C-reactive protein followed by statin therapy would be cost saving if the cost of statin therapy was reduced to $500 per year. If the cost of statin therapy was reduced to $1 per day, the cost-effectiveness of screening would be $4900 per QALY for 58-year-old men and $19,600 per QALY for women of the same age. If the costs associated with elective revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery) were included in the base case analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for screening would be $40,100 per QALY for 58-year-old men and $87,300 per QALY for women.

2144,Potential cost-effectiveness of C-reactive protein screening followed by targeted statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease among patients without overt hyperlipidemia,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that statin therapy reduces the rate of cardiovascular events among patients with low lipid levels but elevated C-reactive protein levels. However, no cost-effectiveness analyses have been performed to assist in determining whether large-scale randomized trials are merited to test this hypothesis. METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate the benefits, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness of C-reactive protein screening followed by targeted statin therapy for elevated C-reactive protein levels, compared with dietary counseling alone, for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels <149 mg/dL. All costs were in 2000 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: The potential incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for screening followed by statin therapy compared with no screening and no statin therapy was $48,100 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for 58-year-old men and $94,400 per QALY for 58-year-old women. Screening was most cost-effective for 65-year-old men ($42,600 per QALY) and least cost-effective for 35-year-old women ($207,300 per QALY). Our results were most sensitive to the baseline risk of coronary heart disease, the cost of statin therapy, and the efficacy of statin therapy for preventing myocardial infarction in patients with high C-reactive protein levels. If a 58-year-old man who smokes and is hypertensive was considered, screening for C-reactive protein followed by statin therapy would be cost saving if the cost of statin therapy was reduced to $500 per year. If the cost of statin therapy was reduced to $1 per day, the cost-effectiveness of screening would be $4900 per QALY for 58-year-old men and $19,600 per QALY for women of the same age.

DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: 183 patients with neck pain for at least two weeks recruited by 42 general practitioners and randomly allocated to manual therapy (n=60, spinal mobilisation), physiotherapy (n=59, mainly exercise), or general practitioner care (n=64, counselling, education, and drugs).

2149,Rapid magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing cancer-related low back pain,"OBJECTIVES: This study compared the relative efficiency of lumbar x-ray and rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for diagnosing cancer-related low back pain (LBP) in primary care patients. DESIGN: We developed a decision model with Markov state transitions to calculate the cost per case detected and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of rapid MR imaging. Model parameters were estimated from the medical literature. The costs of x-ray and rapid MR were calculated in an activity-based costing study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A hypothetical cohort of primary care patients with LBP referred for imaging to exclude cancer as the cause of their pain. MAIN RESULTS: The rapid MR strategy was more expensive due to higher initial imaging costs and larger numbers of patients requiring conventional MR and biopsy. The overall sensitivity of the rapid MR strategy was higher than that of the x-ray strategy (62% vs 55%). However, because of low pre-imaging prevalence of cancer-related LBP, this generates <1 extra case per 1,000 patients imaged. Therefore, the incremental cost per case detected using rapid MR was high ($213,927). The rapid MR strategy resulted in a small increase in quality-adjusted survival (0.00043 QALYs). The estimated incremental cost per QALY for the rapid MR strategy was $296,176.

RESULTS: The process of managed entry of donepezil was associated with higher expected costs and higher expected outcome than no managed entry. The 95% confidence intervals for the net expected costs and net expected outcomes were relatively narrow and did not cross zero, which suggests a statistical difference between managed entry and no managed entry for donepezil.

2153,"Safety, efficacy and costs of pharmacotherapy for functional gastrointestinal disorders: the case of alosetron and its implications","BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders cause substantial morbidity, but not mortality. Alosetron may achieve ""adequate relief "" in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, but may cause major complications, including death. AIM: To appraise, quantitatively, the trade-off between possible symptomatic improvement and serious complications in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A decision analytical model was used to examine alosetron or standard treatment for 6 months in 45-year-old women with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome using the health care system""s perspective. RESULTS: Assuming a 14% higher ""adequate relief"" rate with alosetron compared to standard care, and a complication rate of four per 1000 persons in 6 months, alosetron gained 0.00081 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient at a cost of 358,700 US dollars per QALY gained. Alosetron gained QALYs if ""adequate relief"" increased the patients"" utility by more than 0.01 in the base case. In probabilistic analysis, alosetron gained QALYs in 98.2% of iterations at a median cost of 212,600 US dollars per QALY (interquartile range, 138,000-338,900 US dollars per QALY). Results were highly sensitive to the utility gain with ""adequate relief"" and alosetron""s response and complication rates. CONCLUSIONS: Alosetron""s benefit-to-risk profile appears to be favourable, but its cost per QALY gained may be substantial.

2154,Cost-effectiveness of hepatic metastasectomy in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma: a state-transition Monte Carlo decision analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hepatic resection (""metastasectomy"") in patients with metachronous liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and to investigate the impact of operative and follow-up strategies on outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There is substantial evidence that resection of CRC liver metastases can result in long-term survival in some patients. However, several unresolved issues are difficult to address using currently available clinical data. These include the appropriate threshold for resection, whether to perform repeat resection, and the relative cost-effectiveness of the procedure(s). METHODS: The authors developed a state-transition Monte Carlo decision model to evaluate the (societal) cost-effectiveness of hepatic metastasectomy in patients with metachronous CRC liver metastases. The model tracks the presence, number, size, location, growth, detection, and removal of up to 15 individual metastases in each patient. Survival, quality of life, and cost are predicted on the basis of disease extent. Imaging and surgery affect outcomes via detection and removal of individual metastases. Several patient management strategies were developed and compared with respect to cost, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ($/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). A reference strategy in which metastasectomy is not offered and imaging is not performed for the purpose of assessing resectability or operative planning (""no-surgery"" strategy) was included for comparison. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of alternative model assumptions on results. RESULTS: A strategy permitting resection of up to six metastases and one repeat resection, with CT follow-up every 6 months, resulted in a gain of 2.63 QALYs relative to the no-test/no-treat strategy, at an incremental cost of 18,100 US dollars/QALY. When additional surgical strategies were considered, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; relative to the next least effective strategy) of the six metastases, one repeat, 6-month strategy was 31,700 US dollars/QALY. Across a range of model assumptions, more aggressive treatment strategies (i.e., resection of more metastases, resection of recurrent metastases) were superior to less aggressive strategies and had ICERs below 35,000 US dollars/QALY. Findings were insensitive to changes in most model parameters but somewhat sensitive to changes in surgery and treatment costs. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic metastasectomy is a cost-effective option for selected patients with metachronous CRC metastases limited to the liver. When considering metastasectomy, more aggressive approaches are generally preferred to less aggressive approaches. Overall, surgeons should be encouraged to consider resection for all patients whose metastases can technically be removed.",2003-01-00733,12677152,Ann Surg,G Scott Gazelle,2003,237 / 4,544-55,No,12677152,"G Scott Gazelle; M G Myriam Hunink; Karen M Kuntz; Pamela M McMahon; Elkan F Halpern; Molly Beinfeld; Jessica S Lester; Kenneth K Tanabe; Milton C Weinstein; Cost-effectiveness of hepatic metastasectomy in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma: a state-transition Monte Carlo decision analysis, Ann Surg, 2003-Apr; 237(4):0003-4932; 544-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"6 month follow-up interval for testing and treatment, 1 hepatic resection, and resection of no more than 6 metastases vs. No-test/no-treat",Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,17600,United States,1998,27945.24
2155,The cost-effectiveness of nCPAP treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnoea,"The demand for diagnostic and therapeutic services for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) showed marked growth during the 1990s. This paper analyses the long-term cost-effectiveness of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) treatment in comparison to conventional null treatment. A Markov model was used to represent the natural history of OSAS based upon published evidence. Utility values came from a survey of OSAS patients. Data on health costs were collected from hospitals in the Basque Country, Spain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of nCPAP treatment is <6,000 Euros per quality-adjusted life year. On disaggregated analysis, nCPAP treatment accounts for 86% of incremental costs; 84% of incremental effectiveness is attributable to improved quality of life. Treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome with nasal continuous positive airway pressure has a cost-effectiveness that is in line with that of other commonly funded treatments such as antihypertensive drugs. The key clinical benefit of nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment is improvement in the quality of life of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. This benefit is also precisely the one for which the evidence base is strongest. The remaining uncertainties concerning the impact of nasal continuous positive airway pressure on long-term mortality have only a relatively small impact on the economics of treatment.",2003-01-00740,12662011,Eur Respir J,J Mar,2003,21 / 3,515-22,No,12662011,"J Mar; J R Rueda; J DurÃ¡n-Cantolla; C Schechter; J Chilcott; The cost-effectiveness of nCPAP treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnoea, Eur Respir J, 2003-Mar; 21(3):0903-1936; 515-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) treatment vs. No treatment,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,4938,Euro,2000,6851.54
2156,Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis: a cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is advocated in cirrhotic patients to optimize early detection and treatment. However, the cost-effectiveness is not well defined. Our objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis from a third-party payer""s perspective of no screening, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration measurement alone, abdominal ultrasound (US) and AFP, abdominal three-phase CT and AFP, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and AFP. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed simulating the natural history of hepatitis C-related cirrhosis in a cohort of patients age 50 yr over a time horizon of their remaining life expectancy. Transition probabilities were obtained from published data and U.S. vital statistics. Costs represented Medicare reimbursement data. Costs and health effects were discounted at a 3% annual rate. RESULTS: Screening with ultrasonography and AFP concentration measurement was associated with an incremental cost-utility ratio of 26,689 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year, whereas screening with abdominal three-phase CT and AFP concentration measurement was associated with an incremental cost-utility ratio of 25,232 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year compared with no screening. Compared with three-phase CT and AFP, magnetic resonance and AFP imaging costs 118,000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results are most sensitive to the annual incidence of HCC, proportion of tumors amenable to treatment, and to transplant candidacy, whereas the choice of screening strategy is most sensitive to the test characteristics and cost.

2161,Cost-effectiveness of a primary care intervention for depressed females,"BACKGROUND: To date, there is little information about the differential impact of primary care interventions by gender. We conducted an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis by gender of an intervention to improve recognition and guideline-concordant treatment of depression in primary care. METHODS: Primary care practices that did not employ an onsite mental healthcare specialist were randomized to enhanced (intervention) versus usual care. All subjects met study criteria for current major depression. Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 scores were converted into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to compare the 1-year effectiveness of enhanced versus usual care by gender. Based on results of previous studies, antidepressant acceptors beginning a new depression treatment episode were the focus of the analysis. Statistical analyses included multivariate regression models controlling for sociodemographic and clinical covariates. RESULTS: In the main analysis, enhanced care for females was more expensive and more effective than usual care, at an additional cost of $5244 per QALY. For males, enhanced care was essentially cost and outcome neutral compared to usual care. The cost-effectiveness ratio estimates were robust to sensitivity analyses. Psychological side effects to the intervention may partially explain the limited effect of the intervention on outcomes for males. LIMITATIONS: We consider these results exploratory because the SF-36 to quality-adjusted life year conversion formula is preliminary and because of the relatively small sample size.

2163,Oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in healthy adults: pooled trial evidence and cost-effectiveness model for Canada,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is a common viral respiratory infection that is associated with significant morbidity. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a neuraminidase inhibitor-a new class of antiviral treatment for influenza where efficacy and safety has been established but cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to estimate the costs and effectiveness of two treatment scenarios for empiric management of otherwise healthy nonelderly patients, presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) to primary care physicians in Canada: 1) where oseltamivir is reimbursed and on formulary for prescription; and 2) where oseltamivir is not on formulary. Outcomes are influenza-days averted and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Effectiveness, utility, and pneumonia complication risk estimates are by pooled analysis of patient-level data from four clinical trials. Unit cost information (Canadian dollars) was obtained from published sources in Ontario. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Of 2288 patients randomized, influenza was confirmed in 1575 (69%) and oseltamivir treatment reduced the mean time to symptom alleviation by 1.08 days (95% confidence interval CI] 0.58-1.59). Infected patients treated with oseltamivir had higher utility scores (quality of life) than placebo patients over the 7 days of follow-up (P <.05). Cost per influenza-day averted with oseltamivir on formulary is 49 US dollars (95% CI 31-107) and the cost per QALY is 57,863 US dollars (95% CI 48,919- 70,149 US dollars). Results are sensitive to the percentage of patients presenting to their physician beyond 48 hours from symptom onset who get oseltamivir and the prevalence of influenza among patients presenting with ILI. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir for treatment of patients with ILI is potentially cost-effective if clinical diagnostic specificity for influenza observed in clinical trials is applicable to routine practice.

METHODS: A decision analysis using the Markov model was performed for four different therapeutic strategies using peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin or interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. Clinical data were obtained from available published reports and from the Spanish health system perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin at a fixed dose, compared with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, was 8478 euros per life year saved and 3737 euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. Good therapeutic compliance and weight-adjusted doses of ribavirin decreased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to 1636 euros per life year saved and 721 euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. In compliant genotype 1 patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to 916 euros per life year saved and 404 euros per quality-adjusted life year gained, with an increase from 64 to 69 years in the threshold age at which therapy was cost-effective.

METHODS: A decision analysis using the Markov model was performed for four different therapeutic strategies using peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin or interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. Clinical data were obtained from available published reports and from the Spanish health system perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin at a fixed dose, compared with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, was 8478 euros per life year saved and 3737 euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. Good therapeutic compliance and weight-adjusted doses of ribavirin decreased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to 1636 euros per life year saved and 721 euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. In compliant genotype 1 patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to 916 euros per life year saved and 404 euros per quality-adjusted life year gained, with an increase from 64 to 69 years in the threshold age at which therapy was cost-effective. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that changes in the values of the most relevant parameters do not modify the study outcomes.

AIM: To compare the impact of standard-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist, low-dose proton pump inhibitor and standard-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment for the maintenance therapy of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease on symptom control and health care resource utilization from the perspective of a public health organization in Hong Kong. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate, over 12 months, the economic and clinical outcomes of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients treated with standard-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist, low-dose proton pump inhibitor and standard-dose proton pump inhibitor. The transition probabilities were derived from the literature. Resource utilization was retrieved from a group of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients in Hong Kong. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The standard-dose proton pump inhibitor strategy was associated with the highest numbers of symptom-free patient-years (0.954 years) and quality-adjusted life-years gained (0.999 years), followed by low-dose proton pump inhibitor and standard-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist.

2176,Economic evaluation of breast cancer treatment: considering the value of patient choice,"PURPOSE: To use 5 years of primary data to compare the incremental cost-effectiveness of breast conservation and radiation versus mastectomy with the restriction of choice to a single therapy versus providing a choice of either therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated a random retrospective cohort of 2,517 Medicare beneficiaries treated for newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer from 1992 through 1994. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 5-year medical costs. Risk and propensity score adjustments were used in the analysis. RESULTS: A breast conservation and radiation regimen has significantly higher costs than mastectomy in the first year after surgery; the adjusted 5-year costs are $14,054 (95% confidence interval, $9,791 to $18,312) greater than those of mastectomy. The adjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing breast conservation and radiation to mastectomy was $219,594 per QALY for the comparison of the two strategies.

2178,A revised economic analysis of restrictions on the use of cell phones while driving,"Evidence that cell phone use while driving increases the risk of being involved in a motor vehicle crash has led policymakers to consider prohibitions on this practice. However, while restrictions would reduce property loss, injuries, and fatalities, consumers would lose the convenience of using these devices while driving. Quantifying the risks and benefits associated with cell phone use while driving is complicated by substantial uncertainty in the estimates of several important inputs, including the extent to which cell phone use increases a driver""s risk of being involved in a crash, the amount of time drivers spend using cell phones (and hence their aggregate contribution to crashes, injuries, and fatalities), and the incremental value to users of being able to make calls while driving. Two prominent studies that have investigated cell phone use while driving have concluded that the practice should not be banned. One finds that the benefits of calls made while driving substantially exceed their costs while the other finds that other interventions could reduce motor vehicle injuries and fatalities (measured in terms of quality adjusted life years) at a lower cost. Another issue is that cell phone use imposes increased (involuntary) risks on other roadway users. This article revises the assumptions used in the two previous analyses to make them consistent and updates them using recent data. The result is a best estimate of zero for the net benefit of cell phone use while driving, a finding that differs substantially from the previous study. Our revised cost-effectiveness estimate for cell phone use while driving moves in the other direction, finding that the cost per quality adjusted life year increases modestly compared to the previous estimate.

2179,A cost-utility analysis of tension-free vaginal tape versus colposuspension for primary urodynamic stress incontinence,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of tension-free vaginal tape compared with open Burch colposuspension as a primary treatment for urodynamic stress incontinence. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis alongside a multicentre randomised comparative trial. SETTING: Gynaecology or Urology departments in 14 centres in the UK and Ireland, including University-associated teaching hospitals and district general hospitals. POPULATION: Women with urodynamic stress incontinence. Exclusion criteria were: (1) detrusor overactivity; (2) major voiding problems; (3) prolapse; (4) previous surgery for incontinence or prolapse. METHODS: Resource use data were collected on all 344 patients in the trial, including length of hospital stay, time in theatre and management of complications; resource use was costed using UK unit costs at 1999-2000 prices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between baseline and six months follow up, based on women""s responses to the EQ-5D health questionnaire. RESULTS: Tension-free vaginal tape resulted in a mean cost saving of pound 243 (95% CI pound 341 to pound 201) compared with colposuspension. Differential mean QALYs per patient (tension-free vaginal tape - colposuspension) was 0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.03). The probability of tension-free vaginal tape being, on average, less costly than colposuspension, was 100%, and the probability of tension-free vaginal tape being more cost effective than colposuspension was 94.6% if the decision-maker was willing to pay pound 30,000 per additional QALY.

DESIGN: A Markov model was developed for a cohort of Swedish women, comparable in relative fracture risk to the women enrolled in the FIT vertebral fracture arm (i.e. age 71 years with low bone mass plus at least one prior spine fracture). The women in the model (with low bone mass and a previous spine fracture) were exposed to alendronate therapy and transitioned over time from a ""well"" health state to health states of ""hip fracture"", ""spine fracture"", ""wrist fracture"" or ""death"". All costs were calculated in 2000 Swedish kronors (SEK). TIME HORIZON: In the Markov model our base-case treatment duration was 5 years followed by a 5-year period where the benefit declined linearly to 0. RESULTS: We found that treating 71-year-old osteoporotic women with a prior spine fracture with alendronate resulted in a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of SEK76000, which is well below the threshold for cost effectiveness of SEK300000. For women aged 65 years, the cost-effectiveness ratio increased to SEK173000 and for women aged 77 years, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to SEK52000. CONCLUSIONS: Treating older osteoporotic women with alendronate was more cost effective than treating younger women with osteoporosis, and treating osteoporotic women with prior spine fracture was more cost effective than treating osteoporotic women without prior spine fracture. However, the costs per QALY gained for all populations studied were below generally accepted thresholds for cost effectiveness.",2003-01-00760,12627984,Pharmacoeconomics,O Johnell,2003,21 / 16,305-14,Yes,12627984,"O Johnell; B JÃ¶nsson; L JÃ¶nsson; Dennis Black; Cost effectiveness of alendronate (fosamax) for the treatment of osteoporosis and prevention of fractures, Pharmacoeconomics, 2003; 21(16):1179-2027; 305-14",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with bisphosphonate alendronate for 5 years vs. Conventional treatment without bisphosphonate alendronate,Not Stated,71 Years,71 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,76384,Sweden,2000,12557.22
2181,Modelling the cost effectiveness of interferon beta and glatiramer acetate in the management of multiple sclerosis. Commentary: evaluating disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of four disease modifying treatments (interferon betas and glatiramer acetate) for relapsing remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Modelling cost effectiveness. SETTING: UK NHS. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year gained. RESULTS: The base case cost per quality adjusted life year gained by using any of the four treatments ranged from pound 42,000 (66,469 dollars; 61,630 euro) to pound 98,000 based on efficacy information in the public domain. Uncertainty analysis suggests that the probability of any of these treatments having a cost effectiveness better than pound 20,000 at 20 years is below 20%. The key determinants of cost effectiveness were the time horizon, the progression of patients after stopping treatment, differential discount rates, and the price of the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Cost effectiveness varied markedly between the interventions. Uncertainty around point estimates was substantial. This uncertainty could be reduced by conducting research on the true magnitude of the effect of these drugs, the progression of patients after stopping treatment, the costs of care, and the quality of life of the patients.

2187,Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic imaging work-up and treatment for patients with intermittent claudication in The Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: to determine the societal cost-effectiveness of various management strategies, including both the diagnostic imaging work-up and treatment, for patients with intermittent claudication in The Netherlands. METHODS: a decision-analytic model was used and included probability and quality of life data available from the literature. A cost-analysis was performed in a university setting in The Netherlands. Imaging work-up options included magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), color-guided duplex ultrasound, or intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and treatment options were percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with selective stent placement if feasible or bypass surgery. Management strategies were defined as combinations of imaging work-up and treatment options. A conservative strategy with no imaging work-up and walking exercises was considered as reference. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (euro), and incremental cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios. The base-case analysis evaluated 60-year-old men with severe unilateral intermittent claudication of at least one year duration. RESULTS: the range in QALYs and costs across management strategies that considered angioplasty as only treatment option was small (maximum difference: 0.0033 QALYs and 451 euros). Similarly, the range was small across management strategies that considered angioplasty if feasible otherwise bypass surgery (maximum difference: 0.0033 QALYs and 280 euros). MRA in combination with angioplasty (6.1487 QALYs and 8556 euros) had a CE ratio of 20,000 euros/QALY relative to the conservative strategy. The most effective strategy was DSA in combination with angioplasty if feasible otherwise bypass surgery (6.2254 QALYs and 18,583 euros) which had a CE ratio of 131,000 euros/QALY relative to MRA in combination with angioplasty. CONCLUSION: the results suggest that the imaging work-up with non-invasive imaging modalities can replace DSA for the work-up of patients with intermittent claudication without a substantial loss in effectiveness and a minimal cost-reduction.

2192,Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic imaging work-up and treatment for patients with intermittent claudication in The Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: to determine the societal cost-effectiveness of various management strategies, including both the diagnostic imaging work-up and treatment, for patients with intermittent claudication in The Netherlands. METHODS: a decision-analytic model was used and included probability and quality of life data available from the literature. A cost-analysis was performed in a university setting in The Netherlands. Imaging work-up options included magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), color-guided duplex ultrasound, or intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and treatment options were percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with selective stent placement if feasible or bypass surgery. Management strategies were defined as combinations of imaging work-up and treatment options. A conservative strategy with no imaging work-up and walking exercises was considered as reference. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (euro), and incremental cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios. The base-case analysis evaluated 60-year-old men with severe unilateral intermittent claudication of at least one year duration. RESULTS: the range in QALYs and costs across management strategies that considered angioplasty as only treatment option was small (maximum difference: 0.0033 QALYs and 451 euros). Similarly, the range was small across management strategies that considered angioplasty if feasible otherwise bypass surgery (maximum difference: 0.0033 QALYs and 280 euros). MRA in combination with angioplasty (6.1487 QALYs and 8556 euros) had a CE ratio of 20,000 euros/QALY relative to the conservative strategy. The most effective strategy was DSA in combination with angioplasty if feasible otherwise bypass surgery (6.2254 QALYs and 18,583 euros) which had a CE ratio of 131,000 euros/QALY relative to MRA in combination with angioplasty.

2193,The cost-effectiveness of hearing-aid fitting in the Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of hearing-aid fitting. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model based on aggregate data and results from a prospective intervention study. SETTING: The cost-effectiveness study was based in the general community. The prospective study was hospital based, as 85% of the first-time hearing-aid users attend a hospital in the process of hearing-aid fitting. PATIENTS: The prospective intervention study included adult first-time hearing-aid users with no contraindications for hearing-aid use. INTERVENTION: The usual process of hearing-aid fitting in the Netherlands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The QALYs were based on EuroQol scores. We included direct and indirect costs in the analysis. RESULTS: The mean improvement on the EuroQol measure was 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 0.08), and on the hearing-specific visual analog scale, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.22-0.31). The base-case outcome based on the EuroQol was 15 807/QALY (US dollars 17 072/QALY) (CI, -24 239/QALY to 3718/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this base-case estimate, fitting of hearing aids is considered a cost-effective health care intervention. The CI indicates that the result is not unambiguously positive, probably because the EuroQol lacked sensitivity for the evaluation of hearing-aid fitting. Until now, no study has found an effect of hearing-aid fitting on generic quality of life. Therefore, measures are needed that are suitable for the evaluation of the effects of interventions for sensory disabilities, such as the fitting of hearing aids, on generic quality of life.",2003-01-00764,12622538,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Manuela A Joore,2003,129 / 3,297-304,No,12622538,"Manuela A Joore; Hans Van Der Stel; Hans J M Peters; Gijs M Boas; Lucien J C Anteunis; The cost-effectiveness of hearing-aid fitting in the Netherlands, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 2003-Mar; 129(3):0886-4470; 297-304",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Usual process of hearing-aid fitting vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,15807,ECU,1998,28169.26
2194,Cost-effectiveness of screening a population with chronic gastroesophageal reflux,"BACKGROUND: Persons with chronic esophageal reflux are at increased risk for the development of Barrett""s esophagus and adenocarcinoma. Recently developed ultrathin endoscopes are less expensive and better tolerated than standard endoscopes, they can be used without sedation, and are sensitive and specific for Barrett""s esophagus. The cost-effectiveness of one-time screening strategies were evaluated for 50-year-old patients with chronic reflux: no screening, standard endoscopy, and screening by an ultrathin endoscope. METHODS: Markov models were created to simulate the clinical course for patients with chronic reflux. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated from cancer registry data, published medical data, and expert opinion. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, no screening resulted in average costs of $11,785 per person and 19.3226 quality-adjusted life-years. Ultrathin endoscopy screening resulted in costs of $12,119 per person and 19.3326 quality-adjusted life-years, yielding a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $55,764 per quality-adjusted life-year. Using standard endoscopy yielded costs of $12,332 with only slightly greater effectiveness, yielding a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $709,260 when compared with ultrathin endoscopy and $86,833 compared with no screening. Results were most sensitive to variation in the incidence of cancer in the population with Barrett""s esophagus.

2197,The cost-effectiveness of infliximab (Remicade) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Sweden and the United Kingdom based on the ATTRACT study,"OBJECTIVE: The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of infliximab (Remicade) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was estimated on the basis of a clinical trial comparing infliximab plus methotrexate with methotrexate alone in 428 patients with advanced disease [Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT)]. METHODS: The effect of infliximab on disease progression and related costs and utilities was estimated using two disease progression models based on epidemiological cohorts followed for up to 15 yr in Sweden and the UK. The clinical trial data were used directly in the model and extrapolated to 10 yr using a cohort from the epidemiological studies matched for gender, age, time since onset of RA and disease severity. RESULTS: One to two years of treatment with infliximab treatment reduced direct and indirect resource consumption in both countries, thereby partly offsetting the treatment cost. In the base case, including both direct and indirect costs, the cost per QALY gained was SEK 32 000 (euro 3440) in Sweden and GBP 21 600 (euro 34 800) for 1 yr of treatment. The respective QALY gains were 0.248 and 0.298. With 2 yr of treatment, the costs per QALY gained were SEK 150 000 (euro 16 100) and GBP 29 900 (euro;48 200).

AIMS: To estimate the cost effectiveness of treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin compared with interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin for initial treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: Individual patient level data from a randomised clinical trial with peginterferon plus ribavirin were applied to a previously published and validated Markov model to project lifelong clinical outcomes. Quality of life and economic estimates were based on German patient data. We used a societal perspective and applied a 3% annual discount rate. RESULTS: Compared with no antiviral therapy, peginterferon plus fixed or weight based dosing of ribavirin increased life expectancy by 4.2 and 4.7 years, respectively. Compared with standard interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin, peginterferon plus fixed or weight based dosing of ribavirin increased life expectancy by 0.5 and by 1.0 years with incremental cost effectiveness ratios of 11,800 euros and 6600 euros per quality adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. Subgroup analyses by genotype, viral load, sex, and histology showed that peginterferon plus weight based ribavirin remained cost effective compared with other well accepted medical treatments.
