18401,Cost-Utility of a Single-Injection Combined Corticosteroid-Hyaluronic Acid Formulation vs a 2-Injection Regimen of Sequential Corticosteroid and Hyaluronic Acid Injections,"Research has shown early and sustained relief with a combination therapy of a corticosteroid (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. This can be administered via a single injection containing both products or as separate injections. The former may be more expensive when considering only product cost, but the latter incurs the additional costs and time of a second procedure. The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-utility of the single injection with the 2-injection regimen. The results of this analysis revealed that the single-injection formulation of a CS and HA may be cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, for symptomatic relief of OA symptoms. This treatment may also be more desirable to patients who find injections to be inconvenient or unpleasant.",2017-01-25287,28638242,Clin Med Insights Arthritis Musculoskelet Disord,Etienne L Belzile,2017,10 /,1179544117712993,No,28638242,"Etienne L Belzile; Robert T Deakon; Christopher Vannabouathong; Mohit Bhandari; Martin Lamontagne; Robert McCormack; Cost-Utility of a Single-Injection Combined Corticosteroid-Hyaluronic Acid Formulation vs a 2-Injection Regimen of Sequential Corticosteroid and Hyaluronic Acid Injections, Clin Med Insights Arthritis Musculoskelet Disord, 2017; 10():1179-5441; 1179544117712993",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single-injection regimen (combined corticosteroid-hyaluronic acid) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Two-injection regimen (sequential corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid.,Not Stated,75 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-6725.71,Canada,2016,-5481.62
18402,Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: The VICO Randomized Clinical Trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes),"BACKGROUND: Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO2 EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO2 EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years). RESULTS: The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; P<0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; P=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; P=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (P<0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (P=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of pound20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.

18404,Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Sunitinib and pazopanib are the only two targeted therapies for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) recommended by the United Kingdom''s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Pazopanib demonstrated non-inferior efficacy and a differentiated safety profile versus sunitinib in the phase III COMPARZ trial. The current analysis provides a direct comparison of the cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib from the perspective of the United Kingdom''s National Health Service based on data from COMPARZ and other sources. METHODS: A partitioned-survival analysis model with three health states (alive with no progression, alive with progression, or dead) was used to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for pazopanib versus sunitinib over five years (duration of follow-up for final survival analysis in COMPARZ). The proportion of patients in each health state over time was based on Kaplan-Meier distributions for progression-free and overall survival from COMPARZ. Utility values were based on EQ-5D data from the pivotal study of pazopanib versus placebo. Costs were based on medical resource utilisation data from COMPARZ and unit costs from secondary sources. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty of model results. RESULTS: In the base case, pazopanib was estimated to provide more QALYs (0.0565, 95% credible interval [CrI]: -0.0920 to 0.2126) at a lower cost (- pound1,061, 95% CrI: - pound4,328 to pound2,067) versus sunitinib. The probability that pazopanib yields more QALYs than sunitinib was estimated to be 76%. For a threshold value of pound30,000 per QALY gained, the probability that pazopanib is cost-effective versus sunitinib was estimated to be 95%. Pazopanib was dominant in most scenarios examined in deterministic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Pazopanib is likely to be a cost-effective treatment option compared with sunitinib as first-line treatment of mRCC in the United Kingdom.",2017-01-25295,28636648,PLoS One,Jordan Amdahl,2017,12 / 6,e0175920,No,28636648,"Jordan Amdahl; Jose Diaz; Arati Sharma; Jinhee Park; David Chandiwana; Thomas E Delea; Cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the United Kingdom, PLoS One , 2017; 12(6):1932-6203; e0175920",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pazopanib vs. Standard/Usual Care- Sunitinib,Treatment-naïve patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-15353.54,United Kingdom,2014,-27669.33
18405,"Costs and effectiveness of fingolimod versus alemtuzumab in the treatment of highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the UK: re-treatment, discount, and disutility","OBJECTIVE: Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated with disease modifying therapies (DMTs) who continue to experience disease activity may be considered for escalation therapies such as fingolimod, or may be considered for alemtuzumab. Previous economic modeling used Markov models; applying one alternative technique, discrete event simulation (DES) modeling, allows re-treatment and long-term adverse events (AEs) to be included in the analysis. METHODS: A DES was adapted to model relapse-triggered re-treatment with alemtuzumab and the effect of including ongoing quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements for AEs that extend beyond previous 1-year Markov cycles. As the price to the NHS of fingolimod in the UK is unknown, due to a confidential patient access scheme (PAS), a variety of possible discounts were tested. The interaction of re-treatment assumptions for alemtuzumab with the possible discounts for fingolimod was tested to determine which DMT resulted in lower lifetime costs. The lifetime QALY results were derived from modeled treatment effect and short- and long-term AEs. RESULTS: Most permutations of fingolimod PAS discount and alemtuzumab re-treatment rate resulted in fingolimod being less costly than alemtuzumab. As the percentage of patients who are re-treated with alemtuzumab due to experiencing a relapse approaches 100% of those who relapse whilst on treatment, the discount required for fingolimod to be less costly drops below 5%. Consideration of treatment effect alone found alemtuzumab generated 0.2 more QALYs/patient; the inclusion of AEs up to a duration of 1 year reduced this advantage to only 0.14 QALYs/patient. Modeling AEs with a lifetime QALY decrement found that both DMTs generated very similar QALYs with the difference only 0.04 QALYs/patient. CONCLUSIONS: When the model captured alemtuzumab re-treatment and long-term AE decrements, it was found that fingolimod is cost-effective compared to alemtuzumab, assuming application of only a modest level of confidential PAS discount.",2017-01-25297,28635362,J Med Econ,Stephen M Montgomery,2017,20 / 9,962-973,Yes,28635362,"Stephen M Montgomery; Jeanette Kusel; Richard Nicholas; Nicholas Adlard; Costs and effectiveness of fingolimod versus alemtuzumab in the treatment of highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the UK: re-treatment, discount, and disutility, J Med Econ, 2017 Sep; 20(9):1369-6998; 962-973",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fingolimod vs. Alemtuzumab,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,20665.23,United Kingdom,2015,34491.35
18406,Cost Effectiveness of Pre- vs Post-Liver Transplant Hepatitis C Treatment With Direct-Acting Antivirals,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment offer new hope to both pre- and post-liver transplant (LT) patients. However, whether to treat HCV patients before vs after LT is not clear because treatment can improve liver function but could reduce the chance of receiving a LT while on the waiting list. Our objective was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pre-LT vs post-LT HCV treatment with oral DAAs in decompensated cirrhotic patients on the LT waiting list. METHODS: We used a validated mathematical model that simulated a virtual trial comparing long-term clinical and cost outcomes of pre-LT vs post-LT HCV treatment with oral DAAs. Model parameters were estimated from United Network for Organ Sharing data, SOLAR-1 and 2 trials, and published studies. For each strategy, we estimated the quality-adjusted life-year, life expectancy, cost, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: For lower MELD scores, quality-adjusted life-years were higher with pre-LT HCV treatment compared with post-LT treatment. Pre-LT HCV treatment was cost saving in patients with MELD scores of 15 or less, and cost effective in patients with MELD scores of 16 to 21. In contrast, post-LT HCV treatment was cost effective in patients with MELD scores of 22 to 29 and cost saving if MELD scores were 30 or higher. Results varied by drug prices and by United Network for Organ Sharing regions.

However, whether to treat HCV patients before vs after LT is not clear because treatment can improve liver function but could reduce the chance of receiving a LT while on the waiting list. Our objective was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pre-LT vs post-LT HCV treatment with oral DAAs in decompensated cirrhotic patients on the LT waiting list. METHODS: We used a validated mathematical model that simulated a virtual trial comparing long-term clinical and cost outcomes of pre-LT vs post-LT HCV treatment with oral DAAs.

18422,The effect of PD-L1 testing on the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the second-line treatment of NSCLC,"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors improve outcomes compared with chemotherapy in lung cancer. Tumor PD-L1 receptor expression is being studied as a predictive biomarker. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of second-line treatment with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab with and without the use of PD-L1 testing for patient selection. Design: We developed a decision-analytic model to determine the cost-effectiveness of PD-L1 assessment and second-line immunotherapy versus docetaxel. The model used outcomes data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and drug acquisition costs from the United States. Thereafter, we used epidemiologic data to estimate the economic impact of the treatment. Results: We included four RCTs (2 with nivolumab, 1 with pembrolizumab, and 1 with atezolizumab). The incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for nivolumab was 0.417 among squamous tumors and 0.287 among non-squamous tumors and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were $155 605 and $187 685, respectively. The QALY gain in the base case for atezolizumab was 0.354 and the ICER was $215 802. Compared with treating all patients, the selection of patients by PD-L1 expression improved incremental QALY by up to 183% and decreased the ICER by up to 65%. Pembrolizumab was studied only in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1. The QALY gain was 0.346 and the ICER was $98 421. Patient selection also reduced the budget impact of immunotherapy.

18426,Cost-effectiveness of blinatumomab versus salvage chemotherapy in relapsed or refractory Philadelphia-chromosome-negative B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US payer perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of blinatumomab (Blincyto) vs standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy in adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Philadelphia-chromosome-negative (Ph-) B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on the results of the phase 3 TOWER study from a US healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: The Blincyto Global Economic Model (B-GEM), a partitioned survival model, was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of blinatumomab vs SOC. Response rates, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), numbers of cycles of blinatumomab and SOC, and transplant rates were estimated from TOWER. EFS and OS were estimated by fitting parametric survival distributions to failure-time data from TOWER. Utility values were based on EORTC-8D derived from EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments in TOWER. A 50-year lifetime horizon and US payer perspective were employed. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: The B-GEM projected blinatumomab to yield 1.92 additional life years and 1.64 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SOC at an incremental cost of $180,642. The ICER for blinatumomab vs SOC was estimated to be $110,108/QALY gained in the base case. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the number and cost of inpatient days for administration of blinatumomab and SOC, and was more favorable in the sub-group of patients who had received no prior salvage therapy. At an ICER threshold of $150,000/QALY gained, the probability that blinatumomab is cost-effective was estimated to be 74%. LIMITATIONS: The study does not explicitly consider the impact of adverse events of the treatment; no adjustments for long-term transplant rates were made. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SOC, blinatumomab is a cost-effective treatment option for adults with R/R Ph - B-precursor ALL from the US healthcare perspective at an ICER threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. The value of blinatumomab is derived from its incremental survival and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) benefit over SOC.",2017-01-25306,28631497,J Med Econ,Thomas E Delea,2017,20 / 9,911-922,Yes,28631497,"Thomas E Delea; Jordan Amdahl; Diana Boyko; May Hagiwara; Zachary F Zimmerman; Janet L Franklin; Ze Cong; Guy Hechmati; Anthony Stein; Cost-effectiveness of blinatumomab versus salvage chemotherapy in relapsed or refractory Philadelphia-chromosome-negative B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US payer perspective, J Med Econ, 2017 Sep; 20(9):1369-6998; 911-922",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Blinatumomab vs. Standard/Usual Care,Patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-negative B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,110108,United States,2017,116258

18432,Cost-effectiveness of implementing computed tomography screening for lung cancer in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: A screening program for lung cancer requires more empirical evidence. Based on the experience of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), we developed a method to adjust lead-time bias and quality-of-life changes for estimating the cost-effectiveness of implementing computed tomography (CT) screening in Taiwan. METHODS: The target population was high-risk (>/=30 pack-years) smokers between 55 and 75 years of age. From a nation-wide, 13-year follow-up cohort, we estimated quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), loss-of-QALE, and lifetime healthcare expenditures per case of lung cancer stratified by pathology and stage. Cumulative stage distributions for CT-screening and no-screening were assumed equal to those for CT-screening and radiography-screening in the NLST to estimate the savings of loss-of-QALE and additional costs of lifetime healthcare expenditures after CT screening. Costs attributable to screen-negative subjects, false-positive cases and radiation-induced lung cancer were included to obtain the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from the public payer''s perspective. RESULTS: The incremental costs were US$22,755 per person. After dividing this by savings of loss-of-QALE (1.16 quality-adjusted life year (QALY)), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$19,683 per QALY. This ratio would fall to US$10,947 per QALY if the stage distribution for CT-screening was the same as that of screen-detected cancers in the NELSON trial. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer among high-risk smokers would be cost-effective in Taiwan. As only about 5% of our women are smokers, future research is necessary to identify the high-risk groups among non-smokers and increase the coverage.",2017-01-25319,28625633,Lung Cancer,Szu-Chun Yang,2017,108 /,183-191,No,28625633,"Szu-Chun Yang; Wu-Wei Lai; Chien-Chung Lin; Wu-Chou Su; Li-Jung Ku; Jing-Shiang Hwang; Jung-Der Wang; Cost-effectiveness of implementing computed tomography screening for lung cancer in Taiwan, Lung Cancer, 2017 Jun; 108():0169-5002; 183-191",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for lung cancer with Computed Tomography vs. Screening for lung cancer without Computed Tomography,High risk (=> 30 pack-years) smokers,75 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,19683,United States,2013,21867.46
18433,Long-term Cost-effectiveness of Two GLP-1 Receptor Agonists for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the Italian Setting: Liraglutide Versus Lixisenatide,"PURPOSE: Maintaining glycemic control is the key treatment target for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may be associated with other favorable treatment characteristics, such as reduction in body weight and reduced risk of hypoglycemia compared with traditional diabetes interventions. The aim of the present analysis was to compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of 2 GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide 1.8 mg and lixisenatide 20 mug (both administered once daily), in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control with metformin monotherapy in the Italian setting. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project long-term clinical outcomes and subsequent costs (in 2015 Euros [euro]) associated with liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 mug treatment in a cohort with baseline characteristics derived from the open-label LIRA-LIXI trial (Efficacy and Safety of Liraglutide Versus Lixisenatide as Add-on to Metformin in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes; NCT01973231) over patient lifetimes from the perspective of a health care payer. Efficacy data were taken from the 26-week end points of the same trial, including changes in glycated hemoglobin, body mass index, serum lipid levels, and hypoglycemic event rates. Outcomes projected included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative incidence and time to onset of diabetes-related complications, and direct medical costs. Outcomes were discounted at 3% annually, and sensitivity analyses were performed. FINDINGS: Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with improved discounted life expectancy (14.07 vs 13.96 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.18 vs 9.06 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) compared with lixisenatide 20 mug. These improvements were mostly attributable to a greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin level with liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 mug, leading to reduced incidence and increased time to onset of diabetes-related complications. Compared with lixisenatide 20 mug, liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with increased total costs over patient lifetimes (euro41,623 vs euro41,380), but this was offset by lower costs of treating diabetes-related complications (euro26,682 vs euro27,476).

18434,Decision aids for patients considering total joint replacement: a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a key priority to improve patient-centred care, and can play an important role in helping patients decide whether to undergo total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Patient decision aids can support SDM; however, they may incur an upfront cost. We aimed to estimate the health and economic effects of patient decision aids for TJA. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 2-year follow-up. 343 patients were recruited from two orthopedic screening clinics in Ottawa, Canada. Patients were randomized to either a patient decision aid plus surgeon preference report (decision aid) or usual care. Primary outcomes were costs (in 2014 CAD$), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs were calculated by multiplying self-reported resource use by unit costs. QALYs were calculated by mapping the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) health utilities. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 5%. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data, and bootstrapping was used to estimate uncertainty. RESULTS: The sample comprised 167 intervention and 167 control group patients. The decision aid arm had fewer surgeries over the 2-year period thereby incurring a negative incremental cost of -$560 (95% CI: -$1358 to $426) per patient while providing 0.05 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.13) additional QALYs per patient. Consequently, the decision aid arm was dominant. CONCLUSION: The use of a patient decision aid was associated with fewer health care costs, while producing similar health outcomes.

18435,Cost-effectiveness of Memory Assessment Services for the diagnosis and early support of patients with dementia in England,"Background Policy makers in England advocate referral of patients with suspected dementia to Memory Assessment Services (MAS), but it is unclear how any improvement in patients'' health-related quality of life (HRQL) compares with the associated costs. Aims To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MAS for the diagnosis and follow-up care of patients with suspected dementia. Method We analysed observational data from 1318 patients referred to 69 MAS, and their lay carers (n = 944), who completed resource use and HRQL questionnaires at baseline, three and six months. We reported mean differences in HRQL (disease-specific DEMQOL and generic EQ-5D-3L), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs between baseline and six months after referral to MAS. We also assessed the cost-effectiveness of MAS across different patient subgroups and clinic characteristics. Results Referral to MAS was associated with gains in DEMQOL (mean gain: 3.48, 95% confidence interval: 2.84 to 4.12), EQ-5D-3L (0.023, 0.008 to 0.038) and QALYs (0.006, 0.002 to 0.01). Mean total cost over six months, assuming a societal perspective, was pound1899 ( pound1277 to pound2539). This yielded a negative incremental net monetary benefit of - pound1724 (- pound2388 to - pound1085), assuming NICE''s recommended willingness-to-pay threshold ( pound30,000 per QALY). These base case results were relatively robust to alternative assumptions about costs and HRQL. There was some evidence that patients aged 80 or older benefitted more from referral to MAS (p < 0.01 from adjusted mean differences in net benefits) compared to younger patients. MAS with over 75 new patients a month or cost per patient less than pound2500 over six months were relatively more cost-effective (p < 0.01) than MAS with fewer new monthly patients or higher cost per patient. Conclusions Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care provided by MAS to patients with suspected dementia appears to be effective, but not cost-effective, in the six months after diagnosis. Longer term evidence is required before drawing conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of MAS.",2017-01-25329,28622732,J Health Serv Res Policy,Manuel Gomes,2017,/,1355819617714816,No,28622732,"Manuel Gomes; Mark Pennington; Raphael Wittenberg; Martin Knapp; Nick Black; Sarah Smith; Cost-effectiveness of Memory Assessment Services for the diagnosis and early support of patients with dementia in England, J Health Serv Res Policy, 2017 Jan 01; ():1355-8196; 1355819617714816",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Memory Assessment Services (MAS) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,374164,United Kingdom,2014,674298.67
18436,Cost Effectiveness of Pembrolizumab vs. Standard-of-Care Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment for Metastatic NSCLC that Expresses High Levels of PD-L1 in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab compared with standard-of-care (SoC) platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that expresses high levels of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) [tumour proportion score (TPS) >/=50%], from a US third-party public healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: We conducted a partitioned-survival model with a cycle length of 1 week and a base-case time horizon of 20 years. Parametric models were fitted to Kaplan-Meier estimates of time on treatment, progression-free survival and overall survival from the KEYNOTE-024 randomized clinical trial (patients aged >/=18 years with stage IV NSCLC, TPS >/=50%, without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations who received no prior systemic chemotherapy) and validated with long-term registry data. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated based on EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) utility data collected in the trial. Costs ($US, year 2016 values) for drug acquisition/administration, adverse events and clinical management were included. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. A series of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, pembrolizumab resulted in an expected gain of 1.31 life-years (LYs) and 1.05 QALYs and an incremental cost of $US102,439 compared with SoC. The incremental cost per QALY gain was $US97,621/QALY and the incremental cost per LY gain was $US78,344/LY.

SETTING: Memory clinics in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 200 individuals with mild AD aged 50-90 years gave informed consent to participate in the study. Participants were randomised to control or intervention group. INTERVENTIONS: Control group received treatment as usual. The intervention group performed 1 hour of supervised moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise three times weekly for 16 weeks. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: Different physical, functional and health measures were obtained at inclusion (baseline) and 4 and 16 weeks after. HRQoL (EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels/EQ-Visual Analogue Scale) was reported by the participants and the primary caregivers as proxy respondents. Differences in HRQOL as reported by the participant and caregiver were explored as were different values of caregiver time with respite from care tasks. RESULTS: The intervention cost was estimated at euro608 and euro496 per participant, with and without transport cost, respectively. Participants and caregivers in the intervention group reported a small, positive non-significant improvement in EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS after 16 weeks. The ICER was estimated at euro72 000/quality-adjusted life year using participant-reported outcomes and euro87000 using caregiver-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the exercise intervention is unlikely to be cost-effective within the commonly applied threshold values. The cost of the intervention might be offset by potential savings from reduction in use of health and social care.

Materials and Methods A state-transition microsimulation model of osteoporosis for postmenopausal women aged 55 years or older was developed with a lifetime horizon and U.S. societal perspective. All model inputs were derived from published literature. Three strategies were compared: no screening, DXA with T score-dependent rescreening intervals, and a combination of DXA and quantitative CT with different intervals (3, 5, and 10 years) at different screening initiation ages (55-65 years). Oral bisphosphonate therapy was started if DXA hip T scores were less than or equal to -2.5, 10-year risk for hip fracture was greater than 3% (World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool score, or FRAX), 10-year risk for major osteoporotic fracture was greater than 20% (FRAX), quantitative CT femur bone strength was less than 3000 N, or occurrence of first fracture (eg, hip, vertebral body, wrist). Outcome measures were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2015 U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and number of fragility fractures. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also performed. Results The most cost-effective strategy was combined DXA and quantitative CT screening starting at age 55 with quantitative CT screening every 5 years (ICER, $2000 per QALY). With this strategy, 12.8% of postmenopausal women sustained hip fractures in their remaining life (no screening, 18.7%; DXA screening, 15.8%). The corresponding percentages of vertebral fractures for DXA and quantitative CT with a 5-year interval, was 7.5%; no screening, 11.1%; DXA screening, 9%; for wrist fractures, 14%, 17.8%, and 16.4%, respectively; for other fractures, 22.6%, 30.8%, and 27.3%, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, DXA and quantitative CT at age 55 years with quantitative CT screening every 5 years was the best strategy in more than 90% of all 1000 simulations (for thresholds of $50 000 per QALY and $100 000 per QALY).

Sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the impact of various parameters and assumptions on the model output. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs from a health care perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 6-month GnRH-a therapy compared with no therapy ranged from $6,185 per QALY in deep endometriosis to $6,425 with peritoneal endometriosis. A one-way sensitivity analysis showed considerable influential factors, such as remission rates and utility values. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that 6-month GnRH-a therapy is cost-effective in most cases at a threshold of $7,400/QALY, regardless of the type of endometriosis. CONCLUSION: Six months of therapy with GnRH-a can be a highly cost-effective option for the prevention of endometriosis recurrence.

18454,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Rivaroxaban for Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Greece,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major healthcare concern that results in substantial morbidity and mortality with great economic burden for healthcare systems. Hence, the need for effective and efficient treatment of patients with VTE is important for both clinical and economic reasons. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared to standard of care (SoC) with enoxaparin followed by dose-adjusted vitamin-K antagonists for the treatment of DVT and PE in Greece. METHODS: An existing Markov model was locally adapted from a third-party payer perspective to reflect the management and complications of DVT and PE in the course of 3-month cycles, up to death. The clinical inputs and utility values were extracted from published studies. Direct medical costs, obtained from local resources, were incorporated in the model and refer to year 2017. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was carried out to deal with uncertainty. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that rivaroxaban in 3- and 6-month treatment duration for DVT and PE, respectively, as this is the common clinical practice in Greece, was associated with a 0.02 and 0.01 increment in QALYs compared to SoC, respectively. Rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced total cost in DVT (euro85) but with an additional total cost in PE (euro2) compared to SoC. Therefore, rivaroxaban was a dominant (less costly, more effective) and cost-effective (ICER: euro177) alternative over SoC for the management of DVT and PE, respectively. PSA revealed that the probability of rivaroxaban being cost effective at a threshold of euro34,000 per QALY gained was 99% and 81% for DVT and PE, respectively.

18456,An Economic Analysis of a Peanut Oral Immunotherapy Study in Children,"BACKGROUND: Peanut oral immunotherapy (POIT) decreases the probability of accidental recurrent systemic reactions but reactions from the therapy itself are frequent. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this economic analysis was to characterize the potential cost-effectiveness of POIT. METHODS: Cohort simulations were used to evaluate the effect of POIT for children with peanut allergy. A POIT with probiotic was used in the base-case simulation and long-term survival was modeled using age-adjusted mortality together with the risk of food allergy-associated mortality. RESULTS: The incremental POIT cost-effectiveness ratio was $2142 per quality-adjusted life-year. A mean number of 12.3 (95% CI, 12.0-12.5) and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9-2.1) allergic reactions occurred in the POIT and avoidance groups over 20 years of simulation, with 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2-2.3) episodes of anaphylaxis treated with intramuscular epinephrine per subject in the POIT group and 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0-1.2) episodes per subject in the avoidance group. In sensitivity analyses, POIT was associated with lower rates of anaphylaxis than strict avoidance when the annual rate of accidental allergic reactions in the peanut avoidance group exceeded 25%, the annual rate of anaphylaxis in the POIT group dropped below 6%, or the probability of sustained unresponsiveness after 4 years of POIT was 68% or greater. CONCLUSIONS: POIT may be cost-effective in a long-term economic model. However, treated patients may experience a greater rate of peanut-associated allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.

18457,Cost-effectiveness of subdermal implantable buprenorphine versus sublingual buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder,"AIMS: Subdermal implantable buprenorphine (BSI) was recently approved to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) in clinically-stable adults. In the pivotal clinical trial, BSI was associated with a higher proportion of completely-abstinent patients (85.7% vs 71.9%; p = .03) vs sublingual buprenorphine (SL-BPN). Elsewhere, relapse to illicit drug use is associated with diminished treatment outcomes and increased costs. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BSI vs SL-BPN from a US societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov model simulated BSI and SL-BPN cohorts (clinically-stable adults) transiting through four mutually-exclusive health states for 12 months. Cohorts accumulated direct medical costs from drug acquisition/administration; treatment-diversion/abuse; newly-acquired hepatitis-C; emergency room, hospital, and rehabilitation services; and pediatric poisonings. Non-medical costs of criminality, lost wages/work-productivity, and out-of-pocket expenses were also included. Transition probabilities to a relapsed state were derived from the aforementioned trial. Other transition probabilities, costs, and health-state utilities were derived from observational studies and adjusted for trial characteristics. Outcomes included incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained and incremental net-monetary-benefit (INMB). Uncertainty was assessed by univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: BSI was associated with lower total costs (-$4,386), more QALYs (+0.031), and favorable INMB at all willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds considered. Higher drug acquisition costs for BSI (+$6,492) were outpaced, primarily by reductions in emergency room/hospital utilization (-$8,040) and criminality (-$1,212). BSI was cost-effective in 89% of PSA model replicates, and had a significantly higher NMB at $50,000/QALY ($20,783 vs $15,007; p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: BSI was preferred over SL-BPN from a health-economic perspective for treatment of OUD in clinically-stable adults.

18458,Cost-Utility Analysis of Bariatric Surgery in Italy: Results of Decision-Analytic Modelling,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in Italy from a third-party payer perspective over a medium-term (10 years) and a long-term (lifetime) horizon. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed, in which patients may experience surgery, post-surgery complications, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases or die. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from the Italian and international literature. Three types of surgeries were considered: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. A base-case analysis was performed for the population, the characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates in Italy. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, over 10 years, bariatric surgery led to cost increment of EUR 2,661 and generated additional 1.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of EUR 8,649, additional 0.5 life years and 3.2 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 2,412/QALY and dominant over conservative management over a lifetime.

Due to variability in pricing, value for money may be different in other countries. Our objective was to establish the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in mCRC in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and Israel. METHODS: We performed the analysis using a previously established Markov model for mCRC. Input data for efficacy, adverse events, and quality of life were considered to be generalizable and therefore identical for all countries. We used country-specific prices for medications, administration, and other health service costs. All costs were converted from local currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in March 2016. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) to assess the model robustness across parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: Base case results demonstrated that the highest ICER was in the U.S. ($571,000/QALY) and the lowest was in Australia ($277,000/QALY). In Canada, the U.K., and Israel, ICERs ranged between $351,000 and $358,000 per QALY.

METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, participants were randomized into intervention or CAU group. Adherence, self-efficacy (Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale [ESES]), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, production losses, and patient and family costs were assessed at baseline and during the 12-month study period. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e., cost per increased adherence, self-efficacy, or QALY), and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 102 patients were included in the study, of whom 52 were in the intervention group. Adherence rates over 6 months were 63.7% for the CAU group and 75.9% for the intervention group. Adherence, ESES, and quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. An ICER of euro54 per point increase in ESES score at 6 months and euro1,105 per point increase at 12-month follow-up was found. The intervention resulted in an ICER of euro88 per percentage of adherence increase at 6 months. ICERs of euro8,272 and euro15,144 per QALY gained were found at 6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively.

18467,Colonoscopic surveillance - a cost-effective method to prevent hereditary and familial colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Approximately 20-30% of all colorectal cancer (CRC) cases may have a familial contribution. The family history of CRC can be prominent (e.g., hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC)) or more moderate (e.g., familial colorectal cancer (FCRC)). For family members at risk, colonoscopic surveillance is a well-established method to prevent both HCRC and FCRC, although the evidence for the exact procedures of the surveillance is limited. Surveillance can come at a high price if individuals are frequently examined, as this may result in unnecessary colonoscopies in relation to actual risk for CRC. This study analyses the cost-effectiveness of a surveillance programme implemented in the Northern Sweden Health Care Region. METHODS: The study includes 259 individuals prospectively recorded in the colonoscopic surveillance programme registry at the Cancer Prevention Clinic, Umea University Hospital. We performed a cost-utility analysis with a contrafactual design: we compared observed costs and loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) due to CRC with the surveillance programme to an expected outcome without surveillance. The main measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between surveillance and non-surveillance. Scenario analysis was used to explore uncertainty. RESULTS: The ICER between surveillance and non-surveillance in the base model was 3596euro/QALY. The ICER varied from -4620euro in the best-case scenario to 33,779euro in the worst-case scenario. CONCLUSION: Colonoscopic surveillance is a very cost-effective method to prevent HCRC and FCRC compared to current thresholds for cost-effectiveness and other cancer preventive interventions.",2017-01-25398,28587529,Scand J Gastroenterol,Olle Sjostrom,2017,52 / 9,1002-1007,No,28587529,"Olle Sjostrom; Lars Lindholm; Beatrice Melin; Colonoscopic surveillance - a cost-effective method to prevent hereditary and familial colorectal cancer, Scand J Gastroenterol, 2017 Sep; 52(9):0036-5521; 1002-1007",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Colonoscopic surveillance vs. Standard/Usual Care- No surveillance,Family history of colorectal cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,3596,Euro,2015,4357.52
18468,Cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer prevention,"OBJECTIVES: Data suggesting a link between the fallopian tube and ovarian cancer have led to an increase in rates of salpingectomy at the time of pelvic surgery, a practice known as opportunistic salpingectomy (OS). However, the potential benefits, risks and costs for this new practice are not well established. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic permanent contraception or hysterectomy for benign indications. METHODS: We created two models to compare the cost-effectiveness of salpingectomy versus usual care. The hypothetical study population is 50,000 women aged 45 undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovarian preservation for benign indications, and 300,000 women aged 35 undergoing laparoscopic permanent contraception. SEER data were used for probabilities of ovarian cancer cases and deaths. The ovarian cancer risk reduction, complication rates, utilities and associated costs were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were performed, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to determine the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the laparoscopic hysterectomy cohort, OS is cost saving and would yield $23.9 million in health care dollars saved. In the laparoscopic permanent contraception cohort, OS is cost-effective with an ICER of $31,432/QALY compared to tubal ligation, and remains cost-effective as long as it reduces ovarian cancer risk by 54%.

18469,Cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer prevention,"OBJECTIVES: Data suggesting a link between the fallopian tube and ovarian cancer have led to an increase in rates of salpingectomy at the time of pelvic surgery, a practice known as opportunistic salpingectomy (OS). However, the potential benefits, risks and costs for this new practice are not well established. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic permanent contraception or hysterectomy for benign indications. METHODS: We created two models to compare the cost-effectiveness of salpingectomy versus usual care. The hypothetical study population is 50,000 women aged 45 undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovarian preservation for benign indications, and 300,000 women aged 35 undergoing laparoscopic permanent contraception. SEER data were used for probabilities of ovarian cancer cases and deaths. The ovarian cancer risk reduction, complication rates, utilities and associated costs were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were performed, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to determine the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the laparoscopic hysterectomy cohort, OS is cost saving and would yield $23.9 million in health care dollars saved. In the laparoscopic permanent contraception cohort, OS is cost-effective with an ICER of $31,432/QALY compared to tubal ligation, and remains cost-effective as long as it reduces ovarian cancer risk by 54%. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated cost-effectiveness with hysterectomy and permanent contraception in 62.3% and 55% of trials, respectively.

18470,Economic Evaluation of Complete Revascularization for Patients with Multivessel Disease Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of complete revascularization at index admission compared with infarct-related artery (IRA) treatment only, in patients with multivessel disease undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS: An economic evaluation of a multicenter randomized trial was conducted, comparing complete revascularization at index admission to IRA-only P-PCI in patients with multivessel disease (12-month follow-up). Overall hospital costs (costs for P-PCI procedure(s), hospital length of stay, and any subsequent re-admissions) were estimated. Outcomes were major adverse cardiac events (MACEs, a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemia-driven revascularization) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) derived from the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Multiple imputation was undertaken. The mean incremental cost and effect, with associated 95% confidence intervals, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were estimated. RESULTS: On the basis of 296 patients, the mean incremental overall hospital cost for complete revascularization was estimated to be - pound215.96 (- pound1390.20 to pound958.29), compared with IRA-only, with a per-patient mean reduction in MACEs of 0.170 (0.044 to 0.296) and a QALY gain of 0.011 (-0.019 to 0.041). According to the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, the probability of complete revascularization being cost-effective was estimated to be 72.0% at a willingness-to-pay threshold value of pound20,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Complete revascularization at index admission was estimated to be more effective (in terms of MACEs and QALYs) and cost-effective (overall costs were estimated to be lower and complete revascularization thereby dominated IRA-only).

METHODS: A discrete time Markov model simulated HCV progression and treatment over 20 years. Population cohorts were defined by behaviors that influence the risk of HCV exposure: PWID, MSM-HIV, an overlap cohort of individuals who are both PWID and MSM-HIV, and all other adults. Six different treatment scenarios were modeled, with varying degrees of access to treatment at different fibrosis stages and to different risk cohorts. Benefits were measured as quality-adjusted life-years and a $150,000/quality-adjusted life-year valuation was used to assess social benefits. RESULTS: Compared with limiting treatment to METAVIR fibrosis stages F3 or F4 and excluding PWID, expanding treatment to patients in all fibrosis stages and including PWID reduces cumulative new infections by 55% over a 20-year horizon and reduces the prevalence of HCV by 93%.

18475,Projected long-term outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with fast-acting insulin aspart vs conventional insulin aspart in the UK setting,"AIM: To assess the impact of faster aspart vs insulin aspart on long-term clinical outcomes and costs for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the UK setting. METHODS: The QuintilesIMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical outcomes and costs over patient lifetimes in a cohort with data on baseline characteristics from the ""onset 1"" trial. Treatment effects were taken from the 26-week main phase of the onset 1 trial, with costs and utilities based on literature review. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: Projections indicated that faster aspart was associated with improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (by 0.13 quality-adjusted life-years) vs insulin aspart. Improved clinical outcomes resulted from fewer diabetes-related complications and a delayed time to their onset with faster aspart. Faster aspart was found to be associated with reduced costs vs insulin aspart (cost savings of pound1715), resulting from diabetes-related complications avoided and reduced treatment costs.

18476,Optimal costs of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis for men who have sex with men,"INTRODUCTION: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV due to their increased risk of infection. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effictive HIV-prevention strategy for MSM. Despite evidence of its effectiveness, PrEP uptake in the United States has been slow, in part due to its cost. As jurisdictions and health organizations begin to think about PrEP scale-up, the high cost to society needs to be understood. METHODS: We modified a previously-described decision-analysis model to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, over a 1-year duration of PrEP intervention and lifetime time horizon. Using updated parameter estimates, we calculated: 1) the cost per QALY gained, stratified over 4 strata of PrEP cost (a function of both drug cost and provider costs); and 2) PrEP drug cost per year required to fall at or under 4 cost per QALY gained thresholds. RESULTS: When PrEP drug costs were reduced by 60% (with no sexual disinhibition) to 80% (assuming 25% sexual disinhibition), PrEP was cost-effective (at <$100,000 per QALY averted) in all scenarios of base-case or better adherence, as long as the background HIV prevalence was greater than 10%. For PrEP to be cost saving at base-case adherence/efficacy levels and at a background prevalence of 20%, drug cost would need to be reduced to $8,021 per year with no disinhibition, and to $2,548 with disinhibition. CONCLUSION: Results from our analysis suggest that PrEP drug costs need to be reduced in order to be cost-effective across a range of background HIV prevalence. Moreover, our results provide guidance on the pricing of generic emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in order to provide those at high risk for HIV an affordable prevention option without financial burden on individuals or jurisdictions scaling-up coverage.",2017-01-25429,28570572,PLoS One,Jennie McKenney,2017,12 / 6,e0178170,No,28570572,"Jennie McKenney; Anders Chen; Karen W Hoover; Jane Kelly; David Dowdy; Parastu Sharifi; Patrick S Sullivan; Eli S Rosenberg; Optimal costs of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis for men who have sex with men, PLoS One , 2017; 12(6):1932-6203; e0178170",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) vs. Standard/Usual Care- No Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP),Men who have sex with men,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,0.00,0.00,64000,United States,2015,69884.88
18477,Pipeline embolization device versus coiling for the treatment of large and giant unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE Rupture of large or giant intracranial aneurysms leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Both coiling and the Pipeline embolization device (PED) have been shown to be safe and clinically effective for the treatment of unruptured large and giant intracranial aneurysms; however, the relative cost-to-outcome ratio is unknown. The authors present the first cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the economic impact of the PED compared with coiling or no treatment for the endovascular management of large or giant intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A Markov model was constructed to simulate a 60-year-old woman with a large or giant intracranial aneurysm considering a PED, endovascular coiling, or no treatment in terms of neurological outcome, angiographic outcome, retreatment rates, procedural and rehabilitation costs, and rupture rates. Transition probabilities were derived from prior literature reporting outcomes and costs of PED, coiling, and no treatment for the management of aneurysms. Cost-effectiveness was defined, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) defined as difference in costs divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The ICERs < $50,000/QALY gained were considered cost-effective. To study parameter uncertainty, 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS The base-case model demonstrated lifetime QALYs of 12.72 for patients in the PED cohort, 12.89 for the endovascular coiling cohort, and 9.7 for patients in the no-treatment cohort. Lifetime rehabilitation and treatment costs were $59,837.52 for PED; $79,025.42 for endovascular coiling; and $193,531.29 in the no-treatment cohort. Patients who did not undergo elective treatment were subject to increased rates of aneurysm rupture and high treatment and rehabilitation costs. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to assumptions about the costs and mortality risks for PED and coiling. Probabilistic sampling demonstrated that PED was the cost-effective strategy in 58.4% of iterations, coiling was the cost-effective strategy in 41.4% of iterations, and the no-treatment option was the cost-effective strategy in only 0.2% of iterations.

However, there are widespread differences in the implementation of programmes and choice of strategy. The primary objective of this study was to estimate lifelong costs and health outcomes of two of the currently most preferred methods of screening for colorectal cancer: colonoscopy and sensitive faecal immunochemical test (FIT). METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening in a Swedish population was performed using a decision analysis model, based on the design of the Screening of Swedish Colons (SCREESCO) study, and data from the published literature and registries.

18488,Estimating outcomes and cost effectiveness using a single-arm clinical trial: ofatumumab for double-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"BACKGROUND: Ofatumumab (Arzerra(R), Novartis) is a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab [double refractory (DR-CLL)]. Ofatumumab was licensed on the basis of an uncontrolled Phase II study, Hx-CD20-406, in which patients receiving ofatumumab survived for a median of 13.9 months. However, the lack of an internal control arm presents an obstacle for the estimation of comparative effectiveness. METHODS: The objective of the study was to present a method to estimate the cost effectiveness of ofatumumab in the treatment of DR-CLL. As no suitable historical control was available for modelling, the outcomes from non-responders to ofatumumab were used to model the effect of best supportive care (BSC). This was done via a Cox regression to control for differences in baseline characteristics between groups. This analysis was included in a partitioned survival model built in Microsoft(R) Excel with utilities and costs taken from published sources, with costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at a rate of 3.5% per annum. RESULTS: Using the outcomes seen in non-responders, ofatumumab is expected to add approximately 0.62 life years (1.50 vs. 0.88). Using published utility values this translates to an additional 0.30 QALYs (0.77 vs. 0.47). At the list price, ofatumumab had a cost per QALY of pound130,563, and a cost per life year of pound63,542. The model was sensitive to changes in assumptions regarding overall survival estimates and utility values. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of using data for non-responders to model outcomes for BSC in cost-effectiveness evaluations based on single-arm trials.

18489,Induction therapy with rabbit antithymocyte globulin versus basiliximab after kidney transplantation: a health economic analysis from a German perspective,"A health economic analysis was undertaken based on the 1-year database from a randomized study of rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG) versus basiliximab, in kidney transplantation using resource utilization data and cost estimates from three German hospitals. A three-state Markov model was applied to estimate cost-effectiveness to 10 years post-transplant. Total mean treatment cost per patient to year 1 post-transplant was euro62 075 vs. euro59 767 for rATG versus basiliximab (P < 0.01). rATG therapy was associated with similar treatment costs to basiliximab by year 2, and a predicted cumulative treatment cost saving of euro4 259 under rATG versus basiliximab by year 10 post-transplant. The mean number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient by year 1 was 0.809 vs. 0.802 in the rATG and basiliximab cohorts, respectively (P = 0.38), with cumulative QALYs of 6.161 and 6.065 per patient by year 10. By year 2, the cumulative cost per QALY was slightly lower under rATG (euro35 378) than basiliximab (euro35 885), progressing to a saving of euro1 041 under rATG for the cumulative cost per QALY by year 10. In conclusion, this model indicates that rATG induction provides a modest increase in QALYs with lower long-term costs than basiliximab in deceased-donor high-risk kidney transplant patients.",2017-01-25448,28556488,Transpl Int,Liana Cremaschi,2017,30 / 10,1011-1019,No,28556488,"Liana Cremaschi; Regina von Versen; Thomas Benzing; Michael Wiesener; Nikolai Zink; Gary Milkovich; Thomas Paivanas; Meghan Gallagher; Friedrich Thaiss; Induction therapy with rabbit antithymocyte globulin versus basiliximab after kidney transplantation: a health economic analysis from a German perspective, Transpl Int, 2017 Oct; 30(10):0934-0874; 1011-1019",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rabbit antithymocyte globulin vs. Basiliximab,Received a kidney graft from a deceased donor,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,-44364.58,Euro,2014,-64490.98
18490,Therapeutic Use of Filgrastim for Established Febrile Neutropenia Is Cost Effective Among Patients With Solid Tumors and Lymphomas,"PURPOSE: With the emergence of biosimilar filgrastim to the market, there is a gradual decrease in the listed price of the originator product of filgrastim over the years, and this could have an impact on the cost-effectiveness of filgrastim in the treatment of febrile neutropenia (FN). A cost-effectiveness analysis would allow clinicians to make informed decision when considering the therapeutic filgrastim among low-risk FN patients. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding therapeutic filgrastim to antibiotics in the treatment of established FN among patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. METHODS: A decision tree model was created to compare two treatment options for established FN as follows: (1) antibiotics alone (standard care) and (2) antibiotics with therapeutic filgrastim (comparator). The target population was a hypothetical cohort of adult cancer patients with solid tumors or lymphomas hospitalized with FN in Singapore. The analysis was performed from a hospital''s perspective over a 21-day time horizon. The main outcome measures included costs, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. FINDINGS: Compared with antibiotics alone, the treatment strategy of antibiotics with therapeutic filgrastim was a dominant choice, incurring a cost saving of US$125 per patient (comparator versus standard care: US$9110 versus US$9235) and additional health benefit of 0.0007 QALY gained per patient (comparator versus standard care: 0.0450 versus 0.0443). Model results were robust against the parameter variations in the one-way sensitivity analyses, but increasing the cost of filgrastim beyond US$87 per injection would increase the ICER to >US$50,000/QALY. Furthermore, the strategy of antibiotics with therapeutic filgrastim was the preferred choice (dominant or cost-effective) in 83.7% of the model iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$50,000/QALY. IMPLICATIONS: From a hospital''s perspective, the therapeutic filgrastim, in conjunction with antibiotics, in the treatment of FN is cost effective. This provides evidence to support the routine use of filgrastim for the treatment of FN among adult cancer patients with solid tumors and lymphomas.",2017-01-25450,28554533,Clin Ther,Xiao Jun Wang,2017,39 / 6,1161-1170,Yes,28554533,"Xiao Jun Wang; Wei Xiang Tong; Alexandre Chan; Therapeutic Use of Filgrastim for Established Febrile Neutropenia Is Cost Effective Among Patients With Solid Tumors and Lymphomas, Clin Ther, 2017 Jun; 39(6):1879-114X; 1161-1170",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Antibiotics with therapeutic filgrastim vs. Standard/Usual Care- Antibiotic treatment alone,Adult cancer patients hospitalized with solid tumors or lymphomas,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-178571.43,United States,2014,-195222.74
18491,Triple Therapy Versus Biologic Therapy for Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: The RACAT (Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies) trial found triple therapy to be noninferior to etanercept-methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of etanercept-methotrexate versus triple therapy as a first-line strategy. Design: A within-trial analysis based on the 353 participants in the RACAT trial and a lifetime analysis that extrapolated costs and outcomes by using a decision analytic cohort model. Data Sources: The RACAT trial and sources from the literature. Target Population: Patients with active RA despite at least 12 weeks of methotrexate therapy. Time Horizon: 24 weeks and lifetime. Perspective: Societal and Medicare. Intervention: Etanercept-methotrexate first versus triple therapy first. Outcome Measures: Incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results of Base-Case Analysis: The within-trial analysis found that etanercept-methotrexate as first-line therapy provided marginally more QALYs but accumulated substantially higher drug costs. Differences in other costs between strategies were negligible. The ICERs for first-line etanercept-methotrexate and triple therapy were $2.7 million per QALY and $0.98 million per QALY over 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. The lifetime analysis suggested that first-line etanercept-methotrexate would result in 0.15 additional lifetime QALY, but this gain would cost an incremental $77 290, leading to an ICER of $521 520 per QALY per patient. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Considering a long-term perspective, an initial strategy of etanercept-methotrexate and biologics with similar cost and efficacy is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with using triple therapy first, even under optimistic assumptions. Limitation: Data on the long-term benefit of triple therapy are uncertain. Conclusion: Initiating biologic therapy without trying triple therapy first increases costs while providing minimal incremental benefit.

18492,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Stereotactic Radiosurgery Alone Versus Stereotactic Radiosurgery with Upfront Whole Brain Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases,"AIMS: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone or upfront whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) plus SRS are the most commonly used treatment options for one to three brain oligometastases. The most recent randomised clinical trial result comparing SRS alone with upfront WBRT plus SRS (NCCTG N0574) has favoured SRS alone for neurocognitive function, whereas treatment options remain controversial in terms of cognitive decline and local control. The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of these two competing treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed for patients treated with SRS alone or SRS plus upfront WBRT based on largely randomised clinical trials. Costs were based on 2016 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. Strategies were evaluated from the healthcare payer''s perspective with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the median survival was 9 months for both arms. SRS alone resulted in an ICER of $9917 per QALY gained. In one-way sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to variation in cognitive decline rates for both groups and median survival rates, but the SRS alone remained cost-effective for most parameter ranges.

18493,Cost-effectiveness of combined serum anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG antibody and serum pepsinogen concentrations for screening for gastric cancer risk in Japan,"BACKGROUND: A combination of assays for the presence of serum anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG antibody (HPA) and serum pepsinogen (PG) concentrations can be used to screen for gastric cancer risk. In Japan, this ""ABC method"" is considered an effective means of stratifying gastric cancer risk. This study aimed to ascertain its cost-effectiveness for assessing gastric cancer risk. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of two strategies for gastric cancer-risk screening over a 30-year period: the ABC method, which uses a combination of assessing the presence of HPA and measuring serum PG concentrations and scheduling endoscopies accordingly, and annual endoscopic screening. Clinical and epidemiological data on variables in the model were obtained from published reports. Analyses were made from the perspective of the Japanese health care payer. RESULTS: According to base-case analysis, the ABC method cost less than annual endoscopic screening (64,489 vs. 64,074 USD) and saved more lives (18.16 vs. 18.30 quality-adjusted life years). One-way analyses confirmed the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. The probability that the ABC method is cost-effective in Japanese individuals aged 50 years was 0.997.

18494,Economic evaluation of policy options for dialysis in end-stage renal disease patients under the universal health coverage in Indonesia,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the value for money and budget impact of offering hemodialysis (HD) as a first-line treatment, or the HD-first policy, and the peritoneal dialysis (PD) first policy compared to a supportive care option in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Indonesia. METHODS: A Markov model-based economic evaluation was performed using local and international data to quantify the potential costs and health-related outcomes in terms of life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Three policy options were compared, i.e., the PD-first policy, HD-first policy, and supportive care. RESULTS: The PD-first policy for ESRD patients resulted in 5.93 life years, equal to the HD-first policy, with a slightly higher QALY gained (4.40 vs 4.34). The total lifetime cost for a patient under the PD-first policy is around 700 million IDR, which is lower than the cost under the HD-first policy, i.e. 735 million IDR per patient. Compared to supportive care, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the PD-first policy is 193 million IDR per QALY, while the HD-first policy resulted in 207 million IDR per QALY. Budget impact analysis indicated that the required budget for the PD-first policy is 43 trillion IDR for 53% coverage and 75 trillion IDR for 100% coverage in five years, which is less than the HD-first policy, i.e. 88 trillion IDR and 166 trillion IDR.

18496,Cost-Effectiveness of Tight Control of Inflammation in Early Psoriatic Arthritis: Economic Analysis of a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE: Treat-to-target approaches have proved to be effective in rheumatoid arthritis, but have not been studied in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This study was undertaken to examine the cost effectiveness of tight control (TC) of inflammation in early psoriatic arthritis compared to standard care (SC). METHODS: Cost effectiveness analyses were undertaken alongside a UK-based, open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Taking the perspective of the healthcare sector, effectiveness was measured using EQ-5D-3L which allows the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are presented which represent the additional cost per QALY gained over a 48-week time horizon. Sensitivity analyses are presented assessing the impact of variations in the analytical approach and assumptions on the cost-effectiveness estimates. RESULTS: Mean cost and QALYs were higher in the TC group; pound4198 vs. pound2000 and 0.602 vs. 0.561. These values yielded an ICER of pound53948 per QALY. Bootstrapped uncertainty analysis suggest the TC has a 0.07 probability of being cost effective at a pound20,000 threshold. Stratified analysis suggest that with certain costs being controlled, an ICER of pound24639 can be calculated for patients with a higher degree of disease severity. CONCLUSION: A tight control strategy to treat PsA is an effective intervention in the treatment pathway, however this study does not find tight control to be cost-effective in most analyses. Reduced drug prices, targeting polyarthritis patients or reducing rheumatology visit frequencies may improve value for money metrics in future studies. This article is protected by copyright.

18497,Cost-effectiveness of a school-based health promotion program in Canada: A life-course modeling approach,"BACKGROUND: The Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in Schools (APPLE Schools) has been recognized as a ""best practice"" in preventing childhood obesity. To inform decision making on the economic implications of APPLE Schools and to justify investment, we evaluated the project''s cost-effectiveness following a life-course approach. METHODS: We developed a state transition model for the lifetime progression of body weight status comparing elementary school students attending APPLE Schools and control schools. This model quantified the lifetime impact of APPLE Schools in terms of prevention of excess body weight, chronic disease and improved quality-adjusted life years (QALY), from a school system''s cost perspective. Both costs and health outcomes were discounted to their present value using 3% discount rate. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) of APPLE schools was CA$33,421 per QALY gained, and CA$1,555, CA$1,709 and CA$14,218 per prevented person years of excess weight, obesity and chronic disease, respectively. These estimates show that APPLE Schools is cost effective at a threshold of ICER < CA$50,000. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, APPLE Schools was cost effective more than 64% of the time per QALY gained, when using a threshold of ICER<CA$50,000, and more than 93% of the time when using a threshold of ICER<CA$100,000. CONCLUSION: School-based health promotion, such as APPLE Schools is a cost-effective intervention for obesity prevention and reduction of chronic disease risk over the lifetime. Expanding the coverage and allocating resources towards school-based programs like the APPLE Schools program, is likely to reduce the public health burden of obesity and chronic diseases.",2017-01-25481,28542399,PLoS One,John Paul Ekwaru,2017,12 / 5,e0177848,No,28542399,"John Paul Ekwaru; Arto Ohinmaa; Bach Xuan Tran; Solmaz Setayeshgar; Jeffrey A Johnson; Paul J Veugelers; Cost-effectiveness of a school-based health promotion program in Canada: A life-course modeling approach, PLoS One , 2017; 12(5):1932-6203; e0177848",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,APPLE School vs. Standard/Usual Care,"School-age children, with a focus on grade 5 (age 10)",10 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,33421,Canada,2008,37931.28
18498,Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention portfolios for people who inject drugs in the United States: A model-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: The risks of HIV transmission associated with the opioid epidemic make cost-effective programs for people who inject drugs (PWID) a public health priority. Some of these programs have benefits beyond prevention of HIV-a critical consideration given that injection drug use is increasing across most United States demographic groups. To identify high-value HIV prevention program portfolios for US PWID, we consider combinations of four interventions with demonstrated efficacy: opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe programs (NSPs), HIV testing and treatment (Test & Treat), and oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We adapted an empirically calibrated dynamic compartmental model and used it to assess the discounted costs (in 2015 US dollars), health outcomes (HIV infections averted, change in HIV prevalence, and discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the four prevention programs, considered singly and in combination over a 20-y time horizon. We obtained epidemiologic, economic, and health utility parameter estimates from the literature, previously published models, and expert opinion. We estimate that expansions of OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat implemented singly up to 50% coverage levels can be cost-effective relative to the next highest coverage level (low, medium, and high at 40%, 45%, and 50%, respectively) and that OAT, which we assume to have immediate and direct health benefits for the individual, has the potential to be the highest value investment, even under scenarios where it prevents fewer infections than other programs. Although a model-based analysis can provide only estimates of health outcomes, we project that, over 20 y, 50% coverage with OAT could avert up to 22,000 (95% CI: 5,200, 46,000) infections and cost US$18,000 (95% CI: US$14,000, US$24,000) per QALY gained, 50% NSP coverage could avert up to 35,000 (95% CI: 8,900, 43,000) infections and cost US$25,000 (95% CI: US$7,000, US$76,000) per QALY gained, 50% Test & Treat coverage could avert up to 6,700 (95% CI: 1,200, 16,000) infections and cost US$27,000 (95% CI: US$15,000, US$48,000) per QALY gained, and 50% PrEP coverage could avert up to 37,000 (22,000, 58,000) infections and cost US$300,000 (95% CI: US$162,000, US$667,000) per QALY gained. When coverage expansions are allowed to include combined investment with other programs and are compared to the next best intervention, the model projects that scaling OAT coverage up to 50%, then scaling NSP coverage to 50%, then scaling Test & Treat coverage to 50% can be cost-effective, with each coverage expansion having the potential to cost less than US$50,000 per QALY gained relative to the next best portfolio. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 59% of portfolios prioritized the addition of OAT and 41% prioritized the addition of NSPs, while PrEP was not likely to be a priority nor a cost-effective addition. Our findings are intended to be illustrative, as data on achievable coverage are limited and, in practice, the expansion scenarios considered may exceed feasible levels. We assumed independence of interventions and constant returns to scale. Extensive sensitivity analyses allowed us to assess parameter sensitivity, but the use of a dynamic compartmental model limited the exploration of structural sensitivities. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat, implemented singly or in combination, have the potential to effectively and cost-effectively prevent HIV in US PWID. PrEP is not likely to be cost-effective in this population, based on the scenarios we evaluated.
