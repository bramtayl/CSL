33913,Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions to Prevent Plague in Madagascar.,"Plague (Yersinia pestis) remains endemic in certain parts of the world. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of plague control interventions recommended by the World Health Organization with particular consideration to intervention coverage and timing. We developed a dynamic model of the spread of plague between interacting populations of humans, rats, and fleas and performed a cost-effectiveness analysis calibrated to a 2017 Madagascar outbreak. We assessed three interventions alone and in combination: expanded access to antibiotic treatment with doxycycline, mass distribution of doxycycline prophylaxis, and mass distribution of malathion. We varied intervention timing and coverage levels. We calculated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from a healthcare perspective. The preferred intervention, using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $1350/QALY (GDP per capita in Madagascar), was expanded access to antibiotic treatment with doxycycline with 100% coverage starting immediately after the first reported case, gaining 543 QALYs at an incremental cost of $1023/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses support expanded access to antibiotic treatment and leave open the possibility that mass distribution of doxycycline prophylaxis or mass distribution of malathion could be cost-effective. Our analysis highlights the potential for rapid expansion of access to doxycycline upon recognition of plague outbreaks to cost-effectively prevent future large-scale plague outbreaks and highlights the importance of intervention timing.",2021-01-42107,34208006,Trop Med Infect Dis,Giovanni Malloy,2021,6 / 2,,No,34208006,"Giovanni Malloy; Margaret Brandeau; Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert; Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions to Prevent Plague in Madagascar., Trop Med Infect Dis, 2021 Jun 11; 6(2):",QALY,Madagascar,Certain zoonotic bacterial diseases,Pharmaceutical,doxycycline treatment (10 % expanded coverage) vs. next best alternative,Not Stated,Not Stated,0 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"5 Months, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,236,United States,2017,260.89

33946,Cost-Utility Analysis of Antibiotic Therapy versus Appendicectomy for Acute Uncomplicated Appendicitis.,"BACKGROUND: Current UK National Health Service (NHS) guidelines recommend appendicectomy as gold standard treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis. However, an alternative non-surgical management involves administrating antibiotic-only therapy with significantly lower costs. Therefore, a UK-based cost-utility analysis (CUA) was performed to compare appendicectomy with an antibiotic-only treatment from an NHS perspective. METHODS: This economic evaluation modelled health-outcome data using the ACTUAA (2021) prospective multicentre trial. The non-randomised control trial followed 318 patients given either antibiotic therapy or appendicectomy, with quality of life (QOL) assessed using the SF-12 questionnaires administered 1-year post-treatment. A CUA was conducted over a 1-year time horizon, measuring benefits in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in pound sterling using a propensity score-matched approach to control for selection based on observable factors. RESULTS: The CUA produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of -GBP 23,278.51 (-EUR 27,227.80) per QALY. Therefore, for each QALY gained using antibiotic-only treatment instead of appendicectomy, an extra GBP 23,278.51 was saved. Additionally, two sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for post-operative or post-treatment complications. The antibiotic-only option remained dominant in both scenarios. CONCLUSION: While the results do not rely on a randomized sample, the analysis based on a 1-year follow-up suggested that antibiotics were largely more cost-effective than appendicectomy and led to improved QOL outcomes for patients. The ICER value of -GBP 23,278.51 demonstrates that the NHS must give further consideration to the current gold standard treatment in acute uncomplicated appendicitis.",2021-01-41734,34444222,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Ayesha Ali,2021,18 / 16,,No,34444222,"Ayesha Ali; Zina Mobarak; Mariam Al-Jumaily; Mehreen Anwar; Zaeem Moti; Nadia Zaman; Akbari, Amir Reza; Laure de Preux; Cost-Utility Analysis of Antibiotic Therapy versus Appendicectomy for Acute Uncomplicated Appendicitis., Int J Environ Res Public Health, 2021 Aug 11; 18(16):",QALY,Italy,Diseases of appendix,Pharmaceutical,antibiotic therapy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis vs. appendicectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis,Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"1 Year, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,-23278.51,United Kingdom,2021,-32039.98
33947,Modeling the cost-effectiveness of prolonged-release fampridine for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis in Sweden.,"Aims: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding prolonged-release (PR)-fampridine to best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone for the improvement of walking ability in patients with MS. Methods: A cost-utility analysis based on a Markov model was developed to model responders and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) scores, accumulated costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) in adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 4 and 7. The analysis was conducted from a Swedish societal perspective. Results: In the base-case analysis, PR-fampridine plus BSC led to a higher QALY gain than BSC alone. The largest direct cost was professional care provision followed by hospital inpatient stays while the indirect cost was the loss of earnings due to days off work. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PR-fampridine plus BSC compared with BSC alone was 57,109 Swedish Kronor (kr)/QALY (€5,607/QALY [1 kr = €0.0981762 on 8 April 2021] and $6,675/QALY [1 kr = $0.116890 on 8 April 2021]). All sensitivity analyses performed resulted in ICERs below 500,000 kr (€49,088 and $58,445).Limitations: Resource use data were not specific to the Swedish market.

Pharmacies can serve as a significant channel to reach these people. This study aimed to assess the potential health economic impact of screening and recruitment services in pharmacies in referring people to preventive interventions. METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to perform a cost-utility analysis of the expected national health economic consequences (in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) of a hypothetical pharmacy-based service where people screened and recruited through pharmacies would participate in a digital lifestyle program. Cost-effectiveness was considered in terms of net monetary benefit (NMB). In addition, social return on investment (SROI) was calculated as the ratio of the intervention and recruitment costs and the net present value of expected savings. Payback time was the time taken to reach the break-even point in savings. In the base scenario, a 20-year time horizon was applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were applied to study robustness of the results. RESULTS: In the base scenario, the expected savings from the pharmacy-based screening and recruitment among the reached target cohort were 255.3 m€ (95% CI - 185.2 m€ to 717.2 m€) in pharmacy visiting population meaning 1412€ (95% CI - 1024€ to 3967€) expected savings per person. Additionally, 7032 QALYs (95% CI - 1344 to 16,143) were gained on the population level. The intervention had an NMB of 3358€ (95% CI - 1397€ to 8431€) using a cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 €/QALY. The initial costs were 122.2 m€ with an SROI of 2.09€ (95% CI - 1.52€ to 5.88€). The expected payback time was 10 and 8 years for women and men, respectively. Results were most sensitive for changes in effectiveness of the intervention and selected discount rate.

33954,"Economic evaluation of varicella vaccination strategies in Jiangsu province, China: a decision-tree Markov model.","This study evaluated different varicella vaccination strategies in Jiangsu province, China. A decision-tree Markov model was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of various varicella vaccination strategies for children, including direct and selective vaccination (serotesting pre-vaccination). A cohort of one-year-old children was followed through 60 one-year Markov cycles. The parameter estimation was based on field work, the literature, and statistical yearbooks.

Clinical outcomes on toxicity and disease recurrence were measured and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed, varying input parameters simultaneously according to their distributions. RESULTS: Among the six radiation treatment modalities, including conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), hypofractionated IMRT, IMRT combined with high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, HDR brachytherapy monotherapy, low-dose-rate brachytherapy monotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), SBRT was found to be more cost-effective when compared with LDR-b and other treatment modalities, resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio of $2985 per QALY.

33967,Cost-Utility Analysis of Radiation Treatment Modalities for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Variable costs of different radiation treatment modalities have played an important factor in selecting the most appropriate treatment for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. METHODS: Analysis using a Markov model was conducted to simulate 20-year disease trajectory, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health system costs of a cohort of intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients with mean age of 60 years. Clinical outcomes on toxicity and disease recurrence were measured and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed, varying input parameters simultaneously according to their distributions.

33971,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Trastuzumab Emtansine as Second-line Therapy for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer in China,"Background and objective: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is the standard second-line option for the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer for its superior clinical efficacy in prolonging progression-free survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of T-DM1 from the Chinese healthcare perspective. Capecitabine (Cap), capecitabine + lapatinib (Cap + Lap), capecitabine + trastuzumab (Cap + Tra), capecitabine + trastuzumab + pertuzumab (Cap + Tra + Per) were selected as comparators. Methods: A three-state Markov simulation model was performed. The state transition probabilities were estimated based on the results of a published network meta-analysis, and utilities were derived from the published literature. The costs populated in the model were acquired from the local charge or previously published studies. One-way sensitive analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results: Compared with Cap, Cap + Lap, Cap + Tra, and Cap + Tra + Per, T-DM1 was estimated to increase the cost by US$109,699.1, $106,019.1, $97,506.3, and $67,121.9, respectively, and yield a gain of 0.544 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 0.383 QALYs, 0.367 QALYs, 0.087 QALYs, respectively.

33975,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from Singapore's private insurance payer's perspective.,"BACKGROUND: Patients experiencing relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) have limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Tisagenlecleucel (TIS) has shown improved clinical outcomes, but at a high upfront cost. Singapore has a multi-payer healthcare system where private insurance is one of the major payers. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of TIS against salvage chemotherapy regimen (SCR) for treating r/r DLBCL patients who have failed ≥2 lines of systemic therapy from Singapore's private insurance payer's perspective. METHODS: Over a life-time horizon, a partitioned survival model with three health-states was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of TIS vs. SCR with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Efficacy inputs for TIS and SCR were based on 43 months of observation data from pooled JULIET and UPenn trials, and CORAL extension studies respectively. Direct costs for pre-treatment, treatment, adverse events, follow-up, subsequent-HSCT, relapse, and terminal care were included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the total incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Additionally, the financial implication of introducing TIS in Singapore from a private payer's perspective was analyzed, comparing the current treatment pathway (without TIS) with a future scenario (with TIS) over 5 years. RESULTS: Compared with SCR, TIS was the dominant option, with cost savings of S$8,477 alongside an additional gain of 2.78 QALYs in privately insured patients who shifted from private to public hospitals for TIS treatment. Scenario analyses for patients starting in public hospitals show ICERs of S$99,623 (no subsidy) and S$133,261 (50% subsidy for SCR treatment, no subsidy for TIS), supporting the base case. The projected annual budget impact ranges from S$850,000 to S$3.4 million during the first 5 years.

33982,Cost-effectiveness of total state coverage for hepatitis C medications.,"OBJECTIVES: Most Medicaid beneficiaries with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are not treated with direct-acting agents because of budget constraints, but they experience costly complications after becoming Medicare eligible. Maryland's ""total coverage"" proposal could receive a credit from Medicare to offset Medicaid investments in treatments that could lead to Medicare savings. This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of total coverage for HCV treatments sponsored by state Medicare and Medicaid. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model simulated patients going through the care continuum of HCV. The model simulated 3 pathways: standard coverage with a 50% probability of screening for HCV and 20% probability of treatment; risk-stratified total coverage with assumed 80% probability of screening and 60% treatment rate; and total coverage with assumed 80% probability of screening and 100% treatment rate. METHODS: The model calculated US$ and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio evaluated at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. The budget impact for the state of Maryland was calculated in terms of per member per year.

33984,Clinical and economic impact of an alert system in primary care for the detection of patients with chronic hepatitis C.,"INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is higher in patients born between 1955-1975. The aim was to perform an economic evaluation of an age-based electronic health record (EHR) alert in primary care to detect patients with undiagnosed CHC and its treatment in comparison with non-use of the alert system, in Valencian Community, Spain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision trees and Markov model were used to evaluate the diagnosis and progression of the disease, respectively. CHC was diagnosed by serology and viral load in seropositive subjects. Epidemiological data and diagnostic costs were extracted from public sources of the Valencian Community. Probabilities, utilities and costs of model states were obtained from the literature. The impact on mortality and hepatic complications avoided by the implementation of the alert were estimated, and efficiency was measured as an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the costs of both alternatives. RESULTS: The EHR alert detected 269,548 patients, of whom 1,331 had CHC (vs. 23 patients with non-alert). Over the patients' lifetime, the alert would prevent 93% of decompensated cirrhosis cases, 87% of hepatocellular carcinomas, 90% of liver transplants, and 89% of liver related deaths compared to non-use of the alert system. In addition, it would obtain an additional 3.3 QALY per patient, with an incremental cost of €10,880 and an ICUR of €3,321. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of an age-based EHR alert in primary care to detect patients with CHC reduces hepatic complications and mortality and is an efficient strategy.",2021-01-41711,34928962,PLoS One,Antonio García-Herola,2021,16 / 12,e0260608,No,34928962,"Antonio García-Herola; Raquel Dominguez-Hernandez; Casado, Miguel Ángel; Clinical and economic impact of an alert system in primary care for the detection of patients with chronic hepatitis C., PLoS One, 2021; 16(12):; e0260608",QALY,Spain,Viral hepatitis,Screening,age-based electronic health record alert vs. no electronic health record alert,born between 1955–1975,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,3321,Euro,2018,4234.84
33985,The cost-effectiveness of adding tomosynthesis to mammography-based breast cancer screening: an economic analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies show that digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) combined with digital mammography (DM) can reduce recall rates and increases rates of breast cancer detection. The objective of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of DBT plus DM versus DM alone in British Columbia and to identify parameters that can improve the efficiency of breast cancer screening programs. METHODS: We conducted an economic analysis based on data from a cohort of screening participants in the BC Cancer Breast Screening Program. The decision model simulated lifetime costs and outcomes for participants in breast cancer screening who were aged 40-74 years between 2012 and 2017. We analyzed rates of health care resource utilization, health state costs and estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), to measure incremental cost differences per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from the addition of DBT to DM-based screening, from the government payer's perspective. RESULTS: The model simulated economic outcomes for 112 249 screening participants. We found that the ICER was highly sensitive to recall rate reductions and insensitive to parameters related to cancer detection. If DBT plus DM can reduce absolute recall rates by more than 2.1%, the base-case scenario had an ICER of $17 149 per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY, more than 95% of the probabilistic simulations favoured the adoption of DBT plus DM versus DM alone. The ICER depended heavily on the ability of DBT plus DM to reduce recall rates. INTERPRETATION: The addition of DBT to DM would be considered cost-effective owing to the low positive predictive value of screening with DM alone. Reductions in false-positive recall rates should be monitored closely.",2021-01-41710,33888549,CMAJ Open,Sonya Cressman,2021,9 / 2,E443-E450,No,33888549,"Sonya Cressman; Colin Mar; Janette Sam; Lisa Kan; Caroline Lohrisch; John Spinelli; The cost-effectiveness of adding tomosynthesis to mammography-based breast cancer screening: an economic analysis., CMAJ Open, 2021 Apr-Jun; 9(2):; E443-E450",QALY,Canada,"Malignant neoplasms, breast and female genital organs","Medical Procedure, Screening",digital breast tomosynthesis + digital mammography vs. digital mammography,Not Stated,74 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,"40 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,17149,Canada,2019,13697.52
33986,Cost-effectiveness analyses of augmented cognitive behavioral therapy for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression at secondary mental health care settings.,"AIM: Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment strategy in major depression. However, two-thirds of patients remain depressed after the initial antidepressant treatment. Augmented cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression in primary mental health care settings proved effective and cost-effective. Although we reported the clinical effectiveness of augmented CBT in secondary mental health care, its cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of augmented CBT adjunctive to treatment as usual (TAU) and TAU alone for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression at secondary mental health care settings. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis at 64 weeks, alongside a randomized controlled trial involving 80 patients who sought depression treatment at a university hospital and psychiatric hospital (one each). The cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) that compared the difference in costs and quality-adjusted life years, and other clinical scales, between the groups. RESULTS: The ICERs were JPY -15 278 322 and 2 026 865 for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression for all samples and those with moderate/severe symptoms at baseline, respectively. The acceptability curve demonstrates a 0.221 and 0.701 probability of the augmented CBT being cost-effective for all samples and moderate/severe depression, respectively, at the threshold of JPY 4.57 million (GBP 30 000).

33987,Cost-effectiveness analyses of augmented cognitive behavioral therapy for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression at secondary mental health care settings.,"AIM: Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment strategy in major depression. However, two-thirds of patients remain depressed after the initial antidepressant treatment. Augmented cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression in primary mental health care settings proved effective and cost-effective. Although we reported the clinical effectiveness of augmented CBT in secondary mental health care, its cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of augmented CBT adjunctive to treatment as usual (TAU) and TAU alone for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression at secondary mental health care settings. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis at 64 weeks, alongside a randomized controlled trial involving 80 patients who sought depression treatment at a university hospital and psychiatric hospital (one each). The cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) that compared the difference in costs and quality-adjusted life years, and other clinical scales, between the groups. RESULTS: The ICERs were JPY -15 278 322 and 2 026 865 for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression for all samples and those with moderate/severe symptoms at baseline, respectively. The acceptability curve demonstrates a 0.221 and 0.701 probability of the augmented CBT being cost-effective for all samples and moderate/severe depression, respectively, at the threshold of JPY 4.57 million (GBP 30 000). The sensitivity analysis supported the robustness of our results restricting for moderate/severe depression. CONCLUSION: Augmented CBT for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression is not cost-effective for all samples including mild depression.

33988,Cost-Utility of Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Heart Failure: An Economic Evaluation.,"Background Recent trials comparing catheter ablation to medical therapy in patients with heart failure (HF) with symptomatic atrial fibrillation despite first-line management have demonstrated a reduction in adverse outcomes. We performed an economic evaluation to estimate the cost-utility of catheter ablation as second line therapy in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Methods and Results A Markov model with health states of alive, dead, and alive with amiodarone toxicity was constructed, using the perspective of the Canadian healthcare payer. Patients in the alive states were at risk of HF and non-HF hospitalizations. Parameters were obtained from randomized trials and Alberta health system data for costs and outcomes. A lifetime time horizon was adopted, with discounting at 3.0% annually. Probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Costs are reported in 2018 Canadian dollars. A patient treated with catheter ablation experienced lifetime costs of $64 960 and 5.63 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), compared with $49 865 and 5.18 QALYs for medical treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $35 360/QALY (95% CI, $21 518-77 419), with a 90% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY. A minimum mortality reduction of 28%, or a minimum duration of benefit of >1 to 2 years was required for catheter ablation to be attractive at this threshold. Conclusions Catheter ablation is likely to be cost-effective as a second line intervention for patients with HF with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $35 360/QALY, as long as over half of the relative mortality benefit observed in extant trials is borne out in future studies.",2021-01-41706,34238020,J Am Heart Assoc,Darren Lau,2021,10 / 14,e019599,No,34238020,"Darren Lau; Roopinder Sandhu; Jason Andrade; Justin Ezekowitz; Helen So; Scott Klarenbach; Cost-Utility of Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Heart Failure: An Economic Evaluation., J Am Heart Assoc, 2021 Jul 20; 10(14):; e019599",QALY,Canada,"Other forms of heart disease, Other forms of heart disease",Medical Procedure,catheter ablation vs. medical therapy,heart failure with reduced ejection fraction,65 Years,65 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,35360,Canada,2018,29449.6
33989,Cost-Utility of Acromegaly Pharmacological Treatments in a French Context.,"OBJECTIVE: Efficacy of pharmacological treatments for acromegaly has been assessed in many clinical or real-world studies but no study was interested in economics evaluation of these treatments in France. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the cost-utility of second-line pharmacological treatments in acromegaly patients. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to follow a cohort of 1,000 patients for a lifetime horizon. First-generation somatostatin analogues (FGSA), pegvisomant, pasireotide and pegvisomant combined with FGSA (off label) were compared. Efficacy was defined as the normalization of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration and was obtained from pivotal trials and adjusted by a network meta-analysis. Costs data were obtained from French databases and literature. Utilities from the literature were used to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of treatments compared to FGSA were estimated to be 562,463 € per QALY gained for pasireotide, 171,332 € per QALY gained for pegvisomant, and 186,242 € per QALY gained for pegvisomant + FGSA. Pasireotide seems to be the least cost-efficient treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: FGSA, pegvisomant and pegvisomant + FGSA were on the cost-effective frontier, therefore, depending on the willingness-to-pay for an additional QALY, they are the most cost-effective treatments.

33992,Cost-Effective Analysis of Dual-Energy Computed Tomography for the Diagnosis of Occult Hip Fractures Among Older Adults.,"OBJECTIVE: Early and accurate diagnosis of hip fractures minimizes morbidity and mortality. Although current guidelines favor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of occult hip fractures, a new technology called dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) seems an effective alternative. This article investigates a potentially cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of occult hip fractures in older adults in Singapore. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to compare costs from a payer's perspective and outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of different imaging strategies for diagnosing occult hip fracture, comparing MRI with DECT supplementing single-energy computed tomography (SECT) and SECT alone. Model inputs were obtained from local sources where available. Sensitivity analyses are performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The MRI strategy was dominated by the DECT strategy, whereas DECT supplementing SECT provided 0.30 more QALYs at an incremental cost of SGD106.41 with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SGD352.52 per QALY relative to SECT alone. DECT seemed a cost-effective strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of SGD50 000 per QALY.

33995,Is mass screening for coeliac disease a wise use of resources? A health economic evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Living with undiagnosed symptomatic coeliac disease is connected with deteriorated health, and persons with coeliac disease often wait a long time for their diagnosis. A mass screening would lower the delay, but its cost-effectiveness is still unclear. Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a coeliac disease mass screening at 12 years of age, taking a life course perspective on future benefits and drawbacks. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was derived as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using a Markov model. As a basis for our assumptions, we mainly used information from the Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden (ETICS) study, a school-based screening conducted in 2005/2006 and 2009/2010, where 13,279 12-year-old children participated and 240 were diagnosed with coeliac disease, and a study involving members of the Swedish Coeliac Association with 1031 adult participants. RESULTS: The cost for coeliac disease screening was 40,105 Euro per gained QALY. Sensitivity analyses support screening based on high compliance to a gluten-free diet, rapid progression from symptom-free coeliac disease to coeliac disease with symptoms, long delay from celiac disease with symptoms to diagnosis, and a low QALY score for undiagnosed coeliac disease cases. CONCLUSIONS: A coeliac disease mass screening is cost-effective based on the commonly used threshold of 50,000 Euro per gained QALY. However, this is based on many assumptions, especially regarding the natural history of coeliac disease and the effects on long-term health for individuals with coeliac disease still eating gluten.",2021-01-41692,33836647,BMC Gastroenterol,Fredrik Norstrom,2021,21 / 1,159,No,33836647,"Fredrik Norstrom; Anna Myléus; Katrina Nordyke; Annelie Carlsson; Lotta Högberg; Olof Sandstrom; Lars Stenhammar; Anneli Ivarsson; Lars Lindholm; Is mass screening for coeliac disease a wise use of resources?

33996,Cost-Effectiveness of Lipid-Lowering Treatments in Young Adults.,"BACKGROUND: Raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in young adulthood (aged 18-39 years) is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) later in life. Most young adults with elevated LDL-C do not currently receive lipid-lowering treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of elevated LDL-C in ASCVD-free U.S. young adults and the cost-effectiveness of lipid-lowering strategies for raised LDL-C in young adulthood compared with standard care. METHODS: The prevalence of raised LDL-C was examined in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The CVD Policy Model projected lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for lipid-lowering strategies. Standard care was statin treatment for adults aged ≥40 years based on LDL-C, ASCVD risk, or diabetes plus young adults with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL. Lipid lowering incremental to standard care with moderate-intensity statins or intensive lifestyle interventions was simulated starting when young adult LDL-C was either ≥160 mg/dL or ≥130 mg/dL. RESULTS: Approximately 27% of ASCVD-free young adults have LDL-C of ≥130 mg/dL, and 9% have LDL-C of ≥160 mg/dL. The model projected that young adult lipid lowering with statins or lifestyle interventions would prevent lifetime ASCVD events and increase QALYs compared with standard care. ICERs were US$31,000/QALY for statins in young adult men with LDL-C of ≥130 mg/dL and US$106,000/QALY for statins in young adult women with LDL-C of ≥130 mg/dL.

33998,Cost-utility of talazoparib monotherapy treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in Spain.,"Breast cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies. The aim of the article is to analyse the cost-utility ratio and budgetary impact of talazoparib treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic gBRCA + breast cancer from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. Analyses were based on the EMBRACA clinical trial and the model was constructed according to ""partitioned survival analysis"". Two scenarios were considered in order to compare talazoparib with the alternatives of capecitabine, vinorelbine and eribulin: 1. Chemotherapy in patients pre-treated with anthracyclines/taxanes and, 2. A second- and subsequent-line treatment option. Treatment types following relapse were recorded in the mentioned clinical trial. The effectiveness measure used was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The average health cost of patients treated at 43 months with talazoparib was 84,360.86€, whilst current treatment costs were 26,683.90€. The effectiveness of talazoparib was 1.93 years of survival (1.09 QALY) relative to 1.58 years (0.83 QALY) in the treatment group. The incremental cost-utility ratio was 252,420.04€/QALY. This represents the additional cost required to earn an additional QALY when changing from regular treatment to talazoparib. Regarding budgetary impact, the number of patients susceptible to receiving treatment with between 94 and 202 talazoparib was estimated, according to scenario and likelihood. The 3-year cost difference was between 6.9 and 9 million euros. The economic evaluation conducted shows an elevated incremental cost-utility ratio and budgetary impact. Taking these results into account, the price of talazoparib would have to be lower than that taken as a reference to reach the cost-utility thresholds.",2021-01-41689,33895483,Breast,Antonio Olry de Labry Lima,2021,58 /,27-33,No,33895483,"Antonio Olry de Labry Lima; Zuzana Spacirova; Silvia Fénix-Caballero; Hoces, Antonio Matas; Vegas, Adrián Sánchez; Aranzana, Manuel Cárdenas; Sierra-Sánchez, Jesús F; Díaz, María Del Carmen Martínez; Alegre Del Rey, Emilio Jesús; Cost-utility of talazoparib monotherapy treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in Spain., Breast, 2021 Aug; 58():; 27-33",QALY,Spain,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",Pharmaceutical,talazoparib monotherapy vs. standard care,metastatic or advanced breast cancer,Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,"43 Months, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,252420.04,Euro,2019,299678.37
33999,Economic value of vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic: a U.S. cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis.,"AIMS: The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected over two hundred million worldwide and caused 4.4 million of deaths as of August 2021. Vaccines were quickly developed to address the pandemic. We sought to analyze the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of a non-specified vaccine for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov model of COVID-19 infections using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered structure over a 1-year time horizon from a U.S. healthcare sector perspective. The model consisted of two arms: do nothing and COVID-19 vaccine. Hospitalization and mortality rates were calibrated to U.S. COVID-19 reports as of November 2020. We performed economic calculations of costs in 2020 U.S. dollars and effectiveness in units of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to measure the budget impact and incremental cost-effectiveness at a $100,000/QALY threshold. RESULTS: Vaccines have a high probability of reducing healthcare costs and increasing QALYs compared to doing nothing. Simulations showed reductions in hospital days and mortality by more than 50%. Even though this represents a major U.S. investment, the budget impacts of these technologies could save program costs by up to 60% or more if uptake is high. LIMITATIONS: The economic evaluation draws on the reported values of the clinical benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, although we do not currently have long-term conclusive data about COVID-19 vaccine efficacies. CONCLUSIONS: Spending on vaccines to mitigate COVID-19 infections offer high-value potential that society should consider. Unusually high uptake in vaccines in a short amount of time could result in unprecedented budget impacts to government and commercial payers. Governments should focus on expanding health system infrastructure and subsidizing payer coverage to deliver these vaccines efficiently.",2021-01-41693,34357843,J Med Econ,William Padula,2021,24 / 1,1060-1069,No,34357843,"William Padula; Shreena Malaviya; Natalie Reid; Benjamin Cohen; Francine Chingcuanco; Jeromie Ballreich; Jonothan Tierce; Alexander, G Caleb; Economic value of vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic: a U.S. cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis., J Med Econ, 2021 Jan-Dec; 24(1):; 1060-1069",QALY,United States of America,Provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology or emergency use,Immunization,coronavirus immunization vs. no nothing,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"1 Year, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,-800,United States,2020,-837.58
34000,Cost effectiveness of therapist delivered cognitive behavioural therapy and web-based self-management in irritable bowel syndrome: the ACTIB randomised trial.,"BACKGROUND: Telephone therapist delivered CBT (TCBT) and web-based CBT (WCBT) have been shown to be significantly more clinically effective than treatment as usual (TAU) at reducing IBS symptom severity and impact at 12 months in adults with refractory IBS. In this paper we assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. METHODS: Participants were recruited from 74 general practices and three gastroenterology centres in England. Interventions costs were calculated, and other service use and lost employment measured and costed for one-year post randomisation. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were combined with costs to determine cost-effectiveness of TCBT and WCBT compared to TAU. RESULTS: TCBT cost £956 more than TAU (95% CI, £601-£1435) and generated 0.0429 more QALYs. WCBT cost £224 more than TAU (95% CI, - £11 to £448) and produced 0.029 more QALYs. Compared to TAU, TCBT had an incremental cost per QALY of £22,284 while the figure for WCBT was £7724. After multiple imputation these ratios increased to £27,436 and £17,388 respectively. Including lost employment and informal care, TCBT had costs that were on average £866 lower than TAU (95% CI, - £1133 to £2957), and WCBT had costs that were £1028 lower than TAU (95% CI, - £448 to £2580). CONCLUSIONS: TCBT and WCBT resulted in more QALYs and higher costs than TAU. Complete case analysis suggests both therapies are cost-effective from a healthcare perspective. Imputation for missing data reduces cost-effectiveness but WCTB remained cost-effective. If the reduced societal costs are included both interventions are likely to be more cost-effective.
