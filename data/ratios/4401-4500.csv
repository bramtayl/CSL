4401,Cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin compared with regular dose simvastatin,"AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin when compared with generic simvastatin for secondary prevention in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden based on the recently completed IDEAL trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: The IDEAL trial showed that high-dose treatment with atorvastatin was associated with fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions (MI) or coronary heart disease death (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.78-1.01) and major cardiovascular events by (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.98) or any coronary event (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.76-0.91) than simvastatin with no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events. Costs during the trial period was estimated based on the trial data and a Markov model was constructed where the risk of MIs and revascularization procedures and the long-term costs, quality of life, and mortality associated with these events was simulated. Costs were based on resource consumptions recorded in the trial multiplied with recent unit costs from each country. Both direct health care costs and indirect costs (costs from lost production due to work absence) were included. Intervention lasted for the duration of the trial (4.8 years) while health-effects and costs are predicted for the lifespan of the patient. The main outcome was quality adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. High-dose treatment was predicted to lead to a mean increase in survival of 0.049 years per patient and 0.033 QALYs gained. The cost to gain one QALY was predicted to 47,197euro (Denmark), 62,639euro (Finland), 35,210euro (Norway), and 43,667euro (Sweden), with cost-effectiveness ratio decreasing with higher risk. CONCLUSION: In the prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with a previous MI, high-dose atorvastatin appears to be a cost-effective strategy when compared with generic simvastatin 20-40 mg in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. In Finland, it is cost-effective in high-risk patients. The key driver of the cost-effectiveness is the price-difference between 80 mg atorvastatin and generic simvastatin.",2007-01-03414,17371782,Eur Heart J,Peter Lindgren,2007,28 / 12,1448-53,No,17371782,"Peter Lindgren; Jennifer Graff; Anders G Olsson; Terje J Pedersen; Bengt Jönsson; Cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin compared with regular dose simvastatin, Eur Heart J, 2007-Jun; 28(12):0195-668X; 1448-53",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Not Stated,Atorvastatin 80mg vs. Generic simvastatin 20-40mg,Not Stated,80 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,35210,Euro,2005,58085.91

4410,Cost utility of screening for Barrett's esophagus with esophageal capsule endoscopy versus conventional upper endoscopy,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Screening for Barrett's esophagus with conventional esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) is recommended to decrease mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) has recently been shown to be accurate in detecting Barrett's esophagus. We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of screening by ECE with screening by EGD. METHODS: A Markov model of 50-year-old white men with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux was constructed to compare screening modalities. The model incorporated direct medical costs and indirect costs of lost productivity and followed the patients until age 80 years or death. Outcomes were analyzed from the societal perspective. RESULTS: EGD screening prevented 60% of cancer deaths at a cost of $11,254 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with no screening. ECE prevented 53% of cancer deaths and provided 9 fewer quality-adjusted days at greater cost than EGD. If society were only willing to pay $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, then capsule screening would be preferred if the income of the patient and driver were each greater than $280,682.

4413,How cost-effective is screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"OBJECTIVE: To provide reliable estimates of the long-term cost-effectiveness of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in men. METHODS: A Markov health economic decision model for screening is described and extrapolated to 30 years. The strategy modelled involves a one-off scan at age 65 years, with annual and three-monthly follow-up scans for small and medium aneurysms, respectively. Referral for elective surgery occurs at an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm. Model parameters are estimated from patient-level data from the UK Multi-centre Aneurysm Screening Study. Model structure is validated on this trial's data, and input parameter uncertainty is addressed by probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Costs and life-years gained are obtained for both screening and no systematic screening strategies. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness improves dramatically when considered over longer timescales. Taking a 30-year perspective, screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men is highly cost-effective at 2320 pounds per life-year gained (95% uncertainty interval: 1600 pounds to 4240 pounds). Adjusting life-years for the age-specific health-related quality of life experienced in this population gave a figure of 2970 pounds (95% uncertainty interval: 2030 pounds to 5430 pounds) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The additional cost of screening the UK male population is estimated to be 19 m pounds per year. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men is highly attractive and this evidence provides further support for a national screening programme in the UK.",2007-01-03424,17362572,J Med Screen,L G Kim,2007,14 / 1,46-52,No,17362572,"L G Kim; S G Thompson; A H Briggs; M J Buxton; H E Campbell; How cost-effective is screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms?, J Med Screen, 2007; 14(1):0969-1413; 46-52",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms vs. No systematic screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,66 Years,Male,Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,2970,United Kingdom,2001,6248.52
4414,Enhanced decision support for policy makers using a web interface to health-economic models--illustrated with a cost-effectiveness analysis of nation-wide infant vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the Netherlands,"We have developed a web-based user-interface (web interface) to enhance the usefulness of health-economic evaluations to support decision making (http://pcv.healtheconomics.nl). It allows the user to interact with a health-economic model to evaluate predefined and customized scenarios and perform sensitivity analysis. To explore its usefulness, it was applied to an evaluation of cost-effectiveness of nation-wide infant vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), that was used to support a policy decision on the inclusion of PCV7 in the national vaccination program (NVP) of the Netherlands. We used a decision-tree analytic model to project the impact of infant vaccination with four doses of PCV7 on an annual cohort of infants born in the Netherlands. The base-case analysis includes the beneficial effects on unvaccinated individuals (herd protection). Additional scenarios varying the number of doses, discount rate for effects and the number of serotypes in the vaccine were evaluated and can be analysed on the web. Our model projects a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (iCER) of euro14,000 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 9,800-20,200) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) or euro15,600 (95% UI: 11,100-23,900) per life year gained (LYG).",2007-01-03426,17360082,Vaccine,G A A Hubben,2007,25 / 18,3669-78,Yes,17360082,"G A A Hubben; J M Bos; D M Glynn; A van der Ende; L van Alphen; M J Postma; Enhanced decision support for policy makers using a web interface to health-economic models--illustrated with a cost-effectiveness analysis of nation-wide infant vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the Netherlands, Vaccine, 2007-May-04; 25(18):1873-2518; 3669-78",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccination with the 7-valent penumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,14000,Euro,2004,23858.06
4415,Updated evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of lung volume reduction surgery,"BACKGROUND: The National Emphysema Treatment Trial, a randomized clinical trial of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) vs medical therapy for severe emphysema, included a prospective economic analysis. We present an updated analysis of cost-effectiveness with 1-year additional follow-up data. METHODS: Following pulmonary rehabilitation, 1,218 patients at 17 medical centers were randomized to receive LVRS or continued medical treatment. The cost-effectiveness of LVRS vs medical therapy was calculated over the duration of the trial (January 1998 to December 2003) and estimated at 10 years using modeling based on observed trends in survival, cost, and quality of life. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of LVRS vs medical therapy was $140,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (95% confidence interval, $40,155 to $239,359) at 5 years, and was projected to be $54,000 per QALY gained at 10 years. In subgroup analysis, the cost-effectiveness of LVRS in patients with upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity was $77,000 per QALY gained at 5 years, and was projected to be $48,000 per QALY at 10 years. Compared to the initial results, the updated results are similar for the overall cohort but vary substantially for the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: LVRS is costly relative to other health-care programs during the time horizon when costs and outcomes are known.

4416,Exenatide versus insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK: a model of long-term clinical and cost outcomes,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with exenatide or insulin glargine, added to oral therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with combination oral agents in the UK setting. METHODS: A published and validated computer simulation model of diabetes was used to project long-term complications, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs. Probabilities of diabetes-related complications were derived from published sources. Treatment effects and patient characteristics were extracted from a recent randomised controlled trial comparing exenatide with insulin glargine. Simulations incorporated published quality of life utilities and UK-specific costs from 2004. Pharmacy costs for exenatide were based on 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the US value (as no price for the UK was available at the time of analysis). Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis exenatide was associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.057 years and in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.442 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus insulin glargine. Long-term projections demonstrated that exenatide was associated with a lower cumulative incidence of most cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications and CVD-related death than insulin glargine. Using the range of cost values, evaluation results showed that exenatide is likely to fall in a range between dominant (cost and life saving) at 20% of the US price and cost-effective (with an ICER of 22,420 pounds per QALY gained) at 100% of the US price, versus insulin glargine. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of a recent clinical trial, long-term projections indicated that exenatide is likely to be associated with improvement in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy compared to insulin glargine. The results from this modelling analysis suggest that that exenatide is likely to represent good value for money by generally accepted standards in the UK setting in individuals with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral therapy.",2007-01-03429,17355742,Curr Med Res Opin,Joshua A Ray,2007,23 / 3,609-22,No,17355742,"Joshua A Ray; Kristina S Boye; Nicole Yurgin; William J Valentine; Stéphane Roze; Jan McKendrick; Daniel M D Tucker; Volker Foos; Andrew J Palmer; Exenatide versus insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK: a model of long-term clinical and cost outcomes, Curr Med Res Opin, 2007-Mar; 23(3):0300-7995; 609-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exenatide twice per day vs. Insulin Glargine daily,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.50,3.50,22420,United Kingdom,2004,56305.22
4417,Cost-effectiveness of antenatal screening for neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the costs and health consequences of three different screening strategies for neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT). DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis on the basis of a decision tree that incorporates the relevant strategies and outcomes. SETTING: Three health regions in Norway encompassing a 2.78 million population. POPULATION: Pregnant women (n = 100,448) screened for human platelet antigen (HPA) 1a and anti-HPA 1a antibodies, and their babies. METHOD: Decision tree analysis. In three branches of the decision tree, pregnant women entered a programme while in one no screening was performed. The three different screening strategies included all HPA 1a negative women, only HPA 1a negative, HLA DRB3*0101 positive women or only HPA 1a negative women with high level of anti-HPA 1a antibodies. Included women underwent ultrasound examination and elective caesarean section 2-4 weeks before term. Severely thrombocytopenic newborn were transfused immediately with compatible platelets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, a programme of screening and subsequent treatment would generate between 210 and 230 additional QALYs among 100,000 pregnant women, and at the same time, reduce health care costs by approximately 1.7 million euros. The sensitivity analyses indicate that screening is cost effective or even cost saving within a wide range of probabilities and costs.

4418,Centralization of care for patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of centralized referral of patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was used to compare 2 referral strategies for patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer: 1) referral to an expert center, with a rate of optimal primary cytoreduction of 75% and utilization of combined intraperitoneal and intravenous adjuvant chemotherapy, and 2) referral to a less experienced center, with a rate of optimal primary cytoreduction of 25% and adjuvant treatment that consisted predominantly of intravenous chemotherapy alone. The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was evaluated from the perspective of society. RESULTS: A cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that the strategy of expert center referral had an overall cost per patient of $50,652 and had an effectiveness of 5.12 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The strategy of referral to a less experienced center carried an overall cost of $39,957 and had an effectiveness of 2.33 QALYs. The expert center strategy was associated with an additional 2.78 QALYs at an incremental cost of $10,695 but was more cost-effective, with a cost-effective ratio of $9893 per QALY compared with $17,149 per QALY for the less experienced center referral strategy. Sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo simulation confirmed the robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: According to results from the decision-analysis model, centralized referral of patients with ovarian cancer to an expert center was a cost-effective healthcare strategy and represents a paradigm for quality cancer care, delivering superior patient outcomes at an economically affordable cost.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of two common strategies for managing early endometrial cancer as part of an Ontario population-based study. METHODS: A decision-analytic model (DATA 4.5) was developed for Stage I and II endometrioid-type cancer using empiric data from Ontario. On the basis of preoperative biopsy grade, one of two surgical procedures was selected: (1) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (HBSO) or (2) surgical staging (HBSO and pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy). Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was administered according to final grade and stage. After HBSO, pelvic RT was indicated for Grades 1 and 2 if Stage IC, IIA with > 50% myometrial invasion (MI), or IIB, and for Grade 3 if Stage IB, IC, IIA, or IIB. After staging, pelvic RT was indicated for Grades 1 and 2 if Stage IIB, and for Grade 3 if Stage IC, IIA with > 50% MI, or IIB. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate uncertainty around various parameters. RESULTS: The most cost-effective (dominant) strategies were determined for each preoperative grade. For Grade 1, HBSO strongly dominated surgical staging. For Grade 2, neither strategy was dominant; surgical staging had an ICER of $5216 per QALY. For Grade 3, surgical staging strongly dominated HBSO.

4434,Cost effectiveness analysis of minimally invasive internal thoracic artery bypass versus percutaneous revascularisation for isolated lesions of the left anterior descending artery,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of percutaneous transluminal coronary artery stenting with minimally invasive internal thoracic artery bypass for isolated lesions of the left anterior descending artery. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and Health Technology Assessment databases (1966-2005), and reference sources for utility values and economical variables. METHODS: Decision analytical modelling and Markov simulation were used to model medium and long term costs, quality of life, and cost effectiveness after either intervention using data from referenced sources. Probabilistic sensitivity and alternative analyses were used to investigate the effect of uncertainty about the value of model variables and model structure. RESULTS: Stenting was the dominant strategy in the first two years, being both more effective and less costly than bypass surgery. In the third year bypass surgery still remained more expensive but became marginally more effective. As the incremental cost effectiveness was 1,108,130.40 pounds sterling (1 682,146.00 euros; $2,179,194) per quality adjusted life year (QALY), the additional effectiveness could not be said to justify the additional cost at this stage. By five years, however, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 28,042.95 pounds sterling per QALY began to compare favourably with other interventions. At 10 years the additional effectiveness of 0.132 QALYs (range -0.166 to 0.430) probably justified the additional cost of 829.02 pounds sterling (range 205.56 pounds sterling to 1452.48 pounds sterling), with an incremental cost effectiveness of 6274.02 pounds sterling per QALY. Sensitivity and alternative analysis showed the results were sensitive to the time horizon and stent type.

4435,Modelling cost effectiveness of insulin glargine for the treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes in Canada,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intensive insulin therapy improves glycosylated haemoglobin (Hb(A1C)) levels and delays the onset of long-term diabetes-related complications. Current treatment guidelines recommend maintaining a glycosylated haemoglobin (Hb(A1C)) of < or = 7% in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the risk of hypoglycaemia increases with lower Hb(A1C) levels. As such, patients often choose to settle for suboptimal glucose control in order to prevent hypoglycaemic events. At a given Hb(A1C) level, treatment with insulin glargine results in a lower risk of hypoglycaemia in type 1 and 2 diabetes compared with NPH insulin. It has been proposed that the lower hypoglycaemic risk will allow more patients to achieve target Hb(A1C) levels with insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin. The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control. METHODS: A long-term, state-transition model was developed to simulate the natural history of type 1 and 2 diabetes. Risks of diabetes-related macro- and microvascular complications and mortality by Hb(A1C) levels were estimated based on the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study). Outcome measures included complication rates and associated costs, insulin costs, life years (LYs) and QALYs. The baseline analysis was conducted for patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes (aged 27 and 53 years, respectively) with Hb(A1C) levels >7%, using a 36-year time horizon and a Canadian public payer perspective. Costs and effects were discounted at 5% per annum. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed on key model inputs. All costs were reported in $Can (2005 values). RESULTS: The NPH insulin group had lower total costs than the insulin glargine group for patients with inadequately controlled diabetes (Hb(A1C) >7%; lifetime difference 1398 Can dollars and 1992 Can dollars, respectively, in type 1 and 2 diabetes). However, patients treated with insulin glargine had greater total and quality-adjusted life expectancy than those who received NPH insulin (incremental LY = 0.08 and QALYs = 0.07 in type 1 diabetes and incremental LY = 0.25 and QALYs = 0.23 in type 2 diabetes). The weighted incremental cost per LY gained and QALY gained were 18,661 Can dollars and 20,799 Can dollars, respectively, in type 1 diabetes and 8041 Can dollars and 8618 Can dollars, respectively, in type 2 diabetes (discounted results).

4437,Cost effectiveness of an adherence-improving programme in hypertensive patients,"BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to antihypertensive drugs is high, and the economic consequences of non-adherence may be substantial. The Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS), which is a method to improve adherence, has been shown to be a useful tool for the management of adherence problems. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the MEMS compared with usual care in a population of hypertensive patients with poor adherence. The MEMS programme consisted of provision of containers fitted with electronic caps together with adherence training if indicated. METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, 164 hypertensive patients in the experimental strategy and 89 patients in the usual care strategy were followed for 5 months. Patients who had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > or = 95 mm Hg despite the use of antihypertensive drugs were eligible. Patients were recruited by a GP, and treatment took place in general practice. In the experimental strategy, electronic monitoring of the intake of antihypertensive drugs was introduced without change of medication. Unsatisfactory adherence was defined as < 85% of days with the number of doses taken as prescribed. In the usual care strategy, antihypertensive treatment was intensified by the addition or change of antihypertensive drugs, if necessary, without provision of an electronic monitor. Outcome parameters included the proportion of patients with normalised blood pressure (NBP) at 5 months and QALYs. Costs were quantified from the healthcare and societal perspective. Non-parametric bootstrap simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were presented. In addition, a number of univariate sensitivity analyses were performed on deterministic variables. RESULTS: At 5 months, 3.1% (95% UI [uncertainty interval] -9.7%, +15.8%) more patients had NBP, and 0.003 (95% UI -0.005, +0.010) more QALYs were generated in the experimental strategy. A statistically significant lower percentage of patients had a dose escalation in the experimental strategy. Irrespective of the ceiling ratio for cost effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness probability was between 75% and 80% for the analysis from the healthcare perspective using proportion of patients with NBP as the outcome parameter. For the analysis from the societal perspective using QALYs as the outcome parameter, this probability was between 45% and 51%. CONCLUSION: For a time horizon of 5 months, a difference in both cost and effect could not be detected between an adherence-improving programme compared with usual care for hypertensive patients. The probability that the adherence-improving programme is cost effective is at best moderate.

4438,Cost effectiveness of an adherence-improving programme in hypertensive patients,"BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to antihypertensive drugs is high, and the economic consequences of non-adherence may be substantial. The Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS), which is a method to improve adherence, has been shown to be a useful tool for the management of adherence problems. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the MEMS compared with usual care in a population of hypertensive patients with poor adherence. The MEMS programme consisted of provision of containers fitted with electronic caps together with adherence training if indicated. METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, 164 hypertensive patients in the experimental strategy and 89 patients in the usual care strategy were followed for 5 months. Patients who had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > or = 95 mm Hg despite the use of antihypertensive drugs were eligible. Patients were recruited by a GP, and treatment took place in general practice. In the experimental strategy, electronic monitoring of the intake of antihypertensive drugs was introduced without change of medication. Unsatisfactory adherence was defined as < 85% of days with the number of doses taken as prescribed. In the usual care strategy, antihypertensive treatment was intensified by the addition or change of antihypertensive drugs, if necessary, without provision of an electronic monitor. Outcome parameters included the proportion of patients with normalised blood pressure (NBP) at 5 months and QALYs. Costs were quantified from the healthcare and societal perspective. Non-parametric bootstrap simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were presented. In addition, a number of univariate sensitivity analyses were performed on deterministic variables. RESULTS: At 5 months, 3.1% (95% UI [uncertainty interval] -9.7%, +15.8%) more patients had NBP, and 0.003 (95% UI -0.005, +0.010) more QALYs were generated in the experimental strategy. A statistically significant lower percentage of patients had a dose escalation in the experimental strategy. Irrespective of the ceiling ratio for cost effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness probability was between 75% and 80% for the analysis from the healthcare perspective using proportion of patients with NBP as the outcome parameter. For the analysis from the societal perspective using QALYs as the outcome parameter, this probability was between 45% and 51%. CONCLUSION: For a time horizon of 5 months, a difference in both cost and effect could not be detected between an adherence-improving programme compared with usual care for hypertensive patients. The probability that the adherence-improving programme is cost effective is at best moderate. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness result is surrounded with considerable uncertainty and large-scale implementation warrants additional research into the economic consequences of this intervention.

4439,Enzyme replacement therapy in orphan and ultra-orphan diseases: the limitations of standard economic metrics as exemplified by Fabry-Anderson disease,"BACKGROUND: Fabry-Anderson disease is an x-linked deficiency of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (GALA), resulting in chronic renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertrophy, valvular disease, pain (acro-paraesthesiae) and stroke, together with premature mortality. The disease has a significant impact on quality of life (QOL), as illustrated by studies using the EQ-5D. A specific treatment is available for Fabry-Anderson disease consisting of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of the deficient enzyme. The variable clinical efficacy and cost of ERT has resulted in reluctance by some health providers to approve it. METHODS: We use the limited QOL data available in the Fabry-Anderson disease literature on ERT to derive standard economic metrics. These were derived by bootstrap estimates of the incremental net benefit (INB) statistics together with a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve relating the willingness to pay to the probability that the INB was >0. The estimates were further developed by adoption of a supplementary Bayesian approach utilising a sceptical and enthusiastic prior of the INB of ERT in Fabry-Anderson disease. RESULTS: ERT for Fabry-Anderson disease is not economically viable by standard health programme evaluation metrics. Based on current ERT costs (year 2005 values), derivation of the INB distribution, and a Bayesian analysis using an enthusiastic and sceptical prior of the INB, an upper (350,000 dollars over 1 year) and lower (175,000 dollars over 1 year) economic cost, respectively, of ERT was derived. CONCLUSION: The cost of ERT will always result in a net deficit to society under current costing and ERT efficacy as determined by the QALY metric. The rules of fair cooperation should govern decision making both for ERT in Fabry-Anderson disease and for funding therapeutic advances in other rare diseases belonging to the orphan and ultra-orphan categories.",2007-01-03450,17335306,Pharmacoeconomics,David F Moore,2007,25 / 3,201-8,Yes,17335306,"David F Moore; Markus Ries; Evelyn L Forget; Raphael Schiffmann; Enzyme replacement therapy in orphan and ultra-orphan diseases: the limitations of standard economic metrics as exemplified by Fabry-Anderson disease, Pharmacoeconomics, 2007; 25(3):1179-2027; 201-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of the deficient enzyme vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,131578.95,United States,2005,174368.05
4440,Cost-effectiveness of alendronate in the treatment of postmenopausal women in 9 European countries--an economic evaluation based on the fracture intervention trial,"SUMMARY: Treatment with alendronate (Fosamax) has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of fragility fractures. Cost-effectiveness of treatment was assessed in nine European countries in a Markov model and was generally found to be cost effective in women with a previous spine fracture. INTRODUCTION: Treatment with alendronate (Fosamax) reduces the risk of osteoporotic fractures at the spine, hip and wrist in women with and without prevalent vertebral fracture. Cost-effectiveness estimates in one country may not be applicable elsewhere due to differences in fracture risks, costs and drug prices. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of treating postmenopausal women with alendronate in nine European countries, comprising Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. METHODS: A Markov model was populated with data for the nine European populations. Effect of treatment was taken from the Fracture Intervention Trial, which recruited women with low BMD alone or with a prior vertebral fracture. RESULTS: The cost per QALY gained of treating postmenopausal women with prior vertebral fractures ranged in the base case from ""cost saving"" in the Scandinavian countries to <euro>15,000 in Italy. Corresponding estimates for women without prior vertebral fractures ranged from ""cost saving"" to <euro>40,000.

4458,The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a national lay-led self care support programme for patients with long-term conditions: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: Supporting patients' self care could have a major effect on the management of long-term conditions, which has led to worldwide interest in effective self care interventions. In England, self care support is being developed through the ""Expert Patients Programme"", which provides lay-led generic courses to improve patients' self care skills. However, the clinical and cost effectiveness of such courses remains unclear. METHODS: Two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial design with waiting list control in community settings in England. 629 patients with a wide range of self-defined long-term conditions were studied. The lay-led self care support group involved 6-weekly sessions to teach self care skills. Primary outcomes were self-efficacy, reported energy and routine health services utilisation at 6 months. A cost-effectiveness analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: Patients receiving immediate course access reported considerably greater self-efficacy and energy at 6-month follow-up, but reported no statistically significant reductions in routine health services utilisation over the same time period. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that patients receiving immediate course access reported considerably greater health related quality of life, and a small reduction in costs. If a quality adjusted life year was valued at 20,000 pounds (39,191 dollars; 30,282 Euro), there was a 70% probability that the intervention was cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Lay-led self care support groups are effective in improving self-efficacy and energy levels among patients with long-term conditions, and are likely to be cost effective over 6 months at conventional values of a decision-maker's willingness to pay.

4459,Cost-effectiveness analysis of inactivated virosomal subunit influenza vaccination in children aged 3-14 years from the provider and societal perspectives,"The costs and benefits of vaccinating a theoretical cohort of 1000 preschool and school age children (3-14 years) with one dose of inactivated virosomal subunit influenza vaccine in primary health care centers of the Catalan Health Service during the fall annual health examination were compared with the current strategy of no routine vaccination. The economic analysis was carried out from the provider perspective (cost-effectiveness analysis) and from the societal perspective (cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis). The time horizon of the study was established at 6 months. In the base case (cost of vaccination of euro 9.425, cost of paediatric visit plus antibiotic and antipyretic treatment of euro 42.50, cost of 1 day of hospital stay of euro 454.25, cost of the work lost by the mother to take care of her ill child of euro 29.2 and cost of 1 year of quality adjusted life year lost of euro 10,662), the vaccination does not save money from the provider perspective (net present value=euro-1460.51), but the cost-effectiveness ratios are very reasonable (euro 5.80 per episode of acute febrile respiratory process avoided and euro 18.26 per quality adjusted life year saved). From the societal perspective, the vaccination saves money (net present value=euro+7587.03) and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.80, meaning that euro 0.80 is saved per euro invested.

DESIGN: Reference case cost-utility analysis using value-based medicine principles, which use patient-based utility values and standardized, input variable criteria. PARTICIPANTS: Data from participants in the Macular Photocoagulation Study, Pegaptanib for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study, and the Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Photodynamic Therapy Study. METHODS: Visual data were converted to a value-based format using time tradeoff utility analysis values from patients with macular degeneration. Costs were obtained from 2005 Medicare data. Outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and costs were discounted at a 3% annual rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interventional QALYs gained, percent improvement in quality of life, and dollars spent per QALY gained. RESULTS: Laser photocoagulation confers a 4.4% (P = 0.03 versus pegaptanib therapy) improvement in quality of life for the reference case, whereas pegaptanib therapy confers a 5.9% improvement and PDT confers an 8.1% (P = 0.0002 versus pegaptanib therapy) improvement. The cost-utility associated with laser photocoagulation is $8179, that for pegaptanib therapy is $66978, and that for PDT is $31544.

Using an economic measure, photodynamic therapy is the preferred treatment among these 3 interventions.",2007-01-03459,17320964,Ophthalmology,Gary C Brown,2007,114 / 6,1170-8,No,17320964,"Gary C Brown; Melissa M Brown; Heidi C Brown; Sylvia Kindermann; Sanjay Sharma; A value-based medicine comparison of interventions for subfoveal neovascular macular degeneration, Ophthalmology, 2007-Jun; 114(6):0161-6420; 1170-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin vs. Usual care,Not Stated,75 Years,75 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Years,3.00,3.00,31544,United States,2005,41802.02
4463,Cost-effectiveness of vitamin therapy for age-related macular degeneration,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of vitamin therapy (antioxidants plus zinc) for all indicated patients diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: We compared the impacts of vitamin therapy with those of no vitamin therapy using a computerized, stochastic, agent-based model. The model simulated the natural history of AMD and patterns of ophthalmic service use in the United States in a cohort from age 50 years until 100 or death. PARTICIPANTS AND/OR CONTROLS: The model created 20 million simulated individuals. These individuals each received both the intervention (vitamin therapy after diagnosis) and the control (no vitamin therapy). Expected outcomes generated when vitamins were taken after diagnosis were compared with the expected outcomes generated when they were not. METHODS: The model created individuals representative of patients in the U.S. Incidence of early AMD was based on published studies, as was vision loss and response to choroidal neovascularization therapies. Post-incident disease progression was governed by previously unpublished data drawn from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extent of disease progression, years and severity of visual impairment, cost of ophthalmic care and nursing home services, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and benefits were considered from the health care perspective and discounted using a 3% rate. The analysis was run for 50 years starting in 2003. RESULTS: Compared with no therapy, vitamin therapy yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,387 per QALY gained and lowered the percentage of patients with AMD who ever developed visual impairment in the better-seeing eye from 7.0% to 5.6%.

4464,Cost-effectiveness of aortic valve replacement in the elderly: an introductory study,"OBJECTIVE: With increased life expectancy and improved technology, valve replacement is being offered to increasing numbers of elderly patients with satisfactory clinical results. By using standard econometric techniques, we estimated the relative cost-effectiveness of aortic valve replacement by drawing on a large prospective database at our institution. By using aortic valve replacement as an example, this introductory report paves the way to more definitive studies of these issues in the future. METHODS: From 1961 to 2003, 4617 adult patients underwent aortic valve replacement at our service. These patients were provided with a prospective lifetime follow-up. As of 2005, these patients had accumulated 31,671 patient-years of follow-up (maximum 41 years) and had returned 22,396 yearly questionnaires. A statistical model was used to estimate the future life years of patients who are currently alive. In the absence of direct estimates of utility, quality-adjusted life years were estimated from New York Heart Association class. The cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated by the patient's age at surgery. RESULTS: The overall cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately 13,528 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased according to age at surgery, up to 19,826 dollars per quality-adjusted life year for octogenarians and 27,182 dollars per quality-adjusted life year for nonagenarians. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited scope of this introductory study, aortic valve replacement is cost-effective for all age groups and is very cost-effective for all but the most elderly according to standard econometric rules of thumb.",2007-01-03461,17320552,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,YingXing Wu,2007,133 / 3,608-13,No,17320552,"YingXing Wu; Ruyun Jin; Guangqiang Gao; Gary L Grunkemeier; Albert Starr; Cost-effectiveness of aortic valve replacement in the elderly: an introductory study, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 2007-Mar; 133(3):0022-5223; 608-13",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aortic valve replacement vs. Do nothing,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,13524,United States,2005,17921.97
4465,The cost-utility of cinacalcet in addition to standard care compared to standard care alone for secondary hyperparathyroidism in end-stage renal disease: a UK perspective,"BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common side effect of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with increased risk of fracture and cardiovascular events (CV). Current standard treatment includes dietary control, phosphate binders and vitamin D. However, many patients do not have their parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphate levels controlled by this regimen. Cinacalcet is the first of a new class of calcimimetic drugs which suppress PTH production. Although there is convincing evidence of the impact of cinacalcet on serum biomarkers, the long-term clinical implications of treatment are less clear. The aim of this study is to estimate the cost-utility of cinacalcet as an addition to standard treatment of SHPT compared with standard treatment alone. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility of cinacalcet. Uncertainty was explored through extensive sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Compared with standard treatment, cinacalcet incurs average additional lifetime costs of pound21,167 per person and confers an additional 0.34 quality adjusted life years, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound61,890 (approximately euro89,000) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive one-way sensitivity analysis showed that cinacalcet was only likely to be considered cost-effective if the relative risk of mortality for people with very high levels of PTH was 2.2 compared with people whose PTH reached target levels, or if drug costs were considerably reduced. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed cinacalcet was very unlikely to be cost-effective at usual levels of willingness to pay in the National Health Service (NHS). CONCLUSION: Unless the cost of cinacalcet is considerably reduced, it is unlikely to be considered a cost-effective treatment for people with SHPT.",2007-01-03470,17308322,Nephrol Dial Transplant,Ruth Garside,2007,22 / 5,1428-36,No,17308322,"Ruth Garside; Martin Pitt; Rob Anderson; Stuart Mealing; Richard D'Souza; Ken Stein; The cost-utility of cinacalcet in addition to standard care compared to standard care alone for secondary hyperparathyroidism in end-stage renal disease: a UK perspective, Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2007-May; 22(5):0931-0509; 1428-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cinacalcet in addition to standard care vs. Standard care,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,61890,United Kingdom,2004,155429.53

We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of these regimens, which are expensive and potentially toxic. METHODS: We used a Markov health-state transition model to simulate three adjuvant therapy options for a cohort of 49-year-old women with HER2/neu-positive early-stage breast cancer: conventional chemotherapy without trastuzumab; anthracycline-based AT regimens used in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31 and North Central Cancer Treatment Group N9831 trials; and the nonanthracycline AT regimen used in the Breast Cancer International Research group 006 trial. The base case used treatment efficacy measures reported in the randomized clinical trials of AT. We measured health outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs in 2005 United States dollars (US dollars) and subjected results to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base case, the anthracycline-based AT arm has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 39,982 dollars/QALY, whereas the nonanthracycline AT arm is more expensive and less effective; this result is insensitive to changes in recurrence rates, but if there is no benefit after 4 years, ICERs exceed 100,000 dollars/QALY for both AT arms. Results are moderately sensitive to variation in breast cancer survival rates and trastuzumab cost, and less sensitive to variations in cardiac toxicity.

4469,Cost effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 12-month adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in women with high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive early breast cancer. METHODS: A Markov model tracked quarterly patients' transitions between five health states: disease free, local relapse, disease free after local relapse, metastatic disease, and death. Patients were allowed to incur symptomatic or asymptomatic transient cardiac dysfunction during trastuzumab administration. Probabilities were derived mainly from the combined report of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31 and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group N9831 trials (95% node positive) and a meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Italian and US health care systems. The analysis was run during a 15-year time horizon. A 3% yearly discount rate was applied to both costs and life-years. Second-order Monte-Carlo and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Adjuvant trastuzumab increases life expectancy by 1.54 (1.18 discounted) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). At a cost of 675 euros and 767 dollars per weekly dose in the Italian and US setting, respectively, trastuzumab achieves its clinical benefit at a cost of 14,861 euros (95% CI, 3,917 euros to 44,028 euros) and 18,970 dollars (95% CI, 6,014 dollars to 45,621 dollars) per QALY saved. The incremental cost effectiveness was higher than 50,000 euros/QALY (or 60,000 dollars/QALY) at time horizons shorter than 7.8 years and for patients older than 76 years or with a 10-year risk of relapse lower than 15%. The results confirmed the cost effectiveness when simulating a Herceptin Adjuvant Trial (HERA) -like scenario at multiway sensitivity analysis.

4471,Use of the U.S. and U.K. scoring algorithm for the EuroQol-5D in an economic evaluation of cardiac care,"BACKGROUND: Most studies that have used the EuroQol-5D instrument (EQ-5D) have used a scoring algorithm based on preferences solicited from the U.K. population. An algorithm recently was developed for the U.S. population, with studies showing meaningful differences in the results obtained using the 2 algorithms. We recently published an economic evaluation assessing the use of drug-eluting stents in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). OBJECTIVES: Using the aforementioned economic evaluation, we describe the EQ-5D utility scores resulting from use of U.S. and U.K. algorithms and explore the differences in the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICER) resulting from use of the different EQ-5D estimates. METHODS: EQ-5D data were obtained from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcomes Assessment in Coronary Heart (APPROACH) disease registry. Individual responses were scored once with each algorithm. The within-individual difference was calculated (U.S. score-U.K. score). The mean, SD, and range were compared using paired t tests. The resulting ICERs were compared using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The U.K. mean was statistically different from the U.S. mean (0.83, SD 0.20 vs. 0.87, SD 0.15, P<0.001). The mean within individual difference was 0.04 with a wide range (-0.02 to +0.41). The resulting ICER are CAN $58,635 (95% confidence interval $198,248-$34,406) per quality-adjusted life year and CAN $58,229 (95% confidence interval $116,818-$38,779) per quality-adjusted life year for the U.K. and U.S. algorithms, respectively (P value: 0.07).

DESIGN: Cluster-randomised trial SETTING: Three primary care organisations in the North of England covering a population of 400,000. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy six primary care teams in four clusters: North, South & West, City I and City II. INTERVENTION: Guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) were developed and implemented using a multifaceted approach including evidence-based recommendations, audit and feedback, interactive educational sessions, patient prompts and outreach visits. OUTCOMES: Identification and appropriate treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation or TIA, and cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Implementation led to 36% increase (95% CI 4% to 78%) in diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and improved treatment of TIA (odds ratio of complying with guidelines 1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8). Combined analysis of atrial fibrillation and TIA estimates that compliance was significantly greater (OR 1.46 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94) in the condition for which practices had received the implementation programme. The development and implementation of guidelines cost less than 1500 pounds per practice. The estimated costs per quality-adjusted life year gained by patients with atrial fibrillation or TIA were both less than 2000 pounds, very much less than the usual criterion for cost effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of evidence-based guidelines improved the quality of primary care for atrial fibrillation and TIA. The intervention was feasible and very cost effective.

Combined analysis of atrial fibrillation and TIA estimates that compliance was significantly greater (OR 1.46 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94) in the condition for which practices had received the implementation programme. The development and implementation of guidelines cost less than 1500 pounds per practice. The estimated costs per quality-adjusted life year gained by patients with atrial fibrillation or TIA were both less than 2000 pounds, very much less than the usual criterion for cost effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of evidence-based guidelines improved the quality of primary care for atrial fibrillation and TIA. The intervention was feasible and very cost effective. Key components of the model include contextual analysis, strong professional support, clear recommendations based on robust evidence, simplicity of adoption, good communication and use of established networks and opinion leaders.",2007-01-03476,17301206,Qual Saf Health Care,John Wright,2007,16 / 1,51-9,No,17301206,"John Wright; John Bibby; Joe Eastham; Stephen Harrison; Maureen McGeorge; Chris Patterson; Nick Price; Daphne Russell; Ian Russell; Neil Small; Matt Walsh; John Young; Multifaceted implementation of stroke prevention guidelines in primary care: cluster-randomised evaluation of clinical and cost effectiveness, Qual Saf Health Care, 2007-Feb; 16(1):1475-3901; 51-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of stroke vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,21 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2003,Not Stated
4475,Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in patients with severe persistent allergic asthma,"BACKGROUND: The health, economic and societal burden of asthma is considerable, and is greatest in patients with severe asthma, particularly when inadequately controlled. Real-life studies that assess the effectiveness of treatment are of particular interest. METHODS: We determined the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding omalizumab to standard therapy using data from the real-life 1-year randomized open-label study (ETOPA) and using Canada as a reference country. Only patients receiving high-dose ICS plus LABA were included in the analysis, reflecting the EU label for omalizumab. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were used to calculate the ICER for omalizumab (cost/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the 95% confidence interval and one-sided sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The base case lifetime analysis of standard therapy vs standard therapy plus add-on omalizumab for the first 5 years, gave an ICER of 31,209 Euro. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the 95% confidence interval around the ICER was 27,739-40,840 Euro. The ICER range for one-way sensitivity analyses was 23,762 Euro without discounting to 66,443 Euro without inclusion of asthma-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that add-on omalizumab therapy is cost-effective in patients with severe persistent allergic asthma.",2007-01-03479,17298423,Allergy,R Brown,2007,62 / 2,149-53,No,17298423,"R Brown; F Turk; P Dale; J Bousquet; Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in patients with severe persistent allergic asthma, Allergy, 2007-Feb; 62(2):0105-4538; 149-53",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Standard therapy plus omalizumab for the first 5 years vs. Standard therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,31209,Euro,2005,51485.47
4476,Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in women is unclear. We sought to perform a cost-utility analysis to address this issue. METHODS: We developed a Markov model, based on published literature, to compare aspirin prevention with no therapy. We used the perspective of a third-party payer and a lifetime time horizon. Our main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Our base case analysis considered 65-year-old women with a 7.5% 10-year risk of coronary heart disease events and a 2.8% risk of stroke. RESULTS: Aspirin use cost $13 300 per additional QALY gained in the base case. Results were sensitive to age, cardiovascular disease risk, relative risk reductions with aspirin for ischemic strokes and myocardial infarction, excess risk of hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding, and the disutility of taking medication. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis for 65-year-old women at moderate cardiovascular disease risk found a 27% chance that aspirin produces fewer QALYs than no treatment, a 35% chance that the cost-utility ratio was less than $50 000 per QALY gained, and a 37% probability that it was greater than $50 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin use appears to have a favorable cost-utility ratio for older women with moderate cardiovascular risk, but firm conclusions about its effects are limited by the imprecision of available evidence, which comes mainly from 1 trial. Aspirin is indicated for women at higher risk for stroke but should not be prescribed for low-risk women, including most younger women.",2007-01-03480,17296886,Arch Intern Med,Michael Pignone,2007,167 / 3,290-5,No,17296886,"Michael Pignone; Stephanie Earnshaw; Mark J Pletcher; Jeffrey A Tice; Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women: a cost-utility analysis, Arch Intern Med, 2007-Feb-12; 167(3):0003-9926; 290-5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Low dose aspirin vs. No aspirin,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,13300,United States,2005,17625.12
4477,Cost effectiveness of pertussis vaccination in adults,"BACKGROUND: Prior economic analyses have reached disparate conclusions about whether vaccinating adults against pertussis would be cost effective. Newly available data on pertussis incidence were used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of one-time adult vaccination and adult vaccination with decennial boosters. METHODS: A Markov model was used to calculate the health benefits, risks, costs, and cost effectiveness of the following strategies: (1) no adult pertussis vaccination, (2) one-time adult vaccination at 20-64 years, and (3) adult vaccination with decennial boosters. The impact of the severity of pertussis illness, vaccine adverse events, and herd immunity on model outcomes were also examined. RESULTS: At a disease incidence of 360 per 100,000, the one-time adult vaccination strategy would prevent 2.8 million cases, and the decennial vaccination strategy would prevent 8.3 million cases. As disease incidence varied from 10 to 500 per 100,000, the one-time adult vaccination strategy was projected to prevent 79,000 to 3.8 million adult pertussis cases, while the decennial vaccination program would prevent 239,000 to 11.4 million cases. A one-time adult vaccination strategy would result in 106 million people vaccinated, or approximately 64% of the adult cohort, for a total program cost of $2.1 billion, while a decennial vaccination strategy would cost $6.7 billion. The one-time and decennial booster vaccination strategies result in cost-effectiveness ratios of <$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved if disease incidence in adults were greater than 120 cases per 100,000 population.

4479,Cost-utility comparison of escitalopram and sertraline in the treatment of major depressive disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a cost-utility model comparing escitalopram with sertraline in the treatment of major depressive disorders. METHODS: A decision analytic model was created to compare the cost-utility of these two antidepressants from the perspective of a managed-care organization. The model was designed to compare 10-20 mg/day of escitalopram to 50-200 mg/day of sertraline. Benefits (utility) scores were calculated based on clinical and utility data obtained from the literature. Direct medical costs included costs of the antidepressants, titration, treatment failures, and adverse events. Costs and benefits were modeled for a 6-month period and the model was subjected to thorough sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The estimated 6-month total cost was 919 dollars for escitalopram and 1351 dollars for sertraline. The estimated QALYs were 0.40296 for escitalopram and 0.39268 for sertraline. These differences were mostly due to differences in drug acquisition costs and adverse events. The robustness of the cost-utility model results were tested in a Monte Carlo simulation of 10 000 patients and it indicated an 88.5% probability that escitalopram was the dominant therapy, suggesting both lower costs and greater QALYs. CONCLUSION: This cost-utility model that incorporated the costs of titration and impact of side-effects comparing escitalopram 10-20 mg per day and sertraline 50-200 mg per day shows that escitalopram appeared to be less costly and produced efficacy (utility) at least as good as and maybe slightly better than that of sertraline.",2007-01-03485,17288678,Curr Med Res Opin,Edward P Armstrong,2007,23 / 2,251-8,No,17288678,"Edward P Armstrong; Grant H Skrepnek; M Haim Erder; Cost-utility comparison of escitalopram and sertraline in the treatment of major depressive disorder, Curr Med Res Opin, 2007-Feb; 23(2):0300-7995; 251-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,10-20 mg/day of escitalopram vs. 50-200 mg/day of sertraline,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-4202.33,United States,2005,-5568.92
4480,Cost-effectiveness analysis of oxaliplatin compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer in the US,"BACKGROUND: The MOSAIC trial demonstrated that oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FU/LV) (FOLFOX4) as adjuvant treatment of TNM stage II and III colon cancer significantly improves disease-free survival compared with 5-FU/LV alone. For stage III patients the 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 69% in the FOLFOX4 arm vs 61% in the LV5FU2 arm, P = .002). The cost-effectiveness of FOLFOX4 in stage III patients was evaluated from a US Medicare perspective. METHODS: By using individual patient-level data from the MOSAIC trial (median follow-up: 44.2 months), DFS and overall survival (OS) were estimated up to 4 years from randomization. DFS was extrapolated from 4 to 5 years by fitting a Weibull model and subsequent survival was estimated from life tables. OS beyond 4 years was predicted from the extrapolated DFS estimates and observed survival after recurrence. Costs were calculated from trial data and external estimates of resources to manage recurrence. RESULTS: Patients on FOLFOX4 were predicted to gain 2.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63, 3.37) years of DFS over those on 5-FU/LV. The predicted life expectancy of stage III patients on FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV was 17.61 and 16.26 years, respectively. Mean total lifetime disease-related costs were $56,300 with oxaliplatin and $39,300 with 5-FU/LV. Compared with 5-FU/LV, FOLFOX4 was estimated to cost $20,600 per life-year gained and $22,800 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, discounting costs and outcomes at 3% per annum. CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX4 is likely to be cost-effective compared with 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer.

4481,Economics and preventing hospital-acquired infection: broadening the perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To present a hypothetical model of the change in economic costs and health benefits to society that result from nosocomial infection control programs. DESIGN: We use a modeling framework to represent how 2 types of costs change with nosocomial infection control programs: costs incurred by the hospital sector and community health services, as well as the private costs to patients. We also demonstrate how to value the health benefits of nosocomial infection control programs, using quality-adjusted life years. SETTING: Hypothetical modeling to incorporate the societal perspective. SUBJECTS: A cohort of 50,000 simulated patients at risk of surgical site infection following total hip replacement. INTERVENTION(S): A total of 8 hypothetical interventions that change costs and health outcomes among the cohort by preventing cases of surgical site infection following total hip replacement. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that when infection control interventions reduce economic costs and increase health benefits, they should be adopted without further question. If, however, interventions increase economic costs and increase health benefits, then the trade-off between costs and benefits should be examined. Decision-makers should assess the cost per unit of health benefit from infection control programs, consider the impact on health budgets, and compare infection control with alternative uses of scarce healthcare resources.",2007-01-03494,17265399,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Nicholas Graves,2007,28 / 2,178-84,No,17265399,"Nicholas Graves; Kate Halton; David Lairson; Economics and preventing hospital-acquired infection: broadening the perspective, Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol, 2007-Feb; 28(2):0899-823X; 178-84",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Infection Control Strategies vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,1579,United States,2005,2092.49
4482,Cost-effectiveness of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes: results from the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS),"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes using data from the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,838 patients, who were aged 40 to 75 years and had type 2 diabetes without a documented history of cardiovascular disease and without elevated LDL-cholesterol, were recruited from 32 centres in the UK and Ireland and randomly allocated to atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 1,428) or placebo (n = 1,410). These subjects were followed-up for a median period of 3.9 years. Direct treatment costs and effectiveness were analysed to provide estimates of cost per endpoint-free year over the trial period for alternative definitions of endpoint, and of cost per life-year gained and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a patient's lifetime. RESULTS: Over the trial period, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be 7,608 pounds per year free of any CARDS primary endpoint; the ICER was calculated to be 4,896 pounds per year free of any cardiovascular endpoint and 4,120 pounds per year free of any study endpoint. Over lifetime, the incremental cost per life-year gained was 5,107 pounds and the cost per QALY was 6,471 pounds (costs and benefits both discounted at 3.5%). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin is a cost-effective intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes, with the ICER for this intervention falling within the current acceptance threshold ( 20,000 pounds per QALY) specified by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).",2007-01-03495,17265034,Diabetologia,M Raikou,2007,50 / 4,733-40,No,17265034,"M Raikou; A McGuire; H M Colhoun; D J Betteridge; P N Durrington; G A Hitman; H A W Neil; S J Livingstone; V Charlton-Menys; J H Fuller; Cost-effectiveness of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes: results from the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), Diabetologia, 2007-Apr; 50(4):0012-186X; 733-40",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Atorvastatin 10 mg daily vs. Placebo,Not Stated,62 Years,62 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,6741,United Kingdom,2003,15499.43
4483,Cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment vs. standard treatment in patients with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis: a health-economic model simulation based on a patient survey and clinical trial data,"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects health and quality of life (QoL) and also has great impact on both healthcare costs and costs to society. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of treatment with tacrolimus ointment vs. standard treatment in patients with moderate to severe AD. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed capturing several key features of AD and its treatment: disease severity, treatment alternatives, and QoL. The model was populated with data from three sources: (i) efficacy data from a randomized controlled trial including patients with moderate to severe AD treated with either tacrolimus ointment or standard treatment (corticosteroids), (ii) resource utilization and QoL data from a patient survey including 161 Swedish patients with AD, and (iii) official price lists. Costs were calculated according to disease severity for the two treatment alternatives using the perspective of the Swedish healthcare sector. Two analyses were performed, one based on the quantity of medication used in the trial and one based on the survey data. The relationship between effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment and the amount of medication used was tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the model simulations patients with severe AD treated with tacrolimus ointment experienced on average 4.6 more AD-free weeks per year than patients given standard treatment. The corresponding figure for patients with moderate AD was 6.5 more AD-free weeks per year. The cost-effectiveness ratios [cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained] for treatment with tacrolimus ointment vs. standard treatment were 2,334 British pound for moderate AD and 3,875 British pound for severe AD when treatment patterns from the survey were assumed, and 8,269 British pound for moderate AD and 12,304 British pound for severe AD when treatment patterns from the clinical trial were assumed. The results of sensitivity analyses were all well within limits to be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio are far below the currently discussed threshold in Sweden, corresponding to approximately 48,700 British pound per QALY gained, and equivalent thresholds in other countries.

The model was populated with data from three sources: (i) efficacy data from a randomized controlled trial including patients with moderate to severe AD treated with either tacrolimus ointment or standard treatment (corticosteroids), (ii) resource utilization and QoL data from a patient survey including 161 Swedish patients with AD, and (iii) official price lists. Costs were calculated according to disease severity for the two treatment alternatives using the perspective of the Swedish healthcare sector. Two analyses were performed, one based on the quantity of medication used in the trial and one based on the survey data. The relationship between effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment and the amount of medication used was tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the model simulations patients with severe AD treated with tacrolimus ointment experienced on average 4.6 more AD-free weeks per year than patients given standard treatment. The corresponding figure for patients with moderate AD was 6.5 more AD-free weeks per year. The cost-effectiveness ratios [cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained] for treatment with tacrolimus ointment vs. standard treatment were 2,334 British pound for moderate AD and 3,875 British pound for severe AD when treatment patterns from the survey were assumed, and 8,269 British pound for moderate AD and 12,304 British pound for severe AD when treatment patterns from the clinical trial were assumed. The results of sensitivity analyses were all well within limits to be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio are far below the currently discussed threshold in Sweden, corresponding to approximately 48,700 British pound per QALY gained, and equivalent thresholds in other countries. Treatment with tacrolimus ointment in patients with moderate and severe AD can therefore be considered cost-effective.",2007-01-03497,17263826,Br J Dermatol,J Hjelmgren,2007,156 / 5,913-21,No,17263826,"J Hjelmgren; A Svensson; E T Jörgensen; B Lindemalm-Lundstam; G Ragnarson Tennvall; Cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment vs. standard treatment in patients with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis: a health-economic model simulation based on a patient survey and clinical trial data, Br J Dermatol, 2007-May; 156(5):0007-0963; 913-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tacrolimus ointment vs. Standard treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,3875,United Kingdom,2004,9731.61
4487,Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment options for acute otitis media,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the costs and utility of observation and routine antibiotic treatment options for children with acute otitis media. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed among children aged 6 months to 12 years seen in primary care offices. The interventions studied were watchful waiting as practiced in the Netherlands, delayed prescription, 5 days of amoxicillin, and 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: In the base case analysis, delayed prescription was the least costly option and 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin was the most effective. The incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) of 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin compared with delayed prescription was 56,000 dollars per QALY gained. Watchful waiting and 5 days of amoxicillin were inferior options. The results were sensitive to the rate of nonattendance in the delayed prescription strategy: when the rate was less than 23%, watchful waiting was the least costly option and delayed prescription was an inferior option. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which all model variables were simultaneously varied, showed with 95% certainty that compared with delayed prescription, 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin had a 61% probability of having an ICUR of greater than 50,000 dollars per QALY gained, and watchful waiting had a 23% probability of having an ICUR of less than 50,000 dollars per QALY gained.

4493,Economic evaluation of palliative management versus peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease: evidence for coverage decisions in Thailand,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the value for money of including peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) into the universal health insurance scheme of Thailand. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model applied to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients aged 20 to 70 years was developed to examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of palliative care versus 1) providing PD as an initial treatment followed by HD if complications/switching occur; and 2) providing HD followed by PD if complications/switching occur. Input parameters were extracted from a national cohort, the Thailand Renal Replacement Therapy Registry, and systematic reviews, where possible. The study explored the effects of uncertainty around input parameters, presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, as well as the value of obtaining further information on chosen parameters, i.e., partial expected value of perfect information. RESULTS: Using a societal perspective, the average ICER of initial treatment with PD and the average ICER of initial treatment with HD were 672,000 and 806,000 Baht per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (52,000 and 63,000 purchasing power parity [PPP] US$/QALY) compared with palliative care. Providing treatments for younger ESRD patients resulted in a significant improvement of survival and gain of QALYs compared with the older aged group. The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios of both options for the older age group were relatively similar. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that offering PD as initial treatment was a better choice than offering HD, but it would only be considered a cost-effective strategy if the social willingness-to-pay threshold was at or higher than 700,000 Baht per QALY (54,000 PPP US$/QALY) for the age 20 group and 750,000 Baht per QALY (58,000 PPP US$/QALY) for age 70 years.",2007-01-03502,17261117,Value Health,Yot Teerawattananon,2007,10 / 1,61-72,Yes,17261117,"Yot Teerawattananon; Miranda Mugford; Viroj Tangcharoensathien; Economic evaluation of palliative management versus peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease: evidence for coverage decisions in Thailand, Value Health, 2007 Jan-Feb; 10(1):1098-3015; 61-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Peritoneal dialysis vs. Palliative Management,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,667000,Thailand,2001,21898.57

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that offering PD as initial treatment was a better choice than offering HD, but it would only be considered a cost-effective strategy if the social willingness-to-pay threshold was at or higher than 700,000 Baht per QALY (54,000 PPP US$/QALY) for the age 20 group and 750,000 Baht per QALY (58,000 PPP US$/QALY) for age 70 years.",2007-01-03502,17261117,Value Health,Yot Teerawattananon,2007,10 / 1,61-72,Yes,17261117,"Yot Teerawattananon; Miranda Mugford; Viroj Tangcharoensathien; Economic evaluation of palliative management versus peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease: evidence for coverage decisions in Thailand, Value Health, 2007 Jan-Feb; 10(1):1098-3015; 61-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hemodialysis vs. Palliative Management,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,803000,Thailand,2001,26363.65

METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model applied to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients aged 20 to 70 years was developed to examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of palliative care versus 1) providing PD as an initial treatment followed by HD if complications/switching occur; and 2) providing HD followed by PD if complications/switching occur. Input parameters were extracted from a national cohort, the Thailand Renal Replacement Therapy Registry, and systematic reviews, where possible. The study explored the effects of uncertainty around input parameters, presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, as well as the value of obtaining further information on chosen parameters, i.e., partial expected value of perfect information. RESULTS: Using a societal perspective, the average ICER of initial treatment with PD and the average ICER of initial treatment with HD were 672,000 and 806,000 Baht per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (52,000 and 63,000 purchasing power parity [PPP] US$/QALY) compared with palliative care.
