11101,The EOS 2D/3D X-ray imaging system: a cost-effectiveness analysis quantifying the health benefits from reduced radiation exposure,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the EOS((R)) 2D/3D X-ray imaging system compared with standard X-ray for the diagnosis and monitoring of orthopaedic conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to quantify the long-term costs and health outcomes, expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the UK health service perspective. Input parameters were obtained from medical literature, previously developed cancer models and expert advice. Threshold analysis was used to quantify the additional health benefits required, over and above those associated with radiation-induced cancers, for EOS((R)) to be considered cost-effective. RESULTS: Standard X-ray is associated with a maximum health loss of 0.001 QALYs, approximately 0.4 of a day in full health, while the loss with EOS((R)) is a maximum of 0.00015 QALYs, or 0.05 of a day in full health. On a per patient basis, EOS((R)) is more expensive than standard X-ray by between pound10.66 and pound224.74 depending on the assumptions employed. The results suggest that EOS((R)) is not cost-effective for any indication. Health benefits over and above those obtained from lower radiation would need to double for EOS to be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSION: No evidence currently exists on whether there are health benefits associated with imaging improvements from the use of EOS((R)). The health benefits from radiation dose reductions are very small. Unless EOS((R)) can generate additional health benefits as a consequence of the nature and quality of the image, comparative patient throughput with X-ray will be the major determinant of cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-10994,23473735,Eur J Radiol,Rita Faria,2013,82 / 8,e342-9,No,23473735,"Rita Faria; Claire McKenna; Ros Wade; Huiqin Yang; Nerys Woolacott; Mark Sculpher; The EOS 2D/3D X-ray imaging system: a cost-effectiveness analysis quantifying the health benefits from reduced radiation exposure, Eur J Radiol, ; 82(8):1872-7727; e342-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"EOS 2D/3D X-ray imaging system, at utilisation 48 patients per working day for 251 working days per year vs. Standard X-ray, at utilisation 30 patients per working day for 251 working days per year",Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,350776,United Kingdom,2011,647491.34

11112,Cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome in Germany,"The aim of this health economic analysis was to compare the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel within the German health care system. A two-part decision model was adapted to compare treatment with ticagrelor or clopidogrel in a low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) cohort (</=150 mg) for all ACS patients and subtypes NSTEMI/IA and STEMI. A decision-tree approach was chosen for the first year after initial hospitalization based on trial observations from a subgroup of the PLATO study. Subsequent years were estimated by a Markov model. Following a macro-costing approach, costs were based on official tariffs and published literature. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. One-year treatment with ticagrelor is associated with an estimated 0.1796 life-years gained (LYG) and gained 0.1570 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively, over the lifetime horizon. Overall average cost with ticagrelor is estimated to be EUR 11,815 vs. EUR 11,387 with generic clopidogrel over a lifetime horizon. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was EUR 2,385 per LYG (EUR 2,728 per QALY).

11115,Using decision analysis to assess comparative clinical efficacy of surgical treatment of unstable ankle fractures,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The development of a robust treatment algorithm for ankle fractures based on well-established stability criteria has been shown to be prognostic with respect to treatment and outcomes. In parallel with the development of improved understanding of the biomechanical rationale of ankle fracture treatment has been an increased emphasis on assessing the effectiveness of medical and surgical interventions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of using decision analysis in the assessment of the cost effectiveness of operative treatment of ankle fractures based on the existing clinical data in the literature. METHODS: Using the data obtained from a previous structured review of the ankle fracture literature, decision analysis trees were constructed using standard software. The decision nodes for the trees were based on ankle fracture stability criteria previously published. The outcomes were assessed by calculated Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) assigned to achieving normal ankle function, developing posttraumatic arthritis, or sustaining a postoperative infection. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken by varying the patient''s age, incidence of arthritis, and incidence or infection. RESULTS: Decision analysis trees captured the essential aspects of clinical decision making in ankle fracture treatment in a clinically useful manner. In general, stable fractures yielded better outcomes with nonoperative treatment, whereas unstable fractures had better outcomes with surgery. These were consistent results over a wide range of postoperative infection rates. Varying the age of the patient did not qualitatively change the results. Between the ages of 30 and 80 years, surgery yielded higher expected QALYs than nonoperative care for unstable fractures, and generated lower QALYs than nonoperative care for stable fractures. Using local cost estimates for operative and nonoperative treatment, the incremental cost of surgery for unstable fractures was less than $40,000 per QALY (the usual cutoff for the determination of cost effectiveness) for patients aged up to 90 years. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Decision analysis is a useful methodology in developing treatment guidelines. Numerous previous studies have indicated superior clinical outcomes when unstable ankle fractures underwent operative reduction and stabilization. What has been lacking was an examination of the cost effectiveness of such an approach, particularly in older patients who have fewer expected years of life. In light of the evidence for satisfactory outcomes for surgery of severe ankle fractures in older people, the justification for operative intervention is an obvious question that can be asked in the current increasingly cost-conscious environment. Using a decision-tree decision analysis structured around the stability-based ankle fracture classification system, in conjunction with a relatively simple cost effectiveness analysis, this study was able to demonstrate that surgical treatment of unstable ankle fractures in elderly patients is in fact cost effective.

11119,At what price? A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing trial of labour after previous caesarean versus elective repeat caesarean delivery,"BACKGROUND: Elective repeat caesarean delivery (ERCD) rates have been increasing worldwide, thus prompting obstetric discourse on the risks and benefits for the mother and infant. Yet, these increasing rates also have major economic implications for the health care system. Given the dearth of information on the cost-effectiveness related to mode of delivery, the aim of this paper was to perform an economic evaluation on the costs and short-term maternal health consequences associated with a trial of labour after one previous caesarean delivery compared with ERCD for low risk women in Ireland. METHODS: Using a decision analytic model, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed where the measure of health gain was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a six-week time horizon. A review of international literature was conducted to derive representative estimates of adverse maternal health outcomes following a trial of labour after caesarean (TOLAC) and ERCD. Delivery/procedure costs derived from primary data collection and combined both ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" costing estimations. RESULTS: Maternal morbidities emerged in twice as many cases in the TOLAC group than the ERCD group. However, a TOLAC was found to be the most-effective method of delivery because it was substantially less expensive than ERCD (euro 1,835.06 versus euro 4,039.87 per women, respectively), and QALYs were modestly higher (0.84 versus 0.70). Our findings were supported by probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be well informed of the benefits and risks of TOLAC among low risk women. Ideally, clinician-patient discourse would address differences in length of hospital stay and postpartum recovery time. While it is premature advocate a policy of TOLAC across maternity units, the results of the study prompt further analysis and repeat iterations, encouraging future studies to synthesis previous research and new and relevant evidence under a single comprehensive decision model.",2013-01-11006,23484038,PLoS One,Christopher G Fawsitt,2013,8 / 3,e58577,No,23484038,"Christopher G Fawsitt; Jane Bourke; Richard A Greene; Claire M Everard; Aileen Murphy; Jennifer E Lutomski; At what price?

11120,Cost-effectiveness of surveillance strategies after treatment for high-grade anal dysplasia in high-risk patients,"BACKGROUND: Anal cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected male patients. Currently, there is no consensus on posttreatment surveillance of HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) who have been treated for high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN), the likely precursor to anal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of strategies for anal cancer surveillance in HIV-infected MSM previously treated for HGAIN. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to project quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 5 strategies using high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and/or anal cytology testing after treatment. RESULTS: Performing HRA alone at 6- and 12-month visits was associated with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $4446 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In comparison, combined HRA and anal cytology at both visits provided greater health benefit at a cost of $17,373 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

11124,Individualized treatment of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B using pegylated interferon-alpha2a as first-line and week-12 HBV DNA/HBsAg stopping rule: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is the most frequent and difficult-to-treat viral hepatitis worldwide. HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serum levels, which help the early identification of non-responders to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), prompt more flexible individualized therapeutic strategies exploiting the benefits of both PEG-IFN and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of week-12 HBV DNA/HBsAg stopping rule for early interruption and switch to currently most effective NA treatments (entecavir [ETV] or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]). METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed in the following health-related states: CHB, compensated cirrhosis (CC) and decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, post-liver transplant, death, virological response, relapse and HBsAg clearance. Simulated strategies included: ETV/TDF in CHB; ETV/TDF delayed until CC; first-line PEG-IFN followed by switch to ETV/TDF for either patients meeting the week-12 stopping rule or week-48 null-responders/relapsers; and first-line PEG-IFN followed by switch to ETV/TDF delayed until CC. ETV and TDF were considered alternatively for a total of eight strategies. A lifetime simulation horizon was applied. RESULTS: Early treatment strategies using NAs with or without first-line PEG-IFN provided the highest results (approximately 22 life-years and 15 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). Delayed treatments until cirrhosis development resulted in poorer outcomes. The average per-patient lifetime costs ranged from euro33,500 (TDF in CC) to euro68,900 (TDF in CHB). Costs using ETV were 20-50% higher. First-line PEG-IFN strategies ranged from dominant (that is, more effective and less costly) to highly cost-effective, although differences in QALYs were always very narrow. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy of HBeAg-negative CHB could be improved significantly using first-line PEG-IFN followed by a switch to NAs in either patients meeting the week-12 HBV DNA/HBsAg stopping rule or week-48 non-responders/relapsers.",2013-01-11010,23486701,Antivir Ther,Sergio Iannazzo,2013,18 / 4,,No,23486701,"Sergio Iannazzo; Barbara Coco; Maurizia R Brunetto; Francesca Rossetti; Antonietta Caputo; Andrea Latour; Belen Espinos; Ferruccio Bonino; Individualized treatment of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B using pegylated interferon-alpha2a as first-line and week-12 HBV DNA/HBsAg stopping rule: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Antivir Ther, 2013; 18(4):1359-6535",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pegylated interferon- alpha 2a (PEG-IFN) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) vs. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF),PEG-IFN first-line treatment,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-29290.63,Euro,2011,-46897.98

Recently, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been reported as a more accurate radiological method with higher sensitivity and specificity than chest X-ray (CXR) to detect active tuberculosis. In this study, we assessed the cost effectiveness of HRCT compared to CXR in combination with QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) or the tuberculin skin test (TST) for tuberculosis contact investigation.

11137,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of Internet-based computer tailoring for smoking cessation,"BACKGROUND: Although effective smoking cessation interventions exist, information is limited about their cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of an Internet-based multiple computer-tailored smoking cessation program and tailored counseling by practice nurses working in Dutch general practices compared with an Internet-based multiple computer-tailored program only and care as usual. METHODS: The economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial, for which 91 practice nurses recruited 414 eligible smokers. Smokers were randomized to receive multiple tailoring and counseling (n=163), multiple tailoring only (n=132), or usual care (n=119). Self-reported cost and quality of life were assessed during a 12-month follow-up period. Prolonged abstinence and 24-hour and 7-day point prevalence abstinence were assessed at 12-month follow-up. The trial-based economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective. Uncertainty was accounted for by bootstrapping (1000 times) and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the intervention arms with regard to baseline characteristics or effects on abstinence, quality of life, and addiction level. However, participants in the multiple tailoring and counseling group reported significantly more annual health care-related costs than participants in the usual care group. Cost-effectiveness analysis, using prolonged abstinence as the outcome measure, showed that the mere multiple computer-tailored program had the highest probability of being cost-effective. Compared with usual care, in this group euro5100 had to be paid for each additional abstinent participant. With regard to cost-utility analyses, using quality of life as the outcome measure, usual care was probably most efficient. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this was the first study to determine the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of an Internet-based smoking cessation program with and without counseling by a practice nurse. Although the Internet-based multiple computer-tailored program seemed to be the most cost-effective treatment, the cost-utility was probably highest for care as usual.

11140,Comparative cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted and standard laparoscopic prostatectomy as alternatives to open radical prostatectomy for treatment of men with localised prostate cancer: a health technology assessment from the perspective of the UK National Health Service,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is increasingly used compared with a standard laparoscopic technique, but it remains uncertain whether potential benefits offset higher costs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of robotic prostatectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a care pathway description and model-based cost-utility analysis. We studied men with localised prostate cancer able to undergo either robotic or laparoscopic prostatectomy for cure. We used data from a meta-analysis, other published literature, and costs from the UK National Health Service and commercial sources. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Care received by men for 10 yr following radical prostatectomy was modelled. Clinical events, their effect on quality of life, and associated costs were synthesised assuming 200 procedures were performed annually. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Over 10 yr, robotic prostatectomy was on average (95% confidence interval [CI]) pound1412 (euro1595) ( pound1304 [euro1473] to pound1516 [euro1713]) more costly than laparoscopic prostatectomy but more effective with mean (95% CI) gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.08 (0.01-0.15). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound18 329 (euro20 708) with an 80% probability that robotic prostatectomy was cost effective at a threshold of pound30 000 (euro33 894)/QALY. The ICER was sensitive to the throughput of cases and the relative positive margin rate favouring robotic prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Higher costs of robotic prostatectomy may be offset by modest health gain resulting from lower risk of early harms and positive margin, provided >150 cases are performed each year.

PURPOSE: To compare PCV13 strategies to currently recommended vaccination strategies in adults aged >/=65 years. METHODS: Using a Markov model, the cost effectiveness of PCV13 and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), alone or in combination, was estimated, in adults aged either 65 years or 75 years. No prior vaccination, prior vaccination, and vaccine hyporesponsiveness scenarios were examined. Pneumococcal disease rates, indirect childhood PCV13 effects, and costs were estimated using CDC Active Bacterial Core surveillance data and U.S. national databases. An expert panel estimated vaccine-related protection. A societal perspective was taken and outcomes were discounted 3% per year. RESULTS: In those aged 65 years, single-dose PCV13 cost $11,300 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared to no vaccination; at ages 65 and 80 years, PCV13 cost $83,000/QALY. In those aged 75 years, single-dose PCV13 cost $62,800/QALY gained. PPSV23 cost more and was less effective than PCV13. Results were sensitive to varying vaccine effectiveness and indirect effect estimates.

11146,Modeling of cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination strategies in U.S. older adults,"BACKGROUND: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adults, but its role in older adults is unclear. PURPOSE: To compare PCV13 strategies to currently recommended vaccination strategies in adults aged >/=65 years. METHODS: Using a Markov model, the cost effectiveness of PCV13 and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), alone or in combination, was estimated, in adults aged either 65 years or 75 years. No prior vaccination, prior vaccination, and vaccine hyporesponsiveness scenarios were examined. Pneumococcal disease rates, indirect childhood PCV13 effects, and costs were estimated using CDC Active Bacterial Core surveillance data and U.S. national databases. An expert panel estimated vaccine-related protection. A societal perspective was taken and outcomes were discounted 3% per year. RESULTS: In those aged 65 years, single-dose PCV13 cost $11,300 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared to no vaccination; at ages 65 and 80 years, PCV13 cost $83,000/QALY. In those aged 75 years, single-dose PCV13 cost $62,800/QALY gained. PPSV23 cost more and was less effective than PCV13. Results were sensitive to varying vaccine effectiveness and indirect effect estimates. In hyporesponsiveness scenarios, cost-effectiveness ratios increased by 37%-78% for single-dose strategies and 29%-35% for multiple-dose strategies.

11147,Upfront treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer with intensity modulated radiation therapy compared to four-field radiation therapy: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Radiation can be delivered via four-field box (BOX-RT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness (C/E) of IMRT relative to BOX-RT for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. METHODS: A three-year Markov model with eight-week cycles was developed to compare IMRT to BOX-RT. A proportion (25%) received extended-field radiation therapy (EFRT) to include para-aortic nodes. The model assumed equal overall survival (OS). The model captured costs and utility estimates for BOX-RT, IMRT, and each complication. Modeled complications included acute and chronic toxicities. Baseline model assumptions were obtained by literature review and supplemented by expert opinion. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Database. Treatment strategies were compared using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way, probabilistic and structural sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in assumptions. The C/E of each strategy was evaluated from the perspective of the health care system. RESULTS: C/E analysis revealed an ICER for IMRT of $182,777/quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Although this value was higher than the willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, sensitivity analysis revealed several modifications that would make IMRT a C/E option relative to BOX-RT. For patients requiring EFRT, IMRT was C/E with an ICER of $91,580/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although IMRT was not C/E at the $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, in those requiring EFRT, IMRT was C/E relative to BOX-RT.

11149,Cost-effectiveness of statins for primary cardiovascular prevention in chronic kidney disease,"OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of statins for primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). BACKGROUND: Patients with CKD have an elevated risk of MI and stroke. Although HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (""statins"") may prevent cardiovascular events in patients with non-dialysis-requiring CKD, adverse drug effects and competing risks could materially influence net effects and clinical decision-making. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) to determine the cost-effectiveness of low-cost generic statins for primary CVD prevention in men and women with hypertension and mild-to-moderate CKD. Outcomes included MI and stroke rates, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs (2010 USD), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: For 65-year-old men with moderate hypertension and mild-to-moderate CKD, statins reduced the combined rate of MI and stroke, yielded 0.10 QALYs, and increased costs by $1,800 ($18,000 per QALY gained). For patients with lower baseline cardiovascular risks, health and economic benefits were smaller; for 65-year-old women, statins yielded 0.06 QALYs and increased costs by $1,900 ($33,400 per QALY gained). Results were sensitive to rates of rhabdomyolysis and drug costs. Statins are less cost-effective when obtained at average retail prices, particularly in patients at lower CVD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Although statins reduce absolute CVD risk in patients with CKD, the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, and competing risks associated with progressive CKD, partly offset these gains.

11151,Is adjuvant trastuzumab a cost-effective therapy for HER-2/neu-positive T1bN0 breast cancer?,"BACKGROUND: In light of clinical uncertainty and the high acquisition costs of trastuzumab, we examined the value for money associated with concurrent or sequential trastuzumab in women with HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer with small node-negative tumours (T1bN0). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A probabilistic economic model was developed to estimate the likelihood of adjuvant trastuzumab meeting a $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained threshold over a range of 10-year recurrence risks by age. The primary analysis took an incremental approach, comparing trastuzumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. A secondary analysis took an ''all-or-nothing'' approach, comparing trastuzumab plus chemotherapy with neither treatment. RESULTS: The primary analysis suggested that concurrent trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy was likely to meet the $100 000 threshold at recurrence risks of 29-35%. Sequential trastuzumab was less likely to meet such a threshold. The secondary analysis was more favourable for both trastuzumab strategies, but of limited relevance as clinical benefits were predominantly driven by chemotherapy without trastuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy appears to offer favourable value for money at the upper ranges of baseline recurrence risks reported to date, although more precise estimates of underlying risk are required to confirm the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab in T1bN0 breast cancer.",2013-01-11047,23510987,Ann Oncol,C Skedgel,2013,24 / 7,1834-40,No,23510987,"C Skedgel; D Rayson; T Younis; Is adjuvant trastuzumab a cost-effective therapy for HER-2/neu-positive T1bN0 breast cancer?, Ann Oncol, ; 24(7):0923-7534; 1834-40",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Concurrent adjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy vs. Chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Canada,2011,Not Stated
11152,Cost-effectiveness of digital subtraction angiography in the setting of computed tomographic angiography negative subarachnoid hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have documented the high sensitivity of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in detecting a ruptured aneurysm in the presence of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The practice of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) when CTA does not reveal an aneurysm has thus been called into question. OBJECTIVE: We examined this dilemma from a cost-effectiveness perspective by using current decision analysis techniques. METHODS: A decision tree was created with the use of TreeAge Pro Suite 2012; in 1 arm, a CTA-negative SAH was followed up with DSA; in the other arm, patients were observed without further imaging. Based on literature review, costs and utilities were assigned to each potential outcome. Base-case and sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of each strategy. A Monte Carlo simulation was then conducted by sampling each variable over a plausible distribution to evaluate the robustness of the model. RESULTS: With the use of a negative predictive value of 95.7% for CTA, observation was found to be the most cost-effective strategy ($6737/Quality Adjusted Life Year [QALY] vs $8460/QALY) in the base-case analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that DSA became the more cost-effective option if the negative predictive value of CTA fell below 93.72%. The Monte Carlo simulation produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $83 083/QALY. At the conventional willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY, observation was the more cost-effective strategy in 83.6% of simulations. CONCLUSION: The decision to perform a DSA in CTA-negative SAH depends strongly on the sensitivity of CTA, and therefore must be evaluated at each center treating these types of patients. Given the high sensitivity of CTA reported in the current literature, performing DSA on all patients with CTA negative SAH may not be cost-effective at every institution.",2013-01-11050,23511820,Neurosurgery,Pinakin R Jethwa,2013,72 / 4,511-9; discussion 519,No,23511820,"Pinakin R Jethwa; Vineet Punia; Tapan D Patel; E Jesus Duffis; Chirag D Gandhi; Charles J Prestigiacomo; Cost-effectiveness of digital subtraction angiography in the setting of computed tomographic angiography negative subarachnoid hemorrhage, Neurosurgery, ; 72(4):0148-396X; 511-9; discussion 519",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Digital subtraction angiography vs. Observe for aneurysm or no aneurysm,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,83084,United States,2011,95595.04
11153,The cost effectiveness of licensed oromucosal midazolam (Buccolam((R))) for the treatment of children experiencing acute epileptic seizures: an approach when trial evidence is limited,"BACKGROUND: In the UK, two treatment options are used for acute epileptic seizures in the community-rectal diazepam and unlicensed buccal midazolam. In practice, the former is rarely used, with unlicensed buccal midazolam being widely recommended and prescribed by physicians. In September 2011, Buccolam((R)) (licensed midazolam oromucosal solution) became the first medicine to receive a Paediatric-Use Marketing Authorization (PUMA) and it is indicated for the treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures by caregivers in the community for children (aged 6 months to <18 years) diagnosed with epilepsy. The approval process for a PUMA product differs from other marketing authorization processes and may be based upon small population subsets and may not, in some cases, require new safety or efficacy data to be generated; a similar situation to that seen for orphan drugs. This can lead to challenges when conducting economic evaluations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of Buccolam((R)) for children with a diagnosis of epilepsy suffering prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures occurring in the UK community setting. DESIGN AND PERSPECTIVE: A hybrid model was developed according to a UK payer perspective. The model included a time-to-event simulation for the frequency and location of occurrence of seizures, along with a decision-tree model that assessed the treatment pathway when a seizure occured. The model compared treatment with Buccolam((R)) with standard care in the community (95 % unlicensed buccal midazolam and 5 % rectal diazepam) or either treatment alone. The model was informed by data from a variety of sources, including clinical effectiveness estimates, and costs based on published UK data, using 2012-13 prices, where possible. To determine current practice and real-world effectiveness, a Delphi panel and a survey of parents of children with epilepsy were conducted. RESULTS: Buccolam((R)) showed a reduction in costs of pound2,939 compared with standard care, pound14,269 compared with rectal diazepam alone and pound886 compared with unlicensed buccal midazolam alone. Increases of 0.025, 0.082 and 0.013 quality-adjusted life-years, respectively, were also seen. Buccolam((R)) remained dominant across a range of scenario analyses. CONCLUSION: This model demonstrates the possibility of constructing a thorough economic case when trial or real-world data are not available.

11156,The cost effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for generalized anxiety disorder,"BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders, with important implications for patients and healthcare resources. However, few economic evaluations of pharmacological treatments for GAD have been published to date, and those available have assessed only a limited number of drugs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for patients with GAD in the UK. METHODS: A decision-analytic model in the form of a decision tree was constructed to compare the costs and QALYs of six drugs used as first-line pharmacological treatments in people with GAD (duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline and venlafaxine extended release [XL]) and ''no pharmacological treatment''. The analysis adopted the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) in the UK. Efficacy data were derived from a systematic literature review of double-blind, randomized controlled trials and were synthesized using network meta-analytic techniques. Two network meta-analyses were undertaken to assess the comparative efficacy (expressed by response rates) and tolerability (expressed by rates of discontinuation due to intolerable side effects) of the six drugs and no treatment in the study population. Cost data were derived from published literature and national sources, supplemented by expert opinion. The price year was 2011. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the underlying uncertainty of the model input parameters. RESULTS: Sertraline was the best drug in limiting discontinuation due to side effects and the second best drug in achieving response in patients not discontinuing treatment due to side effects. It also resulted in the lowest costs and highest number of QALYs among all treatment options assessed.

11157,The cost effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for generalized anxiety disorder,"BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders, with important implications for patients and healthcare resources. However, few economic evaluations of pharmacological treatments for GAD have been published to date, and those available have assessed only a limited number of drugs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for patients with GAD in the UK. METHODS: A decision-analytic model in the form of a decision tree was constructed to compare the costs and QALYs of six drugs used as first-line pharmacological treatments in people with GAD (duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline and venlafaxine extended release [XL]) and ''no pharmacological treatment''. The analysis adopted the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) in the UK. Efficacy data were derived from a systematic literature review of double-blind, randomized controlled trials and were synthesized using network meta-analytic techniques. Two network meta-analyses were undertaken to assess the comparative efficacy (expressed by response rates) and tolerability (expressed by rates of discontinuation due to intolerable side effects) of the six drugs and no treatment in the study population. Cost data were derived from published literature and national sources, supplemented by expert opinion. The price year was 2011. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the underlying uncertainty of the model input parameters. RESULTS: Sertraline was the best drug in limiting discontinuation due to side effects and the second best drug in achieving response in patients not discontinuing treatment due to side effects.

11162,Cost-effectiveness analysis of 3-D computerized tomography colonography versus optical colonoscopy for imaging symptomatic gastroenterology patients,"BACKGROUND: When symptomatic gastroenterology patients have an indication for colonic imaging, clinicians have a choice between optical colonoscopy (OC) and computerized tomography colonography with three-dimensional reconstruction (3-D CTC). 3-D CTC provides a minimally invasive and rapid evaluation of the entire colon, and it can be an efficient modality for diagnosing symptoms. It allows for a more targeted use of OC, which is associated with a higher risk of major adverse events and higher procedural costs. A case can be made for 3-D CTC as a primary test for colonic imaging followed if necessary by targeted therapeutic OC; however, the relative long-term costs and benefits of introducing 3-D CTC as a first-line investigation are unknown. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 3-D CTC versus OC for colonic imaging of symptomatic gastroenterology patients in the UK NHS. METHODS: We used a Markov model to follow a cohort of 100,000 symptomatic gastroenterology patients, aged 50 years or older, and estimate the expected lifetime outcomes, life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs ( pound, 2010-2011) associated with 3-D CTC and OC. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the base-case cost-effectiveness results to variation in input parameters and methodological assumptions. RESULTS: 3D-CTC provided a similar number of LYs (7.737 vs 7.739) and QALYs (7.013 vs 7.018) per individual compared with OC, and it was associated with substantially lower mean costs per patient ( pound467 vs pound583), leading to a positive incremental net benefit. After accounting for the overall uncertainty, the probability of 3-D CTC being cost effective was around 60 %, at typical willingness-to-pay values of pound20,000- pound30,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: 3-D CTC is a cost-saving and cost-effective option for colonic imaging of symptomatic gastroenterology patients compared with OC.",2013-01-11054,23512599,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Manuel Gomes,2013,11 / 2,107-17,Yes,23512599,"Manuel Gomes; Robert W Aldridge; Peter Wylie; James Bell; Owen Epstein; Cost-effectiveness analysis of 3-D computerized tomography colonography versus optical colonoscopy for imaging symptomatic gastroenterology patients, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 11(2):1179-1896; 107-17",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,3-D Computerized Tomography Colonography vs. Optical Colonoscopy,Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,23200,United Kingdom,2011,42824.48
11163,Evolution of a cost-utility model of donepezil for Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the evolution of a cost-utility model used to inform the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence''s (NICE) most recent decisions on the cost-utility of drug treatments for Alzheimer''s disease (AD), and to explore the impact of structural assumptions on the cost-utility results. METHODS: Changes informed by noted limitations of the decision model used in NICE''s previous decisions (in 2006) were made cumulatively to the original decision model for donepezil compared with best supportive care (for patients with mild to moderate AD). Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were undertaken for each cumulative change of the model. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) of parameter estimates and structural assumptions was also calculated. RESULTS: Cumulative changes to the decision model highlighted how the results of the original model (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound81,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained) related to those of the new model (where donepezil was estimated to be cost-saving), mainly due to uncertainty in the incremental cost of donepezil treatment over best supportive care (ranging from - pound600 to pound3,000 per patient). The partial EVPI analysis reflected this finding where further information on treatment discontinuations and cost parameter estimates were shown to be valuable in terms of reducing decision uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the evolution of the cost-utility model helped to identify and explore structural differences between cohort-based models and is likely to be useful for decision models in other disease areas.

11164,"Accounting for costs, QALYs, and capacity constraints: using discrete-event simulation to evaluate alternative service delivery and organizational scenarios for hospital-based glaucoma services","BACKGROUND: Decision-analytic models are routinely used as a framework for cost-effectiveness analyses of health care services and technologies; however, these models mostly ignore resource constraints. In this study, we use a discrete-event simulation model to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative options for the organization and delivery of clinical services in the ophthalmology department of a public hospital. The model is novel, given that it represents both disease outcomes and resource constraints in a routine clinical setting. METHODS: A 5-year discrete-event simulation model representing glaucoma patient services at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) was implemented and calibrated to patient-level data. The data were sourced from routinely collected waiting and appointment lists, patient record data, and the published literature. Patient-level costs and quality-adjusted life years were estimated for a range of alternative scenarios, including combinations of alternate follow-up times, booking cycles, and treatment pathways. RESULTS: The model shows that a) extending booking cycle length from 4 to 6 months, b) extending follow-up visit times by 2 to 3 months, and c) using laser in preference to medication are more cost-effective than current practice at the RAH eye clinic. CONCLUSIONS: The current simulation model provides a useful tool for informing improvements in the organization and delivery of glaucoma services at a local level (e.g., within a hospital), on the basis of expected effects on costs and health outcomes while accounting for current capacity constraints. Our model may be adapted to represent glaucoma services at other hospitals, whereas the general modeling approach could be applied to many other clinical service areas.",2013-01-11058,23515216,Med Decis Making,Glenis J Crane,2013,33 / 8,,No,23515216,"Glenis J Crane; Steven M Kymes; Janet E Hiller; Robert Casson; Adam Martin; Jonathan D Karnon; Accounting for costs, QALYs, and capacity constraints: using discrete-event simulation to evaluate alternative service delivery and organizational scenarios for hospital-based glaucoma services, Med Decis Making, 2013 Nov; 33(8):0272-989X",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"6-month cycle laser first, medication, laser if non previous surgery vs. 6-month cycle laser as line 1 + 70/84 days to review",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,19866,Australia,2011,23617.33
11165,Cost-effectiveness of a specialized atrial fibrillation clinic vs. usual care in patients with atrial fibrillation,"AIMS: A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular hospitalizations and deaths with a nurse-led integrated chronic care approach in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) compared with usual care. The aim of the present study is to assess cost-effectiveness of this nurse-led care programme vs. usual care. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken alongside the randomized controlled trial in which 712 patients were included at the Maastricht University Medical Centre, The Netherlands, and allocated to nurse-led care or usual care. Nurse-led care implied guideline-adherent management, steered by dedicated software, supervised by cardiologists. Usual care was regular outpatient care performed by cardiologists. A cost per life-year and a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analysis was performed, both from a hospital perspective. The nurse-led care programme was associated with slightly more life-years and QALYs at a lower cost. Specifically, the nurse-led programme contributed to 0.009 QALY gains with a reduced cost of euro1109 per patient and a gain of 0.02 life-years with a reduced cost of euro735 per patient. Therefore, the nurse-led programme would be considered dominant. In fact, for all the possible values of willingness to pay for a QALY the nurse-led programme is considered to be more likely cost-effective than the care as usual. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness analysis in the present study demonstrated that a nurse-led integrated care approach will save costs and improve survival and quality of life, and is therefore a cost-effective management strategy for patients with AF.",2013-01-11059,23515338,Europace,Jeroen Hendriks,2013,15 / 8,1128-35,No,23515338,"Jeroen Hendriks; Florian Tomini; Thea van Asselt; Harry Crijns; Hubertus Vrijhoef; Cost-effectiveness of a specialized atrial fibrillation clinic vs. usual care in patients with atrial fibrillation, Europace, ; 15(8):1099-5129; 1128-35",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Inegrated chronic care programme consisting of a nurse-driven, guideline-based, software-supported AF-clinic based on the Chronic Care Model vs. Standard/Usual care (no chronic care programme)",Patients with atrial fibrillation reffered to a specialized a fib clinic,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-81555.56,Euro,2011,-130580.73

Here, cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy was assessed. A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression and calculate outcome and costs of treatment. In the baseline analysis, Peg-IFN/RBV treatment prevented organ loss/death, gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and undercut the limit of cost-effectiveness of euro50 000/QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately euro40 400/QALY and euro21 000/QALY for HCV genotype 1 and 2/3 patients, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis testing modified model parameters according to extreme data described in the literature confirmed cost-effectiveness for a lower or higher rate of fibrosis progression, increased non-HCV-related mortality, lower limits of utilities, a time horizon of 30 years, and additional costs in the year of death. On the other hand, cost-effectiveness was lost for patients with genotype 1 in case of doubled antiviral or life-time costs or an increased discount rate of 7%. New treatment strategies for HCV genotype 1 infected patients remained on the same level cost-effective, if additional costs did not exceed euro10 774 per 10% sustained virologic response gain.

11168,Cost-utility estimations of palliative care in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a retrospective analysis,"BACKGROUND: We earlier reported cost-utility estimates in patients who undergo resection aimed at cure for pancreatic carcinoma. The present study describes similar information on patients with unresectable tumors who experienced palliative care only. METHODS: A population-based cohort of patients with exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma during 1998-2005 was evaluated retrospectively (n = 444). Total direct health care costs at departments of surgery and oncology, for primary health care, and at hospice were achieved. Self-estimated health-related quality of life (HRQL) was assessed by the SF-36. A single preference-based utility index, SF-6D, was derived from SF-36 items to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were compared to similar findings in a previously reported group of patients with pancreatic carcinoma resected for cure (n = 31). RESULTS: Palliative care patients (n = 305) had impaired HRQL particularly related to physical domains. The mean preference-based health utility index at diagnosis was 0.65 +/- 0.02 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.69] compared to 0.77 +/- 0.02 (95 % CI 0.75-0.79) in healthy reference individuals. Total direct health care costs were 50 % in patients on palliative care compared to costs for surgical R0 resections (23,701 and 50,950<euro>, respectively).

11169,Cost-utility estimations of palliative care in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a retrospective analysis,"BACKGROUND: We earlier reported cost-utility estimates in patients who undergo resection aimed at cure for pancreatic carcinoma. The present study describes similar information on patients with unresectable tumors who experienced palliative care only. METHODS: A population-based cohort of patients with exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma during 1998-2005 was evaluated retrospectively (n = 444). Total direct health care costs at departments of surgery and oncology, for primary health care, and at hospice were achieved. Self-estimated health-related quality of life (HRQL) was assessed by the SF-36. A single preference-based utility index, SF-6D, was derived from SF-36 items to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were compared to similar findings in a previously reported group of patients with pancreatic carcinoma resected for cure (n = 31). RESULTS: Palliative care patients (n = 305) had impaired HRQL particularly related to physical domains. The mean preference-based health utility index at diagnosis was 0.65 +/- 0.02 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.69] compared to 0.77 +/- 0.02 (95 % CI 0.75-0.79) in healthy reference individuals. Total direct health care costs were 50 % in patients on palliative care compared to costs for surgical R0 resections (23,701 and 50,950<euro>, respectively). QALYs for 1 year from diagnosis were 0.2 (95 % CI 0.17-0.23) in patients on palliative care and 0.48 (95 % CI 0.44-0.54) in resection patients.

11170,"Cost effectiveness of telehealth for patients with long term conditions (Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth questionnaire study): nested economic evaluation in a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial","OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and cost effectiveness of telehealth in addition to standard support and treatment, compared with standard support and treatment. DESIGN: Economic evaluation nested in a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Community based telehealth intervention in three local authority areas in England. PARTICIPANTS: 3230 people with a long term condition (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes) were recruited into the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth trial between May 2008 and December 2009. Of participants taking part in the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth questionnaire study examining acceptability, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness, 845 were randomised to telehealth and 728 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention participants received a package of telehealth equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, in addition to the standard health and social care services available in their area. Controls received usual health and social care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome for the cost effectiveness analysis was incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: We undertook net benefit analyses of costs and outcomes for 965 patients (534 receiving telehealth; 431 usual care). The adjusted mean difference in QALY gain between groups at 12 months was 0.012. Total health and social care costs (including direct costs of the intervention) for the three months before 12 month interview were pound1390 (euro1610; $2150) and pound1596 for the usual care and telehealth groups, respectively. Cost effectiveness acceptability curves were generated to examine decision uncertainty in the analysis surrounding the value of the cost effectiveness threshold. The incremental cost per QALY of telehealth when added to usual care was pound92 000. With this amount, the probability of cost effectiveness was low (11% at willingness to pay threshold of pound30 000; >50% only if the threshold exceeded about pound90 000). In sensitivity analyses, telehealth costs remained slightly (non-significantly) higher than usual care costs, even after assuming that equipment prices fell by 80% or telehealth services operated at maximum capacity. However, the most optimistic scenario (combining reduced equipment prices with maximum operating capacity) eliminated this group difference (cost effectiveness ratio pound12 000 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: The QALY gain by patients using telehealth in addition to usual care was similar to that by patients receiving usual care only, and total costs associated with the telehealth intervention were higher. Telehealth does not seem to be a cost effective addition to standard support and treatment.

11171,A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of erlotinib alone versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as first-line therapy for Eastern Asian nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer, the most prevalent malignant cancer in the world, remains a serious threat to public health. Recently, a large number of studies have shown that an epidermoid growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI), Erlotinib, has significantly better efficacy and is better tolerated in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a positive EGFR gene mutation. However, access to this drug is severely limited in China due to its high acquisition cost. Therefore, we decided to conduct a study to compare cost-effectiveness between erlotinib monotherapy and carboplatin-gemcitabine (CG) combination therapy in patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. METHODS: A Markov model was developed from the perspective of the Chinese health care system to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two treatment strategies; this model was based on data from the OPTIMAL trial, which was undertaken at 22 centres in China. The 10-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated. To allow for uncertainties within the parameters and to estimate the model robustness, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival (PFS) obtained from Markov model was 13.2 months (13.1 months was reported in the trial) in the erlotinib group while and 4.64 months (4.6 months was reported in the trial) in the CG group. The QALYs were 1.4 years in the erlotinib group and 1.96 years in the CG group, indicating difference of 0.56 years. The ICER was most sensitive to the health utility of DP ranged from $58,584.57 to $336,404.2. At a threshold of $96,884, erlotinib had a 50% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib monotherapy is more cost-effective compared with platinum-based doublets chemotherapy as a first-line therapy for advanced EGFR mutation- positive NSCLC patients from within the Chinese health care system.",2013-01-11070,23520448,PLoS One,Siying Wang,2013,8 / 3,e55917,No,23520448,"Siying Wang; Liubao Peng; Jianhe Li; Xiaohui Zeng; Lihui Ouyang; Chongqing Tan; Qiong Lu; A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of erlotinib alone versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as first-line therapy for Eastern Asian nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer, PLoS One , ; 8(3):1932-6203; e55917",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Erlotinib monotherapy vs. Carboplatin-gemcitabine (CG) combination,We assumed a 59- year-old patient with an average weight of 65 kg and a 1.72 m2 body surface area,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,85927.41,United States,2010,101987.37

11175,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA for neurogenic detrusor overactivity in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence (UI) secondary to a neurogenic pathology, including spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, is termed neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). Patients with NDO experience decreased quality of life and are at risk for upper urinary tract damage. Two recent trials demonstrated that onabotulinumtoxinA significantly reduced UI, improved urodynamic parameters, and improved quality of life relative to placebo. However, the economic impact of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for UI due to NDO in the United States remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether the benefit observed in NDO patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA provides good value for money. METHODS: We developed a Markov state transition model to estimate population outcomes and costs for anticholinergic-refractory NDO patients who received either onabotulinumtoxinA or best supportive care (use of incontinence pads with either an anticholinergic drug, clean intermittent self-catheterization, or both). Nonresponding patients (<50% reduction in UI episodes at 6 weeks) were eligible to receive invasive procedures, including augmentation cystoplasty or sacral neuromodulation. Patients could transition through 6 health states, 3 defined based on response to initial treatment, 2 capturing patients who underwent invasive procedures, and death. Time in each health state was adjusted for patient quality of life and summed to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model included direct medical costs related to initial and subsequent drug and invasive treatments, physician visits, and catheterization. Outcomes and costs were summed and compared across intervention groups by using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost per QALY). The time horizon of the model was 3 years, and results were discounted at 3%. Scenario, 1-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: In the base case, onabotulinumtoxinA increased QALYs by 0.059 and costs by $1466 compared with best supportive care, which resulted in an estimated ICER of $24,720/QALY. OnabotulinumtoxinA also decreased mean UI episodes per person-year by 398, resulting in a cost of $4 per UI episode avoided. Model results were most sensitive to the probability of treatment response. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that at a willingness to pay of $50,000/QALY, onabotulinumtoxinA has a 97% probability of being cost-effective. In subgroup analyses of each etiology, onabotulinumtoxinA yielded an ICER of $32,268/QALY in multiple sclerosis and $2182 in spinal cord injury.

11176,To sling or not to sling at time of abdominal sacrocolpopexy: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: We compare the cost-effectiveness of 3 strategies for the use of a mid urethral sling to prevent occult stress urinary incontinence in patients undergoing abdominal sacrocolpopexy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using decision analysis modeling we compared cost-effectiveness during a 1-year postoperative period of 3 treatment approaches including 1) abdominal sacrocolpopexy alone with deferred option for mid urethral sling, 2) abdominal sacrocolpopexy with universal concomitant mid urethral sling and 3) preoperative urodynamic study for selective mid urethral sling. Using published data we modeled probabilities of stress urinary incontinence after abdominal sacrocolpopexy with or without mid urethral sling, the predictive value of urodynamic study to detect occult stress urinary incontinence and the likelihood of complications after mid urethral sling. Costs were derived from Medicare 2010 reimbursement rates. The main outcome modeled was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality adjusted life-years gained. In addition to base case analysis, 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In our model, universally performing mid urethral sling at abdominal sacrocolpopexy was the most cost-effective approach with an incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year gained of $2,867 compared to abdominal sacrocolpopexy alone. Preoperative urodynamic study was more costly and less effective than universally performing intraoperative mid urethral sling. The cost-effectiveness of abdominal sacrocolpopexy plus mid urethral sling was robust to sensitivity analysis with a cost-effectiveness ratio consistently below $20,000 per quality adjusted life-year.

11178,Cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgical procedures for the treatment of severe obesity,"OBJECTIVE: One-third of Americans are obese and an increasing number opt for bariatric surgery. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of common bariatric surgical procedures from a healthcare system perspective. METHODS: We evaluated the three most common bariatric surgical procedures in the US: laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB), conventional (open) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (ORYGB), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) compared to no surgery. The reference case was defined as a 53-year old female with body mass index (BMI) of 44 kg/m(2).

11181,Cost-effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV-1 infections in rural Zambia: a modeling study,"BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir and emtricitabine effectively prevents new HIV infections. The optimal scenario for implementing PrEP where most infections are averted at the lowest cost is unknown. We determined the impact of different PrEP strategies on averting new infections, prevalence, drug resistance and cost-effectiveness in Macha, a rural setting in Zambia. METHODS: A deterministic mathematical model of HIV transmission was constructed using data from the Macha epidemic (antenatal prevalence 7.7%). Antiretroviral therapy is started at CD4<350 cells/mm(3). We compared the number of infections averted, cost-effectiveness, and potential emergence of drug resistance of two ends of the prioritization spectrum: prioritizing PrEP to half of the most sexually active individuals (5-15% of the total population), versus randomly putting 40-60% of the total population on PrEP. RESULTS: Prioritizing PrEP to individuals with the highest sexual activity resulted in more infections averted than a non-prioritized strategy over ten years (31% and 23% reduction in new infections respectively), and also a lower HIV prevalence after ten years (5.7%, 6.4% respectively). The strategy was very cost-effective at $323 per quality adjusted life year gained and appeared to be both less costly and more effective than the non-prioritized strategy. The prevalence of drug resistance due to PrEP was as high as 11.6% when all assumed breakthrough infections resulted in resistance, and as low as 1.3% when 10% of breakthrough infections resulted in resistance in both our prioritized and non-prioritized scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Even in settings with low test rates and treatment retention, the use of PrEP can still be a useful strategy in averting infections. Our model has shown that PrEP is a cost-effective strategy for reducing HIV incidence, even when adherence is suboptimal and prioritization is imperfect.",2013-01-11086,23527217,PLoS One,Brooke E Nichols,2013,8 / 3,e59549,No,23527217,"Brooke E Nichols; Charles A B Boucher; Janneke H van Dijk; Phil E Thuma; Jan L Nouwen; Rob Baltussen; Janneke van de Wijgert; Peter M A Sloot; David A M C van de Vijver; Cost-effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV-1 infections in rural Zambia: a modeling study, PLoS One , ; 8(3):1932-6203; e59549",QALY,Zambia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Prioritized pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV-1 infections to most sexually active vs. Non-prioritized PrEP, PrEP randomly distributed",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-1771.45,United States,2011,-2038.2

However, there are effective treatments available. In the UK, long-acting bronchodilators are first-line treatments for COPD patients requiring maintenance therapy, and there are several options available. The aim of this study is to establish, from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective, the cost-effectiveness profile of indacaterol, the first once-daily long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), compared with tiotropium and salmeterol, in patients with moderate to severe COPD. In assessing the cost-effectiveness of COPD therapies, this study has the advantage of using real world evidence on the resource use associated with COPD management across the spectrum of the disease. METHODS: A Markov model was developed with four health states following the GOLD classification for severity of airflow limitation. The model time horizon was 3 years, and the cycle length was 3 months. From each state, patients could experience a severe or non-severe exacerbation, move to a different COPD state, remain in the current state or die. Transition probabilities were based on data from the indacaterol clinical trials. The majority of the resource use data was taken from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD), which contains data from over 20,000 COPD patients in England and Scotland. Cost data were taken from UK-based sources and published literature and presented for the cost year 2011. Health-related quality of life was the main outcome of interest and utility data for the COPD states were based on data from the indacaterol clinical trials and disutility due to exacerbations were taken from the literature. Both one way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Indacaterol dominated in the comparison with salmeterol producing an incremental QALY gain of 0.008 and cost savings of pound110 per patient over a 3-year time horizon. In the comparison with tiotropium over the same time horizon, indacaterol remained the dominant strategy, producing an incremental QALY gain of 0.008 and cost savings of pound248 per patient. The one-way sensitivity analysis indicates that the proportion of patients in each of the COPD stages and the mortality rate associated with Very Severe COPD are the variables with the largest impact on the results. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that over 72 % and 89 % of the iterations when compared with salmeterol and tiotropium, respectively, produced dominant results for indacaterol.

11186,Routine on-site evaluation of specimen adequacy during initial ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of thyroid nodules: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: On-site evaluation (OSE) of specimen adequacy during fine needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules reduces unsatisfactory results but adds cost. We hypothesized that the addition of routine OSE to initial ultrasound-guided FNA of thyroid nodules is not cost-effective. METHODS: Formal cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a decision model to compare strategies of routine initial OSE versus restriction of OSE to cases of prior inadequate FNA. Adequacy rates for FNA without OSE and detriment to quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for undergoing repeat FNA were estimated on the basis of literature review and institutional experience. Costs were estimated using Medicare limiting charges and Bureau of Labor Statistics wage rates. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine the uncertainty of the model variable estimates. RESULTS: The routine OSE strategy produced a gain of 0.00007 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an additional cost of $43.75 for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $639,143/QALY when compared to restriction of OSE to cases with prior inadequate results. During sensitivity analysis, routine OSE became cost-effective if FNA adequacy rate without OSE decreased from 90 to 85 %, cost of OSE decreased from $116 to $75, cost of FNA increased from $366 to $735, hourly wage increased from $23 to $123, or QALE detriment for repeat FNA increased from 0.25 to 1.6 days. CONCLUSIONS: OSE for initial ultrasound-guided FNA of thyroid nodules is not cost-effective unless the adequacy rate without OSE is less than 85 %.

11187,Economic evaluation of 5-grass pollen tablets versus placebo in the treatment of allergic rhinitis in adults,"BACKGROUND: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is aimed at modifying the immune response to a causative allergen, thereby reducing clinical symptoms and symptomatic medication intake and improving quality of life. Long-term AIT research has led to the development of 5-grass pollen tablets, currently indicated for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis (AR). METHODS: A post-hoc analysis was conducted using the Average Adjusted Symptom Score (AAdSS) to compare the effect of treatment of AR with 5-grass pollen tablets versus placebo treatment. Using the results of the VO34.04 and VO53.06 trials and economic data, cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was performed from the Italian third-party payer perspective with cost data derived from a study of 2008 updated to 2011. Also a societal perspective was considered by using the costs related to the losses of productivity by following the human capital approach. Using the results of the analysis, the estimated receiver-operating characteristic curve was plotted to evaluate medication effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a decision tree constructed to model the possible outcomes and costs for adults and paediatric patients with a low, medium, and high AAdSS. Finally, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the results as well as their consistency at an assumed cost-effectiveness threshold of euro 30,000/QALY. RESULTS: The results indicate that compared to the placebo, the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment provides a benefit of 0.127 QALYs in medium AAdSS patients and of 0.143 QALYs in high AAdSS patients. The 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was found to cost euro 1,024/QALY for patients with a medium AAdSS and euro 1,035/QALY for patients with a high AAdSS. Of all the simulations performed in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99 % indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was below the threshold of euro 30,000/QALY in patients with medium and high AAdSS, whereas it was found to be dominated in 67 % of simulations related to patients with low AAdSS.

11190,Cost-effectiveness analysis of risk-factor guided and birth-cohort screening for chronic hepatitis C infection in the United States,"BACKGROUND: No consensus exists on screening to detect the estimated 2 million Americans unaware of their chronic hepatitis C infections. Advisory groups differ, recommending birth-cohort screening for baby boomers, screening only high-risk individuals, or no screening. We assessed one-time risk assessment and screening to identify previously undiagnosed 40-74 year-olds given newly available hepatitis C treatments. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A Markov model evaluated alternative risk-factor guided and birth-cohort screening and treatment strategies. Risk factors included drug use history, blood transfusion before 1992, and multiple sexual partners. Analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided sex-, race-, age-, and risk-factor-specific hepatitis C prevalence and mortality rates. Nine strategies combined screening (no screening, risk-factor guided screening, or birth-cohort screening) and treatment (standard therapy-peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, Interleukin-28B-guided (IL28B) triple-therapy-standard therapy plus a protease inhibitor, or universal triple therapy). Response-guided treatment depended on HCV genotype. Outcomes include discounted lifetime costs (2010 dollars) and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). Compared to no screening, risk-factor guided and birth-cohort screening for 50 year-olds gained 0.7 to 3.5 quality adjusted life-days and cost $168 to $568 per person. Birth-cohort screening provided more benefit per dollar than risk-factor guided screening and cost $65,749 per QALY if followed by universal triple therapy compared to screening followed by IL28B-guided triple therapy.

11198,Lifetime costs and outcomes of repair of Tetralogy of Fallot compared to natural progression of the disease: Great Ormond Street Hospital cohort,"BACKGROUND: Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease that requires surgical repair without which survival through childhood is extremely rare. The aim of this paper is to use data from the mandatory follow-up of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot to model the health-related costs and outcomes over the first 55-years of life. METHOD: A decision analytical model was developed to establish costs and outcomes for patients up to 55 years after diagnosis and first repair of Tetralogy of Fallot compared to natural progression. Data from Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) centres that follow up Tetralogy of Fallot patients and Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London, United Kingdom (UK) medical records was used to establish the cost and effectiveness of current interventions. Data from a Czech cohort was used for the natural, no intervention condition. RESULTS: The average cost per patient of a repair for Tetralogy of Fallot was pound26,938 (SE = pound4,140). The full life time cost per patient, with no discount rate, was pound65,310 (95% CI pound64,981- pound65,729); pound56,559 discounted (95% CI pound56,159- pound56,960). Patients with a repair had an average of 35 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) per patient over 55 years undiscounted and 20.16 QALYs discounted. If the disorder was left to take its natural course, patients on average had a total of 3 QALYs per patient with no discount rate and 2.30 QALYs discounted. CONCLUSION: A model has been developed that provides an estimate of the value for money of an expensive repair of a congenital heart disease.

11199,Treatment for life for severe haemophilia A- A cost-utility model for prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment,"Prophylaxis has been established as the treatment of choice in children with haemophilia and its continuation into the adult years has been shown to decrease morbidity throughout life. The cost of factor therapy has made the option questionable in cost-effectiveness studies. The role of prophylaxis in pharmacokinetic dosage and tolerization against inhibitor formation were used to model the cost utility of prophylaxis vs. on-demand (OD) therapy over a lifetime horizon in severe haemophilia A. The model was applied to a single provider national health system exemplified by the United Kingdom''s National Health Service and a third party provider in the United States. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and compared to threshold values used by payer agencies to guide reimbursement decisions. A cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was also estimated for Sweden. Prophylaxis was dominant over OD treatment in the UK. The model resulted in an ICER - $68 000 - within the range of treatments reimbursed in the USA. In Sweden, a cost/QALY of SEK 1.1 million was also within the range of reimbursed treatments in that country.
