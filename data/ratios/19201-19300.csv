19201,Is Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in Canadian Family Practices Cost-Effective in Patients 65 Years and Older?,"We present an economic evaluation of a recently completed cohort study in which 2054 seniors were screened for atrial fibrillation (AF) in 22 Canadian family practices. Using a Markov model, trial and literature data were used to project long-term outcomes and costs associated with 4 AF screening strategies for individuals aged 65 years or older: no screening, screen with 30-second radial manual pulse check (pulse check), screen with a blood pressure machine with AF detection (BP-AF), and screen with a single-lead electrocardiogram (SL-ECG). Costs and outcomes were discounted at 1.5% and the model used a lifetime horizon from a public payer perspective. Compared with no screening, screening for AF in Canadian family practice offices using pulse check or screen with a blood pressure machine with AF detection is the dominant strategy whereas screening with SL-ECG is a highly cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of CAD$4788. When different screening strategies were compared, screening with pulse check had the lowest expected costs ($202) and screening with SL-ECG had the highest expected costs ($222). The no-screening arm resulted in the lowest number of QALYs (8.74195) whereas pulse check and SL-ECG resulted in the highest expected QALYs (8.74362). Probabilistic analysis confirmed that pulse check had the highest probability of being cost-effective (63%) assuming a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY gained. Screening for AF in seniors during routine appointments with Canadian family physicians is a cost-effective strategy compared with no screening. Screening with a pulse check is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.",2018-01-26397,30144961,Can J Cardiol,Jean-Eric Tarride,2018,/,,No,30144961,"Jean-Eric Tarride; F Russell Quinn; Gord Blackhouse; Roopinder K Sandhu; Natasha Burke; David J Gladstone; Noah M Ivers; Lisa Dolovich; Andrea Thornton; Juliet Nakamya; Chinthanie Ramasundarahettige; Paul A Frydrych; Sam Henein; Ken Ng; Valerie Congdon; Richard V Birtwhistle; Richard Ward; Jeffrey S Healey; Is Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in Canadian Family Practices Cost-Effective in Patients 65 Years and Older?, Can J Cardiol, 2018 Jun 21; ():0828-282X",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Screening,Screen with single-lead electrocardiogram vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,4788,Canada,2016,3902.34
19202,Cost-effectiveness analysis of erenumab for the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine: Results from the US societal and payer perspectives,"Objectives To assess the cost-effectiveness of erenumab 140 mg (""erenumab"") for the prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine and chronic migraine. Study design A hybrid Monte Carlo patient simulation and Markov cohort model was constructed to compare erenumab to no preventive treatment or onabotulinumtoxinA among adult ( >/= 18 years) patients with episodic migraine and chronic migraine who failed prior preventive therapy from the US societal and payer perspectives. Methods Patients entered the model one at a time and were assigned to a post-treatment monthly migraine day category based on baseline monthly migraine days and treatment effect. Using monthly cycles, patients were followed for 2 years and accumulated costs and utilities associated with their post-treatment monthly migraine days. The primary outcome included the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Results With an annual drug price of erenumab of $6900, treatment with erenumab in the societal perspective ranges from a dominant strategy versus no preventive treatment among chronic migraine patients to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $122,167 versus no preventive treatment among episodic migraine patients. When excluding indirect costs (i.e. payer perspective), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are cost-effective among chronic migraine patients ($23,079 and $65,720 versus no preventive treatment and onabotulinumtoxinA, respectively), but not among episodic migraine patients ($180,012 versus no preventive treatment). Model results were sensitive to changes in monthly migraine days, health utilities, and treatment costs. Conclusion The use of erenumab may be a cost-effective approach to preventing monthly migraine days among patients with chronic migraine versus onabotulinumtoxinA and no preventive treatment in the societal and payer perspectives, but is less likely to offer good value for money for those with episodic migraine, unless lost productivity costs are considered.",2018-01-26404,30142988,Cephalalgia,Matthew Sussman,2018,/,333102418796842,No,30142988,"Matthew Sussman; Jennifer Benner; Peter Neumann; Joseph Menzin; Cost-effectiveness analysis of erenumab for the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine: Results from the US societal and payer perspectives, Cephalalgia, 2018 Aug 24; ():0333-1024; 333102418796842",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Prophylactic erenumab vs. No preventive treatment,Patients failed prior preventive therapy for episodic migraine,18 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,122167,United States,2017,128990.55

19205,Disease-Modifying Therapies for Relapsing-Remitting and Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Few comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses exist in this area, particularly from a payer perspective, despite rapidly increasing prices of DMTs. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically compare cost effectiveness of all relevant DMTs for first-line treatment of RRMS, second-line treatment of RRMS, and first-line treatment of PPMS. METHODS: We used a Markov model with health states based on Expanded Disability Status Score categories. Upon discontinuing first-line treatment, RRMS patients continued to second-line therapy then to supportive care, and PPMS patients moved directly to supportive care. Data was sourced from clinical trials and commercially and publicly available sources. The target population was treatment-naive adults with RRMS or PPMS. We used a lifetime horizon from a US payer perspective, and compared DMTs for RRMS (first-line: dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, peginterferon beta-1a, teriflunomide, natalizumab, fingolimod, and ocrelizumab; second-line: alemtuzumab, natalizumab, fingolimod, and ocrelizumab), ocrelizumab for PPMS, and supportive care. Outcome measures included total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: For RRMS first-line therapy, ocrelizumab dominated the other DMTs with an ICER of US$166,338/QALY compared with supportive care. For RRMS second-line therapy, alemtuzumab dominated the other three DMTs, providing more QALYs for lower costs. For PPMS, ocrelizumab had an ICER of US$648,799/QALY compared with supportive care. Wide variability in results was observed in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results were sensitive to the relative risk of progression and cost of DMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Ocrelizumab would likely be cost effective as a first-line treatment for RRMS with a discounted price but was not cost effective for PPMS. Alemtuzumab dominated other options for second-line treatment of RRMS. Other DMTs were generally similar in terms of costs and health outcomes, providing health benefits compared to supportive care but with significant added costs.

19207,Cost-effectiveness of Transplanting HCV-Infected Livers into Uninfected Recipients with Preemptive Antiviral Therapy,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines do not recommend transplanting hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected livers into HCV-uninfected recipients. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) can be used to treat donor-derived HCV infection. However the added cost of DAA therapy is a barrier. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of transplanting HCV-positive livers into HCV-negative patients with preemptive DAA therapy. METHODS: A previously validated Markov-based mathematical model was adapted to simulate a virtual trial of HCV-negative patients on the liver transplant waitlist. The model compared long-term clinical and economic outcomes in patients willing to accept only HCV-negative livers vs those willing to accept any (HCV-negative or HCV-positive) liver. Recipients of HCV-positive livers received 12 weeks of preemptive DAA therapy. The model incorporated data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and published sources. RESULTS: For patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score >/= 22, accepting any liver vs waiting for only HCV-negative livers was cost effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $56,100 to $91,700/quality-adjusted life year. For patients with a MELD score of 28 (the median MELD score of patients undergoing transplantation in the United States), accepting any liver was cost effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $62,600/quality-adjusted life year.

METHODS: A previously validated Markov-based mathematical model was adapted to simulate a virtual trial of HCV-negative patients on the liver transplant waitlist. The model compared long-term clinical and economic outcomes in patients willing to accept only HCV-negative livers vs those willing to accept any (HCV-negative or HCV-positive) liver. Recipients of HCV-positive livers received 12 weeks of preemptive DAA therapy. The model incorporated data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and published sources. RESULTS: For patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score >/= 22, accepting any liver vs waiting for only HCV-negative livers was cost effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $56,100 to $91,700/quality-adjusted life year. For patients with a MELD score of 28 (the median MELD score of patients undergoing transplantation in the United States), accepting any liver was cost effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $62,600/quality-adjusted life year. In patients with low MELD scores that may not accurately reflect disease severity, accepting any liver was cost effective, irrespective of MELD score.

19222,An early analysis of the cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic classifier for risk stratification of haematuria patients (DCRSHP) compared to flexible cystoscopy in the diagnosis of bladder cancer,"BACKGROUND: Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is the 5th most common cancer in Western societies. The most common symptom of UBC is haematuria. Cystoscopy the gold standard for UBC detection, allows direct observation of the bladder, but is expensive, invasive, and uncomfortable. This study examines whether an alternative new urine-based diagnostic test, the DCRSHP, is cost-effective as a triage diagnostic tool compared to flexible cystoscopy in the diagnosis of UBC in haematuria patients. METHODS: A model-based cost-utility analysis using cost per quality adjusted life year and life year gained, parameterised with secondary data sources. RESULTS: If the DCRSHP is targeted at haematuria patients at lower risk of having bladder cancer e.g. younger patients, non-smokers, then it can be priced as high as pound620, and be both effective and cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis found that DCRSHP is approximately 80% likely to be cost-effective across all willingness to pay values (for a QALY) and prevalence estimates. CONCLUSION: This analysis shows the potential for a non-invasive test to be added to the diagnostic pathway for haematuria patients suspected of having UBC. If the DCRSHP is applied targeting haematuria patients at low risk of UBC, then it has the potential to be both effective and cost-effective.",2018-01-26417,30138462,PLoS One,Andrew J Sutton,2018,13 / 8,e0202796,No,30138462,"Andrew J Sutton; John V Lamont; R Mark Evans; Kate Williamson; Declan O'Rourke; Brian Duggan; Gurdeep S Sagoo; Cherith N Reid; Mark W Ruddock; An early analysis of the cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic classifier for risk stratification of haematuria patients (DCRSHP) compared to flexible cystoscopy in the diagnosis of bladder cancer, PLoS One , 2018; 13(8):1932-6203; e0202796",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Diagnostic,Diagnostic classifier for risk stratification of haematuria patients (DCRSHP) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Diagnostic procedure with cystoscopy,Patients presenting with blood in urine,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,7400,United Kingdom,2014,13335.89
19223,Cost-effectiveness of the recombinant zoster vaccine in the German population aged >/=60 years old,"Each year, around 300,000 Herpes Zoster (HZ) cases are observed in the German population, resulting in costs over euro182 million to society. The objective of this study was to estimate the potential public health and economic impact of the new Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) in the German population >/= 60 years of age (YOA) and to identify the optimal age of vaccination. We used a static, multi-cohort Markov model that followed a hypothetical cohort of 1 million people >/= 60 YOA life-long after vaccination using German-specific inputs. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on the societal perspective. The coverage of RZV was set at 40% with a second-dose compliance of 70%. Vaccinating the population aged >/= 60 YOA would result in 45,000 HZ cases avoided, 1,713 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at a total cost of approximately euro63 million compared to 38,000 cases avoided, 1,545 QALYs gained at a total cost of approximately euro68 million in the population >/= 70 YOA.

19224,Cost-effectiveness of the recombinant zoster vaccine in the German population aged >/=60 years old,"Each year, around 300,000 Herpes Zoster (HZ) cases are observed in the German population, resulting in costs over euro182 million to society. The objective of this study was to estimate the potential public health and economic impact of the new Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) in the German population >/= 60 years of age (YOA) and to identify the optimal age of vaccination. We used a static, multi-cohort Markov model that followed a hypothetical cohort of 1 million people >/= 60 YOA life-long after vaccination using German-specific inputs. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on the societal perspective. The coverage of RZV was set at 40% with a second-dose compliance of 70%. Vaccinating the population aged >/= 60 YOA would result in 45,000 HZ cases avoided, 1,713 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at a total cost of approximately euro63 million compared to 38,000 cases avoided, 1,545 QALYs gained at a total cost of approximately euro68 million in the population >/= 70 YOA.

19225,Patellar Resurfacing in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of patellar resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model representing a hypothetical TKA cohort, with or without patellar resurfacing, using data from the 2014 Australian Registry. The model represents 3 possible postoperative health states: (1) well, (2) patellofemoral pain, or (3) serious adverse event (any event resulting in a revision). Our effectiveness outcome was the quality-adjusted life year, from published utility scores. We estimated cost-effectiveness from a Canadian public healthcare payer perspective. Costs and quality of life were valued in 2015 United States dollars and discounted annually at 5%. RESULTS: Our results suggest that TKA with resurfacing is cost-effective compared to nonresurfacing. Unresurfacing the patellae resulted in higher costs ($13,296.63 vs $12,917.01) and lower quality-adjusted life year (5.37 vs 6.01) at 14 years. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if rates of secondary resurfacing are <0.5%, there was no cost difference. CONCLUSION: Over 14 years postoperative, patellar resurfacing appears to be cost-effective, due to higher revision rates for unresurfaced TKA. Although our results suggest resurfacing improves quality of life, our model is limited by the availability and validity of long-term utility outcomes reported for TKA.

19226,Should NICE reconsider the 2016 UK guidelines on TB contact tracing? A cost-effectiveness analysis of contact investigations in London,"BACKGROUND: In January 2016, clinical TB guidance in the UK changed to no longer recommend screening contacts of non-pulmonary, non-laryngeal (ETB) index cases. However, no new evidence was cited for this change, and there is evidence that screening these contacts may be worthwhile. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening contacts of adult ETB cases and adult pulmonary or laryngeal TB (PTB) cases in London, UK. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional analysis of data collected on TB index cases and contacts in the London TB register and an economic evaluation using a static model describing contact tracing outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using no screening as the baseline comparator.

19232,Screening fathers for postpartum depression can be cost-effective: An example from Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression negatively affects the whole family and its prevalence in Sweden ranges between 6-10% for fathers and 13-16% for mothers. However, only mothers in Sweden are currently routinely screened. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if a postpartum depression screening for fathers in Stockholm County could be cost-effective. METHODS: National Swedish databases were used to find registry data and a literature review was undertaken to identify the model data inputs associated with postpartum depression in Sweden. The generated evidence was used to build a Markov model in TreeAge. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for parameter uncertainties. Alternative scenario analyses were further undertaken to test the assumptions in the base case analysis. RESULTS: A postpartum screening for depression in fathers is cost-effective in base case and alternative scenarios. The results indicate that the screening program is associated with lower costs and higher health effects. The results were sensitive to variables of quality adjusted life years for the depressed fathers, probabilities of remission in treatment and no treatment groups and start age and productivity losses. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in a 70% probability of the postnatal depression screening intervention being cost-effective. LIMITATIONS: The current study only uses secondary data; therefore future research should assess the cost-effectiveness of screening fathers for depression.

Observational studies have demonstrated a benefit from closure of PFO and several RCTs have shown a trend toward benefit. The cost and clinical effectiveness of PFO closure is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched for RCTs of PFO closure in patients with cryptogenic stroke and performed a detailed cost analysis and meta-analysis of treatment outcomes based on the results of the meta-analysis. Five RCTs containing 3404 patients with cryptogenic stroke were included. Of these 1829 underwent PFO closure and 1611 received medical therapy. Mean follow-up was 4.0years. PFO closure achieved cost effectiveness (<$50,000/Quality-adjusted life-year gained) 2.7years (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.2-3.4) after closure. The incremental cost to prevent one combined end point (CEP, combined transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, and death) by PFO closure was $535,655(95% CI $458,329-$642,674). After 55.4years (95%CI 51.1-60.5) of follow-up, the per patient total cost of medical therapy exceeded that of PFO closure. PFO closure demonstrated clinical efficacy with a decreased risk of CEP (pooled hazard ratio (HR=0.43(95%CI 0.27-0.59))) and a decreased risk of stroke (HR=0.29(95%CI 0.02-0.57)).

METHODS: We designed a Markov model to compare four health states following treatment with either PVP or M-TURP to estimate expected costs and outcomes. We used the results of the only randomized clinical trial published to date comparing PVP versus M-TURP to estimate surgical outcomes, complications, re-operation and re-intervention rates. Time horizon was defined at 2 years with four cycles of 6 months each. Resource-use estimation involved a random selection of clinical records from a local institution and cost list from public healthcare system. Costs were obtained in Colombian pesos and converted to US dollars. Threshold was defined at three-times the Colombian gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) were used based on the utilities of the available literature. Uncertainty was analyzed with deterministic and probabilistic models using a Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Patients who underwent PVP gained 1.81 QALYs compared to 1.59 with M-TURP. Costs were US$6797.98 and US$7777.59 for M-TURP and PVP, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$4452.81 per QALY, favoring PVP as a cost-effective alternative in our context.

Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with increased discounted life expectancy by 0.02 years and increased discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.22 quality-adjusted life years compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. Evaluation of direct medical costs suggested that the mean cost per patient with IDegLira was $3,571 lower than with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. The cost saving was driven predominantly by the lower acquisition cost of IDegLira compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart, with further cost savings identified as a result of avoided treatment of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with improved clinical outcomes at a reduced cost compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. CONCLUSIONS: Based on clinical trial data, the present analysis suggests that IDegLira is associated with improved clinical outcomes and cost savings compared with treatment with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US. Therefore, IDegLira is likely to be considered dominant (cost saving and more effective) and, consequently, highly cost-effective in the US setting.",2018-01-26473,30114954,J Med Econ,Michael Dempsey,2018,/,1-9,Yes,30114954,"Michael Dempsey; Michelle Mocarski; Jakob Langer; Barnaby Hunt; Long-term cost-effectiveness analysis shows that IDegLira is associated with improved outcomes and lower costs compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart in the US, J Med Econ, 2018 Jan 29; ():1369-6998; 1-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,IDegLira with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart vs. Standard/Usual Care- Insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart,Patients not meeting glycemic targets on basal insulin,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 10 years, 20 years",3.00,3.00,-16231.8,United States,2017,-17138.42
19236,Cost-effectiveness of everolimus-eluting versus bare-metal stents in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: An analysis from the EXAMINATION randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Use of everolimus-eluting stents (EES) has proven to be clinically effective and safe in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction but it remains unclear whether it is cost-effective compared to bare-metal stents (BMS) in the long-term. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of EES versus BMS based on the 5-year results of the EXAMINATION trial, from a Spanish health service perspective. METHODS: Decision analysis of the use of EES versus BMS was based on the patient-level clinical outcome data of the EXAMINATION trial. The analysis adopted a lifelong time horizon, assuming that long-term survival was independent of the initial treatment strategy after the end of follow-up. Life-expectancy, health-state utility scores and unit costs were extracted from published literature and publicly available sources. Non-parametric bootstrapping was combined with probabilistic sensitivity analysis to co-assess the impact of patient-level variation and parameter uncertainty. The main outcomes were total costs and quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Costs and effects were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: The model predicted an average survival time in patients receiving EES and BMS of 10.52 and 10.38 undiscounted years, respectively. Over the life-long time horizon, the EES strategy was euro430 more costly than BMS (euro8,305 vs. euro7,874), but went along with incremental gains of 0.10 quality-adjusted life-years. This resulted in an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over all simulations of euro3,948 per quality-adjusted life-years gained and was below a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro25,000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained in 86.9% of simulation runs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher total costs relative to BMS, EES appeared to be a cost-effective therapy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients due to their incremental effectiveness. Predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below generally acceptable threshold values.",2018-01-26475,30114230,PLoS One,Nadine Schur,2018,13 / 8,e0201985,No,30114230,"Nadine Schur; Salvatore Brugaletta; Angel Cequier; Andres Iniguez; Antonio Serra; Pilar Jimenez-Quevedo; Vicente Mainar; Gianluca Campo; Maurizio Tespili; Peter den Heijer; Armando Bethencourt; Nicolas Vazquez; Marco Valgimigli; Patrick W Serruys; Zanfina Ademi; Matthias Schwenkglenks; Manel Sabate; Cost-effectiveness of everolimus-eluting versus bare-metal stents in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: An analysis from the EXAMINATION randomized controlled trial, PLoS One , 2018; 13(8):1932-6203; e0201985",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Medical Device,Everolimus-eluting stent vs. Bare metal stent,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,3948,Euro,2016,4710.98

When fully implemented, the programme will invite people aged 50 to 74 to complete an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) every 2 years. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening occurring outside of the NBCSP, we classified participants (n = 2,480) in the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) into 3 risk categories (average, moderately increased, and potentially high) based on CRC family history and assessed their screening practices according to national guidelines. We developed a microsimulation to compare hypothetical screening scenarios (70% and 100% uptake) to current participation levels (baseline) and evaluated clinical outcomes and cost for each risk category. The 2 main limitations of this study are as follows: first, the fact that our cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective, which does not include indirect costs and results in overestimated cost-effectiveness ratios, and second, that our natural history model of CRC does not include polyp sojourn time, which determines the rate of cancerous transformation. Screening uptake was low across all family history risk categories (64%-56% reported no screening). For participants at average risk, 18% reported overscreening, while 37% of those in the highest risk categories screened according to guidelines. Higher screening levels would substantially reduce CRC mortality across all risk categories (95 to 305 fewer deaths per 100,000 persons in the 70% scenario versus baseline). For those at average risk, a fully implemented NBCSP represented the most cost-effective approach to prevent CRC deaths (AUS$13,000-16,000 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). For those at moderately increased risk, higher adherence to recommended screening was also highly cost-effective (AUS$19,000-24,000 per QALY).

At week 16, combined treatment (n=13) was associated with the largest improvement, sertraline (n=7) the next largest and CBT (n=9) the smallest on the observed case analysis. The effect size (Cohen''s d) comparing the improvement in Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale on CBT versus combined treatment was -0.39 and versus sertraline was -0.27. Between 16 and 52 weeks, the greatest clinical improvement was seen with sertraline, but participant discontinuation prevented reliable analysis.

Combined treatment appeared the most clinically effective option, especially over CBT, but the advantages over SSRI monotherapy were not sustained beyond 16 weeks. SSRI monotherapy was the most cost-effective.

19246,Pharmacotherapy vs surgery as initial therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe benign prostate hyperplasia: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using a surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or photoselective vaporisation of the prostate using greenlight laser (GL-PVP), as initial treatment for men with moderate-to-severe benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) compared to the standard practice of using pharmacotherapy as initial treatment followed by surgery if symptoms do not resolve. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared a combination of eight strategies involving upfront pharmacotherapy (i.e., alpha-blocker, 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, or combination) followed by surgery (e.g. TURP or GL-PVP) upon failure vs TURP or GL-PVP as initial treatment, for a target population of men with moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms, with a mean age of 65 years and no contraindications for treatment. A microsimulation decision-analytic model was developed to project the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the target population over the lifetime. The model was populated and validated using published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were determined. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a public payer perspective, a lifetime horizon, a discount rate of 1.5%, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50 000 (Canadian dollars)/QALY. Sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were performed. RESULTS: All options involving an upfront pharmacotherapy followed by TURP for those who fail were economically unattractive compared to strategies involving a GL-PVP for those who fail, and compared to using either BPH surgery as initial treatment. Overall, upfront TURP was the most costly and effective option, followed closely by upfront GL-PVP. On average, upfront TURP costs $1015 more and resulted in a small gain of 0.03 QALYs compared to upfront GL-PVP, translating to an incremental cost per QALY gained of $29 066.

19250,Cost-effectiveness analysis of olanzapine-containing antiemetic therapy for managing highly emetogenic chemotherapy in Southeast Asia: a multinational study,"PURPOSE: Recent studies suggested that olanzapine, together with dexamethasone and serotonin-3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), is effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) following highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). This regimen is particularly useful in Southeast Asia (SEA) countries where resources are limited. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of incorporating olanzapine into standard antiemetic regimens for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving HEC among SEA countries. METHODS: Using a decision tree model, clinical and economic outcomes associated with olanzapine-containing regimen and standard antiemetic regimen (doublet antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 5HT3RA) in most SEA countries except in Singapore (triplet antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 5HT3RA + aprepitant) for CINV prevention following HEC were evaluated. This analysis was performed in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, using societal perspective method with 5-day time horizon. Input parameters were derived from literature, network meta-analysis, government documents, and hospital databases. Outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in USD/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Compared to doublet antiemetic regimen, addition of olanzapine resulted in incremental QALY of 0.0022-0.0026 with cost saving of USD 2.98, USD 27.71, and USD 52.20 in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, respectively. Compared to triplet antiemetic regimen, switching aprepitant to olanzapine yields additional 0.0005 QALY with cost saving of USD 60.91 in Singapore. The probability of being cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 GDP/capita varies from 14.7 to 85.2% across countries.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of incorporating olanzapine into standard antiemetic regimens for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving HEC among SEA countries. METHODS: Using a decision tree model, clinical and economic outcomes associated with olanzapine-containing regimen and standard antiemetic regimen (doublet antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 5HT3RA) in most SEA countries except in Singapore (triplet antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 5HT3RA + aprepitant) for CINV prevention following HEC were evaluated. This analysis was performed in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, using societal perspective method with 5-day time horizon. Input parameters were derived from literature, network meta-analysis, government documents, and hospital databases. Outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in USD/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Compared to doublet antiemetic regimen, addition of olanzapine resulted in incremental QALY of 0.0022-0.0026 with cost saving of USD 2.98, USD 27.71, and USD 52.20 in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, respectively. Compared to triplet antiemetic regimen, switching aprepitant to olanzapine yields additional 0.0005 QALY with cost saving of USD 60.91 in Singapore. The probability of being cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 GDP/capita varies from 14.7 to 85.2% across countries.

19272,"Cost-effectiveness of risk-based breast cancer screening programme, China","Objective: To model the cost-effectiveness of a risk-based breast cancer screening programme in urban China, launched in 2012, compared with no screening. Methods: We developed a Markov model to estimate the lifetime costs and effects, in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), of a breast cancer screening programme for high-risk women aged 40-69 years. We derived or adopted age-specific incidence and transition probability data, assuming a natural history progression between the stages of cancer, from other studies. We obtained lifetime direct and indirect treatment costs in 2014 United States dollars (US$) from surveys of breast cancer patients in 37 Chinese hospitals. To calculate QALYs, we derived utility scores from cross-sectional patient surveys. We evaluated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for various scenarios for comparison with a willingness-to-pay threshold. Findings: Our baseline model of annual screening yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 8253/QALY, lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$ 23 050/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results are robust. In the exploration of various scenarios, screening every 3 years is the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 6671/QALY. The cost-effectiveness of the screening is reduced if not all diagnosed women seek treatment. Finally, the economic benefit of screening women aged 45-69 years with both ultrasound and mammography, compared with mammography alone, is uncertain.

19273,A cost-effectiveness analysis of consolidative local therapy in oligometastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"BACKGROUND: Novel systemic therapies have improved the prognosis of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but costs of some of these drugs are a matter of ongoing debate. More recently, local therapies (LT) such as radiotherapy and surgery have been suggested as additional treatment in oligometastatic NSCLC demonstrating an improved progression-free survival (PFS) in a phase II trial compared to maintenance chemotherapy (MC) alone. The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of local therapies in oligometastatic NSCLC. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model comparing the cost-effectiveness of LT versus MC for oligometastatic NSCLC from the Swiss healthcare payer''s perspective. Treatment specifications and PFS were based on the phase II trial (NCT01725165). Overall survival (OS) was inferred from a recent phase III trial. Utilities were taken from published data. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness-ratio (ICER, costs in Swiss Francs (CHF) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained). RESULTS: PFS in the model was 3.8months for MC and 11.4months for LT (compared to 3.9months and 11.9months in the trial). OS in the model was 15.5months in both arms. LT was cost-effective with a gain of 0.24 QALYs at an additional cost of CHF 9641, resulting in an ICER of CHF 40,972/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that LT was dominant or cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY in 61.7% of the simulations.

19274,A cost-utility analysis comparing large volume displacement oncoplastic surgery to mastectomy with single stage implant reconstruction in the treatment of breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: For larger cancers in moderate to large breast sized women, breast surgical cancer treatment may include large volume displacement oncoplastic surgery (LVOS) or mastectomy with single stage implant reconstruction (SSIR). Often in the case of LVOS, reduction mammaplasty designs are used in the oncoplastic reconstructions with a contralateral symmetry operation. The goal of this study was to investigate the cost-utility between LVOS versus SSIR to determine which approach is cost-effective in the treatment of breast cancer. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed to determine baseline values and ranges. An average national Medicare payment rates using DRG and CPT codes were used for cost assessment. After constructing a decision tree, an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated comparing the difference for both surgical options in costs by the difference in clinical-effectiveness. To validate our results, we performed one-way sensitivity analyses in addition to a Monte-Carlo analysis. RESULTS: An ICUR of $546.81/QALY favoring LVOS was calculated based off of its clinical-effectiveness gain of 7.67 QALY at an additional cost of $4194. One-way sensitivity analyses underscored the degree by which LVOS was cost-effective. For example, LVOS became cost-ineffective when a successful LVOS cost more than $50,000. Similarly, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation showed that even with varying multiple variables at once, results tended to favor our conclusion supporting the cost-effectiveness of LVOS.

19278,Cost-Effectiveness of Current and Emerging Treatments of Varicose Veins,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of current technologies (conservative care [CONS], high-ligation surgery [HL/S], ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy [UGFS], endovenous laser ablation [EVLA], and radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) and emerging technologies (mechanochemical ablation [MOCA] and cyanoacrylate glue occlusion [CAE]) for treatment of varicose veins over 5 years. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed. Effectiveness was measured by re-intervention on the truncal vein, re-treatment of residual varicosities, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 5 years. Model inputs were estimated from systematic review, the UK National Health Service unit costs, and manufacturers'' list prices. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: CONS has the lowest overall cost and quality of life per person over 5 years; HL/S, EVLA, RFA, and MOCA have on average similar costs and effectiveness; and CAE has the highest overall cost but is no more effective than other therapies. The incremental cost per QALY of RFA versus CONS was pound5,148/QALY. Time to return to work or normal activities was significantly longer after HL/S than after other procedures. CONCLUSIONS: At a threshold of pound20,000/QALY, RFA was the treatment with highest median rank for net benefit, with MOCA second, EVLA third, HL/S fourth, CAE fifth, and CONS and UGFS sixth.

19281,Cost-Effectiveness of Insulin Degludec vs. Insulin Glargine U100 in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a UK Setting,"BACKGROUND: Understanding which therapeutic innovations in diabetes represent the best value requires rigorous economic evaluation. Data from randomised controlled trials and observational studies indicate that insulin degludec has a hypoglycemia advantage versus insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100), the most widely prescribed basal insulin analogue in the UK. This analysis was done to more rigorously assess cost-effectiveness in a UK setting. METHODS: Data from two double-blinded, randomised, two-period crossover trials in type 1 (SWITCH 1) and type 2 (SWITCH 2) diabetes mellitus were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of degludec vs. glargine U100 with an economic model. Cost-effectiveness was analysed over a 1-year time horizon based on the different rates of hypoglycaemia and actual doses of insulin used, rather than glycaemic control due to the treat-to-target trial design. RESULTS: In type 1 diabetes mellitus, degludec was highly cost-effective compared with glargine U100, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound984 (increased costs of only pound23/year and improvement in participant health of 0.0232 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)). In type 2 diabetes mellitus, it was estimated that quality of life was improved (0.0065 QALYs gain) with degludec compared with glargine U100 at an increased annual cost of pound117 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, pound17,939). One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to changes in parameters in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: The rigorous design of the SWITCH trials, coupled with a representative patient population and a definition of hypoglycaemia that is relevant for real-world patients, makes the results of these trials highly generalisable. The within-trial analysis has the added value of being able to include doses and event rates directly from the trials.

19288,Cost-effectiveness of Randomized Study of Laparoscopic Versus Open Bilateral Inguinal Hernia Repair,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and cost-effective outcomes of the open Lichtenstein repair (OL) and laparoscopic trans-abdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair for bilateral inguinal hernias. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A cost-effective analysis of laparoscopic versus open inguinal hernia repair is still not well addressed, especially regarding bilateral hernia. METHODS: This is a clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis within a randomized prospective study conducted at Sanchinarro University Hospital.Cases of primary, reducible bilateral inguinal hernia were included and randomized using a simple randomization program.The outcome parameters included surgical and postoperative costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost per QALY gained or the incremental cost effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Between March 2013 and January 2017, 165 patients were enrolled in this study (81 of them underwent TAPP and 84 OL).The TAPP procedure had less early postoperative pain (P = 0.037), a shorter length of stay (P = 0.001), and fewer postoperative complications (P = 0.002) when compared with the OL approach. The overall cost of TAPP procedure was higher compared with the OL cost (1,683.93&OV0556; vs 1192.83&OV0556;, P = 0.027). The mean QALYs at 1 year for TAPP (0.8094) was higher than that associated with OL (0.6765) (P = 0.018). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 &OV0556; and 30,000 &OV0556;, there was a 95.38% and 97.96% probability that TAPP was more cost-effective relative to OL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was developed from a third-party payer perspective in the United States and was implemented using a partitioned survival model with health states for first-line treatment (progression-free), disease progression with and without subsequent active treatment, and death. Survival analyses of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC from the PEAK head-to-head clinical trial of panitumumab versus bevacizumab were performed to estimate time in the model health states. Additional data from PEAK informed the amount of each drug consumed, duration of therapy, subsequent therapy use, and toxicities related to mCRC treatment. Literature and US public data sources were used to estimate unit costs associated with treatment and duration of subsequent active therapies. Utility weights were calculated from patient-level data from panitumumab trials in the first-, second-, and third-line settings. A life-time perspective was taken with future costs and outcomes discounted at 3% per annum. Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with bevacizumab, the use of panitumumab resulted in an incremental cost of US $60,286 and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.445, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US $135,391 in favor of panitumumab. Results were sensitive to wastage and dose rounding assumptions modeled. LIMITATIONS: Progression-free and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves. Costs and quality of life were estimated from multiple and different data sources. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of panitumumab in extending progression-free and overall survival and improving quality of life makes it a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC compared with bevacizumab.",2018-01-26539,30091652,J Med Econ,Christopher N Graham,2018,/,1-23,Yes,30091652,"Christopher N Graham; Alexandra Christodoulopoulou; Hediyyih N Knox; Lorenzo Sabatelli; Guy Hechmati; Tamer Garawin; John H Strickler; A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis of panitumumab compared with bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer in the US, J Med Econ, 2018 Jan 29; ():1369-6998; 1-23",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Panitumumab + FOLFOX6 vs. Standard/Usual Care- Bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin + 5-fluorouracil + leucovorin (FOLFOX6),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,135391,United States,2017,142953.17
19290,First-line pembrolizumab in PD-L1 positive non-small-cell lung cancer: A cost-effectiveness analysis from the UK health care perspective,"BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab has shown significant survival benefits in treating chemotherapy-naive non-small-cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) with increased level of PD-L1 expression. This analysis aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1 positive NSCLC from the UK health care perspective. METHODS: A Markov model with progression-free, progressive disease and death states was developed. Clinical parameters were informed by the KEYNOTE-024 trial. Utility values were sourced from published literature. Cost data including drug acquisition costs, disease management costs, and adverse event costs were derived from British National Formulary and published literature. The model was run until 99% patients died. Both health outcomes and costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address the uncertainties around model parameters. RESULTS: In the base case, pembrolizumab is projected to increase patient''s life expectancy by 1.32 life-years over chemotherapy (2.45 vs. 1.13) and 0.83 QALYs (1.55 vs. 0.71) at an additional cost of pound72,465, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound86,913/QALY. When parameters were varied in the deterministic sensitivity analyses, results are most sensitive to duration of median overall survival in both groups. Probability sensitivity analyses showed that using a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound50,000 per QALY, the probability of pembrolizumab being cost-effective is 29.4%. CONCLUSION: Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound50,000, pembrolizumab is not cost-effective at its current list price and a discount of 50% or more is required for it to be cost-effective comparing to commonly prescribed chemotherapy.

19291,Cost-Effectiveness of Balloon Kyphoplasty for Patients with Acute/ Subacute Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures in the Super-Aging Japanese Society,"STUDY DESIGN: Propensity score matching study OBJECTIVE.: To assess the cost effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) in Japan. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) is a common disease in elderly people. In Japan, the incidence of painful OVF in 2008 was estimated as 880,000, and approximately 40% of patients with painful OVF are hospitalized due to the severity of pain. Japan is the front runner among super-aged societies and rising health care costs are an economic problem. METHODS: BKP and non-surgical management (NSM) for acute/ subacute OVF were performed in 116 cases and 420 cases, respectively. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) and incremental costs were calculated based on a propensity score matching study. QALY was evaluated using the SF-6D questionnaire. Finally, using a Markov model, Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were calculated for 71 matched cases. RESULTS: In the comparison between BKP and NSM, mean patients age was 78.3 years and 77.7 years, respectively (P = 0.456). The BKP procedure cost 402,988 JPY more than NSM and the gains in QALY at the 6-month follow-up were 0.153 and 0.120, respectively (difference = 0.033). ICERs for 3 years and 20 years were 4,404,158 JPY and 2,416,406 JPY, respectively. According to sensitivity analysis, ICERs ranged from 652,181 JPY to 4,896,645 JPY (4,418-33,168 GBP). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that balloon kyphoplasty is a cost-effective treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral fracture in Japan. However, the effect might be blunted in patients aged > 80 years. Further research is necessary to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of BKP in this population.

19292,Sodium Nitrite-Mediated Cardioprotection in Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: In the follow-up of patients in a trial of intracoronary sodium nitrite given during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we found a reduction in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Specifically, MACE rates were 5.2% versus 25.0% with placebo at 3 years ( P = .013). Such MACE reductions should also be associated with economic benefit. Thus, we assessed the cost utility of sodium nitrite therapy versus standard primary PCI only. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a model to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the first 36 months after ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Decision tree analysis was used to assess different potential cardiovascular outcomes after STEMI for patients in both treatment groups. Model inputs were derived from the NITRITE-AMI study. Cost of comparative treatments and follow-up in relation to cardiovascular events was calculated from the United Kingdom National Health Service perspective. Higher procedural costs for nitrite treatment were offset by lower costs for repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure compared to primary PCI plus placebo. Nitrite treatment was associated with higher utility values (0.91 +/- 0.19 vs 0.82 +/- 0.30, P = .041). The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound2177 per QALY indicates a cost-effective strategy. Furthermore, positive results were maintained when input parameters varied, indicating the robustness of our model. In fact, based on the difference in utility values, the cost of nitrite could increase by 4-fold ( pound2006 per vial) and remain cost-effective. CONCLUSION: This first analysis of sodium nitrite as a cardioprotective treatment demonstrates cost-effectiveness. Although more comparative analysis and assessment of longer follow-up times are required, our data indicate the considerable potential of nitrite-mediated cardioprotection.",2018-01-26561,30081658,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther,Daniel A Jones,2018,/,1074248418784940,No,30081658,"Daniel A Jones; Peter Whittaker; Krishnaraj S Rathod; Amy J Richards; Mervyn Andiapen; Sotiris Antoniou; Anthony Mathur; Amrita Ahluwalia; Sodium Nitrite-Mediated Cardioprotection in Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther, 2018 Aug 6; ():1074-2484; 1074248418784940",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,Sodium nitrite given intracoronary at the time of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,2177.83,United Kingdom,2015,3634.91
19293,"Cost-effectiveness estimates of vaccination against rotavirus in Piedmont, Italy","BACKGROUND: Rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis (RVGE) represents the most frequent form of severe gastroenteritis in children. In such a scenario, the availability of an efficient anti-Rotavirus (anti-RV) vaccine represents an effective prevention tool able to prevent those complications mainly linked to the moderate-severe forms of this disease, which require hospital care. The aim of the present study is to estimate the cost effectiveness of universal routine infant RV vaccination program and its budget impact on the Regional Health Service (RHS) of Piedmont, Italy, in order to evaluate the opportunity of the implementation of a national anti-Rotavirus vaccination programme. METHODS: The researchers performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing costs and benefits of a Rotarix two-dose vaccination versus non vaccination and a budget impact analysis (BIA), complementary to the cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Our results show that the mass implementation of an anti-RV vaccination in Piedmont, in addition to the expected public health benefits, also allows the RHS to save a considerable amount of money within a short period of time, due to the remarkable reduction of direct health costs associated with RVGE management. In fact, as the analysis shows, a universal vaccination against RV results in money-saving for the RHS already from the 2nd year (with a vaccination coverage of 50%). During the five year period, the active and free offer of the anti-RV vaccination would determine a total saving for RHS of about euro 503.000. The cost-effectiveness analysis results showed a cost-saving ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) relevant to the RHS and equal to - euro12.197/QALY. CONCLUSION: In conclusion the adoption of a universal preventive strategy for all the infants in the Piedmont Region may contribute significantly towards the control of RVGE incidence, thus allowing a noteworthy saving of economic and social resources for both the RHS and the general public.",2018-01-26571,30078657,J Infect Public Health,Maria R Gualano,2018,/,,No,30078657,"Maria R Gualano; Robin Thomas; Renata Gili; Giacomo Scaioli; Gianluca Voglino; Carla Zotti; Cost-effectiveness estimates of vaccination against rotavirus in Piedmont, Italy, J Infect Public Health, 2018 Aug 2; ():1876-035X",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Immunization,Rotarix two-dose vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,24 Weeks,6 Weeks,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-12177.8,Euro,2016,-14531.24

However, the approach could be a challenge in low HIV incidence places with a low proportion of high-risk MSM. To examine the impact of PrEP in such setting in Asia, we developed an epidemic model and conducted cost-effectiveness analysis using empirical multicentre clinical and HIV sequence data from HIV-infected MSM in Hong Kong, in conjunction with behavioural data of local MSM. Without PrEP, the HIV incidence (per 100 person-years) would increase from 1.1 to 1.6 between 2011 and 2021.

However, under current market drug price in 2016, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALYG) of PrEP (USD1583136/QALYG) is almost 3 times higher than test-and-treat intervention alone (USD396874/QALYG). Assuming 93% fall of PrEP drug price and in combination with test-and-treat, putting 30% of MSM on non-targeting PrEP would be more feasible, cost-effective (USD268915/QALYG), and could avert more new infections (40%).
