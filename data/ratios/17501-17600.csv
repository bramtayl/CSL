17501,Cost-utility of osteoarticular allograft versus endoprosthetic reconstruction for primary bone sarcoma of the knee: A markov analysis,"BACKGROUND: The most cost-effective reconstruction after resection of bone sarcoma is unknown. The goal of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of osteoarticular allograft to endoprosthetic reconstruction of the proximal tibia or distal femur. METHODS: A Markov model was used. Revision and complication rates were taken from existing studies. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates and implant prices. Health-state utilities were derived from the Health Utilities Index 3 survey with additional assumptions. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were used with less than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses were performed for comparison over a range of costs, utilities, complication rates, and revisions rates. RESULTS: Osteoarticular allografts, and a 30% price-discounted endoprosthesis were cost-effective with ICERs of $92.59 and $6 114.77. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed discounted endoprostheses were favored if allografts cost over $21 900 or endoprostheses cost less than $51 900. Allograft reconstruction was favored over discounted endoprosthetic reconstruction if the allograft complication rate was less than 1.3%. Allografts were more cost-effective than full-price endoprostheses. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoarticular allografts and price-discounted endoprosthetic reconstructions are cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis, using plausible complication and revision rates, favored the use of discounted endoprostheses over allografts. Allografts are more cost-effective than full-price endoprostheses.",2017-01-23953,28105636,J Surg Oncol,Robert J Wilson,2017,115 / 3,257-265,No,28105636,"Robert J Wilson; Lina M Sulieman; Jacob P VanHouten; Jennifer L Halpern; Herbert S Schwartz; Clinton J Devin; Ginger E Holt; Cost-utility of osteoarticular allograft versus endoprosthetic reconstruction for primary bone sarcoma of the knee: A markov analysis, J Surg Oncol, 2017 Mar; 115(3):0022-4790; 257-265",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Osteoarticular allograft vs. Endoprosthetic reconstruction,Stage IIB primary osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma originating in the distal femur or proximal tibia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-92.58,United States,2015,-101.09
17502,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Five Competing Strategies for the Management of Multiple Recurrent Community-Onset Clostridium difficile Infection in France,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is characterized by high rates of recurrence, resulting in substantial health care costs. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of treatments for the management of second recurrence of community-onset CDI in France. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic simulation model to compare 5 treatments for the management of second recurrence of community-onset CDI: pulsed-tapered vancomycin, fidaxomicin, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via colonoscopy, FMT via duodenal infusion, and FMT via enema. The model outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) among the 5 treatments. ICERs were interpreted using a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro32,000/QALY. Uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Three strategies were on the efficiency frontier: pulsed-tapered vancomycin, FMT via enema, and FMT via colonoscopy, in order of increasing effectiveness. FMT via duodenal infusion and fidaxomicin were dominated (i.e. less effective and costlier) by FMT via colonoscopy and FMT via enema. FMT via enema compared with pulsed-tapered vancomycin had an ICER of euro18,092/QALY. The ICER for FMT via colonoscopy versus FMT via enema was euro73,653/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations showed that FMT via enema was the most cost-effective strategy in 58% of simulations and FMT via colonoscopy was favored in 19% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro32,000/QALY.

17506,A cost-effectiveness analysis of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the treatment of adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobehavioral disorder in children that may persist into adulthood. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved in many countries for ADHD treatment in children, adolescents, and adults. OBJECTIVES: Estimate the cost-effectiveness of LDX as a first- or second-line treatment for adults with ADHD from the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) perspective compared with methylphenidate extended release (MPH-ER) and atomoxetine (ATX). METHODS: A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed. Health outcomes included response, non-response and inability to tolerate. Efficacy data were obtained from a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC). Response was a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates due to adverse events. Utilities were identified via a systematic literature review. Health care resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. Daily drug costs were estimated from mean doses reported in the trials used in the MTC. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed. RESULTS: LDX dominated MPH-ER and ATX; reducing mean per-patient annual cost by pound5 and pound200, and increasing mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.005 and 0.009, respectively. In the PSA, the probability of cost-effectiveness for LDX vs. MPH-ER and ATX at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY was 61% and 80%, respectively.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a multicentre pragmatic two-arm randomised controlled trial. Patients were followed-up for 36 months, and data on health service usage and health state utility were collected and analysed within the trial time horizon. A Markov model was developed to extrapolate the results over a 5-year and 10-year time horizon. SETTING: 22 hospital eye services in the UK. POPULATION: Males and females aged 50 years or over with newly diagnosed PACG or primary angle closure (PAC). INTERVENTIONS: Lens extraction compared to standard care (ie, laser iridotomy followed by medical therapy and glaucoma surgery). OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of primary and secondary healthcare usage (UK NHS perspective), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for lens extraction versus standard care. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 67.5 (8.42), 57.5% were women, 44.6% had both eyes eligible, 1.4% were of Asian ethnicity and 35.4% had PAC. The mean health service costs were higher in patients randomised to lens extraction: pound2467 vs pound1486. The mean adjusted QALYs were also higher with early lens extraction: 2.602 vs 2.533. The ICER for lens extraction versus standard care was pound14 284 per QALY gained at three years. Modelling suggests that the ICER may drop to pound7090 per QALY gained by 5 years and that lens extraction may be cost saving by 10 years. Our results are generally robust to changes in the key input parameters and assumptions.

17522,Effects of Radiation Exposure on the Cost-Effectiveness of CT Angiography and Perfusion Imaging in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT angiography and perfusion imaging is an important prognostic tool in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of advanced imaging in patients with SAH, incorporating the risks of radiation exposure from CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The risks of radiation-induced brain cancer and cataracts were incorporated into our established decision model comparing the cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging and transcranial Doppler sonography in SAH. Cancer risk was calculated by using National Cancer Institute methodology. The remaining input probabilities were based on literature data and a cohort at our institution. Outcomes were expected quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging were the dominant strategies, resulting in both better health outcomes and lower costs, even when incorporating brain cancer and cataract risks. Our results remained robust in 2-way sensitivity analyses varying the prolonged latency period up to 30 years, with either brain cancer risk up to 50 times higher than the upper 95% CI limit or the probability of cataracts from 0 to 1. Results were consistent for scenarios that considered either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with SAH. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed our findings over a broad range of selected input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: While risks of radiation exposure represent an important consideration, CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging remained the preferred imaging compared with transcranial Doppler sonography in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SAH, with improved health outcomes and lower health care costs, even when modeling a significantly higher risk and shorter latency period for both cataract and brain cancer than that currently known.",2017-01-23992,28082263,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,J Ivanidze,2017,38 / 3,462-468,No,28082263,"J Ivanidze; R A Charalel; I Shuryak; D Brenner; A Pandya; O N Kallas; K Kesavabhotla; A Z Segal; M S Simon; P C Sanelli; Effects of Radiation Exposure on the Cost-Effectiveness of CT Angiography and Perfusion Imaging in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, 2017 Mar; 38(3):0195-6108; 462-468",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Doppler sonography (TCD) vs. Standard/Usual Care- CT perfusion (CTAP),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-40010.53,United States,2012,-45102.07
17523,Economic Evaluation of PCSK9 Inhibitors in Reducing Cardiovascular Risk from Health System and Private Payer Perspectives,"The introduction of Proprotein covertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors has been heralded as a major advancement in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by nearly 50%. However, concerns have been raised on the added value to the health care system in terms of their costs and benefits. We assess the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors based on a decision-analytic model with existing clinical evidence. The model compares a lipid-lowering therapy based on statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor treatment with statin treatment only (standard therapy). From health system perspective, incremental cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained are presented. From a private payer perspective, return-on-investment and net present values over patient lifespan are presented. At the current annual cost of $14,000 to $15,000, PCSK9 inhibitors are not cost-effective at an incremental cost of about $350,000 per QALY. Moreover, for every dollar invested in PCSK9 inhibitors, the private payer loses $1.98. Our study suggests that the annual treatment price should be set at $4,250 at a societal willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY. However, we estimate the breakeven price for private payer is only $600 per annual treatment. At current prices, our study suggests that PCSK9 inhibitors do not add value to the U.S. health system and their provision is not profitable for private payers. To be the breakthrough drug in the fight against cardiovascular disease, the current price of PCSK9 inhibitors must be reduced by more than 70%.",2017-01-23994,28081164,PLoS One,Alejandro Arrieta,2017,12 / 1,e0169761,No,28081164,"Alejandro Arrieta; Timothy F Page; Emir Veledar; Khurram Nasir; Economic Evaluation of PCSK9 Inhibitors in Reducing Cardiovascular Risk from Health System and Private Payer Perspectives, PLoS One , 2017; 12(1):1932-6203; e0169761",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"PCSK9 Inhibitors (Health System perspective if cost=$14,000) vs. Standard/Usual Care",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,360178,United States,2015,393296.8
17524,Cost-effectiveness analysis of universal screening for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in hospital inpatients,"The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening all hospital inpatients for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) at the time of hospital admission, compared to not screening, from a US hospital perspective. We used a linked transmission/Markov model to compare outcomes for a typical hospitalized medical patient, from a community with a colonization prevalence of 0.05%. Outcomes were number of colonized patients, CPE-related clinical infections and deaths, expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a population approach with a polypill including a statin (simvastatin 20 mg) and three antihypertensive agents (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) and periodic risk assessment with different risk thresholds. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model for lifetime predictions of CVD events, diabetes, and death in 259 146 asymptomatic UK Biobank participants aged 40-69 years. We assessed incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for polypill scenarios with the same combination of agents and doses but differing for starting age, and periodic risk assessment with 10-year CVD risk thresholds of 10% and 20%. RESULTS: Restrictive risk assessment, in which statins and antihypertensives were prescribed when risk exceeded 20%, was the optimal strategy gaining 123 QALYs (95% credible interval (CI) -173 to 387) per 10 000 individuals at an extra cost of pound1.45 million (95% CI 0.89 to 1.94) as compared with current practice. Although less restrictive risk assessment and polypill scenarios prevented more CVD events and attained larger survival gains, these benefits were offset by the additional costs and disutility of daily medication use. Lowering the risk threshold for prescription of statins to 10% was economically unattractive, costing pound40 000 per QALY gained. Starting the polypill from age 60 onwards became the most cost-effective scenario when annual drug prices were reduced below pound240. All polypill scenarios would save costs at prices below pound50.

17536,Cost-effectiveness of the polypill versus risk assessment for prevention of cardiovascular disease,"OBJECTIVE: There is an international trend towards recommending medication to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals at increasingly lower cardiovascular risk. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a population approach with a polypill including a statin (simvastatin 20 mg) and three antihypertensive agents (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) and periodic risk assessment with different risk thresholds. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model for lifetime predictions of CVD events, diabetes, and death in 259 146 asymptomatic UK Biobank participants aged 40-69 years. We assessed incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for polypill scenarios with the same combination of agents and doses but differing for starting age, and periodic risk assessment with 10-year CVD risk thresholds of 10% and 20%. RESULTS: Restrictive risk assessment, in which statins and antihypertensives were prescribed when risk exceeded 20%, was the optimal strategy gaining 123 QALYs (95% credible interval (CI) -173 to 387) per 10 000 individuals at an extra cost of pound1.45 million (95% CI 0.89 to 1.94) as compared with current practice. Although less restrictive risk assessment and polypill scenarios prevented more CVD events and attained larger survival gains, these benefits were offset by the additional costs and disutility of daily medication use. Lowering the risk threshold for prescription of statins to 10% was economically unattractive, costing pound40 000 per QALY gained.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of insulin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira, Xultophy(R)) compared with six potential intensification treatment options for patients with T2DM that is uncontrolled with basal insulin. METHODS: The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE) Cohort Model of Type 2 Diabetes was used with Swedish input data, a 40-year time frame and a societal perspective. The comparators for treatment intensification included insulin glargine, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, insulin aspart plus either glargine or NPH, and liraglutide plus either glargine or NPH. Clinical data for all comparators (except NPH insulin) were based on an indirect treatment comparison of several studies.

17544,Supervised neuromuscular exercise prior to hip and knee replacement: 12-month clinical effect and cost-utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There are indications of beneficial short-term effect of pre-operative exercise in reducing pain and improving activity of daily living after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Though, information from studies conducting longer follow-ups and economic evaluations of exercise prior to THR and TKR is needed. The aim of the study was to analyse 12-month clinical effect and cost-utility of supervised neuromuscular exercise prior to THR and TKR surgery. METHODS: The study was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial including 165 patients scheduled for standard THR or TKR at a hospital located in a rural area of Denmark. The patients were randomised to replacement surgery with or without an 8-week preoperative supervised neuromuscular exercise program (Clinical Trials registration no.: NCT01003756). Clinical effect was measured with Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were based on EQ-5D-3L and Danish preference weights. Resource use was extracted from national registries and valued using standard tariffs (2012-EUR). Incremental net benefit was analysed to estimate the probability for the intervention being cost effective for a range of threshold values. A health care sector perspective was applied. RESULTS: HOOS/KOOS quality of life [8.25 (95% CI, 0.42 to 16.10)] and QALYs [0.04 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.07)] were statistically significantly improved. Effect-sizes ranged between 0.09-0.59 for HOOS/KOOS subscales. Despite including an intervention cost of euro326 per patient, there was no difference in total cost between groups [euro132 (95% CI -3942 to 3679)]. At a threshold of euro40,000, preoperative exercise was found to be cost effective at 84% probability. CONCLUSION: Preoperative supervised neuromuscular exercise for 8 weeks was found to be cost-effective in patients scheduled for THR and TKR surgery at conventional thresholds for willingness to pay. One-year clinical effects were small to moderate and favoured the intervention group, but only statistically significant for quality of life measures.

17545,Estimating the Cost-Effectiveness of One-Time Screening and Treatment for Hepatitis C in Korea,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a one-time hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and treatment program in South Korea where hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevails, in people aged 40-70, compared to current practice (no screening). METHODS: A published Markov model was used in conjunction with a screening and treatment decision tree to model patient cohorts, aged 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69 years, distributed across chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and compensated cirrhosis (CC) health states (82.5% and 17.5%, respectively). Based on a published seroepidemiology study, HCV prevalence was estimated at 0.60%, 0.80% and 1.53%, respectively. An estimated 71.7% of the population was screened. Post-diagnosis, 39.4% of patients were treated with a newly available all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen over 5 years. Published rates of sustained virologic response, disease management costs, transition rates and utilities were utilised. RESULTS: Screening resulted in the identification of 43,635 previously undiagnosed patients across all cohorts. One-time HCV screening and treatment was estimated to be cost-effective across all cohorts; predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $5,714 to $8,889 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Incremental costs associated with screening, treatment and disease management ranged from $156.47 to $181.85 million USD; lifetime costs-offsets associated with the avoidance of end stage liver disease complications ranged from $51.47 to $57.48 million USD.

17547,Estimating the Cost-Effectiveness of One-Time Screening and Treatment for Hepatitis C in Korea,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a one-time hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and treatment program in South Korea where hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevails, in people aged 40-70, compared to current practice (no screening). METHODS: A published Markov model was used in conjunction with a screening and treatment decision tree to model patient cohorts, aged 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69 years, distributed across chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and compensated cirrhosis (CC) health states (82.5% and 17.5%, respectively). Based on a published seroepidemiology study, HCV prevalence was estimated at 0.60%, 0.80% and 1.53%, respectively. An estimated 71.7% of the population was screened. Post-diagnosis, 39.4% of patients were treated with a newly available all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen over 5 years. Published rates of sustained virologic response, disease management costs, transition rates and utilities were utilised. RESULTS: Screening resulted in the identification of 43,635 previously undiagnosed patients across all cohorts. One-time HCV screening and treatment was estimated to be cost-effective across all cohorts; predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $5,714 to $8,889 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Incremental costs associated with screening, treatment and disease management ranged from $156.47 to $181.85 million USD; lifetime costs-offsets associated with the avoidance of end stage liver disease complications ranged from $51.47 to $57.48 million USD.

17548,Evaluating the Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Daily Administered GLP-1 Receptor Agonists for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in the United Kingdom,"INTRODUCTION: The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class has grown in the last decade, with several agents available in the UK. However there is currently a paucity of evidence regarding the relative cost-effectiveness of liraglutide 1.2 mg versus other daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists, due to a lack of head-to-head trial data. Therefore the present analysis was performed, using results from a network meta-analysis (NMA), to compare the cost-effectiveness of three currently available daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists for treatment of diabetes in the UK setting. METHODS: A validated and published diabetes model was used to make long-term projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2015 GBP) for patients receiving liraglutide 1.2 mg once-daily, exenatide 10 mug twice daily and lixisenatide 20 mug once-daily. Treatment effects were taken from an NMA evaluating the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and were applied in a cohort based on the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 (LEAD-6) trial. Costs and utilities were based on published sources. RESULTS: Liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with improved quality-adjusted life expectancy versus exenatide [9.19 versus 9.17 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and lixisenatide (9.19 versus 9.12 QALYs). Improvements were driven by benefits in glycemic control, leading to a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications. Liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with reduced costs versus exenatide (GBP 36,394 versus GBP 36,547) and lixisenatide (GBP 36,394 versus GBP 36,496), with cost savings as a result of complications avoided entirely offsetting increased acquisition costs. Based on the projected outcomes, liraglutide was found to be dominant over both exenatide and lixisenatide.

17550,Cost-Effectiveness of Treating Hepatitis C with Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Infections with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are a global public health problem. Long-term consequences are the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Newly introduced direct acting antivirals, especially interferon-free regimens, have improved rates of sustained viral response above 90% in most patient groups and allow treating patients who were ineligible for treatment in the past. These new regimens have replaced former treatment and are recommended by current guidelines. However, there is an ongoing discussion on high pharmaceutical prices. Our aim was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) treatment in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model to simulate disease progression and assess cost-effectiveness. The model calculates lifetime costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) of SOF/LDV and other strategies. Patients were stratified by treatment status (treatment-naive and treatment-experienced) and absence/presence of cirrhosis. Different treatment strategies were compared to prior standard of care. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model robustness. RESULTS: Base-case analyses results show that in treatment-naive non-cirrhotic patients treatment with SOF/LDV dominates the prior standard of care (is more effective and less costly). In cirrhotic patients an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3,383 euro/QALY was estimated. In treatment-experienced patients ICERs were 26,426 euro/QALY and 1,397 euro/QALY for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, respectively.

17558,Cost-Effectiveness of Treating Hepatitis C with Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Infections with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are a global public health problem. Long-term consequences are the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Newly introduced direct acting antivirals, especially interferon-free regimens, have improved rates of sustained viral response above 90% in most patient groups and allow treating patients who were ineligible for treatment in the past. These new regimens have replaced former treatment and are recommended by current guidelines. However, there is an ongoing discussion on high pharmaceutical prices. Our aim was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) treatment in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model to simulate disease progression and assess cost-effectiveness. The model calculates lifetime costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) of SOF/LDV and other strategies. Patients were stratified by treatment status (treatment-naive and treatment-experienced) and absence/presence of cirrhosis. Different treatment strategies were compared to prior standard of care. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model robustness. RESULTS: Base-case analyses results show that in treatment-naive non-cirrhotic patients treatment with SOF/LDV dominates the prior standard of care (is more effective and less costly). In cirrhotic patients an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3,383 euro/QALY was estimated. In treatment-experienced patients ICERs were 26,426 euro/QALY and 1,397 euro/QALY for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, respectively.

Materials and Methods A decision-analytic Markov model was developed for patients with inoperable, localized HCC who were eligible for both RFA and SBRT to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the following treatment strategies: (a) SBRT as initial treatment followed by SBRT for local progression (SBRT-SBRT), (b) RFA followed by RFA for local progression (RFA-RFA), (c) SBRT followed by RFA for local progression (SBRT-RFA), and (d) RFA followed by SBRT for local progression (RFA-SBRT). Probabilities of disease progression, treatment characteristics, and mortality were derived from published studies. Outcomes included health benefits expressed as discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs in U.S. dollars, and cost-effectiveness expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Results In the base case, SBRT-SBRT yielded the most QALYs (1.565) and cost $197 557. RFA-SBRT yielded 1.558 QALYs and cost $193 288. SBRT-SBRT was not cost-effective, at $558 679 per QALY gained relative to RFA-SBRT. RFA-SBRT was the preferred strategy, because RFA-RFA and SBRT-RFA were less effective and more costly. In all evaluated scenarios, SBRT was preferred as salvage therapy for local progression after RFA. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained, RFA-SBRT was preferred in 65.8% of simulations. Conclusion SBRT for initial treatment of localized, inoperable HCC is not cost-effective. However, SBRT is the preferred salvage therapy for local progression after RFA.

Probabilities of disease progression, treatment characteristics, and mortality were derived from published studies. Outcomes included health benefits expressed as discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs in U.S. dollars, and cost-effectiveness expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Results In the base case, SBRT-SBRT yielded the most QALYs (1.565) and cost $197 557. RFA-SBRT yielded 1.558 QALYs and cost $193 288. SBRT-SBRT was not cost-effective, at $558 679 per QALY gained relative to RFA-SBRT. RFA-SBRT was the preferred strategy, because RFA-RFA and SBRT-RFA were less effective and more costly. In all evaluated scenarios, SBRT was preferred as salvage therapy for local progression after RFA. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained, RFA-SBRT was preferred in 65.8% of simulations. Conclusion SBRT for initial treatment of localized, inoperable HCC is not cost-effective. However, SBRT is the preferred salvage therapy for local progression after RFA.

17571,Cost-effectiveness of conservative versus surgical treatment strategies of lumbar spinal stenosis in the Swiss setting: analysis of the prospective multicenter Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study (LSOS),"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of conservative versus surgical treatment strategies for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). METHODS: Patients prospectively enrolled in the multicenter Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study (LSOS) with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were included. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) were calculated based on EQ-5D data. Cost data were retrieved retrospectively. Cost-effectiveness was calculated via decision tree analysis. RESULTS: A total of 434 patients were included, treated surgically (n = 170) or conservatively (n = 264) for LSS. The majority of surgically treated patients underwent decompression (n = 141, 82.9%), and 17.1% (n = 29) additionally underwent fusion. A reoperation was required in 13 (7.6%) surgically treated patients. In 27 (10.2%) conservatively treated patients, a single infiltration was successful, with no further infiltration or surgery within the follow-up. However, 46 patients (17.4%) required multiple infiltrations, and in 191 (72.4%) initially conservatively treated patients a subsequent surgery was needed. The area under the curve was 0.776 QALY in the surgical arm (0.776 and 0.790, decompression or additional fusion, respectively), compared to 0.778 in the conservative arm. Treatment costs were estimated at CHF 12,958 and 13,637 (USD 13,465 and 14,169) in surgically and initially conservatively treated patients, respectively [base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): CHF 392,145, USD 407,831], per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis identified surgery as the preferred strategy in 67.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Both the surgical and the conservative treatment approach resulted in a comparable health-related quality of life within the first year after study inclusion. Due to slightly higher costs, mostly because the majority of initially conservatively treated patients underwent multiple infiltrations or a subsequent surgery, decompressive surgery was identified as the most cost-effective approach for LSS in this setting.",2017-01-24063,28040872,Eur Spine J,A Aichmair,2017,26 / 2,501-509,No,28040872,"A Aichmair; J M Burgstaller; M Schwenkglenks; J Steurer; F Porchet; F Brunner; M Farshad; LSOS Study Group; Cost-effectiveness of conservative versus surgical treatment strategies of lumbar spinal stenosis in the Swiss setting: analysis of the prospective multicenter Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study (LSOS), Eur Spine J, 2017 Feb; 26(2):0940-6719; 501-509",QALY,Switzerland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conservative treatment,"Patients with the diagnosis of LSS, with a minimum age of 50 years, neurogenic claudication, available magnetic resonance and/or computed tomography imaging studies, and an absence of vertebral fractures, spine infection, scoliosis, or clinically relevant peripheral artery occlusive disease",90 Years,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,339500,Switzerland,2015,385468.73
17572,Low-molecular weight heparin versus vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is primarily treated with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), a strategy based on studies showing it to be superior to the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin for preventing VTE recurrence. Subsequent analyses suggest that the magnitude of this benefit might be less than previously determined. Neither patient-focused measures of utility nor the costs of each strategy have been evaluated in the current treatment era. METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis of VKA and LMWH for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis through use of a microsimulation model of outcomes for competing anticoagulation management strategies from a 2014 United States societal perspective. RESULTS: LMWH therapy added 0.27 QALYs relative to VKA treatment with an ICER of $217,007. One-way sensitivity analysis evaluating the utility of LMWH revealed that VKA was always the preferred strategy at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Limitations include that the model incorporates a low VKA time in therapeutic range (TTR) and that the TTR in some centers may be higher thereby increasing the cost-effectiveness of the VKA strategy. Utilities for anticoagulation strategies were not derived from cancer patients, and preference is known to vary depending on how anticoagulation method is integrated with cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that compared to LMWH, warfarin is a more cost-effective strategy to treat cancer-associated VTE. Although LMWH is associated with a modest increase in life expectancy, this increase comes at significant cost.",2017-01-24067,28039844,Thromb Res,Nathan T Connell,2017,150 /,53-58,No,28039844,"Nathan T Connell; Gregory A Abel; Jean M Connors; Low-molecular weight heparin versus vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis: A cost-effectiveness analysis, Thromb Res, 2017 Feb; 150():1879-2472; 53-58",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Low-Molecularweight Heparin (LMWH) vs. Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,0.00,217007,United States,2014,237242.32
17573,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nintedanib in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in the UK,"BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend nintedanib (OFEV(R)) as an option for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of nintedanib versus pirfenidone, N-acetylcysteine and best supportive care (BSC) for the treatment of IPF from a UK payer''s perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to capture the changes in the condition of adults with IPF. Efficacy outcomes included mortality, lung function decline and acute exacerbations. Treatment safety (serious adverse events) and tolerability (overall discontinuation) were also considered. The baseline risk of these events was derived from patient-level data from the placebo arms of nintedanib clinical trials (TOMORROW, INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2). A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to estimate the relative effectiveness of the comparator treatments. Quality of life and healthcare resource use data from the clinical trials were also incorporated in the economic model. RESULTS: Nintedanib showed statistically significant differences against placebo on acute exacerbation events avoided and lung function decline. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the results were split between two treatments with relative low costs and modest effectiveness (BSC and N-acetylcysteine) and two that showed improved effectiveness (lung function) and higher costs (nintedanib and pirfenidone). All comparators were assumed to have similar projected survival and the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was driven by the acute exacerbations and lung function estimates. In the base-case deterministic pairwise comparison with pirfenidone, nintedanib was found to have fewer acute exacerbations and resulted in less costs and more QALYs gained. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BSC (placebo), nintedanib and pirfenidone were the only treatments to show statistical significance in the efficacy parameters. We found substantial uncertainty in the overall cost-effectiveness results between nintedanib and pirfenidone. N-Acetylcysteine was largely similar to BSC but with a worse survival profile.

METHODS: A state-transition probability analysis was developed adopting the French Health Technology Assessment (HTA) perspective per guidance. Parameters included test characteristics, rate of cognitive decline, treatment effect, costs, and quality of life. Additional scenarios assessed the validity of the analytical framework, including: (1) earlier evaluation/treatment; (2) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a comparator; and (3) use of other diagnostic procedures. Outputs included differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). All benefits and costs were discounted for time preferences. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of findings and key influencers of outcomes. RESULTS: Abeta-PET used as an adjunct to standard diagnostic assessment increased QALYs by 0.021 years and 10 year costs by euro470 per patient. The ICER was euro21,888 per QALY gained compared to standard diagnostic assessment alone. When compared with CSF, Abeta-PET costs euro24,084 per QALY gained. In other scenarios, Abeta-PET was consistently cost-effective relative to the commonly used affordability threshold (euro40,000 per QALY). Over 95% of simulations in the sensitivity analysis were cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Abeta-PET is projected to affordably increase QALYs from the French HTA perspective per guidance over a range of clinical scenarios, comparators, and input parameters.",2017-01-24073,28035842,Curr Med Res Opin,John Hornberger,2017,33 / 4,675-685,No,28035842,"John Hornberger; Jay Bae; Ian Watson; Joe Johnston; Michael Happich; Clinical and cost implications of amyloid beta detection with amyloid beta positron emission tomography imaging in early Alzheimer's disease - the case of florbetapir, Curr Med Res Opin, 2017 Apr; 33(4):0300-7995; 675-685",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Amyloid beta (Ab) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard Diagnostic Assessment,Patients under evaluation for Alzheimer's Disease (AD),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,21888,Euro,2016,26118
17581,Cost-effectiveness of switching to insulin degludec from other basal insulins: evidence from Swedish real-world data,"OBJECTIVES: Health economic analysis from a healthcare and societal point of view was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec (IDeg) after switching from other basal insulins in people with type 1 diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, single arm, observational follow-up from August 2013 to October 2015 of 476 consecutive patients at Danderyd Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) who switched to IDeg from other basal insulins (99% basal insulin analogs). The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to predict the cost-effectiveness of life-long treatment with IDeg vs. other basal insulins, based on a Swedish setting. RESULTS: Mean (SD) duration of follow-up was 21.7 (6.0) weeks. Mean HbA1c decreased by 2.7 mmol/mol, mean basal insulin dose decreased by 13.1% (p < .0001), and mean bolus insulin dose decreased by 7.5% (p < .0001) after switching. Frequencies of non-severe daytime hypoglycemia and non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemia decreased by 12% (p = .0127) and 53% (p < .0001) respectively and severe hypoglycemia was reduced by 62% (p = .0225). The CDM predicted a gain in life expectancy of 0.33 years, a discounted gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.54, and lower estimated direct lifetime healthcare costs of SEK 22,757 for patients switching to IDeg. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) showed IDeg as dominant (i.e. higher effectiveness with a lower cost). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. CONCLUSION: Based on this prospective, real-world, follow-up and using the CDM, it was estimated that switching to IDeg from other basal insulins translated into QALY gains including improved life expectancy and health-related quality of life, as well as dominant ICER, meaning cost-savings for the healthcare system. However, the study is limited by its observational design.

17582,Cost-Effectiveness of Skin Surveillance Through a Specialized Clinic for Patients at High Risk of Melanoma,"Purpose Clinical guidelines recommend that people at high risk of melanoma receive regular surveillance to improve survival through early detection. A specialized High Risk Clinic in Sydney, Australia was found to be effective for this purpose; however, wider implementation of this clinical service requires evidence of cost-effectiveness and data addressing potential overtreatment of suspicious skin lesions. Patients and Methods A decision-analytic model was built to compare the costs and benefits of specialized surveillance compared with standard care over a 10-year period, from a health system perspective. A high-risk standard care cohort was obtained using linked population data, comprising the Sax Institute''s 45 and Up cohort study, linked to Medicare Benefits Schedule claims data, the cancer registry, and hospital admissions data. Benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life-years gained. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken for all model parameters. Results Specialized surveillance through the High Risk Clinic was both less expensive and more effective than standard care. The mean saving was A$6,828 (95% CI, $5,564 to $8,092) per patient, and the mean quality-adjusted life-year gain was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.27 to 0.35). The main drivers of the differences were detection of melanoma at an earlier stage resulting in less extensive treatment and a lower annual mean excision rate for suspicious lesions in specialized surveillance (0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91) compared with standard care (2.55; 95% CI, 2.34 to 2.76). The results were robust when tested in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Specialized surveillance was a cost-effective strategy for the management of individuals at high risk of melanoma. There were also fewer invasive procedures in specialized surveillance compared with standard care in the community.",2017-01-24078,28034073,J Clin Oncol,Caroline G Watts,2017,35 / 1,63-71,No,28034073,"Caroline G Watts; Anne E Cust; Scott W Menzies; Graham J Mann; Rachael L Morton; Cost-Effectiveness of Skin Surveillance Through a Specialized Clinic for Patients at High Risk of Melanoma, J Clin Oncol, 2017 Jan; 35(1):0732-183X; 63-71",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Specialized Skin Surveillance vs. Standard/Usual Care,Patients at High Risk of Melanoma,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,-22025.81,Australia,2013,-23694.62
17583,Cost-effectiveness of multisystemic therapy versus usual treatment for young people with antisocial problems,"BACKGROUND: Behavioural problems are common among adolescents. The burden on society in social disturbance, health, failures to contribute and costs has triggered innovative community-based interventions such as multisystemic therapy (MST). AIMS: Our aim was to compare the cost-effectiveness of MST and treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was assessed alongside a randomised clinical trial. One hundred and sixteen adolescents were allocated to MST or TAU. Follow-up lasted six months. Quality of life (EQ-5D) as perceived by the adolescents was the primary outcome. A societal perspective was used for cost assessment. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the small improvement experienced in quality of life (EQ-5D average score improvement in both 0.02 points, standard deviation 0.13 MST; 0.23 TAU). Dropout before follow-up was 48% and 69% respectively. Overall costs attributed to these young people were, however, 50% lower in the MST group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 384,633euro (95% CI: -2,001,433 to 2,024,681euro), which indicates dominance of MST over TAU. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study shows that, at worst, MST offers no advantage to young offenders in terms of their experienced quality of life, but ''TAU'' included family focused intervention as well as standard supervision. There were some cost advantages for the individual and his/her family in the MST group, but substantial cost benefits for wider society. The case for a large, multi-centre, perhaps international trial is strong as widespread implementation of MST would benefit everyone if these findings are confirmed.

17592,Cost-effectiveness of TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope for prevention of cardiovascular implantable electronic device infection,"AIMS: Infection is a major complication of cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) therapy that usually requires device extraction and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The TYRX Antibacterial Envelope is a polypropylene mesh that stabilises the CIED and elutes minocycline and rifampin to reduce the risk of post-operative infection. METHODS: A decision tree was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TYRX versus standard of care (SOC) following implantation of four CIED device types. The model was parameterised for a UK National Health Service perspective. Probabilities were derived from the literature. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration, hospitalisation, adverse events, device extraction, and replacement. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Over a 12-month time horizon, TYRX was less costly and more effective than SOC when utilised in patients with an ICD or CRT-D. TYRX was associated with ICERs of pound46,548 and pound21,768 per QALY gained in patients with an IPG or CRT-P, respectively. TYRX was cost-effective at a pound30,000 threshold at baseline probabilities of infection exceeding 1.65% (CRT-D), 1.95% (CRT-P), 1.87% (IPG), and 1.38% (ICD). LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Device-specific infection rates for high-risk patients were not available in the literature and not used in this analysis, potentially underestimating the impact of TYRX in certain devices. Nevertheless, TYRX is associated with a reduction in post-operative infection risk relative to SOC, resulting in reduced healthcare resource utilisation at an initial cost.

The model was parameterised for a UK National Health Service perspective. Probabilities were derived from the literature. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration, hospitalisation, adverse events, device extraction, and replacement. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Over a 12-month time horizon, TYRX was less costly and more effective than SOC when utilised in patients with an ICD or CRT-D. TYRX was associated with ICERs of pound46,548 and pound21,768 per QALY gained in patients with an IPG or CRT-P, respectively. TYRX was cost-effective at a pound30,000 threshold at baseline probabilities of infection exceeding 1.65% (CRT-D), 1.95% (CRT-P), 1.87% (IPG), and 1.38% (ICD). LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Device-specific infection rates for high-risk patients were not available in the literature and not used in this analysis, potentially underestimating the impact of TYRX in certain devices. Nevertheless, TYRX is associated with a reduction in post-operative infection risk relative to SOC, resulting in reduced healthcare resource utilisation at an initial cost.

17597,Economic evaluation of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus in Spain,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection in selected patients into the standard of care of Barrett''s esophagus with high-grade dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia in Spain. METHODS: The disease evolution was modeled via a semi-Markov model. The treatment strategies compared included endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection and the Standard of Care (esophagectomy or palliative chemoradiotherapy according to disease status for high-grade dysplasia and endoscopic surveillance for low-grade dysplasia). Efficacy rates, transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from the literature. Clinical management patterns and resource use were modeled according to Spanish clinical expert opinion. Costs were expressed in euros (euro) from 2016 reflecting the Spanish National Health System perspective. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: With respect to the Spanish Standard of Care, endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection was a dominant strategy for high-grade dysplasia patients. When a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained was considered, this was cost-effective for low-grade dysplasia patients (euro12,865 per quality-adjusted life-years gained).

17599,Cost-effectiveness of rule-based immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus infections in preterm infants,"The objective of the paper is to assess the cost-effectiveness of targeted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis based on a validated prediction rule with 1-year time horizon in moderately preterm infants compared to no prophylaxis. Data on health care consumption were derived from a randomised clinical trial on wheeze reduction following RSV prophylaxis and a large birth cohort study on risk prediction of RSV hospitalisation. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of targeted RSV prophylaxis vs. no prophylaxis per quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) using a societal perspective, including medical and parental costs and effects. Costs and health outcomes were modelled in a decision tree analysis with sensitivity analyses. Targeted RSV prophylaxis in infants with a first-year RSV hospitalisation risk of > 10% resulted in a QALY gain of 0.02 (0.931 vs. 0.929) per patient against additional cost of euro472 compared to no prophylaxis (ICER euro214,748/QALY). The ICER falls below a threshold of euro80,000 per QALY when RSV prophylaxis cost would be lowered from euro928 (baseline) to euro406 per unit. At a unit cost of euro97, RSV prophylaxis would be cost saving.

17600,An initial cost-effectiveness analysis of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) in pediatric epilepsy surgery,"PURPOSE: Previous studies have illustrated the clinical utility of the addition of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) to conventional microsurgical resection. While iMRI requires initial capital cost investment, long-term reduction in costly follow-up management and reoperation costs may prove economically efficacious. The objective of this study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the addition of iMRI utilization versus conventional microsurgical techniques in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) resection in pediatric patients with medically refractory epilepsy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pediatric subjects who underwent surgical resection of FCD at the Children''s National Health System between March 2005 and April 2015. Patients were assigned to one of three cohorts: iMRI-assisted resection, conventional resection with iMRI-assisted reoperation, or conventional resection. Direct costs included preoperative, operative, postoperative, long-term follow-up, and antiepileptic drug (AED) costs. The cost-effectiveness was calculated as the sum total of all direct medical costs over the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We also performed sensitivity analysis on numerous variables to assess the validity of our results. RESULTS: Fifty-six consecutive pediatric patients underwent resective surgery for medically intractable FCD. Ten patients underwent iMRI-assisted resection; 7 underwent conventional resection followed by iMRI-assisted reoperation; 39 patients underwent conventional microsurgical resection. Taken over the lifetime of the patient, the cumulative discounted QALY of patients in the iMRI-assisted resection cohort was about 2.91 years, versus 2.61 years in the conventional resection with iMRI-assisted reoperation cohort, and 1.76 years for the conventional resection cohort. Adjusting for inflation, iMRI-assisted surgeries have a cost-effectiveness ratio of $16,179 per QALY, versus $28,514 per QALY for the conventional resection with iMRI-assisted reoperation cohort, and $49,960 per QALY for the conventional resection cohort. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that no one single variable significantly altered cost-effectiveness across all three cohorts compared to the baseline results. CONCLUSION: The addition of iMRI to conventional microsurgical techniques for resection of FCD in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy resulted in increased seizure freedom and reduction in long-term direct medical costs compared to conventional surgeries. Our data suggests that iMRI may be a cost-effective addition to the surgical armamentarium for epilepsy surgery.",2017-01-24172,29159426,Childs Nerv Syst,Matthew F Sacino,2017,/,,No,29159426,"Matthew F Sacino; Sean S Huang; Robert F Keating; William D Gaillard; Chima O Oluigbo; An initial cost-effectiveness analysis of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) in pediatric epilepsy surgery, Childs Nerv Syst, 2017 Nov 20; ():1433-0350",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,iMRI-assisted resections vs. None,pediatric patients presenting for surgery for medically intractable epilepsy secondary to FCD,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,16179,United States,2016,17446.59
