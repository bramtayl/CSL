19001,Colorectal Cancer: Cost-effectiveness of Colonoscopy versus CT Colonography Screening with Participation Rates and Costs,"Purpose To compare the cost-effectiveness of computed tomographic (CT) colonography and colonoscopy screening by using data on unit costs and participation rates from a randomized controlled screening trial in a dedicated screening setting. Materials and Methods Observed participation rates and screening costs from the Colonoscopy or Colonography for Screening, or COCOS, trial were used in a microsimulation model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with colonoscopy and CT colonography screening. For both tests, the authors determined optimal age range and screening interval combinations assuming a 100% participation rate. Assuming observed participation for these combinations, the cost-effectiveness of both tests was compared. Extracolonic findings were not included because long-term follow-up data are lacking. Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of euro3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings.

Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of euro3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings.

METHOD: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model, a validated computer simulation of knee OA, to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of generic celecoxib in persons with knee OA. We examined eight treatment strategies consisting of generic celecoxib, over-the-counter (OTC) naproxen, or prescription naproxen, with or without prescription or OTC proton-pump-inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. In the base case, we assumed that annual cost was $130 for OTC naproxen, $360 for prescription naproxen, and $880 for generic celecoxib. We considered a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and discounted costs and benefits at 3% annually. In sensitivity analyses we varied celecoxib toxicity, discontinuation, cost, and pain level. RESULTS: In the base case analysis of the high pain cohort (WOMAC 50), celecoxib had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $284,630/QALY compared with OTC naproxen. Only under highly favorable cost, toxicity, and discontinuation assumptions (e.g., annual cost below $360, combined with a reduction in the cardiovascular (CV) event rates below baseline values) was celecoxib likely to be cost-effective. Celecoxib might also be cost-effective at an annual cost of $600 if CV toxicity were eliminated completely. In subjects with moderate pain (WOMAC 30), at the base case CV event rate of 0.2%, generic celecoxib was only cost-effective at the lowest plausible cost ($190).

19035,A cost-effectiveness analysis of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma in the United States of America,"OBJECTIVE: A large, pivotal, phase 3 trial in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) demonstrated that denosumab, compared with zoledronic acid, was non-inferior for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs), extended the observed median progression-free survival (PFS) by 10.7 months, and showed significantly less renal toxicity. The cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid in MM in the US was assessed from societal and payer perspectives. METHODS: The XGEVA Global Economic Model was developed by integrating data from the phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy of denosumab with zoledronic acid for the prevention of SREs in MM. SRE rates were adjusted to reflect the real-world incidence. The model included utility decrements for SREs, administration, serious adverse events (SAEs), and disease progression. Drug, administration, SRE management, SAEs, and anti-MM treatment costs were based on data from published studies. For the societal perspective, the model additionally included SRE-related direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, compared with zoledronic acid, the use of denosumab resulted in an incremental cost of US$26,329 and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.2439, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US$107,939 and a NMB of US$10,259 in favor of denosumab. Results were sensitive to SRE rates and PFS parameters. LIMITATIONS: Costs were estimated from multiple sources, which varied by tumor type, patient population, country, and other parameters. PFS and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves. CONCLUSION: Denosumab''s efficacy in delaying or preventing SREs, potential to improve PFS, and lack of renal toxicity make it a cost-effective option for the prevention of SREs in MM compared with zoledronic acid.",2018-01-25897,29480139,J Med Econ,Noopur Raje,2018,/,1-12,Yes,29480139,"Noopur Raje; Garson David Roodman; Wolfgang Willenbacher; Kazuyuki Shimizu; Ramon Garcia-Sanz; Evangelos Terpos; Lisa Kennedy; Lorenzo Sabatelli; Michele Intorcia; Guy Hechmati; A cost-effectiveness analysis of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma in the United States of America, J Med Econ, 2018 Jan 29; ():1369-6998; 1-12",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Denosumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Zoledronic acid,Patients newly diagnosed; at least one osteolytic lesion,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,107939,United States,2017,113967.85
19036,Towards the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Bhutan: A cost-utility analysis to determine the optimal policy option,"BACKGROUND: Due to competing health priorities and limited resources, many low-income countries, even those with a high disease burden, are not able to introduce pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-utility of 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10 and PCV13) compared to no vaccination in Bhutan. METHODS: A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed in the Bhutanese context using a government perspective. A Markov simulation model with one-year cycle length was used to estimate the costs and outcomes of three options: PCV10, PCV13 and no PCV programmes for a lifetime horizon. A discount rate of 3% per annum was applied. Results are presented using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in United State Dollar per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (USD 1=Ngultrum 65). A one-way sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, PCV10 and PCV13 gained 0.0006 and 0.0007 QALYs with additional lifetime costs of USD 0.02 and USD 0.03 per person, respectively. PCV10 and PCV13 generated ICERs of USD 36 and USD 40 per QALY gained compared to no vaccination. In addition, PCV13 produced an ICER of USD 92 compared with PCV10.

19038,The use of intensive radiological assessments in routine surveillance after treatment for head and neck cancer: An economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty around the optimal surveillance of head and neck cancer patients after the primary curative treatment. This study aims at assessing the cost-effectiveness of a post-treatment programme of frequent radiological assessments (maximal approach) compared with a symptom-driven surveillance (minimal approach). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model is developed to assess the cost utility of two alternative follow-up programmes with a lifetime horizon. The two interventions differ in the number of radiological assessments (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and positron-emission tomography) performed over a 5-year period. Clinical and utility parameters are derived from published and unpublished literature and expert opinion. The cost analysis is conducted from the perspective of a major Italian region''s health care system. Cost-effectiveness results are expressed as incremental cost per life year gained (LYG) and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and checked against a cost-effectiveness threshold of euro25,000-40,000 per QALY. One-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are carried out. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, an intensive programme of radiological investigations leads to 0.10 additional QALYs (0.15 LYG) and an increase in costs of euro1903 per patient compared with those of a minimal option, resulting in an incremental cost of euro19,951/QALY gained (euro13,123/LYG). In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 72% of the results lie below the euro40,000 threshold (55% below euro25,000). CONCLUSIONS: An intensive post-treatment follow-up with scheduled radiological assessments over time might be cost-effective compared with symptom-driven surveillance in head and neck cancer patients.

METHODS: We used a decision analytic model to compare 1) no intervention; 2) HCV screening and education (control); and 3) HCV screening, education, and care coordination (active linkage intervention). We also explored an alternative strategy wherein HCV/HIV co-infected participants linked elsewhere. Trial data include population characteristics (67% male, mean age 48, 58% HCV infected) and linkage rates. Data from published sources include treatment efficacy and HCV re-infection risk. We projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime medical costs using an established model of HCV (HEP-CE).

19041,Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria,"BACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a skin disease, with itchy hives and / or angioedema that last for at least 6 weeks without an obvious external trigger. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab relative to standard of care (SoC; up to 4 times the daily dose of H1-antihistaminics) for the Netherlands from a societal perspective. METHODS: The Markov model used consisted of five health states based on Urticaria Activity Score over seven days (UAS7). Model settings and characteristics of the Dutch patient population were based on an online survey among clinical experts and were validated during an expert committee meeting. Transition probabilities were derived from the GLACIAL trial. Healthcare consumption, quality of life (using EQ-5D) and productivity losses were derived from a burden of illness study (ASSURE-CSU) among 93 Dutch patients. Healthcare consumption and productivity losses were valued using the Dutch costing manual. Comparator treatment was SoC, consisting of (up dosed) antihistamines. A ten-year time horizon was used. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of omalizumab versus SoC was euro17,502 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Productivity costs played an important role in the value of the ICER; discarding productivity costs resulted in an ICER of euro85,310 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Omalizumab is cost-effective compared to SoC. The outcomes of this study were used to establish omalizumab as third-line treatment in the Dutch treatment guidelines for CSU.

19042,Cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of acute ischaemic stroke in China,"OBJECTIVES: Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy is an effective but expensive therapy for acute ischaemic stroke with proximal anterior circulation occlusion. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy in China, which is the largest developing country. DESIGN: A combination of decision tree and Markov model was developed. Outcome and cost data were derived from the published literature and claims database. The efficacy data were derived from the meta-analyses of nine trials. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the uncertainty of the results. SETTING: Hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS: The patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by proximal anterior circulation occlusion within 6 hours. INTERVENTIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment within 4.5 hours versus intravenous tPA treatment alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: The benefit conferred by the treatment was assessed by estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the long term (30 years). RESULTS: The addition of mechanical thrombectomy to intravenous tPA treatment compared with standard treatment alone yielded a lifetime gain of 0.794 QALYs at an additional cost of CNY 50 000 (US$7700), resulting in a cost of CNY 63 010 (US$9690) per QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that mechanical thrombectomy was cost-effective in 99.9% of the simulation runs at a willingness-to-pay threshold of CNY 125 700 (US$19 300) per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke caused by proximal anterior circulation occlusion within 6 hours was cost-effective in China.

19043,The Cost-Effectiveness of Screening in the Community to Reduce Osteoporotic Fractures in Older Women in the UK: Economic Evaluation of the SCOOP Study,"The SCOOP study was a two-arm randomized controlled trial conducted in the UK in 12,483 eligible women aged 70 to 85 years. It compared a screening program using the FRAX(R) risk assessment tool in addition to bone mineral density (BMD) measures versus usual management. The SCOOP study found a reduction in the incidence of hip fractures in the screening arm, but there was no evidence of a reduction in the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures. To make decisions about whether to implement any screening program, we should also consider whether the program is likely to be a good use of health care resources, ie, is it cost-effective? The cost per gained quality adjusted life year of screening for fracture risk has not previously been demonstrated in an economic evaluation alongside a clinical trial. We conducted a ""within trial"" economic analysis alongside the SCOOP study from the perspective of a national health payer, the UK National Health Service (NHS). The main outcome measure in the economic analysis was the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained over a 5-year time period. We also estimated cost per osteoporosis-related fracture prevented and the cost per hip fracture prevented. The screening arm had an average incremental QALY gain of 0.0237 (95% confidence interval -0.0034 to 0.0508) for the 5-year follow-up. The incremental cost per QALY gained was pound2772 compared with the control arm. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated a 93% probability of the intervention being cost-effective at values of a QALY greater than pound20,000. The intervention arm prevented fractures at a cost of pound4478 and pound7694 per fracture for osteoporosis-related and hip fractures, respectively. The current study demonstrates that a systematic, community-based screening program of fracture risk in older women in the UK represents a highly cost-effective intervention. (c) 2018 The Authors.

19044,Cost-effectiveness of the long-term use of temozolomide for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma in Germany,"Concomitant radiochemotherapy followed by six cycles of temozolomide (= short term) is considered as standard therapy for adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In contrast, open-end administration of temozolomide until progression (= long-term) is proposed by some authors as a viable alternative. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of long-term temozolomide therapy for patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma compared to standard therapy. A Markov model was constructed to compare medical costs and clinical outcomes for both therapy types over a time horizon of 60 months. Transition probabilities for standard therapy were calculated from randomized controlled trial data by Stupp et al. The data for long-term temozolomide therapy was collected by matching a cohort treated in the Department of Neurosurgery at Jena University Hospital. Health utilities were obtained from a previous cost utility study. The cost perspective was based on health insurance. The base case analysis showed a median overall survival of 17.1 months and a median progression-free survival of 7.4 months for patients in the long-term temozolomide therapy arm. The cost-effectiveness analysis using all base case parameters in a time-dependent Markov model resulted in an incremental effectiveness of 0.022 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was euro351,909/QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that parameters with the most influence on ICER were the health state utility of progression in both therapy arms.

19045,Revisiting policy on chronic HCV treatment under the Thai Universal Health Coverage: An economic evaluation and budget impact analysis,"Thailand is encountering challenges to introduce the high-cost sofosbuvir for chronic hepatitis C treatment as part of the Universal Health Care''s benefit package. This study was conducted in respond to policy demand from the Thai government to assess the value for money and budget impact of introducing sofosbuvir-based regimens in the tax-based health insurance scheme. The Markov model was constructed to assess costs and benefits of the four treatment options that include: (i) current practice-peginterferon alfa (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) for 24 weeks in genotype 3 and 48 weeks for other genotypes; (ii) Sofosbuvir plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (SOF+PEG-RBV) for 12 weeks; (iii) Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (SOF+DCV) for 12 weeks; (iv) Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF+LDV) for 12 weeks for non-3 genotypes and SOF+PEG-RBV for 12 weeks for genotype 3 infection. Given that policy options (ii) and (iii) are for pan-genotypic infection, the cost of genotype testing was applied only for policy options (i) and (iv). Results reveal that all sofosbuvir-based regimens had greater quality adjusted life years (QALY) gains compared with the current treatment, therefore associated with lower lifetime costs and more favourable health outcomes. Additionally, among the three regimens of sofosbuvir, SOF+PEG-RBV for genotype 3 and SOF+LDV for non-3 genotype are the most cost-effective treatment option with the threshold of 160,000 THB per QALY gained.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (stable disease, progressive disease, death) was developed over a 20-year time horizon. Ceritinib''s efficacy inputs (progression-free and overall survival) were estimated from ASCEND-4; parametric survival models extrapolated data beyond the trial period. The relative efficacy of ceritinib versus chemotherapy was obtained from ASCEND-4, the relative efficacy of ceritinib versus crizotinib was estimated using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. Drug acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and medical costs were obtained from publicly available databases and the literature, and inflated to 2016 US dollars. Treatment-specific stable-state utilities were derived from trials and progressive-state utility from the literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated for ceritinib versus each comparator. Cost-effectiveness was assessed based on US willingness-to-pay thresholds. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model robustness. RESULTS: In the base case, first-line ceritinib was associated with total direct costs of $299,777 and 3.28 QALYs (from 4.61 life years gained [LYG]) over 20 years. First-line crizotinib and chemotherapy were associated with 2.73 and 2.41 QALYs, 3.92 and 3.53 LYG, and $263,172 and $228,184 total direct costs, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $66,064 for ceritinib versus crizotinib and $81,645 for ceritinib versus chemotherapy. In the first two years following treatment initiation, ceritinib dominated crizotinib by conferring greater health benefits at reduced total costs. Results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. LIMITATIONS: In the absence of head-to-head trials, an indirect comparison method was used.

19055,Intravitreal Aflibercept Versus Ranibizumab for Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the United States. The most severe vision loss occurs in patients with neovascular AMD, known as wet AMD (wAMD). The most commonly used antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies approved by the FDA to treat patients with wAMD are ranibizumab, 0.5 mg administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately every 28 days), and intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI), 2 mg every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by IAI 2 mg once every 8 weeks (2 months). Given the similar efficacy and safety profiles between IAI and ranibizumab, their associated costs and comparative cost-effectiveness are key factors in determining which one represents a more rational investment of scarce health care resources to help address the increasing cost of prescription drugs in the United States, a source of concern for patients, prescribers, payers, and policymakers. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal aflibercept injection 2 mg every 8 weeks after 3 initial monthly doses (IAI 2q8) versus ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly (Rq4) and pro re nata (PRN) in the treatment of patients with wAMD from a U.S. payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to estimate the lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs of treating patients with wAMD with IAI 2q8, Rq4, and ranibizumab PRN. The model considered changes in best-corrected visual acuity in the affected and fellow eyes over time, and the effect of blindness on mortality. Efficacy for IAI 2q8 and Rq4 was from VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies and from the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials for ranibizumab PRN. Utilities and costs (in 2016 U.S. dollars) were from published literature. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, IAI 2q8 provided equal health benefits with Rq4 (5.44 QALYs) at a lower total cost ($33,795 vs. $48,031) as a result of fewer injections. IAI 2q8 yielded slightly greater QALYs versus ranibizumab PRN (5.44 vs. 5.40) at a slightly higher cost ($33,795 vs. $33,652), with an incremental cost per QALY gained of $2,583. Results were sensitive to variations in drug acquisition costs and number of injections of both drugs and the baseline age of the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: IAI 2q8 can be cost saving and cost-effective compared with Rq4 and ranibizumab PRN for the treatment of wAMD in the United States.

Our objective was to determine through modeling whether this testing would be cost-effective, considering financial cost, quality of life, and estimated change in adherence. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was completed with a 3-arm model: (1) no regular urate monitoring; (2) annual urate monitoring; and (3) biannual urate monitoring. Inputs to the model for health-related quality of life, flare rate, and treatment location were drawn from the medical literature and modeled over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: No monitoring was the least costly (Australian$6974) but least effective [13.51 quality-adjusted life-yrs (QALY)], while annual urate monitoring [A$7117; 13.53 QALY; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) A$13,678/QALY gained] and biannual monitoring [A$7298; 13.54 QALY; ICER A$15,420 per QALY gained] were both cost-effective alternatives in base case analysis. Sensitivity analysis on both an individual component level and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) demonstrated that the result was robust to changes in input variables. An improvement in adherence of >/= 3.5% with biannual monitoring was all that was required to demonstrate cost-effectiveness.

19066,Cost effectiveness of focal impulse and rotor modulation guided ablation added to pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Although ablation with focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM), as an adjunct to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), has been shown to decrease atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence, cost-effectiveness has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of FIRM-guided ablation when added to PVI in a mixed AF population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a Markov model to estimate the costs, quality-adjusted survival, and cost effectiveness of adding FIRM ablation to PVI. AF recurrence rates were based on 3-year data from the CONFIRM trial. Model inputs for event probabilities and utilities were obtained from literature review. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement, wholesale acquisition costs, and literature review. Three-year total costs FIRM+PVI versus PVI alone were $27,686 versus $26,924. QALYs were 2.338 versus 2.316, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $34,452 per QALY gained. Most of the cost (65-81%) was related to the index ablation procedure. Lower AF recurrence generated cost offsets of $4,266, primarily due to a reduced need for medications and repeat ablation. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated ICER below $100,000/QALY in 74% of simulations. CONCLUSION: Based on data from the CONFIRM study, the addition of FIRM to PVI does have the potential to be cost-effective due to higher quality-adjusted life years and lower follow-up costs. Value is sensitive to the incremental reduction in AF recurrence, and FIRM may have the greatest economic value in patients with greater AF symptom severity.

19067,Economic Evaluation of Selective Neonatal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Vaccination of High-risk Infants in Ireland,"BACKGROUND: In Western Europe, currently only Ireland and Portugal continue to provide universal neonatal BCG vaccination programmes, despite not being considered as high TB incidence countries. Other European countries only vaccinate infants considered at high risk of contracting TB. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of selective BCG vaccination compared to strategies of universal and no vaccination. METHODS: An economic model was used to simulate a cohort from birth to life expectancy, taking the perspective of the publicly-funded healthcare system. BCG protection was modelled to last 15 years. International vaccine efficacy data was combined with Irish epidemiological and cost data. The model took into account long-term sequelae associated with TB meningitis and severe adverse reactions relating to the BCG vaccine. A fully probabilistic model was used to incorporate uncertainty across all parameters. RESULTS: At &OV0556;139,557 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), selective vaccination was not cost-effective relative to a programme of no vaccination. The incremental cost effectiveness of universal vaccination was &OV0556;2.55 million per QALY relative to selective vaccination. There was substantial uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of BCG vaccination. The cost-effectiveness of selective vaccination could be substantially improved by reducing the cost of administering the vaccine.

METHODS: A Markov-based state transition model [European study on Quantifying Utility of Investment in Protection from Tobacco model (EQUIPTMOD)] was used to estimate costs and benefits [expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] of changing the current provision of smoking cessation programmes in the Netherlands and England. The changes included: (a) increasing the reach of top-level services to increase potential quitters (e.g. brief physician advice); (b) increasing the reach of behavioural support (group-based therapy and SMS text-messaging support) to increase the success rates; (c) including a new but effective medication (cytisine); and (d) all changes implemented together (combined change). The costs and QALYs generated by those changes over 2, 5, 10 years and a life-time were compared with that of the current practice in each country. Results were expressed as incremental net benefit (INB) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A sequential analysis from a life-time perspective was conducted to identify the optimal change. RESULTS: The combined change was dominant (cost-saving) over all alternative changes and over the current practice, in both countries.

19079,Cost-effectiveness analysis of different seasonal influenza vaccines in the elderly Italian population,"In the perspective of reaching at least 75% influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly and substantial budget constraints, Italian decision makers are facing important challenges in determining an optimal immunization strategy for this growing and particularly vulnerable population. Four different influenza vaccines are currently available for Italian older adults aged 65 years or above, namely trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIVs), MF59-adjuvanted TIV (MF59-TIV), intradermal TIV (ID-TIV) and quadrivalent inactivated vaccines (QIVs). The present study is the first to compare the cost-effectiveness profiles of virtually all possible public health strategies, including the aforementioned four vaccine formulations as well non-vaccination. For this purpose, a decision tree model was built ex novo; the analysis was conducted from the third-payer perspective in the timeframe of one year. All available vaccines were cost-effective compared with non-vaccination. However, MF59-TIV had the most favorable economic profile in the Italian elderly population. Indeed, compared with non-vaccination, it was deemed highly cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro10,750 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER was much lower (euro4,527/QALY) when MF59-TIV was directly compared with TIV. ID-TIV and QIV were dominated by MF59-TIV as the former comparators were associated with greater total costs and lower health benefits. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of the base case results.

METHODS: A Markov process model was developed to examine the outcomes of PCV-13 against a no vaccination strategy using data and assumptions adapted for relevance to China. Outcomes over a lifetime horizon are presented. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, a PCV-13 vaccination program would provide a gain of 0.009 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per subject. From the health care and societal perspectives, the incremental costs per QALY were $20,709 and 18,483, respectively. When herd effect was included, the cost effectiveness of the PCV-13 vaccination strategy was notably improved. The lower price of PCV-13 will improve the cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The PCV-13 vaccination is likely to be cost-effective at the current Chinese prices and ceiling threshold ($8,382).",2018-01-25950,29425054,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Hua Zhou,2018,/,0,No,29425054,"Hua Zhou; Jinchun He; Bin Wu; Datian Che; Cost-effectiveness analysis of routine 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations in Chinese infants, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2018 Feb 9; ():2164-554X; 0",QALY,China,Not Stated,Immunization,PCV-13 (under scenario of no herd protection) vs. None,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,18483,United States,2016,19931.1

19087,Cost Effectiveness of Routine Laryngoscopy in the Surgical Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Some surgeons perform flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL) in all patients prior to thyroid cancer operations. Given the low likelihood of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) or aerodigestive invasion in clinically low-risk thyroid cancers, the value of routine FFL in this group is controversial. We hypothesized that routine preoperative FFL would not be cost effective in low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). METHODS: A decision model was constructed comparing preoperative FFL versus surgery without FFL in a clinical stage T2 N0 DTC patient without voice symptoms. Total thyroidectomy and definitive hemithyroidectomy were both modeled as possible initial surgical approaches. Outcome probabilities and their corresponding utilities were estimated via literature review, and costs were estimated using Medicare reimbursement data. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the uncertainty of cost, probability, and utility estimates in the model. RESULTS: When the initial surgical strategy was total thyroidectomy, routine preoperative FFL produced an incremental cost of $183 and an incremental effectiveness of 0.000126 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for routine FFL prior to total thyroidectomy was $1.45 million/QALY, exceeding the $100,000/QALY threshold for cost effectiveness. Routine FFL became cost effective if the preoperative probability of asymptomatic vocal cord paralysis increased from 1.0% to 4.9%, or if the cost of preoperative FFL decreased from $128 to $27. Changing the extent of initial surgery to hemithyroidectomy produced a higher ICER for routine FFL of $1.7 million/QALY. CONCLUSION: Routine preoperative FFL is not cost effective in asymptomatic patients with sonographically low-risk DTC, regardless of the initial planned extent of surgery.",2018-01-25954,29417402,Ann Surg Oncol,Kyle Zanocco,2018,25 / 4,949-956,No,29417402,"Kyle Zanocco; David J Kaltman; James X Wu; Abbey Fingeret; Keith S Heller; James A Lee; Michael W Yeh; Julie Ann Sosa; Cord Sturgeon; Cost Effectiveness of Routine Laryngoscopy in the Surgical Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, Ann Surg Oncol, 2018 Apr; 25(4):1068-9265; 949-956",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Surgical",Routine preoperative flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy vs. Total thyroidectomy without routine flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy,Stage T2 N0 low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer; history of previous neck surgery or radiation therapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,1450000,United States,2016,1563604.19

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness decision-analytic modelling. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: A simulated population of 100,000 RhD negative women not known to be sensitised to the RhD antigen. METHODS: A decision tree model was used to characterise the antenatal care pathway in England and the long-term consequences of sensitisation events. The diagnostic accuracy of HT-NIPT was derived from a systematic review and bivariate meta-analysis; estimates of other inputs were derived from relevant literature sources and databases. Women in whom the HT-NIPT was positive or inconclusive continued to receive RAADP, while women with a negative result received none. Five alternative strategies in which the use of HT-NIPT may affect the existing post-partum care pathway were considered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs expressed in 2015GBP and impact on health outcomes expressed in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime. RESULTS: The results suggested that HT-NIPT appears cost saving but also less effective than current practice, irrespective of the post-partum strategy evaluated. A post-partum strategy in which inconclusive test results are distinguished from positive results performed best. HT-NIPT is only cost-effective when the overall test cost is pound26.60 or less.

19093,Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging and targeted fusion biopsy for early detection of prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To determine how best to use MRI and targeted MR/ultrasound fusion biopsy for early detection of prostate cancer in men with elevated PSA and whether it can be cost-effective. METHODS: A Markov model of prostate cancer onset and progression was developed to estimate health and economic consequences of prostate cancer screening with MRI. Men were screened with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from ages 55 to 69. Men with elevated PSA (>4 ng/mL) received an MRI, followed by targeted fusion or combined (standard + targeted fusion) biopsy on positive MRI, and standard or no biopsy on negative MRI. Prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score on MRI determined biopsy decisions. Deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated for each strategy. RESULTS: With a negative MRI, standard biopsy was more expensive and had lower QALYs than performing no biopsy. The optimal screening strategy (ICER: $23,483/QALY) recommended combined biopsy for men with PI-RADS score >/=3 and no biopsy for men with PI-RADS score <3, and reduced the number of screening biopsies by 15%. Threshold analysis suggests MRI continues to be cost-effective when sensitivity and specificity of MRI and combined biopsy are simultaneously reduced by 19.0. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests MRI followed by targeted MR/ultrasound fusion biopsy can be a cost-effective approach for early detection of prostate cancer.

19095,A Multiple Treatment Comparison of Eleven Disease-Modifying Drugs Used for Multiple Sclerosis,"Background: Several disease-modifying drug therapies are available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). To ensure the most appropriate MS management, we assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the disease-modifying medicines used for MS. Methods: We conducted a systematic review including 11 disease-modifying drugs used for treatment of adult patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. We performed a network meta-analysis using both direct and indirect evidence. We examined the endpoints, annual relapse, disability progression, mortality, serious adverse events and withdrawal from the study due to adverse events. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by developing a decision model. The model calculated costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with different treatment strategies. Uncertainties in the parameter values were explored with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and several scenario analyses. Results: Alemtuzumab 12 mg was the most effective against annual relapse (high quality evidence). For disability progression, dimethyl fumarate 240 mg and fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg were more effective treatment alternatives (high quality evidence). For withdrawal due to adverse events, the conclusion is unclear due to the low quality of the available evidence. Peg-interferon beta-1a was associated with more adverse events (than the other treatments). None of the examined treatments had an effect on overall mortality compared to placebo. The economic analysis indicated that alemtuzumab was more effective in terms of QALYs and less costly than the other treatment alternatives. Discarding alemtuzumab, three treatment alternatives (interferon beta-1b (Extavia), peg-interferon beta-1a and natalizumab) could be considered cost-effective depending on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Assuming a WTP below EUR 111,690 per QALY, interferon beta-1b (Extavia) was approximately 36% likely to be the most cost-effective treatment, followed by peg-interferon beta-1a (approximately 34% likely). Conclusions: Our results showed that alemtuzumab can be considered as more effective and less costly than the other treatment alternatives.
