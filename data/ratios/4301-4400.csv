4301,Economic evaluation of treatment administration strategies of ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV/AIDS patients in Thailand: a simulation study,"BACKGROUND: There are many effective interventions, via various routes (intravenous [IV], oral [OR], intravitreal injection [IVT] and intraocular implantation [IMP]), for treating cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) that have become available. There are large variations in treating CMVR in clinical practice in Thailand. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of providing (i) IVT, (ii) IV/OR and (iii) IMP ganciclovir to patients with HIV/AIDS and CMVR versus providing no treatment. DESIGN: A simulation study for which the input parameters were derived from a systematic review of the literature, a hospital-based survey and patient interviews. SETTING: The analysis assumed a Thai healthcare system perspective. However, the model was run using both societal and healthcare provider perspectives. RESULTS: Our results suggest that IVT ganciclovir was cost effective and the best option for treating patients with CMVR irrespective of whether patients received antiretroviral treatment (ART). In patients receiving ART, moving from IVT to IV/OR ganciclovir was also likely to be a cost-effective option. Offering IMP ganciclovir was not likely to be cost effective. Providing treatments for patients with bilateral CMVR was more cost effective than providing treatments for those with unilateral CMVR, and offering treatments for patients receiving ART was better value for money than treating patients without ART. CONCLUSIONS: Our models suggest that IV/OR ganciclovir should be recommended for the treatment of unilateral and bilateral CMVR for patients receiving ART in the Thai healthcare system.

4308,The cost effectiveness of opportunistic chlamydia screening in England,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) is being implemented in England. This study aims to estimate the cost effectiveness of (a) the NCSP strategy (annual screening offer to men and women aged under 25 years) and (b) alternative screening strategies. METHODS: A stochastic, individual based, dynamic sexual network model was combined with a cost effectiveness model to estimate the complications and associated costs of chlamydial infection. The model was constructed and parameterised from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) (England), including the direct costs of infection, complications and screening. Unit costs were derived from standard data sources and published studies. The average and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (cost per major outcome averted or quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained) of chlamydia screening strategies targeting women and/or men of different age groups was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were done to explore model uncertainty. RESULTS: All screening strategies modelled are likely to cost the NHS money and improve health. If pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) progression is less than 10% then screening at any level is unlikely to be cost effective. However, if PID progression is 10% or higher the NCSP strategy compared to no screening appears to be cost effective. The incremental cost effectiveness analysis suggests that screening men and women aged under 20 years is the most beneficial strategy that falls below accepted thresholds. There is a high degree of uncertainty in the findings.

This study aims to estimate the cost effectiveness of (a) the NCSP strategy (annual screening offer to men and women aged under 25 years) and (b) alternative screening strategies.

4323,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin based on a 10-year simulation of long-term complications with the Diabetes Mellitus Model in patients with type 2 diabetes in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes and in whom OAD (oral anti-diabetics) had failed in Switzerland. METHODS: Long-term diabetes outcomes were simulated with the Diabetes Mellitus Model (DMM) over a period of 10 years. The incidences of long-term complications (micro- and macrovascular events) were simulated for 10,000 patients over 10 years for six different scenarios. The scenarios were based on HbA1c reductions observed in clinical trials. For insulin glargine, HbA1c reductions of 0.96% (pessimistic case) and 1.24% (optimistic case) were simulated for three different HbA1c baseline values (10, 9 and 8%). For NPH insulin the HbA1c reduction was assumed to be 0.84%. A cost model and a utility model were developed in order to use the cumulated incidences of the simulations for the calculation of cost and QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). The unit costs of micro- and macrovascular events were assessed on the basis of published literature and guideline-projected resource-use estimations for Switzerland. Disutility values of diabetes-related long-term complications were derived from the literature. Total direct medical costs or QALYs were assessed by a combination of cumulated incidences of each event up to 10 years with the corresponding unit cost per event (in addition to the acquisition cost) or with disutility values per event, respectively. Events, total cost, and QALYs were discounted at 3%. In scenarios where no savings could be shown for insulin glargine, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as the incremental cost per event prevented and the cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Cost comparison demonstrated that insulin glargine is the dominant strategy for the optimistic case scenario starting at a baseline HbA1c value of 10% as savings in the management of complications exceeded the difference in acquisition costs after 8 years of treatment. Optimistic case scenarios for baseline HbA1c values of 9 and 8% achieved costs per QALY gained amounting to CHF 2,853 and CHF 5,711 and costs per event prevented amounting to CHF 2,054 and CHF 4,899, respectively. Pessimistic case scenarios for baseline HbA1c values of 10, 9 and 8% resulted in costs per QALY gained amounting to CHF 40,441, CHF 45,701 and CHF 49,468 and costs per event prevented amounting to CHF 27,742, CHF 32,451 and CHF 41,620, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the long-term health-economic implications of treating type 2 diabetes patients, in whom OAD had failed, with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin in Switzerland. The 10-year simulations demonstrated that the deltaHbA1c reductions of 0.4 and 0.12% achieved with insulin glargine led to a reduction of long-term complications, mortality and associated costs as well as to an improved quality of life.

Disutility values of diabetes-related long-term complications were derived from the literature. Total direct medical costs or QALYs were assessed by a combination of cumulated incidences of each event up to 10 years with the corresponding unit cost per event (in addition to the acquisition cost) or with disutility values per event, respectively. Events, total cost, and QALYs were discounted at 3%. In scenarios where no savings could be shown for insulin glargine, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as the incremental cost per event prevented and the cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Cost comparison demonstrated that insulin glargine is the dominant strategy for the optimistic case scenario starting at a baseline HbA1c value of 10% as savings in the management of complications exceeded the difference in acquisition costs after 8 years of treatment. Optimistic case scenarios for baseline HbA1c values of 9 and 8% achieved costs per QALY gained amounting to CHF 2,853 and CHF 5,711 and costs per event prevented amounting to CHF 2,054 and CHF 4,899, respectively. Pessimistic case scenarios for baseline HbA1c values of 10, 9 and 8% resulted in costs per QALY gained amounting to CHF 40,441, CHF 45,701 and CHF 49,468 and costs per event prevented amounting to CHF 27,742, CHF 32,451 and CHF 41,620, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the long-term health-economic implications of treating type 2 diabetes patients, in whom OAD had failed, with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin in Switzerland. The 10-year simulations demonstrated that the deltaHbA1c reductions of 0.4 and 0.12% achieved with insulin glargine led to a reduction of long-term complications, mortality and associated costs as well as to an improved quality of life. Insulin glargine proved to be cost-effective and represents good to excellent value for money compared to NPH insulin.",2007-01-03336,17474539,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,M Brändle,2007,45 / 4,203-20,No,17474539,"M Brändle; M Azoulay; R A Greiner; Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin based on a 10-year simulation of long-term complications with the Diabetes Mellitus Model in patients with type 2 diabetes in Switzerland, Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2007-Apr; 45(4):0946-1965; 203-20",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin glargine vs. NPH insulin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,49468,Switzerland,2005,52702.42
4326,Cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in working-age cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: Despite recommendations to immunize all patients at an increased risk of influenza complications, the vaccine utilization among high-risk nonelderly adults remains low and its cost-effectiveness is unclear. In the current study, the authors analyzed the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in working-age (ages 20-64 years) cancer patients. METHODS: The authors developed a decision-analytic model, from the societal perspective, using epidemiologic, vaccine effectiveness, resource utilization, cost, survival, and utility data from published sources, supplemented with data collected from the authors' own institutional accounting system. Two strategies were compared: influenza vaccination of working-age cancer patients and no vaccination. The base-case patient was assumed to be a 51-year-old cancer patient (the mean age for the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] population of working-age patients within 5 years of cancer diagnosis). RESULTS: The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was 6.02 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a cost of $30.10. The effectiveness of the no vaccination strategy was 6.01 QALYs at a cost of $27.86. Compared with the no vaccination strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccinating working-age cancer patients would be $224.00 per QALY gained. Using the benchmark of $50,000 per QALY, the model was only sensitive to changes in cancer survival (threshold of 2.8 months). CONCLUSIONS: The influenza vaccine is cost-effective for working-age cancer patients with a life expectancy of >or=3 months. All working-age cancer patients who are within 5 years of cancer diagnosis and have a life expectancy of at least 3 months should be vaccinated against influenza.",2007-01-03349,17457827,Cancer,Elenir B C Avritscher,2007,109 / 11,2357-64,No,17457827,"Elenir B C Avritscher; Catherine D Cooksley; Jane M Geraci; Benjamin N Bekele; Scott B Cantor; Kenneth V Rolston; Linda S Elting; Cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in working-age cancer patients, Cancer, 2007-Jun-01; 109(11):0008-543X; 2357-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Influenza vaccination vs. No influenza vaccination,Not Stated,51 Years,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.00,224,United States,2005,296.84
4327,Cost-effectiveness of grass allergen tablet (GRAZAX) for the prevention of seasonal grass pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis - a Northern European perspective,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis has increased dramatically. Seventeen million people in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland suffer from grass pollen induced allergic rhinitis. Symptomatic therapy with antihistamines and topical steroids is partially effective but allergen-specific immunotherapy by injection or sublingual routes is superior. The grass allergen tablet (GRAZAX) is a new allergen-specific immunotherapy for home administration. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the grass allergen tablet compared with symptomatic medication in seven Northern European countries. METHODS: A prospective pharmacoeconomic analysis was carried out alongside a multinational clinical trial. Pooled data on resource use and health outcomes were collected. A societal perspective was adopted, and the analysis had a 9-year time horizon. The outcome measure was Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). RESULTS: The grass allergen tablet was clinically superior to symptomatic treatment, producing statistically significant differences for all efficacy end-points, including the number of QALYs gained - 0.976 vs. 0.947 QALYs gained. There was a significantly higher usage of the rescue medications loratadine and budesonide, and more hours missed from work (production loss), in the symptomatic treatment group. The cost per QALY gained in the grass allergen tablet group was similar in the seven countries (euro 12,930 to euro 18,263 for an annual cost of the grass allergen tablet of euro 1500). The analysis showed that the grass allergen tablet was cost-effective for all countries for an annual treatment cost below euro 2200. CONCLUSION: The pharmacoeconomic analysis illustrated that allergen-specific immunotherapy with the grass allergen tablet is a cost-effective intervention for the prevention of grass pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis in Northern European countries, for a tablet price below euro 6. In Germany for example the price of the tablet is euro 2.95 corresponding to a yearly treatment cost of euro 358 - based on a 9-year time horizon.",2007-01-03350,17456225,Clin Exp Allergy,C Bachert,2007,37 / 5,772-9,No,17456225,"C Bachert; U Vestenbaek; J Christensen; U K Griffiths; P B Poulsen; Cost-effectiveness of grass allergen tablet (GRAZAX) for the prevention of seasonal grass pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis - a Northern European perspective, Clin Exp Allergy, 2007-May; 37(5):0954-7894; 772-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Grass allergen tablets (Grazax) for 3 consecutive years vs. Symptomatic medications,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,9 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Euro,2005,Not Stated

The concept of favorable cost-effectiveness of total hip or knee arthroplasty is thus inadequately verified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a trial involving several thousand patients from 10 medical specialties, 223 patients who were enrolled for hip or knee replacement surgery were asked to fill in the 15D health-related quality of life (HRQoL) survey before and after operation. RESULTS: Mean (SD) HRQoL score (on a 0-1 scale) increased in primary hip replacement patients (n = 96) from 0.81 (0.084) preoperatively to 0.86 (0.12) at 12 months (p < 0.001).

Significant resources have to be allocated to finance this therapy, underlining the need for cost-effectiveness analysis. A model was set up, societal costs were calculated and the discount rate was 3%. Life expectancy data were based on the literature and prolonged according to qualified guess (10% and 20% absolute improvement in overall survival (OS)). The comparator was the FEC(100) regimen. The median additional health care cost per patient treated was 33,597 euros. The yielding cost per life year gained (LYG) was 15,341 euros with a 20% improved OS and 35,947 euros with 10% improved OS. The corresponding net health care cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 19,176 euros and 44,934 euros. Including all resource use the figures were 8148 euros and 30,290 euros per LYG.

4332,Incremental benefit and cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease,"BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials found that high-dose statin therapy, compared with conventional-dose statin therapy, reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the actual benefit and cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We designed a Markov model to compare daily high-dose with conventional-dose statin therapy for hypothetical 60-year-old cohorts with ACS and stable CAD over patient lifetime. Pooled estimates for major clinical end points (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, rehospitalization, and revascularization) from relevant clinical trials were incorporated. Incremental benefit was quantified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Threshold analyses determined at what price difference high-dose statins would yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY gained. In ACS patients, a high-dose versus conventional-dose statin strategy resulted in a gain of 0.35 QALYs. In threshold analyses, a high-dose statin strategy consistently yielded incremental cost-effective ratios below $30,000 per QALY even under conservative model assumptions. In stable CAD patients, a high-dose statin strategy yielded a gain of only 0.10 QALYs and was sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy. The daily cost difference between a high- and conventional-dose statin would need to be <$1.70, $2.65, and $3.55 to yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose statin therapy is potentially highly effective and cost-effective in patients with ACS. In patients with stable CAD, however, the cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy is highly sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy and cost.

The cost-effectiveness of plant stanol esters in the prevention of coronary heart disease, however, has remained unevaluated. DESIGN: A Bayesian modelling approach was applied to synthesize clinical evidence and evaluate the cost-effectiveness (Euro/quality-adjusted life years) of plant stanol esters in spread in the prevention of coronary heart disease based on published FINRISK and 4S risk functions. RESULTS: The regular use of plant stanol esters reduced total serum cholesterol by -0.362 mmol/l [95% credibility interval (CrI) -0.31 to -0.41].

4342,Cost-effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in older adults,"BACKGROUND: A vaccine to prevent herpes zoster was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of this vaccine for different age groups. METHODS: We constructed a cost-effectiveness model, based on the Shingles Prevention Study, to compare varicella zoster vaccination with usual care for healthy adults aged >60 years. Outcomes included cost in 2005 US dollars and quality-adjusted life expectancy. Costs and natural history data were drawn from the published literature; vaccine efficacy was assumed to persist for 10 years. RESULTS: For the base case analysis, compared with usual care, vaccination increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.0007-0.0024 quality-adjusted life years per person, depending on age at vaccination and sex. These increases came almost exclusively as a result of prevention of acute pain associated with herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination also increased costs by $94-$135 per person, compared with no vaccination. The incremental cost-effectiveness ranged from $44,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved for a 70-year-old woman to $191,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved for an 80-year-old man. For the sensitivity analysis, the decision was most sensitive to vaccine cost. At a cost of $46 per dose, vaccination cost <$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved for all adults >60 years of age. Other variables related to the vaccine (duration, efficacy, and adverse effects), postherpetic neuralgia (incidence, duration, and utility), herpes zoster (incidence and severity), and the discount rate all affected the cost-effectiveness ratio by >20%.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of raloxifene, alendronate and conservative care in this population. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to assess the incremental cost and effectiveness of raloxifene and alendronate relative to conservative care. We assumed a societal perspective and a lifetime time horizon. We examined clinical scenarios involving postmenopausal women from 55 to 75 years of age with bone mineral density T-scores ranging from -1.0 to -2.4. Modeled health events included vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, invasive breast cancer, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Raloxifene and alendronate were assumed to reduce the incidence of vertebral but not nonvertebral fractures; raloxifene was assumed to decrease the incidence of breast cancer and increase the incidence of VTEs. Cost-effectiveness is reported in $/QALYs gained. RESULTS: For women 55 to 60 years of age with a T-score of -1.8, raloxifene cost approximately $50,000/QALY gained relative to conservative care. Raloxifene was less cost-effective for women 65 and older. At all ages, alendronate was both more expensive and less effective than raloxifene. In most clinical scenarios, raloxifene conferred a greater benefit (in QALYs) from prevention of invasive breast cancer than from fracture prevention. Results were most sensitive to the population's underlying risk of fracture and breast cancer, assumed efficacy and costs of treatment, and the discount rate.

METHODS: A Markov decision tree was constructed to estimate costs and health outcomes of PDT, ESO and SURV in a hypothetical cohort of male patients, 50 years of age, with BE and HGD. Outcomes included unadjusted life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs). Direct medical costs (2003 CDN$) were measured from the perspective of a provincial ministry of health. The time horizon for the model was five years (cycle length three months), and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Model parameters were assigned unique distributions, and a probabilistic analysis with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was performed. RESULTS: SURV was the least costly strategy, followed by PDT and ESO, but SURV was also the least effective. In terms of LYs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 814 dollars/LY for PDT versus SURV and 3,397 dollars/LY for ESO versus PDT. PDT dominated ESO for QALYs in the base-case. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PDT versus SURV was 879 dollars/QALY. In probabilistic analysis, PDT was most likely to be cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) values between 100 dollars/LY and 3,500 dollars/LY, and ESO was most likely to be cost-effective for WTP values over 3500 dollars/LY. For quality-adjusted survival, PDT was most likely to be cost-effective for all WTP thresholds above 1,000 dollars/QALY.

The clinical and cost effectiveness of ranibizumab (Lucentis) was compared to that of bevacizumab (Avastin), which costs up to 100 times less. A cost effectiveness model was developed to assess the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) over 10 years. For predominantly classic AMD, the efficacy of bevacizumab relative to ranibizumab would have to be around 40% for the latter to achieve 30 k pounds per QALY, a NICE threshold. Similar but worse results applied to the other main forms of AMD, minimally occult and occult with no classic lesions. The price of ranibizumab would have to be drastically reduced for it to be cost effective. Continued unlicensed use of bevacizumab raises ethical, legal and policy questions.

4354,Responding to a small-scale bioterrorist anthrax attack: cost-effectiveness analysis comparing preattack vaccination with postattack antibiotic treatment and vaccination,"BACKGROUND: In 2001, a small-scale bioterrorism-related anthrax attack was perpetrated via the US mail. The optimal future response may require strategies different from those required in a large-scale attack. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using Monte Carlo simulation during a 10-year time frame from a societal perspective to determine the optimal response strategy for a small-scale anthrax attack perpetrated against US Postal Service distribution centers in a large metropolitan area. Three strategies were compared: preattack vaccination of all US distribution center postal workers, postattack antibiotic therapy followed by vaccination of exposed personnel, and postattack antibiotic therapy without vaccination of exposed personnel. Outcome measures were costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness. The probabilities for anthrax exposure and infection; vaccine and antibiotic benefits, risks, and costs; and associated clinical outcomes were derived from the medical literature and from bioterrorism experts. RESULTS: Postattack antibiotic therapy and vaccination of exposed postal workers is the most cost-effective response compared with other strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness is $59 558 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with postattack antibiotic therapy alone. Preattack vaccination of all distribution center workers is less effective and more costly than the other 2 strategies. Assuming complete adherence to preattack vaccination, the incremental cost-effectiveness compared with postattack antibiotic therapy alone is almost $2.6 million per quality-adjusted life-year.

METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of caspofungin vs. liposomal amphotericin B was evaluated using a decision-tree model. The decision tree was populated using both data and clinical definitions from published clinical studies. Model outcomes included success in terms of resolution of fever, baseline infection, absence of breakthrough infection, survival and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) saved. Discontinuation due to nephrotoxicity or other adverse events were included in the model. Efficacy and safety data were based on additional analyses of a randomised, double blind, multinational trial of caspofungin compared with liposomal amphotericin B. Information on life expectancy, quality of life, medical resource consumption and costs were obtained from peer-reviewed published data. RESULTS: The caspofungin mean total treatment cost was 9762 pounds (95% uncertainty interval 6955-12,577), which was 2033 pounds (-2489; 6779) less than liposomal amphotericin B. Treatment with caspofungin resulted in 0.40 (-0.12; 0.94) additional QALYs saved in comparison with liposomal amphotericin B. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found a 95% probability of the incremental cost per QALY saved being within the generally accepted threshold for cost-effectiveness (30,000 pounds). Additional analyses with varying dose of caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B confirmed these findings.

4357,Economic consequences of alternative medication strategies in first episode non-affective psychosis,"BACKGROUND: Maintenance treatment appears to be successful in preventing relapses in first episode psychosis, but is also associated with side effects. Guided discontinuation strategy is a less intrusive intervention, but may lead to more relapses. In the current economic evaluation, costs and health outcomes of discontinuation strategy will be compared with the results of maintenance treatment in patients with remitted first episode psychosis. METHOD: The study was designed as a randomised clinical trial. In total 128 patients were prospectively followed for 18 months after six months of stable remission. The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used as primary health outcome in the economic evaluation. Relapse rates were assessed in addition to various other secondary outcomes. RESULTS: There were no relevant differences in mean costs between groups during the study. Total costs were largely influenced by costs related to admissions to psychiatric hospitals. No differences between groups were found for QALY results. CONCLUSIONS: There were no indications that either of the examined interventions is superior to the other in terms of costs or QALY results. Additional results indicated that the relapse rate in discontinuation strategy was twice as high, but without an increase in hospital admissions or negative consequences on other clinical outcomes.

4358,Cost-effectiveness of echocardiography to identify intracardiac thrombus among patients with first stroke or transient ischemic attack,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Echocardiography to select stroke patients for targeted treatments, such as anticoagulation (AC), to reduce recurrent stroke risk is controversial. The authors' objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of imaging strategies that use transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography for identifying intracardiac thrombus in new stroke patients. METHODS: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of 7 echocardiographic imaging strategies and 2 nontesting strategies with model parameters based on systematic evidence review related to effectiveness of echocardiography in newly diagnosed ischemic stroke patients (white males aged 65 years in base case). Primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: All strategies containing TTE were dominated by others and were eliminated from the analysis. Assuming that AC reduces recurrent stroke risk from intracardiac thrombus by 43% over 1 year, TEE generated a cost per QALY of $137,000 (relative to standard treatment) among patients with 5% thrombus prevalence. Cost per QALY dropped to $50,000 in patients with at least 15% intracardiac thrombus prevalence, or, if an 86% relative risk reduction with AC is assumed, in patients with thrombus prevalence of at least 6%. Probabilistic analyses indicate considerable uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness of echocardiography across a wide range of intracardiac thrombus prevalence (pretest probability). CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on cost-effectiveness is insufficient to justify widespread use of echocardiography in stroke patients.

4367,The cost-effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil as firstline therapy in active lupus nephritis,"OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that can affect any system of the body. Involvement of the kidneys, lupus nephritis (LN), affects up to 50% of SLE patients during the course of their disease, and is characterized by periods of active disease (flares) and remission. For more severe nephritis, an induction course of immunosuppressive therapy is recommended. Options include intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), followed by a maintenance course, typically of azathioprine. The objective of this study is to determine which therapy results in better quality of life (QoL) for patients and which represents best value for money for finite health service resources. METHODS: A patient-level simulation model is developed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of a patient treated with IVC or MMF for an induction period of six months. Efficacy, QoL, resource use and cost data are extracted from the literature and standard databases and supplemented with expert opinion where necessary. RESULTS: On average, the model predicts MMF to result in improved QoL compared with IVC. MMF is also less expensive than IVC, costing pound 1600 (euro 2400; US$ 3100) less over the period, based on 2005 NHS prices. The major determinant and cost driver of this result is the requirement for a day-case procedure to administer IVC. Sensitivity analysis shows an 81% probability that MMF will be cost-effective compared with IVC at a willingness to pay of pound 30,000 (euro 44,700; US$ 58,500) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: MMF is likely to result in better QoL and be less expensive than IVC as induction therapy for LN.",2007-01-03380,17409128,Rheumatology (Oxford),E C F Wilson,2007,46 / 7,1096-101,No,17409128,"E C F Wilson; D R W Jayne; E Dellow; R J Fordham; The cost-effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil as firstline therapy in active lupus nephritis, Rheumatology (Oxford), 2007-Jul; 46(7):1462-0324; 1096-101",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mycophenolate mofetil vs. Intravenous cylcophosamide,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-41205.13,United Kingdom,2005,-99401.29

These strategies were compared in terms of cumulative incidence of early cancer and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Early cancer detection rates were similar among all strategies. Personalized strategies were more cost-effective compared to uniform screening strategies.

4372,An economic assessment of analogue basal-bolus insulin versus human basal-bolus insulin in subjects with type 1 diabetes in the UK,"BACKGROUND: A recent study demonstrated that treatment of type 1 diabetes with an analogue basal-bolus insulin regimen was associated with improved glycaemic control (HbA(1c) -0.22% points, p < 0.001), reduced risk of hypoglycaemic events (-21%, p = 0.036) and reduction in body mass index (-0.30 kg/m(2), p < 0.001) compared to a human basal-bolus regimen after 18 weeks. METHODS: A published and validated computer simulation model was used to project long-term economic and clinical outcomes in a simulated cohort of type 1 diabetes patients treated with either insulin detemir plus insulin aspart (analogue) or Neutral Protamine Hagedorn plus human soluble insulin (human), in a UK setting. Probabilities of complications and HbA(1c)-dependent adjustments were derived from major clinical and epidemiological studies. Complication and treatment costs were projected over patient lifetimes from a National Health Service perspective. Costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was 0.66 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) higher in the analogue insulin versus the human insulin group (mean +/- SD) (7.65 +/- 0.09 versus 6.99 +/- 0.08). Direct lifetime costs were 1654 pounds greater with analogue versus human insulin treatment (40,876 pounds +/- 1119 versus 39,222 pounds+/- 1141), producing an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 2500 pounds per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed the results were robust under a range of plausible scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with analogue insulin was associated with a decreased incidence of long-term complications and improved QALE, but slightly higher treatment costs compared to human insulin therapy.

4373,Modelling the cost-utility of bio-electric stimulation therapy compared to standard care in the treatment of elderly patients with chronic non-healing wounds in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-utility of bio-electric stimulation therapy (Posifect) compared to standard care in elderly patients with chronic, non-healing wounds of > 6 months duration, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. METHODS: Clinical and resource use data from a 16 week clinical evaluation of bio-electric stimulation therapy among patients who had recalcitrant wounds were combined with utility data obtained from a standard gamble analysis to construct a 16 week Markov model. The model considers the decision by a clinician to continue with a patient's previous care plan or treat with bio-electric stimulation therapy. Unit resource costs at 2005/2006 prices were applied to the resource utilisation estimates within the model, enabling the cost-utility of bio-electric stimulation therapy compared to standard care to be estimated. The acquisition cost of Posifect had not been decided at the time of performing this study. Hence, the base case analysis used a cost of 50 pounds per dressing. RESULTS: 33% of all wounds are expected to heal within 16 weeks after the start of bio-electric stimulation therapy. Consequently, using bio-electric stimulation therapy is expected to lead to a 51% decrease in the number of domiciliary clinician visits, from 4.7 to 2.3 per week. The model also showed that using bio-electric stimulation therapy instead of patients' standard care is expected to reduce the NHS cost of managing them by 16% from 2287 pounds (95% CI: 1838 pounds; 2735 pounds) to 1921 pounds (95% CI: 1609 pounds; 2233 pounds) and result in a health gain of 0.023 QALYs over 16 weeks. Hence, bio-electric stimulation therapy was found to be a dominant treatment. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-utility of using bio-electric stimulation therapy relative to standard care is very sensitive to the acquisition cost of the therapy, the acquisition cost of patients' drugs and the number of clinician visits and less sensitive to utility values and the acquisition cost of other dressings. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the model, bio-electric stimulation therapy is expected to afford the NHS a cost-effective dressing compared to standard care in the management of chronic non-healing wounds of > 6 months duration. Bio-electric stimulation therapy's acquisition cost is expected to be offset by a reduction in the requirement for domiciliary clinician visits, leading to a release of NHS resources for use elsewhere in the system, thereby generating an increase in NHS efficiency.",2007-01-03386,17407644,Curr Med Res Opin,John P Clegg,2007,23 / 4,871-83,No,17407644,"John P Clegg; Julian F Guest; Modelling the cost-utility of bio-electric stimulation therapy compared to standard care in the treatment of elderly patients with chronic non-healing wounds in the UK, Curr Med Res Opin, 2007-Apr; 23(4):0300-7995; 871-83",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bio-electric stimulation therapy vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,16 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-15913.04,United Kingdom,2006,-37658.01
4374,Cost-effectiveness of four immunomodulatory therapies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a Markov model based on long-term clinical data,"BACKGROUND: Before the introduction of the immunomodulatory therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), treatment options for MS consisted of symptomatic management (physical therapy and pharmacological treatment for symptom management). Symptomatic management for MS has been supplemented in the past decade by 2 new classes of immunomodulatory therapies that have been approved as first-line treatments for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS): subcutaneous glatiramer acetate (SC GA) and 3 beta-interferons: intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IM IFNbeta-1a), SC IFNbeta-1a, and SC IFNbeta-1b. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic outcomes of 5 treatment strategies: symptom management alone, symptom management combined with SC GA, IM IFNbeta1-a, SC IFNbeta1-a, or SC IFNbeta1-b in patients diagnosed with RRMS. METHODS: A literature-based Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 5 treatment strategies for managing a hypothetical cohort of patients diagnosed with RRMS in the United States--4 immunomodulatory drug therapies and symptom management alone. Health states were based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), a widely accepted scale for assessing RRMS (higher EDSS scores = increased disease severity). Baseline relapse and disease progression transition probabilities for symptom management were obtained from natural history studies. Treatment effects of the immunomodulatory therapies were estimated by applying a percentage reduction to the symptom management transition probabilities for relapse (27% reduction) and disease progression (30% reduction). Transition probabilities were subsequently adjusted to account for (1) the effects of neutralizing antibodies, specifically on relapse rates by assuming no additional therapy benefits after the second year of continuous therapy, and (2) treatment discontinuation. Therapy-specific data were obtained from clinical trials and long-term follow-up observational studies. Transitions among health states occurred in 1-month cycles for the lifetime of a patient. Costs (2005 US$) and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year for the 4 immunomodulatory therapies is $258,465, $303,968, $416,301, and $310,691 for SC GA, IM IFNbeta-1a, SC IFNbeta-1a, and SC IFNbeta-1b, respectively, compared with symptom management alone. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results were sensitive to changes in utilities, disease progression rates, time horizon, and immunomodulatory therapy cost. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacoeconomic model determined that SC GA was the best strategy of the 4 immunomodulatory therapies used to manage MS and resulted in better outcomes than symptom management alone. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the model was sensitive to changes in a number of key parameters, and thus changes in these key parameters would likely influence the estimated cost-effectiveness results.

4378,Long-term cost-effectiveness of donepezil for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: (Acetyl-)cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, use of ChE inhibitors is limited by budget constraints and disincentives on the side of health insurances and nursing care insurances. OBJECTIVE: To analyse under what conditions the application of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil is favourable for the treatment of patients with AD from the perspective of health insurance and nursing care insurance companies in Germany, taking into account factors such as start and duration of treatment, duration of follow-up, drug costs, internalization of opportunity costs and varying mortality and efficacy rates. METHODS: Transition probabilities from a Swedish study and German cost data for donepezil were merged in a Markov model to follow a cohort of patients over a period of 5-10 years. We defined a base case with 1 year treatment and follow-up over 5 years and varied treatment length, follow-up interval and cost factors in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base case, the ChE inhibitor donepezil did not lead to cost savings but to a cost-effective outcome on side of health insurances and nursing care insurances. Early treatment of AD and internalization of opportunity costs (caring time devoted to patients) led to less costs per quality adjusted life years gained. However, results are very sensitive with respect to varying mortality and efficacy rates. CONCLUSION: The application of donepezil may be cost-effective, but considerable uncertainties remain.

4379,The cost-effectiveness of extended-duration antithrombotic prophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Although the risk of thromboembolism after total hip arthroplasty continues beyond hospital discharge, the cost-effectiveness of extending prophylaxis beyond hospitalization is unclear. We compared the cost-effectiveness of an extended duration of antithrombotic prophylaxis following total hip arthroplasty, with use of low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin administered for twenty-eight days beyond hospital discharge, in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. METHODS: The economic analysis was structured around a decision tree characterizing the consequences of extended prophylaxis choices following total hip arthroplasty. The health benefits of extended antithrombotic prophylaxis, measured as the reduction in symptomatic venous thromboembolic events and deaths for each treatment alternative, were determined through a systematic review of the literature. Gains in quality-adjusted life years were based on the distribution of life years remaining for all patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty in Canada in 2003, weighted by utilities derived from the literature. The cost analysis, in 2006 Canadian dollars, took a direct payer perspective with a ninety-day time horizon. RESULTS: There was a net gain in quality-adjusted life years in both cohorts that received extended prophylaxis relative to the cohort that received no extended prophylaxis (7.5 quality-adjusted life years per 1000 patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin and 5.5 quality-adjusted life years per 1000 patients treated with warfarin), although these gains were not significant. The net treatment costs per 1000 patients treated were $799,104 with low-molecular-weight heparin and $72,236 with warfarin. In comparison with the cohort that received no extended prophylaxis, the cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin was $106,454 per quality-adjusted life year gained and the cost-effectiveness of warfarin was $13,115 per quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient economic evidence to support extended thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin following total hip arthroplasty.

4382,Cost effectiveness of once-daily oral chelation therapy with deferasirox versus infusional deferoxamine in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients: US healthcare system perspective,"BACKGROUND: Deferasirox is a recently approved once-daily oral iron chelator that has been shown to reduce liver iron concentrations and serum ferritin levels to a similar extent as infusional deferoxamine. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of deferasirox versus deferoxamine in patients with beta-thalassaemia major from a US healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the total additional lifetime costs and QALYs gained with deferasirox versus deferoxamine in patients with beta-thalassaemia major and chronic iron overload from blood transfusions. Patients were assumed to be 3 years of age at initiation of chelation therapy and to receive prescribed dosages of deferasirox and deferoxamine that have been shown to be similarly effective in such patients. Compliance with chelation therapy and probabilities of iron overload-related cardiac disease and death by degree of compliance were estimated using data from published studies. Costs ($US, year 2006 values) of deferoxamine administration and iron overload-related cardiac disease were based on analyses of health insurance claims of transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients. Utilities were based on a study of patient preferences for oral versus infusional chelation therapy, as well as published literature. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were employed to examine the robustness of the results to key assumptions. RESULTS: Deferasirox resulted in a gain of 4.5 QALYs per patient at an additional expected lifetime cost of $US126,018 per patient; the cost per QALY gained was $US28,255. The cost effectiveness of deferasirox versus deferoxamine was sensitive to the estimated costs of deferoxamine administration and the quality-of-life benefit associated with oral versus infusional therapy. Cost effectiveness was also relatively sensitive to the equivalent daily dose of deferasirox, and the unit costs of deferasirox and deferoxamine, and was more favourable in younger patients.

Two rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) have recently completed clinical trials. We investigated whether routine infant immunisation with either vaccine can be cost effective. METHODS: We compared costs and outcomes of vaccination using a cohort model, following children over the first 5 years of life. We estimated health provider costs, economic costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to rotavirus-related deaths, hospital admissions, nosocomial infections, accident and emergency attendances, general practice consultations and calls to NHS Direct. RESULTS: Under base case assumptions, a programme using RotaTeq (priced at pound 25 a dose) would cost the health provider pound 79,900 per QALY gained. Using Rotarix (priced at pound 35 a dose) would cost pound 61,000 per QALY gained. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis indicate that at these prices an immunisation programme would be unlikely to be cost-effective for any realistic value of the key parameters.

4386,Rotator cuff repair: an analysis of utility scores and cost-effectiveness,"More than 75,000 rotator cuff repairs are performed annually, yet cost-effectiveness data are unavailable. This study examines the cost utility of rotator cuff repair by relating surgical costs to increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Eighty-seven patients were followed up prospectively for 1 year, during which cost and quality of life data were collected. Patient-based utility measures of quality of life (European Quality-of-Life measure [EuroQoL] and Health Utility Index [HUI]) were administered. Changes in these measures generated net QALYs. Finally, life expectancies were applied to generate a cost-effectiveness ratio, and subsequent 1-way sensitivity analyses varied costs, QALYs, and discount rates to determine which factors drive cost-effectiveness. Total costs averaged $10,605.20. Significant improvements were noted in health-related quality of life postoperatively. The estimated mean lifetime gain in QALYs from surgery was 0.81 by use of the HUI and 3.43 by use of the EuroQoL. This yielded cost-effectiveness ratios of $13,092.84/QALY by use of the HUI and $3,091.90/QALY by use of the EuroQoL. The cost-effectiveness of rotator cuff repair compares favorably with other common interventions in health care and reaches commonly accepted benchmarks for cost-effectiveness.",2007-01-03398,17399623,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,Mark A Vitale,2007,16 / 2,181-7,No,17399623,"Mark A Vitale; Michael G Vitale; Joshua G Zivin; Jonathan P Braman; Louis U Bigliani; Evan L Flatow; Rotator cuff repair: an analysis of utility scores and cost-effectiveness, J Shoulder Elbow Surg, 2007 Mar-Apr; 16(2):1532-6500; 181-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rotator cuff repair surgery vs. Medical Management,Not Stated,80 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,3091,United States,2005,4096.18
4387,A brief pain management program compared with physical therapy for low back pain: results from an economic analysis alongside a randomized clinical trial,"OBJECTIVE: Guidelines for the management of acute low back pain in primary care recommend early intervention to address psychosocial risk factors associated with long-term disability. We assessed the cost utility and cost effectiveness of a brief pain management program (BPM) targeting psychosocial factors compared with physical therapy (PT) for primary care patients with low back pain of <12 weeks' duration. METHODS: A total of 402 patients were randomly assigned to BPM or PT. We adopted a health care perspective, examining the direct health care costs of low back pain. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 12-month change scores on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire. Resource use data related to back pain were collected at 12-month followup. Cost effectiveness was expressed as incremental ratios, with uncertainty assessed using cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in mean health care costs or outcomes between treatments. PT had marginally greater effectiveness at 12 months, albeit with greater health care costs (BPM 142 pounds, PT 195 pounds). The incremental cost-per-QALY ratio was 2,362 pounds. If the UK National Health Service were willing to pay 10,000 pound per additional QALY, there is only a 17% chance that BPM provides the best value for money. CONCLUSION: PT is a cost-effective primary care management strategy for low back pain. However, the absence of a clinically superior treatment program raises the possibility that BPM could provide an additional primary care approach, administered in fewer sessions, allowing patient and doctor preferences to be considered.",2007-01-03400,17394176,Arthritis Rheum,D G T Whitehurst,2007,57 / 3,466-73,No,17394176,"D G T Whitehurst; M Lewis; G L Yao; S Bryan; J P Raftery; R Mullis; E M Hay; A brief pain management program compared with physical therapy for low back pain: results from an economic analysis alongside a randomized clinical trial, Arthritis Rheum, 2007-Apr-15; 57(3):0004-3591; 466-73",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biopschycosocial brief pain management program lasting 12 months vs. Physical therapy pain management program lasting 12 months,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,2678,United Kingdom,2002,5788.74
4388,Cost-effectiveness analysis of variceal ligation vs. beta-blockers for primary prevention of variceal bleeding,"Although both beta-blockade (BB) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) are used for primary prevention of variceal bleeding (VB) in patients with cirrhosis with moderate to large esophageal varices (EVs), the more cost-effective option is uncertain. We created a Markov decision model to compare BB and EVL in such patients, examining both cost-effectiveness (cost per life year [LY]) and cost-utility (cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). Outcomes included cost per LY, cost per QALY, proportions of persons with VB, TIPS, and all-cause mortality. EVL and BB were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). When considering only LYs, initial EVL exceeds the benchmark of 50,000 dollars/LY, with an ICER of 98,407 dollars. However, when quality of life (QoL) is considered, EVL is cost-effective compared to BB (ICUR of 25,548 dollars/QALY). In sensitivity analysis, EVL is cost-effective if the yearly risk of EV bleeding is > or = 0.26 (base case 0.15), the relative risk of bleeding on BB is > or = 0.69 (base case 0.58), or if the relative risk of bleeding with EVL is < 0.27 (base case 0.35). The ICUR favored EVL unless the relative risk of bleeding on BB is < 0.46, the relative risk of bleeding with EVL is > 0.46, or the time horizon is < or = 24 months. Whether EVL is ""cost-effective"" relative to BB therapy for primary prevention of EV bleeding depends on whether LYs or QALYs are considered.

4389,The cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination for people aged 50 to 64 years: an international model,"OBJECTIVES: Routine influenza vaccination is currently recommended in several countries for people aged more than 60 or 65 years or with high risk of complications. A lower age threshold of 50 years has been recommended in the United States since 1999. To help policymakers consider whether such a policy should be adopted more widely, we conducted an economic evaluation of lowering the age limit for routine influenza vaccination to 50 years in Brazil, France, Germany, and Italy. METHODS: The probabilistic model was designed to compare in a single season the costs and clinical outcomes associated with two alternative vaccination policies for persons aged 50 to 64 years: reimbursement only for people at high risk of complications (current policy), and reimbursement for all individuals in this age group (proposed policy). Two perspectives were considered: third-party payer (TPP) and societal. Model inputs were obtained primarily from the published literature and validated through expert opinion. The historical distribution of annual influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence was used to simulate the uncertain incidence in any given season. We estimated gains in unadjusted and quality-adjusted life expectancy, and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Comparing the proposed to the current policy, the estimated mean costs per QALY gained were R$4,100, EURO 13,200, EURO 31,400 and EURO 15,700 for Brazil, France, Germany, and Italy, respectively, from a TPP perspective. From the societal perspective, the age-based policy is predicted to yield net cost savings in Germany and Italy, whereas the cost per QALY decreased to R$2800 for Brazil and EURO 8000 for France. The results were particularly sensitive to the ILI incidence rate, vaccine uptake, influenza fatality rate, and the costs of administering vaccination. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold ratio of EURO 50,000 per QALY gained, the probabilities of the new policy being cost-effective were 94% and 95% for France, 72% and near 100% for Germany, and 89% and 99% for Italy, from the TPP and societal perspectives, respectively.

A lower age threshold of 50 years has been recommended in the United States since 1999. To help policymakers consider whether such a policy should be adopted more widely, we conducted an economic evaluation of lowering the age limit for routine influenza vaccination to 50 years in Brazil, France, Germany, and Italy. METHODS: The probabilistic model was designed to compare in a single season the costs and clinical outcomes associated with two alternative vaccination policies for persons aged 50 to 64 years: reimbursement only for people at high risk of complications (current policy), and reimbursement for all individuals in this age group (proposed policy). Two perspectives were considered: third-party payer (TPP) and societal. Model inputs were obtained primarily from the published literature and validated through expert opinion. The historical distribution of annual influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence was used to simulate the uncertain incidence in any given season. We estimated gains in unadjusted and quality-adjusted life expectancy, and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Comparing the proposed to the current policy, the estimated mean costs per QALY gained were R$4,100, EURO 13,200, EURO 31,400 and EURO 15,700 for Brazil, France, Germany, and Italy, respectively, from a TPP perspective. From the societal perspective, the age-based policy is predicted to yield net cost savings in Germany and Italy, whereas the cost per QALY decreased to R$2800 for Brazil and EURO 8000 for France. The results were particularly sensitive to the ILI incidence rate, vaccine uptake, influenza fatality rate, and the costs of administering vaccination. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold ratio of EURO 50,000 per QALY gained, the probabilities of the new policy being cost-effective were 94% and 95% for France, 72% and near 100% for Germany, and 89% and 99% for Italy, from the TPP and societal perspectives, respectively.

4397,A cost-effectiveness analysis of alcohol prevention targeting licensed premises,"BACKGROUND: A multi-component alcohol prevention programme targeting licensed premises has been ongoing in Stockholm since 1996. An earlier study has established that this led to a 29% reduction in police-reported violence. The objective of the present study is to calculate the programme's cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective; the cost of implementation, the savings made as a result of fewer assaults, unlawful threats and violence towards officials, and the health gains in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). METHODS: The costs included administration, studies of alcohol serving practices, community mobilization, responsible beverage service training and stricter alcohol law enforcement. For the purpose of estimating how the decrease in violence affected savings and health gains, a survey among victims of violence (N=604) was performed. RESULTS: The cost of the programme was estimated at Euro 796,000. The average cost of a violent crime was estimated at Euro 19,049, which implies overall savings of Euro 31.314 million related to the judicial system (78%), production losses (15%), health care issues (5%) and other damages (2%). Accordingly, the base case cost-saving ratio was 1:39. The average loss of health state weighting among the victims at 0.09 translates into 236 gained QALYs for society as a whole, which should be compared with the modest proportion of savings in the health sector. CONCLUSION: The most significant concern is the low response rate (35%), and caution needs to be exercised when interpreting our results. Yet, a reasonable conclusion is that the monetary and human benefits have been considerable.",2007-01-03406,17387105,Eur J Public Health,Anna M Månsdotter,2007,17 / 6,618-23,No,17387105,"Anna M Månsdotter; Malin K Rydberg; Eva Wallin; Lars A Lindholm; Sven Andréasson; A cost-effectiveness analysis of alcohol prevention targeting licensed premises, Eur J Public Health, 2007-Dec; 17(6):1101-1262; 618-23",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Alcohol prevention program vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-17122.23,Euro,2005,-28246.53
4398,Cost effectiveness of long-term treatment with eszopiclone for primary insomnia in adults: a decision analytical model,"OBJECTIVE: Although the clinical benefits of pharmacological treatments for insomnia have been studied, no systematic assessment of their economic value has been reported. This analysis assessed, from a broad payer and societal perspective, the cost effectiveness of long-term treatment with eszopiclone (LUNESTA, Sepracor Inc., [Marlborough, MA, USA]) for chronic primary insomnia in adults in the US. METHODS: A decision analytical model was developed based on the reanalysis of a 6-month placebo-controlled trial, which demonstrated that eszopiclone 3mg significantly improved sleep and daytime function measures versus placebo in adults with primary insomnia. Patients were classified as either having remitted or not remitted from insomnia based upon a composite index of eight sleep and daytime function measures collected during the trial. These data were supplemented with quality-of-life and healthcare and lost productivity cost data from the published literature and medical and absenteeism claims databases. RESULTS: Compared with non-remitted patients, patients classified as remitted had lower monthly healthcare and productivity costs (in 2006 dollars) [a reduction of $US242 and $US182, respectively] and higher quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) weight (a net gain of 0.0810 on a scale ranging from 0 to 1). During the study, eszopiclone-treated patients were about 2.5 times more likely to have remitted than placebo-treated patients. Six months of eszopiclone treatment reduced direct (healthcare) and indirect (productivity) costs by an estimated $US245.13 and $US184.19 per patient, respectively. Eszopiclone use was associated with a cost of $US497.15 per patient over 6 months (including drug cost, dispensing fee, physician visit and time loss to receive care). Thus, after considering the above savings and the costs associated with eszopiclone treatment over 6 months, cost increased by $US252.02 (excluding productivity gains) and $US67.83 (including productivity gains) per person. However, eszopiclone treatment was also associated with a net QALY gain of 0.006831 per patient over the same period. Consequently, the incremental cost per QALY gained associated with eszopiclone was approximately $US9930 (including productivity gains [i.e. $US67.83 / 0.006831]) and $US36 894 (excluding productivity gains [i.e. $US252.02 / 0.006831]). Sensitivity analyses using a variety of scenarios suggested that eszopiclone is generally cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggested that long-term eszopiclone treatment was cost effective over the 6-month study period, particularly when the impact on productivity costs is considered. Given the increasing interest in new pharmacological interventions to manage insomnia, payers and clinicians alike should carefully consider the balance of health and economic benefits that these interventions offer. Accordingly, additional research in this area is warranted.",2007-01-03411,17381185,CNS Drugs,Marc F Botteman,2007,21 / 4,319-34,No,17381185,"Marc F Botteman; Ron J Ozminkowski; Shaohung Wang; Chris L Pashos; Kendyl Schaefer; Daniel J Foley; Cost effectiveness of long-term treatment with eszopiclone for primary insomnia in adults: a decision analytical model, CNS Drugs, 2007; 21(4):1172-7047; 319-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eszopiclone (3mg) nightly for 6 months vs. Placebo nightly for 6 months,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,9930,United States,2006,12747.98
4399,Cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin compared with regular dose simvastatin,"AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin when compared with generic simvastatin for secondary prevention in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden based on the recently completed IDEAL trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: The IDEAL trial showed that high-dose treatment with atorvastatin was associated with fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions (MI) or coronary heart disease death (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.78-1.01) and major cardiovascular events by (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.98) or any coronary event (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.76-0.91) than simvastatin with no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events. Costs during the trial period was estimated based on the trial data and a Markov model was constructed where the risk of MIs and revascularization procedures and the long-term costs, quality of life, and mortality associated with these events was simulated. Costs were based on resource consumptions recorded in the trial multiplied with recent unit costs from each country. Both direct health care costs and indirect costs (costs from lost production due to work absence) were included. Intervention lasted for the duration of the trial (4.8 years) while health-effects and costs are predicted for the lifespan of the patient. The main outcome was quality adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. High-dose treatment was predicted to lead to a mean increase in survival of 0.049 years per patient and 0.033 QALYs gained. The cost to gain one QALY was predicted to 47,197euro (Denmark), 62,639euro (Finland), 35,210euro (Norway), and 43,667euro (Sweden), with cost-effectiveness ratio decreasing with higher risk. CONCLUSION: In the prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with a previous MI, high-dose atorvastatin appears to be a cost-effective strategy when compared with generic simvastatin 20-40 mg in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. In Finland, it is cost-effective in high-risk patients.
