18101,Cost-utility analysis of the fixed-dose combination of dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine as initial treatment of HIV+ patients in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: Fixed-dose combinations of antiretroviral drugs have meant an important step forward in simplifying treatment and improving compliance and has led to an increased effectiveness of therapy, a viral load decrease and improving the quality of life of patients. The single-table formulation of dolutegravir with abacavir and lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) is a highly efficacious and well-tolerated once-daily regimen for HIV-infected patients. The objective of the study was to assess the incremental cost-utility ratio of the fixed-dose combination of (DTG/ABC/3TC) versus the combinations emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz (FTC/TDF/EFV), and darunavir/r (DRV/r) or raltegravir (RAL) with emtricitabine/tenofovir (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) as initial antiretroviral therapy in patients infected with HIV-1 from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. METHOD: The ARAMIS model, which uses a microsimulation approach to simulate the individual changes in each patient from the start of treatment to death through a Markov chain of descriptive health states of the disease, was adapted to Spain. The alternatives used for comparison were the fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz (FTC/TDF/EFV), and the fixed- dose combinations of emtricitabine/tenofovir (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) with darunavir/r (DRV/r) or raltegravir (RAL). The probability of achieving virological suppression by the treatments included in the model was obtained from clinical trials SINGLE, SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO and the costs were expressed in euro (2015). The model use the perspective of the Spanish National Health System, with a lifetime horizon and a discount rate of 3% was applied to cost and effectiveness. RESULTS: Treatment initiation with DTG/ABC/3TC was dominant when it was compared with treatment initiation with all the comparators: vs. FTC/TDF/EFV (-67 210.71euro/QALY), vs. DRV/r + FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC (-1 787 341.44euro/QALY), and vs. RAL + FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC (-1 005 117.13euro/QALY).

18104,Economic evaluation of sequencing strategies in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Mexico: a contrast between public and private payer perspectives,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in Mexico. A large proportion of Mexican patients present with advanced disease, and 25% have HER2-positive tumors. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of different sequencing strategies of HER2-targeted agents in Mexico according to various payer perspectives. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four different HER2-targeted treatment sequences among patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in Mexico according to three public and one private payer perspectives. Patients were followed weekly over their remaining life expectancies within the model. Health states considered were progression-free survival (PFS) 1st-3rd lines, and death. Transition probabilities between states were based on published trials. Cost data were obtained from official publications from Mexican healthcare institutions. The evaluated outcomes were PFS, OS, costs, QALYs, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the public payer perspective, sequences containing pertuzumab or T-DM1 were not cost-effective when compared with a sequence including the combination of trastuzumab/docetaxel as first line without subsequent T-DM1 or pertuzumab, even when utilizing alternate definitions for willingness to pay thresholds. In the private payer perspective, a sequence containing T-DM1 but not pertuzumab proved cost-effective at a lower clinical effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: In Mexico, the use of at least three lines of trastuzumab in combination with other therapies, but not with pertuzumab or TDM-1, represents the most cost-effective option for patients covered by the public healthcare system, and this sequence should be made available for all patients.",2017-01-24806,28840424,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Vakaramoko Diaby,2017,166 / 3,951-963,No,28840424,"Vakaramoko Diaby; Askal Ayalew Ali; Krystal J Williams; Kyrian Ezendu; Enrique Soto-Perez-de-Celis; Yanin Chavarri-Guerra; Gilberto de Lima Lopes; Economic evaluation of sequencing strategies in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Mexico: a contrast between public and private payer perspectives, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2017 Dec; 166(3):0167-6806; 951-963",QALY,Mexico,Not Stated,Not Stated,1st line: pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel [THP]; 2nd line: T-DM1; 3rd line: capecitabine vs. Sequence 4: (no T-DM1 or pertuzumab),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.50,3.50,263113.96,United States,2016,283728.33

18112,Economic evaluation of sequencing strategies in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Mexico: a contrast between public and private payer perspectives,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in Mexico. A large proportion of Mexican patients present with advanced disease, and 25% have HER2-positive tumors. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of different sequencing strategies of HER2-targeted agents in Mexico according to various payer perspectives. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four different HER2-targeted treatment sequences among patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in Mexico according to three public and one private payer perspectives. Patients were followed weekly over their remaining life expectancies within the model. Health states considered were progression-free survival (PFS) 1st-3rd lines, and death. Transition probabilities between states were based on published trials. Cost data were obtained from official publications from Mexican healthcare institutions. The evaluated outcomes were PFS, OS, costs, QALYs, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the public payer perspective, sequences containing pertuzumab or T-DM1 were not cost-effective when compared with a sequence including the combination of trastuzumab/docetaxel as first line without subsequent T-DM1 or pertuzumab, even when utilizing alternate definitions for willingness to pay thresholds.

We conducted a cost-effectiveness evaluation of trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination, compared to no vaccination, in children </=60 months of age participating in a prospective cohort study in Bangkok, Thailand. METHODS: A static decision tree model was constructed to simulate the population of children in the cohort. Proportions of children with laboratory-confirmed influenza were derived from children followed weekly. The societal perspective and one-year analytic horizon were used for each influenza season; the model was repeated for three influenza seasons (2012-2014). Direct and indirect costs associated with influenza illness were collected and summed. Cost of the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV3) including promotion, administration, and supervision cost was added for children who were vaccinated. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY), derived from literature, were used to quantify health outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the difference in the expected total costs between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups divided by the difference in QALYs for both groups. RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, IIV3 vaccination among children </=60 months in our cohort was not cost-effective in the introductory year (2012 season; 24,450 USD/QALY gained), highly cost-effective in the 2013 season (554 USD/QALY gained), and cost-effective in the 2014 season (16,200 USD/QALY gained). CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of IIV3 vaccination among children participating in the cohort study varied by influenza season, with vaccine cost and proportion of high-risk children demonstrating the greatest influence in sensitivity analyses.

18116,Economic evaluation of rituximab in addition to standard of care chemotherapy for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"AIMS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive form of leukemia with a poor prognosis in adult patients. The addition of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to standard chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in adults with ALL. However, it is unknown whether the addition of rituximab is cost-effective. The objective was to determine the economic impact of rituximab in addition to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy vs SOC alone in newly-diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative, CD20-positive, B-cell precursor ALL. METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed, based upon the Canadian healthcare system. It included the following health states over a lifetime horizon (max approximately 60 years): event-free survival (EFS), relapsed/resistant disease, cure, and death. SOC was either hyper-CVAD or the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL consortium. EFS, overall survival, and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were derived from a large randomized controlled trial. Costs of the model included: first-line treatment and administration, disease management, second-line and third-line treatment and administration, palliative care, and SAE-related treatments. Inputs were sourced from provincial and national public data, the literature, and cancer agency input. RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 2.20 QALYs with rituximab in addition to SOC. The resulting mean Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was C$21,828/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of C$100,000/QALY, the probability of being cost-effective was 98%. Decision outcomes were robust to the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses, including the SOC backbone as either hyper-CVAD or DFCI. LIMITATIONS: The results of this analysis are limited by generalizability of the chemotherapy backbone to Canadian practice. CONCLUSIONS: For adults with ALL, rituximab in addition to SOC was found to be a cost-effective intervention, compared to SOC alone. The addition of rituximab is associated with increased life years and increased QALYs at a reasonable incremental cost.",2017-01-24812,28837377,J Med Econ,Julian Nam,2017,/,1-13,Yes,28837377,"Julian Nam; Robert Milenkovski; Simon Yunger; Marc Geirnaert; Kristjan Paulson; Matthew Seftel; Economic evaluation of rituximab in addition to standard of care chemotherapy for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-13",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rituximab + chemotherapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,21828,Canada,2015,18663.42
18117,The cost-effectiveness and monetary benefits of dabigatran in the prevention of arterial thromboembolism for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes a significant health and economic burden to the Dutch society. Dabigatran was proven to have at least similar efficacy and a similar or better safety profile when compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in preventing arterial thromboembolism in patients with AF. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and monetary benefit of dabigatran vs VKAs in Dutch patients with non-valvular AF. Value-based pricing considerations and corresponding negotiations on dabigatran will be explicitly considered. METHODS: The base case economic analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. Health effects and costs were analysed using a Markov model. The main model inputs were derived from the RE-LY trial and Dutch observational data. Univariate, probabilistic sensitivity, and various scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: Dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs. A total of 4,552 QALYs were gained, and euro13,892,288 was saved in a cohort of 10,000 AF patients. The economic value of dabigatran was strongly related to the costs of VKA control that are averted. Notably, dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs if annual costs of VKA control exceeded euro159 per person, or dabigatran costs were below euro2.81 per day. CONCLUSION: Dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs for the prevention of atrial thromboembolism in patients with non-valvular AF in the Netherlands. This result appeared robust in the sensitivity analysis.

The purposes of this study were to compare the direct cost and cost-effectiveness of surgery for ASD in the United States (US) and Japan (JP). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 76 US and 76 JP patients receiving surgery for ASD with >/=2-year follow-up was identified. Data analysis included preoperative and postoperative demographic, radiographic, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and direct cost for surgery. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined using cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The cost/QALY was calculated from the 2-year cost and HRQOL data. RESULTS: JP exhibited worse baseline spinopelvic alignment than the US (pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis: 35.4 degrees vs 22.7 degrees , p < 0.01). The US had more three-column osteotomies (50 vs 16%), and shorter hospital stay (7.9 vs 22.7 days) (p < 0.05). The US demonstrated worse postoperative ODI (41.3 vs. 33.9%) and greater revision surgery rate (40 vs 10%) (p < 0.05).

18120,Incremental cost-effectiveness of algorithm-driven genetic testing versus no testing for Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) in Singapore,"BACKGROUND: Offering genetic testing for Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) to all young patients with type 2 diabetes has been shown to be not cost-effective. This study tests whether a novel algorithm-driven genetic testing strategy for MODY is incrementally cost-effective relative to the setting of no testing. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed to estimate the costs and effectiveness of the algorithm-driven MODY testing strategy and a strategy of no genetic testing over a 30-year time horizon from a payer''s perspective. The algorithm uses glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody testing (negative antibodies), age of onset of diabetes (<45 years) and body mass index (<25 kg/m2 if diagnosed >30 years) to stratify the population of patients with diabetes into three subgroups, and testing for MODY only among the subgroup most likely to have the mutation. Singapore-specific costs and prevalence of MODY obtained from local studies and utility values sourced from the literature are used to populate the model. RESULTS: The algorithm-driven MODY testing strategy has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$93 663 per quality-adjusted life year relative to the no testing strategy. If the price of genetic testing falls from US$1050 to US$530 (a 50% decrease), it will become cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Our proposed algorithm-driven testing strategy for MODY is not yet cost-effective based on established benchmarks. However, as genetic testing prices continue to fall, this strategy is likely to become cost-effective in the near future.",2017-01-24818,28835481,J Med Genet,Hai Van Nguyen,2017,54 / 11,747-753,No,28835481,"Hai Van Nguyen; Eric Andrew Finkelstein; Shweta Mital; Daphne Su-Lyn Gardner; Incremental cost-effectiveness of algorithm-driven genetic testing versus no testing for Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) in Singapore, J Med Genet, 2017 Nov; 54(11):1468-6244; 747-753",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Algorithm driven Maturity onset diabetes of the young testing vs. No genetic testing,Not Stated,75 Years,21 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,93663,United States,2015,102275.43

METHODS: A patient-level health state transition model based on levels of visual acuity in the better-seeing eye was constructed to simulate the costs and consequences of patients taking AREDS vitamin supplements. SETTING: UK National Health Service (NHS). The model was populated with data from AREDS and real-world outcomes and resource use from a prospective multicentre national nAMD database study containing 92 976 ranibizumab treatment episodes. INTERVENTIONS: Two treatment approaches were compared: immediate intervention with AREDS supplements or no supplements.

The objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of the Program for the Identification of ''Actionable'' Atrial Fibrillation in the Pharmacy Setting (PIAAF-Pharmacy), which screened 1145 participants aged 65 years or more at 30 community pharmacies in Ontario and Alberta between October 2014 and April 2015. METHODS: We used a 2-part decision model to evaluate the short- and long-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of a pharmacy screening program for atrial fibrillation compared to no screening. Data from the PIAAF-Pharmacy study were used for the short-term model, and the relevant literature was used to extrapolate the benefits of the PIAAF-Pharmacy study in the long-term model. Costs and QALYs were calculated from a payer perspective over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 1.5%/year. RESULTS: Screening for atrial fibrillation in pharmacies was associated with higher costs ($26) and more QALYs (0.0035) compared to no screening, yielding an incremental cost per QALY gained of $7480. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed that screening for atrial fibrillation in a pharmacy setting was a cost-effective strategy. INTERPRETATION: Our results support screening for atrial fibrillation in Canadian pharmacies. Given this finding, efforts should be made by provincial governments and pharmacies to implement such programs in Canada. The addition of atrial fibrillation screening alongside screening and management of other cardiovascular conditions may help to reduce the burden of stroke.",2017-01-24822,28835370,CMAJ Open,Jean-Eric Tarride,2017,5 / 3,E653-E661,No,28835370,"Jean-Eric Tarride; Lisa Dolovich; Gordon Blackhouse; Jason Robert Guertin; Natasha Burke; Veena Manja; Alex Grinvalds; Ting Lim; Jeff S Healey; Roopinder K Sandhu; Screening for atrial fibrillation in Canadian pharmacies: an economic evaluation, CMAJ Open, 2017 Aug 25; 5(3):2291-0026; E653-E661",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Program for the Identification of ‘Actionable’ Atrial Fibrillation in the Pharmacy Setting vs. None,Newly diagnosed,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,6515,Canada,2016,5309.89
18124,Cost-Effectiveness of Intensive versus Standard Blood-Pressure Control,"BACKGROUND: In the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease who received intensive systolic blood-pressure control (target, <120 mm Hg) had significantly lower rates of death and cardiovascular disease events than did those who received standard control (target, <140 mm Hg). On the basis of these data, we wanted to determine the lifetime health benefits and health care costs associated with intensive control versus standard control. METHODS: We used a microsimulation model to apply SPRINT treatment effects and health care costs from national sources to a hypothetical cohort of SPRINT-eligible adults. The model projected lifetime costs of treatment and monitoring in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease events and subsequent treatment costs, treatment-related risks of serious adverse events and subsequent costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for intensive control versus standard control of systolic blood pressure. RESULTS: We determined that the mean number of QALYs would be 0.27 higher among patients who received intensive control than among those who received standard control and would cost approximately $47,000 more per QALY gained if there were a reduction in adherence and treatment effects after 5 years; the cost would be approximately $28,000 more per QALY gained if the treatment effects persisted for the remaining lifetime of the patient. Most simulation results indicated that intensive treatment would be cost-effective (51 to 79% below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY and 76 to 93% below the threshold of $100,000 per QALY), regardless of whether treatment effects were reduced after 5 years or persisted for the remaining lifetime. CONCLUSIONS: In this simulation study, intensive systolic blood-pressure control prevented cardiovascular disease events and prolonged life and did so at levels below common willingness-to-pay thresholds per QALY, regardless of whether benefits were reduced after 5 years or persisted for the patient''s remaining lifetime.

18125,Cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation for chronic refractory constipation in children and adolescents: a Markov model analysis,"AIM: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) compared with conservative treatment in children and adolescents with constipation refractory to conservative management. METHOD: A Markov probabilistic model was used, comparing costs and effectiveness of SNM and conservative treatment in children and adolescents aged 10-18 years with constipation refractory to conservative management. Input for the model regarding transition probabilities, utilities and healthcare costs was based on data from a cohort of patients treated in our centre. This cohort consisted of 30 female patients (mean age 16 years) with functional constipation refractory to conservative management. The mean duration of laxative use in this group was 5.9 years. All patients had a test SNM, followed by a permanent SNM in 27/30. Median follow-up was 22.1 months (range 12.2-36.8). The model was run to simulate a follow-up period of 3 years. RESULTS: The mean cumulative costs for the SNM group and the conservative treatment group were euro17 789 (SD euro2492) and euro7574 (SD euro4332) per patient, respectively. The mean quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in the SNM group was 1.74 (SD 0.19), compared with 0.86 (SD 0.14) in the conservatively managed group. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro12 328 per QALY (SD euro4788). Sensitivity analysis showed that the outcomes were robust to a wide range of model assumptions. CONCLUSION: Chronic constipation seriously affects the quality of life of children and adolescents. Preliminary evidence suggests that SNM can improve symptoms and quality of life at a reasonable cost.",2017-01-24831,28834055,Colorectal Dis,A A van der Wilt,2017,19 / 11,1013-1023,No,28834055,"A A van der Wilt; H H M Groenewoud; M A Benninga; C D Dirksen; C G M I Baeten; N D Bouvy; J Melenhorst; S O Breukink; Cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation for chronic refractory constipation in children and adolescents: a Markov model analysis, Colorectal Dis, 2017 Nov; 19(11):1463-1318; 1013-1023",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sacral neuromodulation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conservative treatment,Not Stated,18 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,4.00,1.50,12328,Euro,2015,14938.7
18126,Cost-effectiveness of Evolocumab Therapy for Reducing Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,"Importance: The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor evolocumab has been demonstrated to reduce the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To our knowledge, long-term cost-effectiveness of this therapy has not been evaluated using clinical trial efficacy data. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of evolocumab in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease when added to standard background therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A Markov cohort state-transition model was used, integrating US population-specific demographics, risk factors, background therapy, and event rates along with trial-based event risk reduction. Costs, including price of drug, utilities, and transitional probabilities, were included from published sources. Exposures: Addition of evolocumab to standard background therapy including statins. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and cardiovascular death, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and net value-based price. Results: In the base case, using US clinical practice patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 70 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) and an annual events rate of 6.4 per 100 patient-years, evolocumab was associated with increased cost and improved QALY: incremental cost, $105398; incremental QALY, 0.39, with an ICER of $268637 per QALY gained ($165689 with discounted price of $10311 based on mean rebate of 29% for branded pharmaceuticals). Sensitivity and scenario analyses demonstrated ICERs ranging from $100193 to $488642 per QALY, with ICER of $413579 per QALY for trial patient characteristics and event rate of 4.2 per 100 patient-years ($270192 with discounted price of $10311) and $483800 if no cardiovascular mortality reduction emerges. Evolocumab treatment exceeded $150000 per QALY in most scenarios but would meet this threshold at an annual net price of $9669 ($6780 for the trial participants) or with the discounted net price of $10311 in patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 80 mg/dL. Conclusions and Relevance: At its current list price of $14523, the addition of evolocumab to standard background therapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease exceeds generally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds. To achieve an ICER of $150000 per QALY, the annual net price would need to be substantially lower ($9669 for US clinical practice and $6780 for trial participants), or a higher-risk population would need to be treated.",2017-01-24837,28832867,JAMA Cardiol,Gregg C Fonarow,2017,2 / 10,1069-1078,No,28832867,"Gregg C Fonarow; Anthony C Keech; Terje R Pedersen; Robert P Giugliano; Peter S Sever; Peter Lindgren; Ben van Hout; Guillermo Villa; Yi Qian; Ransi Somaratne; Marc S Sabatine; Cost-effectiveness of Evolocumab Therapy for Reducing Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, JAMA Cardiol, 2017 Oct 01; 2(10):2380-6591; 1069-1078",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Evolocumab added to standard therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard therapy alone,LDL cholesterol level of at least 70mg/dL,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,268637,United States,2017,283641.52
18127,An economic evaluation of the healthcare cost of tinnitus management in the UK,"BACKGROUND: There is no standard treatment pathway for tinnitus patients in the UK. Possible therapies include education and reassurance, cognitive behavioural therapies, modified tinnitus retraining therapy (education and sound enrichment), or amplification of external sound using hearing aids. However, the effectiveness of most therapies is somewhat controversial. As health services come under economic pressure to deploy resources more effectively there is an increasing need to demonstrate the value of tinnitus therapies, and how value may be continuously enhanced. The objective of this project was to map out existing clinical practice, estimate the NHS costs associated with the management approaches used, and obtain initial indicative estimates of cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Current treatment pathways, costs and health outcomes were determined from the tinnitus literature, national statistics, a patient survey, and expert opinion. These were used to create an Excel-based economic model of therapy options for tinnitus patients. The probabilities associated with the likelihood of an individual patient receiving a particular combination of therapies was used to calculate the average cost of treatment per patient, average health outcome per patient measured in QALYs gained, and cost-effectiveness, measured by the average cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: The average cost of tinnitus treatment per patient per year is GB pound717, equating to an NHS healthcare bill of GB pound750 million per year. Across all pathways, tinnitus therapy costs pound10,600 per QALY gained. Results were relatively insensitive to restrictions on access to cognitive behaviour therapy, and a subsequent reliance on other therapies.

RESULTS: The average cost of tinnitus treatment per patient per year is GB pound717, equating to an NHS healthcare bill of GB pound750 million per year. Across all pathways, tinnitus therapy costs pound10,600 per QALY gained. Results were relatively insensitive to restrictions on access to cognitive behaviour therapy, and a subsequent reliance on other therapies.

18136,An economic evaluation of the healthcare cost of tinnitus management in the UK,"BACKGROUND: There is no standard treatment pathway for tinnitus patients in the UK. Possible therapies include education and reassurance, cognitive behavioural therapies, modified tinnitus retraining therapy (education and sound enrichment), or amplification of external sound using hearing aids. However, the effectiveness of most therapies is somewhat controversial. As health services come under economic pressure to deploy resources more effectively there is an increasing need to demonstrate the value of tinnitus therapies, and how value may be continuously enhanced. The objective of this project was to map out existing clinical practice, estimate the NHS costs associated with the management approaches used, and obtain initial indicative estimates of cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Current treatment pathways, costs and health outcomes were determined from the tinnitus literature, national statistics, a patient survey, and expert opinion. These were used to create an Excel-based economic model of therapy options for tinnitus patients. The probabilities associated with the likelihood of an individual patient receiving a particular combination of therapies was used to calculate the average cost of treatment per patient, average health outcome per patient measured in QALYs gained, and cost-effectiveness, measured by the average cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: The average cost of tinnitus treatment per patient per year is GB pound717, equating to an NHS healthcare bill of GB pound750 million per year.

The objectives of this modelling study are to describe the extra costs and expected health gains associated with admission to the ICU versus the general ward for 30,712 patients and the variation in cost-effectiveness estimates among subgroups and individuals, and to perform a distribution-weighted economic evaluation incorporating extra weighting to patients with high severity of disease. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic model that estimates the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (ICER) from ICU admission compared with general ward care using Norwegian registry data from 2008 to 2010. We assigned increasing weights to health gains for those with higher severity of disease, defined as less expected lifetime health if not admitted. The study has inherent uncertainty of findings because a randomized clinical trial comparing patients admitted or rejected to the ICU has never been performed. Uncertainty is explored in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The mean cost-effectiveness of ICU admission versus ward care was euro11,600/QALY, with 1.6 QALYs gained and an incremental cost of euro18,700 per patient. The probability (p) of cost-effectiveness was 95% at a threshold of euro22,000/QALY. The mean ICER for medical admissions was euro10,700/QALY (p = 97%), euro12,300/QALY (p = 93%) for admissions after acute surgery, and euro14,700/QALY (p = 84%) after planned surgery. For individualized ICERs, there was a 50% probability that ICU admission was cost-effective for 85% of the patients at a threshold of euro64,000/QALY, leaving 15% of the admissions not cost-effective. In the distributional evaluation, 8% of all patients had distribution-weighted ICERs (higher weights to gains for more severe conditions) above euro64,000/QALY. High-severity admissions gained the most, and were more cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: On average, ICU admission versus general ward care was cost-effective at a threshold of euro22,000/QALY (p = 95%). According to the individualized cost-effectiveness information, one in six ICU admissions was not cost-effective at a threshold of euro64,000/QALY.

18141,Cost-effectiveness of golimumab for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in Quebec using a patient level state transition microsimulation,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct cost-effectiveness analyses comparing the addition of golimumab to the standard of care (SoC) for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who are refractory to conventional therapies in Quebec (Canada). METHODS: An individual patient state transition microsimulation model was developed to project health outcomes and costs over 10 years, using a payer perspective. The incremental benefit estimates for golimumab were driven by induction response and risk of a flare. Flare risks post-induction were derived for golimumab from the PURSUIT maintenance trial and extension study, while those for SoC were derived from the placebo arms of the Active Ulcerative Colitis Trials (ACT) 1 and 2. Other inputs were derived from multiple sources, including retrospective claims analyses and literature. Costs are reported in 2014 Canadian dollars. A 5% annual discount rate was applied to costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Compared with SoC, golimumab was projected to increase the time spent in mild disease or remission states, decrease flare rates, and increase QALYs. These gains were achieved with higher direct medical costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for golimumab vs SoC was $63,487 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: The long-term flare projections for SoC were based on the data available from the ACT 1 and 2 placebo arms, as data were not available from the PURSUIT maintenance or extension trial. Additionally, the study was limited to only SoC and golimumab, due to the availability of individual patient data to analyze. CONCLUSION: This economic analysis concluded that treatment with golimumab is likely more cost-effective vs SoC when considering cost-effectiveness acceptability thresholds from $50,000-$100,000 per QALY.",2017-01-24841,28830258,J Med Econ,Sean Stern,2017,/,1-11,Yes,28830258,"Sean Stern; Alexandra J Ward; Catherine Saint-Laurent Thibault; Fernando Camacho; Elham Rahme; Dominik Naessens; Guy Aumais; Edmond-Jean Bernard; Raymond Bourdages; Albert Cohen; Pierre Pare; Peter Dyrda; Cost-effectiveness of golimumab for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in Quebec using a patient level state transition microsimulation, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-11",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Golimumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard care,Moderate-to-severe disease,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,63847,Canada,2014,63236.21
18142,Cost effectiveness of a practice-based intervention to improve vaccination rates in adults less than 65-years-old,"The cost-effectiveness of the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program to improve vaccination rates in adults <65-years-old is unknown. Two vaccines, influenza and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis), were targeted for this age group. Cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with control, with a primary outcome of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, was estimated from societal and third party payer perspectives over a 10-year time horizon using a decision analysis model. Vaccination rates and intervention costs were derived from an intervention trial, and vaccine effectiveness, illness rates, and costs with/without vaccination were obtained from US databases and literature data. Future costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3%/year. The intervention cost was $1.78 per eligible patient/year. From the societal perspective, per patient total vaccination and illness costs with the intervention were $27.43 higher than control while gaining 0.00087 QALYs, costing $31,700/QALY gained. The intervention, extrapolated to the US population, could prevent 4.2 million cases, 87,489 hospitalizations, and 5,680 deaths due to influenza over 10 y in adults <65-years-old. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the intervention was favored in 68.2% of model runs at a $50,000/QALY level and in 94.3% at $100,000/QALY. In a separate scenario analysis, the intervention became cost saving if influenza economic burden was >$2,099 per case (societal base case $846).

DESIGN: Economic analysis using the School for Public Health Research Diabetes Prevention Model. SETTING: England 2015-2016. POPULATION: Adults aged >/=16 with high risk of type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6%-6.4%). Population subgroups defined by age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, baseline body mass index, baseline HbA1c and working status. INTERVENTIONS: The proposed NHS DPP: an intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on dietary advice, physical activity and weight loss. Comparator: no diabetes prevention intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs, savings and return on investment, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), diabetes cases, cardiovascular cases and net monetary benefit from an NHS perspective. RESULTS: Intervention costs will be recouped through NHS savings within 12 years, with net NHS saving of pound1.28 over 20 years for each pound1 invested. Per 100 000 DPP interventions given, 3552 QALYs are gained. The DPP is most cost-effective and cost-saving in obese individuals, those with baseline HbA1c 6.2%-6.4% and those aged 40-74. QALY gains are lower in minority ethnic and low socioeconomic status subgroups. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that there is 97% probability that the DPP will be cost-effective within 20 years. NHS savings are highly sensitive to intervention cost, effectiveness and duration of effect. CONCLUSIONS: The DPP is likely to be cost-effective and cost-saving under current assumptions. Prioritising obese individuals could create the most value for money and obtain the greatest health benefits per individual targeted.

DESIGN: Economic analysis using the School for Public Health Research Diabetes Prevention Model. SETTING: England 2015-2016. POPULATION: Adults aged >/=16 with high risk of type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6%-6.4%). Population subgroups defined by age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, baseline body mass index, baseline HbA1c and working status. INTERVENTIONS: The proposed NHS DPP: an intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on dietary advice, physical activity and weight loss. Comparator: no diabetes prevention intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs, savings and return on investment, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), diabetes cases, cardiovascular cases and net monetary benefit from an NHS perspective. RESULTS: Intervention costs will be recouped through NHS savings within 12 years, with net NHS saving of pound1.28 over 20 years for each pound1 invested. Per 100 000 DPP interventions given, 3552 QALYs are gained. The DPP is most cost-effective and cost-saving in obese individuals, those with baseline HbA1c 6.2%-6.4% and those aged 40-74.

18151,Multiple treatment comparison of seven new drugs for patients with advanced malignant melanoma: a systematic review and health economic decision model in a Norwegian setting,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of seven new drugs (cobimetinib, dabrafenib, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, trametinib and vemurafenib) used for treatment of patients with advanced malignant melanoma in the Norwegian setting. DESIGN: A multiple technology assessment. PATIENTS: Patients with advanced malignant melanoma aged 18 or older. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search for randomised controlled trials in relevant bibliographic databases. METHODS: We performed network meta-analyses using both direct and indirect evidence with dacarbazine as a common comparator. We ranked the different treatments in terms of their likelihood of leading to the best results for each endpoint. The cost-utility analysis was based on a probabilistic discrete-time Markov cohort model. The model calculated the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with different treatment strategies from a healthcare perspective. Sensitivity analysis was performed by means of Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Monotherapies with a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor had a higher probability of good performance for overall survival than monotherapies with ipilimumab or BRAF/MEK inhibitors. The combination treatments had all similar levels of effectiveness to the PD-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitors.PD-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitors are more effective and more costly compared with ipilimumab in monotherapy. Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab had higher costs and the same level of effectiveness as the PD-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitors in monotherapy.BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetinib) had both similar effectiveness and cost-effectiveness; however, the combination therapies are more likely to give higher quality adjusted life year gains than BRAF or MEK inhibitor monotherapies, but to a higher cost. CONCLUSIONS: None of the drugs investigated can be considered cost-effective at what has normally been considered a reasonable willingness-to-pay (WTP) in Norway.

The combination treatments had all similar levels of effectiveness to the PD-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitors.PD-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitors are more effective and more costly compared with ipilimumab in monotherapy. Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab had higher costs and the same level of effectiveness as the PD-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitors in monotherapy.BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetinib) had both similar effectiveness and cost-effectiveness; however, the combination therapies are more likely to give higher quality adjusted life year gains than BRAF or MEK inhibitor monotherapies, but to a higher cost.

18161,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of nationwide campaigns for awareness and case finding of hepatitis C targeted at people who inject drugs and the general population in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is a serious, but underdiagnosed disease that can generally be treated successfully. Therefore, a nationwide HCV awareness campaign was implemented in the Netherlands targeting people who inject drugs (PWID) in addiction care (''PWID intervention'') and high-risk groups in the general population (''public intervention''). The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the interventions used in this campaign. METHODS: For the ''PWID'' intervention, all addiction care centres in the Netherlands provided proactive individual HCV consultation and testing. The ''public intervention'' consisted of health education through mass media and instruction of health care professionals. A Markov chain model was used to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, cost per QALY gained). We included a ''DAA treatment'' scenario to estimate the effect of these treatment strategies on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The ''PWID intervention'' identified 257 additional HCV-carriers. The ICER was euro9056 (95% CI: euro6043-euro13,523) when compared to ''no intervention''. The ''public intervention'' identified 38 additional HCV-carriers. The ICER was euro18,421 (95% CI: euro7376-euro25,490,119) when compared to ''no intervention''. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability that the ''PWID intervention'' was cost-effective was 100%. It also showed a probability of 34% that the ''public intervention'' did not exceed the Dutch threshold for cost-effectiveness (euro20,000). New treatment regimens are likely to improve cost-effectiveness of this strategy. CONCLUSION: In a nationwide HCV awareness and case finding campaign, the intervention targeting PWID was effective and cost-effective.

18163,Cost-effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cervical Spine Clearance of Neurologically Intact Patients With Blunt Trauma,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for cervical clearance after a negative cervical computed tomography (CT) scan result in alert patients with blunt trauma who are neurologically intact is not infrequent, despite poor evidence in regard to its utility. The objective of this study is to evaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of using MRI versus no follow-up in this patient population. METHODS: A modeling-based decision analysis was performed during the lifetime of a 40-year-old individual from a societal perspective. The 2 strategies compared were no follow-up and MRI. A Markov model with a 3% discount rate was used with parameters from the literature. Base cases and probabilistic and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the strategies. RESULTS: The cost of MRI follow-up was $11,477, with a health benefit of 24.03 quality-adjusted life-years; the cost of no follow-up was $6,432, with a health benefit of 24.08 quality-adjusted life-years. No follow-up was the dominant strategy, with a lower cost and a higher utility. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed no follow-up to be the better strategy in all 10,000 iterations. No follow-up was the better strategy irrespective of the negative predictive value of initial CT result, and it remained the better strategy when the incidence of missed unstable injury resulting in permanent neurologic deficits was less than 64.2% and the incidence of patients immobilized with a hard collar who still received cord injury was greater than 19.7%.

A comparative analysis of both drugs in contemporary European ACS patients is lacking. METHODS: To address this issue, cardiac and bleeding events of 2 ""sister"" multicenter stent trials, BASKET-PROVE (BP) I with clopidogrel and BPII with prasugrel (for 12months each) were used in a hybrid analysis. Medication costs were 2015 sales prices, event costs modelled for Denmark (DNK), Germany (GER) and Switzerland (SUI) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) by EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. RESULTS: In BPI and II, 1012 and 985 ACS-patients received drug eluting stents, respectively, followed-up for 2years.

18167,Health economics of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) for early breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: The clinical effectiveness of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) has been confirmed in the randomised TARGIT-A (targeted intraoperative radiotherapy-alone) trial to be similar to a several weeks'' course of whole-breast external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with early breast cancer. This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of TARGIT-IORT to inform policy decisions about its wider implementation. SETTING: TARGIT-A randomised clinical trial (ISRCTN34086741) which compared TARGIT with traditional EBRT and found similar breast cancer control, particularly when TARGIT was given simultaneously with lumpectomy. METHODS: Cost-utility analysis using decision analytic modelling by a Markov model. A cost-effectiveness Markov model was developed using TreeAge Pro V.2015. The decision analytic model compared two strategies of radiotherapy for breast cancer in a hypothetical cohort of patients with early breast cancer based on the published health state transition probability data from the TARGIT-A trial. Analysis was performed for UK setting and National Health Service (NHS) healthcare payer''s perspective using NHS cost data and treatment outcomes were simulated for both strategies for a time horizon of 10 years. Model health state utilities were drawn from the published literature. Future costs and effects were discounted at the rate of 3.5%. To address uncertainty, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: In the base case analysis, TARGIT-IORT was a highly cost-effective strategy yielding health gain at a lower cost than its comparator EBRT. Discounted TARGIT-IORT and EBRT costs for the time horizon of 10 years were pound12 455 and pound13 280, respectively. TARGIT-IORT gained 0.18 incremental QALY as the discounted QALYs gained by TARGIT-IORT were 8.15 and by EBRT were 7.97 showing TARGIT-IORT as a dominant strategy over EBRT. Model outputs were robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: TARGIT-IORT is a dominant strategy over EBRT, being less costly and producing higher QALY gain.

18168,Cost-effectiveness of a patient navigation program to improve cervical cancer screening,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a community-based patient navigation program to improve cervical cancer screening among Hispanic women 18 or older in San Antonio, Texas. STUDY DESIGN: We used a microsimulation model of cervical cancer to project the long-term cost-effectiveness of a community-based patient navigation program compared with current practice. METHODS: We used program data from 2012 to 2015 and published data from the existing literature as model input. Taking a societal perspective, we estimated the lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years and conducted 2-way sensitivity analyses to account for parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The patient navigation program resulted in a per-capita gain of 0.2 years of life expectancy. The program was highly cost-effective relative to no intervention (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $748). The program costs would have to increase up to 10 times from $311 for it not to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The 3-year community-based patient navigation program effectively increased cervical cancer screening uptake and adherence and improved the cost-effectiveness of the screening program for Hispanic women 18 years or older in San Antonio, Texas.

18169,Re-evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and effects of childhood rotavirus vaccination in Norway,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccination was included into the Norwegian childhood immunisation programme in 2014. Before implementation, rotavirus vaccination was found to be cost-effective from a societal perspective, but not from a healthcare perspective. Since introduction, new data on the incidence and economic effects of rotavirus disease have become available. We assessed early epidemiological effects of the rotavirus vaccination programme and re-evaluated its cost-effectiveness in Norway for the years 2015-2019. METHODS: Using a dynamic transmission model, we compared the epidemiological effects of the ongoing two-dose vaccination programme with Rotarix(R), and a hypothetical 3-dose programme with RotaTeq(R) with no vaccination. A baseline cost of euro 54 per fully vaccinated child was used. Cost-effectiveness was computed from a healthcare and societal perspective, using a decision analytical model. Data on healthcare use and costs, productivity losses and health utilities were based on published and own estimates. Uncertainty was accounted for in one-way, multi-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: During 2015-2019, 114,658 home care cases, 34,571 primary care cases, 7,381 severe cases, and 2 deaths associated with rotavirus disease were avoided due to vaccination. Under baseline assumptions vaccination was cost-effective from a healthcare perspective with a cost per QALY of euro 47,447 for Rotarix(R) and euro 52,709 for RotaTeq(R). The break-even price was euro 70 for Rotarix(R) and euro 67 for RotaTeq(R). Vaccination was cost-saving from the societal perspective, and also from a healthcare perspective for vaccine prices below euro 25 and euro 22 per vaccinated child for Rotarix(R) and RotaTeq(R), respectively.

18171,Is Two-level Cervical Disc Replacement More Cost-effective Than Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion at 7 Years?,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the 7-year cost-effectiveness of two-level cervical disc replacement (CDR) and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CDR and ACDF are both effective treatment strategies for managing degenerative conditions of the cervical spine. CDR has been shown to be a more-cost effective intervention in the short term, but the long-term cost-effectiveness has not been established. METHODS: We analyzed 7-year follow-up data from the two-level Medtronic Prestige LP investigational device exemption study. Short-form 36 (SF-36) data were converted into health utility scores using the SF-6D algorithm. Costs were based on direct costs from the payer perspective, and effectiveness was measured as quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The willingness to pay (WTP) threshold was set to $50,000/QALY. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted via Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Two-level CDR had a 7-year cost of $176,654.19, generated 4.65 QALYs, and had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $37,993.53/QALY. Two-level ACDF had a 7-year cost of $158,373.48, generated 4.44 QALYs, and had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $35,635.72. CDR was associated with an incremental cost of $18,280.71 and an incremental effectiveness of 0.21 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $89,021.04, above the WTP threshold. Our Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated CDR would be chosen 46% of the time based on 10,000 simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Two-level CDR and ACDF are both cost-effective procedures at 7-year follow-up for treating degenerative conditions of the cervical spine. Based on an ICER of $89,021.04/QALY, we cannot conclude which treatment is the more cost-effective option at 7-years. CDR would be chosen 46% of the time based on 10,000 iterations of our Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

18172,The value of frontal sinusotomy for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps-A cost utility analysis,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The number of surgical procedures performed for frontal sinusitis and the associated costs have increased dramatically over the past decade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic frontal sinusotomy (EFS) in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort-style Markov decision-tree economic model with a 36-year time horizon. METHODS: Matched cohorts of CRSwNP patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) with (n = 139) and without (n = 49) EFS were compared to each other and to patients (n = 139) from the Medical Expenditures Survey Panel database who underwent medical management for chronic rhinosinusitis. Multi-year health utility values were calculated from responses to the EuroQol 5-Dimension instrument. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Decision analysis showed that ESS without EFS proved more cost-effective than ESS with EFS or medical management. ESS without EFS compared to medical management yielded an ICER of $9,004/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). ESS with EFS compared to ESS without EFS yielded an ICER of $62,310/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY, ESS without EFS was more cost-effective than ESS with EFS with 52.1% certainty. These results were robust to one-way analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: ESS remains a cost-effective intervention compared to medical therapy alone for patients with CRSwNP. In this study, the addition of frontal sinusotomy during ESS for patients with CRSwNP was not found to be cost-effective at a WTP threshold of $50,000/QALY, but may be cost effective at a higher threshold of $100,000/QALY.

18174,The impact of urban speed reduction programmes on health system cost and utilities,"BACKGROUND: Vehicle speed changes impact the probability of injuring a pedestrian in ways that differ from the way that it impacts the probability of a collision or of death.

The net result of this difference may lead to an increase in injury costs due to the implementation of a speed reduction programme. We find that even small investments in speed reductions have the potential to produce gains in QALYs.

18180,The impact of urban speed reduction programmes on health system cost and utilities,"BACKGROUND: Vehicle speed changes impact the probability of injuring a pedestrian in ways that differ from the way that it impacts the probability of a collision or of death. Therefore, return on investment in speed reduction programmes has complex and unpredictable manifests. The objective of this study is to analyse the impact of motor vehicle speed reduction on the collision-related morbidity and mortality rates of urban pedestrians. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a simple way to estimate the public health impacts of traffic speed changes using a Markov model. Our outcome measures include the cost of injury, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and probability of death and injury due to a road traffic collision. Our two-way sensitivity analysis of speed, both before the implementation of a speed reduction programme and after, shows that, due to key differences in the probability of injury compared with the probability of death, speed reduction programmes may decrease the probability of death while leaving the probability of injury unchanged. The net result of this difference may lead to an increase in injury costs due to the implementation of a speed reduction programme. We find that even small investments in speed reductions have the potential to produce gains in QALYs.

18181,Cost-effectiveness analysis of telephone-based support for the management of pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injury in India and Bangladesh,"OBJECTIVE: To determine from a societal perspective the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of telephone-based support for management of pressure ulcers. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of a randomised clinical trial. SETTING: Tertiary centre in India and Bangladesh. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomised clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of telephone-based support (intervention group) with usual care (control group). The analyses evaluated costs and health outcomes in terms of cm2 reduction of pressure ulcers size and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. All costs were in Indian Rupees (INR) and then converted to US dollars (USD). RESULTS: The mean (95% confidence interval) between-group difference for the reduction in size of pressure ulcers was 0.53 (-3.12 to 4.32) cm2, favouring the intervention group. The corresponding QALYs were 0.027 (0.004-0.051), favouring the intervention group. The mean total cost per participant in the intervention group was INR 43 781 (USD 2460) compared to INR 42 561 (USD 2391) for the control group. The per participant cost of delivering the intervention was INR 2110 (USD 119). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was INR 2306 (USD 130) per additional cm2 reduction in the size of the pressure ulcer and INR 44 915 (USD 2523) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: In terms of QALYs, telephone-based support to help people manage pressure ulcers at home provides good value for money and has an 87% probability of being cost-effective, based on 3 times gross domestic product. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the overall cost data with and without productivity costs, and did not alter this conclusion.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 15 August 2017; doi:10.1038/sc.2017.87.",2017-01-24883,28809389,Spinal Cord,M Arora,2017,/,,No,28809389,"M Arora; L A Harvey; J V Glinsky; H S Chhabra; M S Hossain; N Arumugam; P K Bedi; I D Cameron; A J Hayes; Cost-effectiveness analysis of telephone-based support for the management of pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injury in India and Bangladesh, Spinal Cord, 2017 Aug 15; ():1362-4393",QALY,India,Not Stated,Not Stated,Telephone-based support vs. Standard/Usual Care- Usual care,"Patients had at least one pressure ulcer (on the sacrum, ischial tuberosity or greater trochanter of the femur)",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,44915,India,2015,765.54
18182,A cost-utility analysis of Dynesys dynamic stabilization versus instrumented fusion for the treatment of degenerative lumbar spine diseases,"BACKGROUND: Symptomatic chronic low back and leg pain resulting from lumbar spine degenerative disorders is highly prevalent in China, and for some patients, surgery is the final option for improvement. Several techniques for spinal non-fusion have been introduced to reduce the side-effects of fusion methods and hasten postoperative recovery. In this study, the authors have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Dynesys posterior dynamic stabilization system (DY) compared with lumbar fusion techniques in the treatment of single-level degenerative lumbar spinal conditions. METHODS: A total of 221 patients undergoing single-level elective primary surgery for degenerative lumbar pathology were included. 2-Year postoperative health outcomes of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires were recorded. 2-Year back-related medical resource use, missed work, and health-state values (Quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) were assessed. Cost-effectiveness was determined by the incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: At each follow-up point, both cohorts were associated with significant improvements in VAS scores, ODI, SF-36 scores and EQ-5D QALY scores, which persisted at the 2-year evaluation. The 2-year total mean cost per patient were significantly lower for Dynesys system ($20,150) compared to fusion techniques ($25,581, $27,862 and $27,314, respectively) (P < 0.001).

Emerging evidence shows that post HSIL treatment adjuvant quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination improves the effectiveness of treatment. However, no recommendations exist regarding the use of qHPV vaccine as an adjuvant form of therapy. Our objective was to determine whether post-treatment adjuvant vaccination should be adopted in HIV-infected MSM (individuals at highest risk for anal cancer) on the basis of cost-effectiveness determined using existing evidence or whether future research is needed. METHODS: We developed a Markov (state-transition) cohort model to assess the cost-effectiveness of post-treatment adjuvant HPV vaccination of 27years or older HIV-infected MSM. We first estimated cost-effectiveness and then performed value-of-information (VOI) analysis to determine whether future research is required by estimating the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). We also estimated expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) to determine what new evidences should have highest priority. RESULTS: With the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $71,937/QALY, ""treatment plus vaccination"" was the most cost-effective HSIL management strategy using the willingness-to-pay threshold of 100,000/QALY.

18188,Cost Effectiveness of Nivolumab in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, new drugs have been introduced for second-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Nivolumab increases overall survival and is associated with less toxicity compared to everolimus in this setting according to the CheckMate 025 study. However, because of the high cost of nivolumab, there is a need to define its value by considering both efficacy and cost. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of nivolumab for second-line treatment of advanced RCC from the US payer perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nivolumab with those of everolimus and placebo in second-line treatment of advanced RCC. Health outcomes were measured in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs). Drug costs were based on 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Model robustness was assessed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We addressed the issue of the extensive duration of immunotherapy treatment among long-term survivors, which may or may not be approved by payers. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The total mean cost per patient was $101 070 for nivolumab and $50 935 for everolimus. Nivolumab generated a gain of 0.24 LYs (0.34 QALYs) compared to everolimus. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for nivolumab was $146 532/QALY versus everolimus and $226 197/QALY versus placebo. Limiting the maximal treatment duration of nivolumab to 2 yr reduced the ICER to $121 788/QALY versus everolimus. The analysis is limited by data availability and our assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis established that with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 to $150 000 per QALY, nivolumab is estimated to be cost-effective versus everolimus, but not cost-effective versus placebo.

18190,Depression screening with patient-targeted feedback in cardiology: The cost-effectiveness of DEPSCREEN-INFO,"BACKGROUND: Although depression is common in patients with heart disease, screening for depression is much debated. DEPSCREEN-INFO showed that a patient-targeted feedback in addition to screening results in lower depression level six months after screening. The purpose of this analysis was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of DEPSCREEN-INFO. METHODS: Patients with coronary heart disease or arterial hypertension were included. Participants in both groups were screened for depression. Participants in the intervention group additionally received a patient-targeted feedback of their result and recommended treatment options. A cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) based on the EQ-5D was performed. The time horizon was 6 months. Resource utilization was assessed by a telephone interview. Multiple imputation using chained equations was used. Net-benefit regressions controlled for prognostic variables at baseline were performed to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Different sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: 375 participants (intervention group: 155; control group: 220) were included at baseline. After 6 months, in the intervention group adjusted total costs were lower (-euro2,098; SE: euro1,717) and more QALY were gained (0.0067; SD: 0.0133); yet differences were not statistically significant.

18191,A cost-effectiveness comparison of the NICE 2015 and WHO 2013 diagnostic criteria for women with gestational diabetes with and without risk factors,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness (CE) of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2015 and the WHO 2013 diagnostic thresholds for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). SETTING: The analysis was from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 6221 patients from four of the Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study centres (two UK, two Australian), 6308 patients from the Atlantic Diabetes in Pregnancy study and 12 755 patients from UK clinical practice. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES PLANNED: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), net monetary benefit (NMB) and the probability of being cost-effective at CE thresholds of pound20 000 and pound30 000 per QALY. RESULTS: In a population of pregnant women from the four HAPO study centres and using NICE-defined risk factors for GDM, diagnosing GDM using NICE 2015 criteria had an NMB of pound239 902 (relative to no treatment) at a CE threshold of pound30 000 per QALY compared with WHO 2013 criteria, which had an NMB of pound186 675. NICE 2015 criteria had a 51.5% probability of being cost-effective compared with the WHO 2013 diagnostic criteria, which had a 27.6% probability of being cost-effective (no treatment had a 21.0% probability of being cost-effective). For women without NICE risk factors in this population, the NMBs for NICE 2015 and WHO 2013 criteria were both negative relative to no treatment and no treatment had a 78.1% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSION: The NICE 2015 diagnostic criteria for GDM can be considered cost-effective relative to the WHO 2013 alternative at a CE threshold of pound30 000 per QALY.

The aim is to determine the cost-effectiveness of a proactive integrated primary care program. METHODS: Economic evaluation embedded in a single-blind, 3-armed, cluster-randomized controlled trial with 12 months'' follow-up in 39 general practices in the Netherlands. General practices were randomized to one of 3 trial arms: (1) an electronic frailty screening instrument using routine medical record data followed by standard general practitioner (GP) care; (2) this screening instrument followed by a nurse-led care program; or (3) usual care. Health resource utilization data were collected using electronic medical records and questionnaires. Associated costs were calculated. A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was undertaken. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was calculated comparing proactive screening arm with usual care, and screening plus nurse-led care arm with usual care, as well as the screening arm with screening plus nurse-led care arm. RESULTS: Out of 7638 potential participants, 3092 (40.5%) older adults participated. Whereas effect differences were minor, the total costs per patient were lower in both intervention groups compared with usual care.

18196,Impact of pelvic floor muscle training on sexual function of women with urinary incontinence and a comparison of electrical stimulation versus standard treatment (IPSU trial): a randomised controlled trial,"AIMS: To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of electric stimulation plus standard pelvic floor muscle training compared to standard pelvic floor muscle training alone in women with urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. METHODS: Single centre two arm parallel group randomised controlled trial conducted in a Teaching hospital in England. Participants were women presenting with urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. The interventions compared were electric stimulation versus standard pelvic floor muscle training. OUTCOME MEASURES: included Prolapse and Incontinence Sexual function Questionnaire (PISQ) physical function dimension at post-treatment (primary); other dimensions of PISQ, SF-36; EQ-5D, EPAQ, resource use, adverse events and cost-effectiveness (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: 114 women were randomised (Intervention n=57; Control group n=57). 64/114 (56%). PARTICIPANTS: had valid primary outcome data at follow-up (Intervention 30; Control 34). The mean PISQ-PF dimension scores at follow-up were 33.1 (SD 5.5) and 32.3 (SD 5.2) for the Intervention and Control groups respectively; with the Control group having a higher (better) score. After adjusting for baseline score, BMI, menopausal status, time from randomisation and baseline oxford scale score the mean difference was -1.0 (95% CI: -4.0 to 1.9; P=0.474). There was no differences between the groups in any of the secondary outcomes at follow-up. Within this study, the use of electrical stimulation was cost-effective with very small incremental costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). CONCLUSIONS: In women presenting with urinary incontinence in conjunction with sexual dysfunction, physiotherapy is beneficial to improve overall sexual function.

18197,Reaching hepatitis C virus elimination targets requires health system interventions to enhance the care cascade,"BACKGROUND: Modelling suggests that achieving the World Health Organization''s elimination targets for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is possible by scaling up use of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. However, poor linkage to health services and retention in care presents a major barrier, in particular among people who inject drugs (PWID). We identify and assess the cost-effectiveness of additional health system interventions required to achieve HCV elimination targets in Australia, a setting where all people living with HCV have access to DAA therapy. METHODS: We used a dynamic HCV transmission and liver-disease progression mathematical model among current and former PWID, capturing testing, treatment and other features of the care cascade. Interventions tested were: availability of point-of-care RNA testing; increased testing of PWID; using biomarkers in place of liver stiffness measurement; and scaling up primary care treatment delivery. RESULTS: The projected treatment uptake in Australia reduced the number of people living with HCV from approximately 230,000 in 2015 to approximately 24,000 by 2030 and reduced incidence by 45%. However, the majority (74%) of remaining infections were undiagnosed and among PWID. Scaling up primary care treatment delivery and using biomarkers in place of liver stiffness measurement only reduced incidence by a further 1% but saved AU$32 million by 2030, with no change to health outcomes. Additionally replacing HCV antibody testing with point-of-care RNA testing increased healthcare cost savings to AU$62 million, increased incidence reduction to 64% and gained 11,000 quality-adjusted life years, but critically, additional screening of PWID was required to achieve HCV elimination targets.
