24901,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Oral Direct-Acting Antivirals for Chinese Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: All oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have shown excellent efficacy and safety in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, the cost of DAAs used to be expensive; therefore, large numbers of patients had no access to DAAs in China. Recently, prices have been greatly reduced. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) in Chinese CHC patients stratified by hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT), cirrhosis status, and treatment history. METHODS: On the basis of a Chinese healthcare perspective, a Markov model was constructed to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes of patients treated with different DAA regimens. Chinese-specific clinical, cost, and utility inputs were obtained or calculated from published sources and expert opinions. Costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported as primary outcomes. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted. RESULTS: At a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$30,081/QALY (calculated by three times the GDP per capita in China), SOF/VEL was cost-effective in patients with HCV GT 1, 3, and 6 infections, and the probabilities that SOF/VEL was cost-effective were 9.7-75.7%, 39.1-63.9%, and 35.6-88.0%, respectively. For GT2 patients, noncirrhotic patients, treatment-naïve patients, and treatment-experienced patients, LDV/SOF was the most cost-effective regimen, and the probabilities of cost-effectiveness for each of these groups was 92.1-99.8%, 89.9-99.0%, 61.6-91.2%, and 99.3-100.0%, respectively below the WTP threshold. The GLE/PIB regimen (12-week duration) was the most cost-effective in cirrhotic patients, whereas the probability of its cost-effectiveness varied with that of EBR/GZR (4.1-93.8% versus 6.2-93.3%) below the WTP threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, SOF/VEL and LDV/SOF regimens are more likely to be cost-effective among various subgroups of Chinese patients with CHC.",2020-01-34898,33210262,J. Int.

24911,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Oral Direct-Acting Antivirals for Chinese Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: All oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have shown excellent efficacy and safety in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, the cost of DAAs used to be expensive; therefore, large numbers of patients had no access to DAAs in China. Recently, prices have been greatly reduced. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) in Chinese CHC patients stratified by hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT), cirrhosis status, and treatment history. METHODS: On the basis of a Chinese healthcare perspective, a Markov model was constructed to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes of patients treated with different DAA regimens. Chinese-specific clinical, cost, and utility inputs were obtained or calculated from published sources and expert opinions. Costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported as primary outcomes. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted.

24913,Cost-Effectiveness of Tucatinib in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer From the US and Chinese Perspectives,"Background: The clinical evaluation of HER2CLIMB trial showed a 21. 9-month median overall survival with the triplet regimens of tucatinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab (TXT) for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. From the payer''s perspective of the United States and China, a cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to evaluate the costs and benefits of adding tucatinib in this study. Methods: We constructed a Markov model for the economic evaluation of adding tucatinib to trastuzumab plus capecitabine in patients with HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer in the United States and China. The model was conducted with a 10-year time horizon, and the health status was divided into three states: progression-free survival, progressing disease, and death. The health utility scores were consistent with published literature with similar patient status. The transition probabilities were derived from the survival data of the HER2CLIMB study. The unit prices of medicines were obtained from the West China Hospital, Red Book, and published literature. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which robustness was evaluated by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared with the two-drug regimen of trastuzumab plus capecitabine (TX), the addition of tucatinib increased 0.21 QALY, with an increasing cost of $146,995.05 and $19,022.97 in the United States and China, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the TXT versus TX was $699,976.43 in the U.S. and $90,585.57 in China, both of which are higher than their respective threshold of willingness to play. Deterministic sensitivity analysis shows that the price of tucatinib is the parameter that has the most significant impact on ICERs, but it does not change the results of the model. Probability sensitivity analysis shows that the probability of cost-effective for TXT is 0 in the base case.

24915,The effect of PD-L1 categories-directed pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for newly diagnosed metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy improve outcomes in newly diagnosed metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to evaluate the economic outcomes of first-line treatment by adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with and without the use of PD-L1 testing for patient selection. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was adopted to project the disease course of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous and squamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations. The efficacy and toxicity data were gathered from the KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 trials. Transition probabilities were estimated from the reported survival probabilities in each group. Cost and health preference data were derived from published economic evaluations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured, and subgroup, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed for exploring the model uncertainties. RESULTS: In the US context, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is projected to increase quality-adjusted-life year (QALY) by 1.168 and 0.988 in comparison with chemotherapy and the ICERs were $122,248 and $121,375/QALY in the whole nonsquamous and squamous patients with unconfirmed PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS), respectively. After the selection of patients by PD-L1 TPS by PD-L1 testing, the ICERs of adding pembrolizumab treatment for patients with confirmed PD-L1 TPS >1% and =50% were $143,282 and $127,661/QALY in nonsquamous disease, and $131,495 and $121,554/QALY in squamous disease, respectively. The ICERs of adding pembrolizumab treatment for Chinese patients were higher than $40,000/QALY regardless of the histology and TPS subgroups, which highly exceed the willingness-to-pay threshold of $29,196/QALY (three times of per capita gross domestic product of China in 2018) in China. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for untreated metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations is a cost-effective option regardless of PD-L1 expression status in the US context, and not cost-effective in the Chinese context.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model was adopted to project the disease course of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous and squamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations. The efficacy and toxicity data were gathered from the KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 trials. Transition probabilities were estimated from the reported survival probabilities in each group. Cost and health preference data were derived from published economic evaluations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured, and subgroup, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed for exploring the model uncertainties. RESULTS: In the US context, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is projected to increase quality-adjusted-life year (QALY) by 1.168 and 0.988 in comparison with chemotherapy and the ICERs were $122,248 and $121,375/QALY in the whole nonsquamous and squamous patients with unconfirmed PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS), respectively. After the selection of patients by PD-L1 TPS by PD-L1 testing, the ICERs of adding pembrolizumab treatment for patients with confirmed PD-L1 TPS >1% and =50% were $143,282 and $127,661/QALY in nonsquamous disease, and $131,495 and $121,554/QALY in squamous disease, respectively. The ICERs of adding pembrolizumab treatment for Chinese patients were higher than $40,000/QALY regardless of the histology and TPS subgroups, which highly exceed the willingness-to-pay threshold of $29,196/QALY (three times of per capita gross domestic product of China in 2018) in China. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for untreated metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations is a cost-effective option regardless of PD-L1 expression status in the US context, and not cost-effective in the Chinese context.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We simulated the impact of delaying diabetes onset by 1-9 years, utilizing data from the 3,058 of 9,306 NAVIGATOR trial participants who developed type 2 diabetes. Costs and utility weights associated with diabetes and diabetes-related complications were obtained for the U.S. and U.K. settings, with costs expressed in 2017 values. We estimated discounted lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Gains in QALYs increased from 0.02 (U.S. setting, 95% CI 0.01, 0.03) to 0.15 (U.S. setting, 95% CI 0.10, 0.21) as the imposed time to diabetes onset was increased from 1 to 9 years, respectively. Savings in complication costs increased from $1,388 (95% CI $1,092, $1,669) for a 1-year delay to $8,437 (95% CI $6,611, $10,197) for a delay of 9 years.

24937,Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of integrating smoking cessation into lung cancer screening: a microsimulation model,"BACKGROUND: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening can reduce lung cancer mortality in people at high risk; adding a smoking cessation intervention to screening could further improve screening program outcomes. This study aimed to assess the impact of adding a smoking cessation intervention to lung cancer screening on clinical outcomes, costs and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Using the OncoSim-Lung mathematical microsimulation model, we compared the projected lifetime impact of a smoking cessation intervention (nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and 12 wk of counselling) in the context of annual low-dose CT screening for lung cancer in people at high risk to lung cancer screening without a cessation intervention in Canada. The simulated population consisted of Canadians born in 1940-1974; lung cancer screening was offered to eligible people in 2020. In the base-case scenario, we assumed that the intervention would be offered to smokers up to 10 times; each intervention would achieve a 2.5% permanent quit rate. Sensitivity analyses varied key model inputs. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with a lifetime horizon from the health system''s perspective, discounted at 1.5% per year. Costs are in 2019 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Offering a smoking cessation intervention in the context of lung cancer screening could lead to an additional 13% of smokers quitting smoking. It could potentially prevent 12 more lung cancers and save 200 more life-years for every 1000 smokers screened, at a cost of $22 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The results were most sensitive to quit rate. The intervention would cost over $50 000 per QALY gained with a permanent quit rate of less than 1.25% per attempt. INTERPRETATION: Adding a smoking cessation intervention to lung cancer screening is likely cost-effective. To optimize the benefits of lung cancer screening, health care providers should encourage participants who still smoke to quit smoking.",2020-01-34925,32963023,CMAJ Open,William K Evans,2020,8 / 3,E585-E592,No,32963023,"William K Evans; Cindy L Gauvreau; William M Flanagan; Saima Memon; Jean Hai Ein Yong; John R Goffin; Natalie R Fitzgerald; Michael Wolfson; Anthony B Miller; Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of integrating smoking cessation into lung cancer screening: a microsimulation model, CMAJ Open, 2020 Jul-Sep; 8(3):2291-0026; E585-E592",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Other",smoking cessation program + low dose computed tomography vs. low dose computed tomography screening,"high risk lung cancer, >=30 pack per year smoking history",74 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,22200,Canada,2019,16936.27
24938,A brief cognitive behavioural intervention is cost-effective for primary care patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms compared to usual care,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioural intervention for patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) provided by a mental health nurse practitioner (MHNP) in primary care in comparison with usual care. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation from a societal perspective alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial with 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes were the RAND-36 physical component summary score (PCS), somatic symptom severity (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), and anxiety and depression symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)). Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. We used non-parametric bootstrapping to estimate statistical uncertainty. The bootstrapped cost-effect pairs were used to estimate cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Mean total costs in the intervention group were significantly lower than in the usual care group (mean difference - 2300€, 95% CI -3257 to -134). The mean difference in QALYs was 0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.04), in PCS 2.46 (95% CI 1.44 to 3.47), in PHQ-15 -0.26 (95% CI -0.81 to 0.28), and in HADS -0.07 (-0.81 to 0.67). At a willingness to pay of 0 € per additional unit of effect, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.93 for QALYs and 0.92 for PCS, PHQ-15 and HADS scores. CONCLUSION: Our intervention is cost-effective compared to usual care for patients with MUPS. Implementation of the intervention has the potential to result in a significant decline in costs.

24939,Cost-Effectiveness of the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group Screening Guidelines to Prevent Heart Failure in Survivors of Childhood Cancer,"PURPOSE: Survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and/or chest-directed radiation are at increased risk for heart failure (HF). The International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) recommends risk-based screening echocardiograms, but evidence supporting its frequency and cost-effectiveness is limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St Jude Lifetime Cohort, we developed a microsimulation model of the clinical course of HF. We estimated long-term health outcomes and economic impact of screening according to IGHG-defined risk groups (low [doxorubicin-equivalent anthracycline dose of 1-99 mg/m(2) and/or radiotherapy < 15 Gy], moderate [100 to < 250 mg/m(2) or 15 to < 35 Gy], or high [= 250 mg/m(2) or = 35 Gy or both = 100 mg/m(2) and = 15 Gy]). We compared 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year interval-based screening with no screening. Screening performance and treatment effectiveness were estimated based on published studies. Costs and quality-of-life weights were based on national averages and published reports. Outcomes included lifetime HF risk, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Strategies with ICERs < $100,000 per QALY gained were considered cost-effective. RESULTS: Among the IGHG risk groups, cumulative lifetime risks of HF without screening were 36.7% (high risk), 24.7% (moderate risk), and 16.9% (low risk). Routine screening reduced this risk by 4% to 11%, depending on frequency. Screening every 2, 5, and 10 years was cost-effective for high-risk survivors, and every 5 and 10 years for moderate-risk survivors.

The International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) recommends risk-based screening echocardiograms, but evidence supporting its frequency and cost-effectiveness is limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St Jude Lifetime Cohort, we developed a microsimulation model of the clinical course of HF. We estimated long-term health outcomes and economic impact of screening according to IGHG-defined risk groups (low [doxorubicin-equivalent anthracycline dose of 1-99 mg/m(2) and/or radiotherapy < 15 Gy], moderate [100 to < 250 mg/m(2) or 15 to < 35 Gy], or high [= 250 mg/m(2) or = 35 Gy or both = 100 mg/m(2) and = 15 Gy]). We compared 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year interval-based screening with no screening. Screening performance and treatment effectiveness were estimated based on published studies. Costs and quality-of-life weights were based on national averages and published reports. Outcomes included lifetime HF risk, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Strategies with ICERs < $100,000 per QALY gained were considered cost-effective. RESULTS: Among the IGHG risk groups, cumulative lifetime risks of HF without screening were 36.7% (high risk), 24.7% (moderate risk), and 16.9% (low risk). Routine screening reduced this risk by 4% to 11%, depending on frequency.

The International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) recommends risk-based screening echocardiograms, but evidence supporting its frequency and cost-effectiveness is limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St Jude Lifetime Cohort, we developed a microsimulation model of the clinical course of HF. We estimated long-term health outcomes and economic impact of screening according to IGHG-defined risk groups (low [doxorubicin-equivalent anthracycline dose of 1-99 mg/m(2) and/or radiotherapy < 15 Gy], moderate [100 to < 250 mg/m(2) or 15 to < 35 Gy], or high [= 250 mg/m(2) or = 35 Gy or both = 100 mg/m(2) and = 15 Gy]). We compared 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year interval-based screening with no screening. Screening performance and treatment effectiveness were estimated based on published studies. Costs and quality-of-life weights were based on national averages and published reports.

24951,A cost-effectiveness assessment of dual-mobility bearings in revision hip arthroplasty,"AIMS: The rate of dislocation when traditional single bearing implants are used in revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been reported to be between 8% and 10%. The use of dual mobility bearings can reduce this risk to between 0.5% and 2%. Dual mobility bearings are more expensive, and it is not clear if the additional clinical benefits constitute value for money for the payers. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dual mobility compared with single bearings for patients undergoing revision THA. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the expected cost and benefits of dual mobility compared with single bearing implants in patients undergoing revision THA. The rates of revision and further revision were calculated from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales, while rates of transition from one health state to another were estimated from the literature, and the data were stratified by sex and age. Implant and healthcare costs were estimated from local procurement prices and national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using published utility estimates for patients undergoing THA. RESULTS: At a minimum five-year follow-up, the use of dual mobility was cost-effective with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of between £3,006 and £18,745/QALY for patients aged < 55 years and between 64 and 75 years, respectively. For those aged > 75 years dual mobility was only cost-effective if the timeline was beyond seven years. The use of dual mobility bearings was cost-saving for patients aged < 75 years and cost-effective for those aged > 75 years if the time horizon was beyond ten years. CONCLUSION: The use of dual mobility bearings is cost-effective compared with single bearings in patients undergoing revision THA. The younger the patient is, the more likely it is that a dual mobility bearing can be more cost-effective and even cost-saving. The results are affected by the time horizon and cost of bearings for those aged > 75 years. For patients aged > 75 years, the surgeon must decide whether the use of a dual mobility bearing is a viable economic and clinical option.

Implant and healthcare costs were estimated from local procurement prices and national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using published utility estimates for patients undergoing THA. RESULTS: At a minimum five-year follow-up, the use of dual mobility was cost-effective with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of between £3,006 and £18,745/QALY for patients aged < 55 years and between 64 and 75 years, respectively. For those aged > 75 years dual mobility was only cost-effective if the timeline was beyond seven years. The use of dual mobility bearings was cost-saving for patients aged < 75 years and cost-effective for those aged > 75 years if the time horizon was beyond ten years. CONCLUSION: The use of dual mobility bearings is cost-effective compared with single bearings in patients undergoing revision THA. The younger the patient is, the more likely it is that a dual mobility bearing can be more cost-effective and even cost-saving. The results are affected by the time horizon and cost of bearings for those aged > 75 years. For patients aged > 75 years, the surgeon must decide whether the use of a dual mobility bearing is a viable economic and clinical option.

RESULTS: At a minimum five-year follow-up, the use of dual mobility was cost-effective with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of between £3,006 and £18,745/QALY for patients aged < 55 years and between 64 and 75 years, respectively. For those aged > 75 years dual mobility was only cost-effective if the timeline was beyond seven years. The use of dual mobility bearings was cost-saving for patients aged < 75 years and cost-effective for those aged > 75 years if the time horizon was beyond ten years. CONCLUSION: The use of dual mobility bearings is cost-effective compared with single bearings in patients undergoing revision THA. The younger the patient is, the more likely it is that a dual mobility bearing can be more cost-effective and even cost-saving. The results are affected by the time horizon and cost of bearings for those aged > 75 years. For patients aged > 75 years, the surgeon must decide whether the use of a dual mobility bearing is a viable economic and clinical option.

24975,Identification of Abusive Head Trauma in High-Risk Infants: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abusive head trauma detection strategies in emergency department settings with and without rapid magnetic resonance imaging (rMRI) availability. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov decision model estimated outcomes in well-appearing infants with high-risk chief complaints. In an emergency department without rMRI, we considered 3 strategies: clinical judgment, universal head computed tomography (CT) scan, or the Pittsburgh Infant Brain Injury Score (PIBIS) with a CT scan. In an emergency department with rMRI for brain availability, we considered additional strategies: universal rMRI, universal rMRI with a CT scan, PIBIS with rMRI, and PIBIS with rMRI followed by a CT scan. Correct diagnosis eliminated future risk; missed abusive head trauma led to reinjury risk with associated poor outcomes. Cohorts were followed for 1 year from a healthcare perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The main outcomes evaluated in this study were abusive head trauma correctly identified and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: Without rMRI availability, PIBIS followed by a CT scan was the most cost-effective strategy. Results were sensitive to variation of CT scan-induced cancer parameters and abusive head trauma prevalence. When rMRI was available, universal rMRI followed by a confirmatory CT scan cost $25 791 to gain 1 additional quality-adjusted life-year compared with PIBIS followed by rMRI with a confirmatory CT scan. In both models, clinical judgement was less effective than alternative strategies.

STUDY DESIGN: A Markov decision model estimated outcomes in well-appearing infants with high-risk chief complaints. In an emergency department without rMRI, we considered 3 strategies: clinical judgment, universal head computed tomography (CT) scan, or the Pittsburgh Infant Brain Injury Score (PIBIS) with a CT scan. In an emergency department with rMRI for brain availability, we considered additional strategies: universal rMRI, universal rMRI with a CT scan, PIBIS with rMRI, and PIBIS with rMRI followed by a CT scan. Correct diagnosis eliminated future risk; missed abusive head trauma led to reinjury risk with associated poor outcomes. Cohorts were followed for 1 year from a healthcare perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The main outcomes evaluated in this study were abusive head trauma correctly identified and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: Without rMRI availability, PIBIS followed by a CT scan was the most cost-effective strategy. Results were sensitive to variation of CT scan-induced cancer parameters and abusive head trauma prevalence.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of VFA as a screening tool to reduce future fracture risk in US community-dwelling women aged =?65 years. METHODS: An individual-level state-transition cost-effectiveness model from a healthcare perspective was constructed using derived data from published literature. The time horizon was lifetime. Five screening strategies were compared, including no screening at all, central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) only, VFA only, central DXA followed by VFA if the femoral neck T-score (FN-T) =?-?1.5, or if the FN-T =?-?1.0. Various initiation ages and rescreening intervals were evaluated. Oral bisphosphonate treatment for 5-year periods was assumed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2017 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained) were used as the outcome measure. RESULTS: The incorporation of VFA slightly increased life expectancy by 0.1 years and reduced the number of subsequent osteoporotic fractures by 3.7% and 7.7% compared with using DXA alone and no screening, respectively, leading to approximately 30 billion dollars saved.

Cardiovascular rehabilitation helps to reduce the risk of relapses or deterioration of cardiovascular diseases, however, the number of patients that participate is insufficient, especially in later stages of the rehabilitation process. The aim of the study is to evaluate cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular rehabilitation care using cost-utility analysis. METHODS: The study evaluate the Cardio ambulance Late Phase, Late Phase of The Spa treatment and for comparison also Early Phase of The Spa treatment in Konstantin Spa. The research was conducted in outpatient facility and spa facility. For QALY, a prospective questionnaire survey was conducted in patients with cardiovascular disease using generic EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. The costs were calculated from the perspective of the health care payer. The cost-utility analysis was carried out at the end of the study and results are presented in incremental cost-utility ratio. RESULTS: The average cost per patient in outpatient facility is CZK 12,459. The average amount for an overall early phase of spa treatment per patient is CZK 35,161. The average amount for an overall late phase spa treatment per patient is CZK 30,503. QALY obtained from Index Value was 0.092 (Konstantin Spa Early Phase), 0.054 (Konstantin Spa Late Phase), 0.26 (Cardio ambulance Late Phase).

The research was conducted in outpatient facility and spa facility. For QALY, a prospective questionnaire survey was conducted in patients with cardiovascular disease using generic EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. The costs were calculated from the perspective of the health care payer. The cost-utility analysis was carried out at the end of the study and results are presented in incremental cost-utility ratio. RESULTS: The average cost per patient in outpatient facility is CZK 12,459. The average amount for an overall early phase of spa treatment per patient is CZK 35,161. The average amount for an overall late phase spa treatment per patient is CZK 30,503. QALY obtained from Index Value was 0.092 (Konstantin Spa Early Phase), 0.054 (Konstantin Spa Late Phase), 0.26 (Cardio ambulance Late Phase). For Konstantin Spa Late Phase, the ICUR value was 644,436 and for Konstantin Spa Early Phase was 343,981 (comparator is the Cardio ambulance Late Phase). Konstantin Spa Early Phase compared to Konstantin Spa Late Phase had an ICUR value of 122,592. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the spa treatment in later stage of the cardiovascular rehabilitation process is cost effective with use of cost effectiveness threshold three times the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.",2020-01-34951,33013203,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Ondrej Gajdoš,2020,18 /,39,Yes,33013203,"Ondrej Gajdoš; Vojtech Kamenský; Kristýna Doskocilová; Martina Caithamlová; Ivana Kubátová; Cost-utility analysis of cardiovascular outpatient rehabilitation care and spa treatment care for patients with heart disease, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2020; 18():1478-7547; 39",QALY,Czech Republic,Not Stated,Care Delivery,"konstantin spa early phase vs. cardio ambulance late phase for non acute patients, comprehensive, monitored training treatment for 20 sessions (2 to 3 times per week)",prague,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,343980.61,Czech Republic,2015,15272.3
