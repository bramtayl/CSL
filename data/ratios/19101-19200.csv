19101,A Multiple Treatment Comparison of Eleven Disease-Modifying Drugs Used for Multiple Sclerosis,"Background: Several disease-modifying drug therapies are available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). To ensure the most appropriate MS management, we assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the disease-modifying medicines used for MS. Methods: We conducted a systematic review including 11 disease-modifying drugs used for treatment of adult patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. We performed a network meta-analysis using both direct and indirect evidence. We examined the endpoints, annual relapse, disability progression, mortality, serious adverse events and withdrawal from the study due to adverse events. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by developing a decision model. The model calculated costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with different treatment strategies. Uncertainties in the parameter values were explored with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and several scenario analyses. Results: Alemtuzumab 12 mg was the most effective against annual relapse (high quality evidence). For disability progression, dimethyl fumarate 240 mg and fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg were more effective treatment alternatives (high quality evidence). For withdrawal due to adverse events, the conclusion is unclear due to the low quality of the available evidence. Peg-interferon beta-1a was associated with more adverse events (than the other treatments). None of the examined treatments had an effect on overall mortality compared to placebo. The economic analysis indicated that alemtuzumab was more effective in terms of QALYs and less costly than the other treatment alternatives. Discarding alemtuzumab, three treatment alternatives (interferon beta-1b (Extavia), peg-interferon beta-1a and natalizumab) could be considered cost-effective depending on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Assuming a WTP below EUR 111,690 per QALY, interferon beta-1b (Extavia) was approximately 36% likely to be the most cost-effective treatment, followed by peg-interferon beta-1a (approximately 34% likely). Conclusions: Our results showed that alemtuzumab can be considered as more effective and less costly than the other treatment alternatives.

19106,Economic evaluation of floseal compared to nasal packing for the management of anterior epistaxis,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Floseal, a topically applied hemostatic agent, and nasal packing for the management of epistaxis in Canada. STUDY DESIGN: Outcomes research, a cost-utility analysis. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the costs and health outcomes of Floseal with nasal packing over a lifetime horizon from the perspective of a publicly funded healthcare system. A cycle length of 1 year was used. Efficacy of Floseal and packing was sought from the published literature. Unit costs were gathered from a hospital case costing system, whereas physician fees were extracted from the Ontario Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services. Results were expressed as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: From the perspective of a publicly funded health are system, the Floseal treatment strategy was associated with higher costs ($2,067) and greater QALYs (0.27) than nasal packing. Our findings were highly sensitive to discount rates, the cost of Floseal, and the cost of nasal packing. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that the probability that Floseal treatment is cost-effective reached 99% if the willingness-to-pay threshold was greater than $120,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Prior studies have demonstrated Floseal to be an effective treatment for anterior epistaxis. In the Canadian healthcare system, Floseal treatment appears to be a cost-effective treatment option compared to nasal packing for anterior epistaxis.

19107,Risk-Targeted Lung Cancer Screening: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Targeting low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening to persons at highest risk for lung cancer mortality has been suggested to improve screening efficiency. Objective: To quantify the value of risk-targeted selection for lung cancer screening compared with National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) eligibility criteria. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a multistate prediction model. Data Sources: NLST. Target Population: Current and former smokers eligible for lung cancer screening. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: Risk-targeted versus NLST-based screening. Outcome Measures: Incremental 7-year mortality, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness of screening with LDCT versus chest radiography at each decile of lung cancer mortality risk. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Participants at greater risk for lung cancer mortality were older and had more comorbid conditions and higher screening-related costs. The incremental lung cancer mortality benefits during the first 7 years ranged from 1.2 to 9.5 lung cancer deaths prevented per 10 000 person-years for the lowest to highest risk deciles, respectively (extreme decile ratio, 7.9). The gradient of benefits across risk groups, however, was attenuated in terms of life-years (extreme decile ratio, 3.6) and QALYs (extreme decile ratio, 2.4). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were similar across risk deciles ($75 000 per QALY in the lowest risk decile to $53 000 per QALY in the highest risk decile). Payers willing to pay $100 000 per QALY would pay for LDCT screening for all decile groups. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Alternative assumptions did not substantially alter our findings. Limitation: Our model did not account for all correlated differences between lung cancer mortality risk and quality of life. Conclusions: Although risk targeting may improve screening efficiency in terms of early lung cancer mortality per person screened, the gains in efficiency are attenuated and modest in terms of life-years, QALYs, and cost-effectiveness.

19108,Economic evaluation of paliperidone palmitate once monthly for treating chronic schizophrenia patients in the United Arab Emirates,"OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating diseases in the United Arab Emirates. Oral antipsychotics (OA) are commonly used in terms of pharmacotherapy; however, these treatments can be rendered ineffective by poor patient adherence. Paliperidone palmitate once monthly (PP1M) is a long acting antipsychotic which can offer an adherence advantage when compared to oral treatments. The study objective is to estimate the cost effectiveness of PP1M in the UAE setting. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 1-year validated decision-tree model was adapted to the UAE setting using published literature and expert opinion. Patients on PP1M were compared with or without oral supplementation to patients on any oral antipsychotic. Patient outcomes studied were incremental cost per quality adjusted life years gained, incremental cost per hospitalizations, relapses, and emergency room visits averted. RESULTS: After 1 year, patients on PP1M monotherapy when compared to oral antipsychotics had better outcomes (0.840 vs 0.811 QALYs; 31 relapse days averted as well as 9 and 24 percentage points of ER and hospitalizations averted, respectively), and better healthcare savings (AED 1405). PP1M economically dominated oral antipsychotics. The results were stable across a broad range of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. PP1M plus oral antipsychotics could not be evaluated due to the absence of clinical data that would provide insight into the clinical value of combination therapy. CONCLUSION: PP1M is estimated to save the UAE healthcare system money, while at the same time improving patient outcomes.",2018-01-26127,29292670,Curr Med Res Opin,Solomon Nuhoho,2018,/,1-11,No,29292670,"Solomon Nuhoho; Abdallah Saad; Goretti Saumell; Daniel Ribes; Antoine C El Khoury; Economic evaluation of paliperidone palmitate once monthly for treating chronic schizophrenia patients in the United Arab Emirates, Curr Med Res Opin, 2018 Jan 25; ():0300-7995; 1-11",QALY,United Arab Emirates,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Paliperidone palmitate vs. Standard/Usual Care- Oral antipsychotics,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-48413.79,United Arab Emirates,2016,-14213.8
19109,Cost effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreductive surgery versus primary cytoreductive surgery for patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer during the initial treatment phase,"OBJECTIVE: Advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) can be treated with either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) or primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS). Although randomized controlled trials show that NACT is non-inferior in overall survival compared to PCS, there may be improvement in short-term morbidity. We sought to investigate the cost-effectiveness of NACT relative to PCS for AEOC from the US Medicare perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model with a 7-month time horizon comparing (1) 3cycles of NACT with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CT), followed by interval cytoreductive surgery, then 3 additional cycles of CT, or (2) PCS followed by 6cycles of CT. Input parameters included probability of chemotherapy complications, surgical complications, treatment completion, treatment costs, and utilities. Model outcomes included costs, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in terms of cost per life-year gained and cost per QALY gained. We accounted for differences in surgical complexity by incorporating the cost of additional procedures and the probability of undergoing those procedures. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed via Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: NACT resulted in a savings of $7034 per patient with a 0.035 QALY increase compared to PCS; therefore, NACT dominated PCS in the base case analysis. With PSA, NACT was the dominant strategy more than 99% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: In the short-term, NACT is a cost-effective alternative compared to PCS in women with AEOC.

19110,Cost-effectiveness analysis of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity in Belgium,"AIMS: This study presents the cost-effectiveness analysis of bariatric surgery in Belgium from a third-party payer perspective for a lifetime and 10-year horizon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model incorporating Markov process was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding against conventional medical management (CMM). In the model, patients could undergo surgery, or experience post-surgery complications, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or die. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. The impact of different surgical methods on body mass index (BMI) level in the base-case analysis was informed by the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry and the Swedish Obese Subject (SOS) study. Healthcare resource use and costs were obtained from Belgian sources. A base-case analysis was performed for the population, the characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates in Belgium. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis over a 10-year time horizon, the increment in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from bariatric surgery vs CMM was 1.4 per patient, whereas the incremental cost was euro3,788, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro2,809 per QALY. Over a lifetime, bariatric surgery produced savings of euro9,332, an additional 1.1 life years and 5.0 QALYs.

19112,"Pharmacoeconomic study comparing carbetocin with oxytocin for the prevention of hemorrhage following cesarean delivery in Lima, Peru","Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the main causes of maternal death. Oxytocin has traditionally been used to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. AIM: To compare oxytocin with carbetocin, a long-acting analog of oxytocin, for prevention of uterine hemorrhage after cesarean delivery. MATERIALS & METHODS: Clinical data were retrieved from the 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis ""Carbetocin for preventing postpartum hemorrhage"". A decision tree was constructed. The direct costs were those of medications from the Peruvian official price list (DIGEMID). Costs associated with additional oxytocic drugs, blood transfusions, postpartum hemorrhage kits and hysterectomy were obtained from Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins. The perspective of the study was that of the payer. The time horizon for calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 1 year (2015). RESULTS: Patients who received carbetocin required fewer additional uterotonic agents, had fewer hemorrhages and received fewer blood transfusions. Therefore, the costs associated with these interventions were lower. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was S/. 49,918 per QALY gained, which is lower than the threshold we estimated for Peru.

19113,Care Management to Reduce Disparities and Control Hypertension in Primary Care: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Project ReD CHiP (reducing disparities and controlling hypertension in primary care) care management was a clinic-based intervention that aimed to improve blood pressure control through improved care coordination and provide self-management support to patients from racially and socioeconomically. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ReD CHiP care management versus standard care to treat hypertension in diverse communities. RESEARCH DESIGN: Microsimulation model from a health care sector perspective over 15 years. We used the published literature to inform our model including the ReD CHiP trial and the age-specific and race-specific cardiovascular disease risk equations. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty. SUBJECTS: Primary prevention in a racially diverse setting. MEASURES: Costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: ReD CHiP had an increase of $2114 and 0.04 QALYs. The ICER was $52,850/QALY. Predominately African American (ICER: $48,250/QALY) and elderly populations (ie, age 65+) derived value from ReD CHiP (ICER: $39,525/QALY). The value of ReD CHiP varied with changes in the reduction in systolic blood pressure (5 mm Hg reduction, ICER: $133,300/QALY; 15 mm Hg reduction, ICER: $18,767/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that ReD CHiP CM was cost-effective in over 90% of simulations, based on a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: ReD CHiP care management is cost-effective to prevent negative consequences of hypertension.

METHODS: This study used a microsimulation model of screening and active surveillance (AS), based on data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, for the natural history of prostate cancer and Johns Hopkins AS cohort data to inform the probabilities of referral to treatment during AS. A cohort of 10 million men, based on US life tables, was simulated. The lifetime costs and effects of screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years with different screening frequencies and AS protocols were projected, and their cost-effectiveness was determined. RESULTS: Quadrennial screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years (55, 59, 63, and 67 years) with AS for men with low-risk cancers (ie, those with a Gleason score of 6 or lower) and yearly biopsies or triennial biopsies resulted in an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of $51,918 or $69,380, respectively. Most policies in which screening was followed by immediate treatment were dominated. In most sensitivity analyses, this study found a policy with which the cost per QALY remained below $100,000.

19124,Comparative effectiveness of prostate cancer screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years followed by active surveillance,"BACKGROUND: Because of the recent grade C draft recommendation by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for prostate cancer screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years, there is a need to determine whether this could be cost-effective in a US population setting. METHODS: This study used a microsimulation model of screening and active surveillance (AS), based on data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, for the natural history of prostate cancer and Johns Hopkins AS cohort data to inform the probabilities of referral to treatment during AS. A cohort of 10 million men, based on US life tables, was simulated. The lifetime costs and effects of screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years with different screening frequencies and AS protocols were projected, and their cost-effectiveness was determined. RESULTS: Quadrennial screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years (55, 59, 63, and 67 years) with AS for men with low-risk cancers (ie, those with a Gleason score of 6 or lower) and yearly biopsies or triennial biopsies resulted in an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of $51,918 or $69,380, respectively. Most policies in which screening was followed by immediate treatment were dominated. In most sensitivity analyses, this study found a policy with which the cost per QALY remained below $100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening in the United States between the ages of 55 and 69 years, as recommended by the USPSTF, may be cost-effective at a $100,000 threshold but only with a quadrennial screening frequency and with AS offered to all low-risk men.

19126,Individualized Glycemic Control for U.S. Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] level <7%) is an established, cost-effective standard of care. However, guidelines recommend individualizing goals on the basis of age, comorbidity, diabetes duration, and complications. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of individualized control versus uniform intensive control (HbA1c level <7%) for the U.S. population with type 2 diabetes. Design: Patient-level Monte Carlo-based Markov model. Data Sources: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012. Target Population: The approximately 17.3 million persons in the United States with diabetes diagnosed at age 30 years or older. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: Individualized versus uniform intensive glycemic control. Outcome Measures: Average lifetime costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results of Base-Case Analysis: Individualized control saved $13 547 per patient compared with uniform intensive control ($105 307 vs. $118 854), primarily due to lower medication costs ($34 521 vs. $48 763). Individualized control decreased life expectancy (20.63 vs. 20.73 years) due to an increase in complications but produced more QALYs (16.68 vs. 16.58) due to fewer hypoglycemic events and fewer medications. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Individualized control was cost-saving and generated more QALYs compared with uniform intensive control, except in analyses where the disutility associated with receiving diabetes medications was decreased by at least 60%. Limitation: The model did not account for effects of early versus later intensive glycemic control. Conclusion: Health policies and clinical programs that encourage an individualized approach to glycemic control for U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes reduce costs and increase quality of life compared with uniform intensive control. Additional research is needed to confirm the risks and benefits of this strategy.

19127,Cost-effectiveness of per oral endoscopic myotomy relative to laparoscopic Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia,"BACKGROUND: Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has recently emerged as a viable option relative to the classic approach of laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for the treatment of esophageal achalasia. In this cost-utility analysis of POEM and LHM, we hypothesized that POEM would be cost-effective relative to LHM. METHODS: A stochastic cost-utility analysis of treatment for achalasia was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of POEM relative to LHM. Costs were estimated from the provider perspective and obtained from our institution''s cost-accounting database. The measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) which were estimated from direct elicitation of utility using a visual analog scale. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was assessed by bootstrapping the sample and computing the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). RESULTS: Patients treated within an 11-year period (2004-2016) were recruited for participation (20 POEM, 21 LHM). During the index admission, the mean costs for POEM ($8630 +/- $2653) and the mean costs for LHM ($7604 +/- $2091) were not significantly different (P = 0.179). Additionally, mean QALYs for POEM (0.413 +/- 0.248) were higher than that associated with LHM (0.357 +/- 0.338), but this difference was also not statistically significant (P = 0.55). The ICER suggested that it would cost an additional $18,536 for each QALY gained using POEM. There was substantial uncertainty in the ICER; there was a 48.25% probability that POEM was cost-effective at the mean ICER. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, there was a 68.31% probability that POEM was cost-effective relative to LHM. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of achalasia, POEM appears to be cost-effective relative to LHM depending on one''s willingness-to-pay for an additional QALY.",2018-01-26141,29218664,Surg Endosc,Erin K Greenleaf,2018,32 / 1,39-45,No,29218664,"Erin K Greenleaf; Joshua S Winder; Christopher S Hollenbeak; Randy S Haluck; Abraham Mathew; Eric M Pauli; Cost-effectiveness of per oral endoscopic myotomy relative to laparoscopic Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia, Surg Endosc, 2018 Jan; 32(1):1432-2218; 39-45",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",Per oral endoscopic myotomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy,Not Stated,75 Years,25 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,18536,United States,2015,20240.41
19128,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Intraoperative Cell Salvage for Obstetric Hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses on cell salvage for cesarean delivery to inform national and societal guidelines on obstetric blood management are lacking. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of cell salvage strategies in obstetric hemorrhage from a societal perspective. METHODS: Markov decision analysis modeling compared the cost-effectiveness of three strategies: use of cell salvage for every cesarean delivery, cell salvage use for high-risk cases, and no cell salvage. A societal perspective and lifetime horizon was assumed for the base case of a 26-yr-old primiparous woman presenting for cesarean delivery. Each strategy integrated probabilities of hemorrhage, hysterectomy, transfusion reactions, emergency procedures, and cell salvage utilization; utilities for quality of life; and costs at the societal level. One-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. A threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained was used as a cost-effectiveness criterion. RESULTS: Cell salvage use for cases at high risk for hemorrhage was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $34,881 per quality-adjusted life-year gained). Routine cell salvage use for all cesarean deliveries was not cost-effective, costing $415,488 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results were not sensitive to individual variation of other model parameters. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at the $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained threshold, there is more than 85% likelihood that cell salvage use for cases at high risk for hemorrhage is favorable. CONCLUSIONS: The use of cell salvage for cases at high risk for obstetric hemorrhage is economically reasonable; routine cell salvage use for all cesarean deliveries is not.

19130,Meniscus Root Repair vs Meniscectomy or Nonoperative Management to Prevent Knee Osteoarthritis After Medial Meniscus Root Tears: Clinical and Economic Effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Medial meniscus root tears are a common knee injury and can lead to accelerated osteoarthritis, which might ultimately result in a total knee replacement. PURPOSE: To compare meniscus repair, meniscectomy, and nonoperative treatment approaches among middle-aged patients in terms of osteoarthritis development, total knee replacement rates (clinical effectiveness), and cost-effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted. Progression to osteoarthritis was pooled and meta-analyzed. A Markov model projected strategy-specific costs and disutilities in a cohort of 55-year-old patients presenting with a meniscus root tear without osteoarthritis at baseline. Failure rates of repair and meniscectomy procedures and disutilities associated with osteoarthritis, total knee replacement, and revision total knee replacement were accounted for. Utilities, costs, and event rates were based on literature and public databases. Analyses considered a time frame between 5 years and lifetime and explored the effects of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Over 10 years, meniscus repair, meniscectomy, and nonoperative treatment led to 53.0%, 99.3%, and 95.1% rates of osteoarthritis and 33.5%, 51.5%, and 45.5% rates of total knee replacement, respectively. Meta-analysis confirmed lower osteoarthritis and total knee replacement rates for meniscus repair versus meniscectomy and nonoperative treatment. Discounted 10-year costs were $22,590 for meniscus repair, as opposed to $31,528 and $25,006 for meniscectomy and nonoperative treatment, respectively; projected quality-adjusted life years were 6.892, 6.533, and 6.693, respectively, yielding meniscus repair to be an economically dominant strategy. Repair was either cost-effective or dominant when compared with meniscectomy and nonoperative treatment across a broad range of assumptions starting from 5 years after surgery. CONCLUSION: Repair of medial meniscus root tears, as compared with total meniscectomy and nonsurgical treatment, leads to less osteoarthritis and is a cost-saving intervention.

DESIGN: We developed a Markov cohort simulation model to estimate the incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of PrEP compared to alternative safer conception strategies including cART alone for the HIV-infected partner and assisted reproductive technologies. We modeled various scenarios in which HIV RNA suppression in the male partner was less than perfect. SETTING: U.S. healthcare sector perspective.

We modeled various scenarios in which HIV RNA suppression in the male partner was less than perfect. SETTING: U.S. healthcare sector perspective. SUBJECTS, PARTICIPANTS: Serodiscordant couples in the U.S. comprised of an HIV-infected male and HIV-uninfected female seeking conception. INTERVENTION: Economic analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cumulative risks of HIV transmission to women and babies, maternal life expectancy, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALY), discounted lifetime medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: cART with condomless intercourse limited to ovulation was the preferred HIV prevention strategy among women seeking to conceive with an HIV-infected partner who is HIV-suppressed. PrEP was not cost-effective for women who had partners that were virologically suppressed. When the probability of male partner HIV suppression was low and we assumed generic pricing of PrEP, PrEP was cost-effective, and sometimes even cost saving compared to cART alone. CONCLUSIONS: From a U.S. healthcare sector perspective, when the male partner was not reliably suppressed, PrEP became economically attractive, and in some cases, cost saving.",2018-01-26206,30234602,AIDS,Ashley A Leech,2018,/,,No,30234602,"Ashley A Leech; James F Jr Burgess; Meg Sullivan; Wendy Kuohung; Michal Horny; Mari-Lynn Drainoni; Cindy L Christiansen; Benjamin P Linas; Cost-effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention for conception in the United States, AIDS, 2018 Jan 13; ():0269-9370",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",Combination antiretroviral therapy + intrauterine insemination vs. Combination antiretroviral therapy + PrEP intercourse limited to ovulation,HIV negative women with HIV positive male partner,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,5296000,United States,2016,5710929.5

19137,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Regorafenib and TAS-102 in Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Regorafenib and TAS-102 are standard treatment options in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer based on improvement in overall survival by 6 and 8 weeks, respectively, when compared with best supportive care alone (BSC). Given the small incremental clinical benefit, we evaluated their cost-effectiveness from a United States payer''s perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare costs and effectiveness of regorafenib, TAS-102, and BSC. Model inputs for clinical efficacy and adverse events were from the CORRECT trial (Regorafenib monotherapy for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer: an international, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial) for regorafenib and the RECOURSE trial (Randomized, Double Blind, Phase 3 Study of TAS-102 plus Best Supportive Care [BSC] versus Placebo plus BSC in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Refractory to Standard Chemotherapies) for TAS-102. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported to compare treatments. Model robustness was checked with univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses as well as a scenario analysis using the CONCUR trial data for regorafenib. RESULTS: In our base case, regorafenib and TAS-102 had the ICERs of $395,223 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $399,740 per QALY versus BSC, respectively. Compared with regorafenib, TAS-102 provided an additional 0.041 QALY at the cost of $16,608 or $406,104 per QALY, but the differences were not robust in sensitivity analyses. The most influential parameters on the ICERs were efficacy and health state utility parameters as well as the cost of treating neutropenia. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, BSC was more cost-effective than both regorafenib and TAS-102 in 50% of repetitions at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $330,000 per QALY.

19140,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C screening strategies in France,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Europe, hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening still targets people at high risk of infection. We aim to determine the cost-effectiveness of expanded HCV screening in France. METHODS: A Markov model simulated chronic hepatitis C (CHC) prevalence, incidence of events, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the French general population, aged 18 to 80years, undiagnosed for CHC for different strategies: S1=current strategy targeting the at risk population; S2=S1 and all men between 18 and 59years; S3=S1 and all individuals between 40 and 59years; S4=S1 and all individuals between 40 and 80years; S5=all individuals between 18 and 80years (universal screening). Once CHC was diagnosed, treatment was initiated either to patients with fibrosis stage >/=F2 or regardless of fibrosis. Data were extracted from published literature, a national prevalence survey, and a previously published mathematical model. ICER were interpreted based on one or three times French GDP per capita (euro32,800). RESULTS: Universal screening led to the lowest prevalence of CHC and incidence of events, regardless of treatment initiation. When considering treatment initiation to patients with fibrosis >/=F2, targeting all people aged 40-80 was the only cost-effective strategy at both thresholds (euro26,100/QALY). When we considered treatment for all, although universal screening of all individuals aged 18-80 is associated with the highest costs, it is more effective than targeting all people aged 40-80, and cost-effective at both thresholds (euro31,100/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: In France, universal screening is the most effective screening strategy for HCV. Universal screening is cost-effective when treatment is initiated regardless of fibrosis stage.

ICER were interpreted based on one or three times French GDP per capita (euro32,800). RESULTS: Universal screening led to the lowest prevalence of CHC and incidence of events, regardless of treatment initiation. When considering treatment initiation to patients with fibrosis >/=F2, targeting all people aged 40-80 was the only cost-effective strategy at both thresholds (euro26,100/QALY). When we considered treatment for all, although universal screening of all individuals aged 18-80 is associated with the highest costs, it is more effective than targeting all people aged 40-80, and cost-effective at both thresholds (euro31,100/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: In France, universal screening is the most effective screening strategy for HCV. Universal screening is cost-effective when treatment is initiated regardless of fibrosis stage.

19148,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban and aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients with stable cardiovascular disease: An Australian perspective,"OBJECTIVE: In light of the Cardiovascular Outcomes for People using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial, our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness, from the Australian healthcare perspective, of rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin versus aspirin alone for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular disease among patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease. METHODS: A Markov model was developed using input data from the COMPASS trial to predict the clinical course and costs of patients over a 20-year time-horizon. The model comprised of three health states: ''Alive without recurrent CVD'', ''Alive after recurrent CVD'' and ''Dead''. Costs were from the Australian public healthcare system perspective, and estimated from published sources, as were utility data. The costs of rivaroxaban were based on current acquisition prices on the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (PBS) and assumed as AUD$3.09/day. The main outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and cost per year of life saved (YoLS). Costs and benefits were discounted by 5.0% per year. RESULTS: Compared to aspirin alone, rivaroxaban plus aspirin was estimated to cost an additional AUD$12,156 (discounted) per person, but lead to 0.516 YoLS (discounted) and 0.386 QALYs gained (discounted), over 20years. These equated to ICERs of AUD$23,560/YoLS and AUD$31,436/QALY gained. We have assumed a threshold of AUD$50,000/QALY gained to signify cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Compared to aspirin, rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin is likely to be cost-effective in preventing recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease.",2018-01-26232,30220379,Int J Cardiol,Zanfina Ademi,2018,270 /,54-59,No,30220379,"Zanfina Ademi; Ella Zomer; Andrew Tonkin; Danny Liew; Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban and aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients with stable cardiovascular disease: An Australian perspective, Int J Cardiol, 2018 Nov 1; 270():0167-5273; 54-59",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Rivaroxaban plus aspirin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Aspirin (100 mg once daily),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,31436,Australia,2017,25452.49
19149,Early cost-effectiveness of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) for second line treatment in advanced melanoma: a model-based economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: An emerging immunotherapy is infusion of tumor infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL), with objective response rates of around 50% versus 19% for ipilimumab. As an Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Products (ATMP), TIL is highly personalized and complex therapy. It requests substantial upfront investments from the hospital in: expensive lab-equipment, staff expertise and training, as well as extremely tight hospital logistics. Therefore, an early health economic modelling study, as part of a Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) program, was performed. METHODS: We used a Markov decision model to estimate the expected costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs) for TIL versus ipilimumab for second line treatment in metastatic melanoma patients from a Dutch health care perspective over a life long time horizon. Three mutually exclusive health states (stable disease (responders)), progressive disease and death) were modelled. To inform further research prioritization, Value of Information (VOI) analysis was performed. RESULTS: TIL is expected to generate more QALYs compared to ipilimumab (0.45 versus 0.38 respectively) at lower incremental cost (presently euro81,140 versus euro94,705 respectively) resulting in a dominant ICER (less costly and more effective). Based on current information TIL is dominating ipilimumab and has a probability of 86% for being cost effective at a cost/QALY threshold of euro80,000. The Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) amounted to euro3 M. CONCLUSIONS: TIL is expected to have the highest probability of being cost-effective in second line treatment for advanced melanoma compared to ipilimumab. To reduce decision uncertainty, a clinical trial investigating e.g. costs and survival seems most valuable.

19150,Cost-effectiveness of roflumilast as an add-on to triple inhaled therapy vs triple inhaled therapy in patients with severe and very severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis in the UK,"Purpose: Patients with severe COPD are at high risk of experiencing disease exacerbations, which require additional treatment and are associated with elevated mortality and increased risk of future exacerbations. Some patients continue to experience exacerbations despite receiving triple inhaled therapy (ICS plus LAMA plus LABA). Roflumilast is recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease as add-on treatment to triple inhaled therapy for these patients. This cost-effectiveness analysis compared costs and quality-adjusted life-years for roflumilast plus triple inhaled therapy vs triple inhaled therapy alone, using data from the REACT and RE(2)SPOND trials. Patients and methods: Patients included in the analysis had severe to very severe COPD, FEV1 <50% predicted, symptoms of chronic bronchitis and >/=2 exacerbations per year. Our model was adapted from a previously published and validated model, and the analyses conducted from a UK National Health Service perspective. A scenario analysis considered a subset of patients who had experienced at least one COPD-related hospitalization within the previous year. Results: Roflumilast as add-on to triple inhaled therapy was associated with non-significant reductions in rates of both moderate and severe exacerbations compared with triple inhaled therapy alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for roflumilast as add-on to triple inhaled therapy was pound24,976. In patients who had experienced previous hospitalization, roflumilast was associated with a non-significant reduction in the rate of moderate exacerbations, and a statistically significant reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations. The ICER for roflumilast in this population was pound7,087. Conclusions: Roflumilast is a cost-effective treatment option for patients with severe or very severe COPD, chronic bronchitis, and a history of exacerbations.

19151,Retrospective cost-effectiveness of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination program in Australia,"BACKGROUND: The Australian infant pneumococcal vaccination program was funded in 2005 using the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and the 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2011. The PCV7 and PCV13 programs resulted in herd immunity effects across all age-groups, including older adults. Coincident with the introduction of the PCV7 program in 2005, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was funded for all Australian adults aged over 65years. METHODS: A multi-cohort Markov model with a cycle length of one year was developed to retrospectively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the PPV23 immunisation program from 2005 to 2015. The analysis was performed from the healthcare system perspective with costs and quality-adjusted life years discounted at 5% annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PPV23 doses provided from 2005 to 2015 was calculated separately for each year when compared to no vaccination. Parameter uncertainty was explored using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: It was estimated that PPV23 doses given out over the 11-year period from 2005 to 2015 prevented 771 hospitalisations and 99 deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, the estimated IPD cases and deaths prevented by PPV23 declined by more than 50% over this period (e.g. from 12.9 deaths for doses given out in 2005 to 6.1 in 2015), likely driven by herd effects from infant PCV programs. The estimated ICER over the period 2005 to 2015 was approximately A$224,000/QALY gained compared to no vaccination. When examined per year, the ICER for each individual year worsened from $140,000/QALY in 2005 to $238,000/QALY in 2011 to $286,000/QALY in 2015. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of the PPV23 program in older Australians was estimated to have worsened over time. It is unlikely to have been cost-effective, unless PPV23 provided protection against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia and/or a low vaccine price was negotiated. A key policy priority should be to review of the future use of PPV23 in Australia, which is likely to be more cost-effective in certain high-risk groups.",2018-01-26250,30213457,Vaccine,C Chen,2018,/,,Yes,30213457,"C Chen; P Beutels; J Wood; R Menzies; C R MacIntyre; P McIntyre; A T Newall; Retrospective cost-effectiveness of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination program in Australia, Vaccine, 2018 Jan 31; ():1873-2518",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Immunization,PPV23 immunization vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,224000,Australia,2015,183981.15

With a one-time infusion cost of $475,000, tisagenlecleucel is currently the most expensive oncologic therapy. We aimed to determine whether tisagenlecleucel is cost effective compared with currently available treatments. Methods Markov modeling was used to evaluate tisagenlecleucel in pediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model was informed by recent multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Tisagenlecleucel (under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness) was compared with blinatumomab, clofarabine combination therapy (clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide), and clofarabine monotherapy. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty. Main outcomes were life-years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3% discount rate). Results With an assumption of a 40% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 12.1 years and cost $61,000/QALY gained. However, at a 20% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, life-expectancies were more modest (3.8 years) and expensive ($151,000/QALY gained). At a 0% 5-year relapse-free survival rate and with use as a bridge to transplant, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 5.7 years and cost $184,000/QALY gained. Reduction of the price of tisagenlecleucel to $200,000 or $350,000 would allow it to meet a $100,000/QALY or $150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold in all scenarios. Conclusion The long-term effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost effectiveness. At its current price, tisagenlecleucel represents reasonable value if it can keep a substantial fraction of patients in remission without transplantation; however, if all patients ultimately require a transplantation to remain in remission, it will not be cost effective at generally accepted thresholds.

Methods Markov modeling was used to evaluate tisagenlecleucel in pediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model was informed by recent multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Tisagenlecleucel (under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness) was compared with blinatumomab, clofarabine combination therapy (clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide), and clofarabine monotherapy. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty. Main outcomes were life-years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3% discount rate). Results With an assumption of a 40% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 12.1 years and cost $61,000/QALY gained. However, at a 20% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, life-expectancies were more modest (3.8 years) and expensive ($151,000/QALY gained). At a 0% 5-year relapse-free survival rate and with use as a bridge to transplant, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 5.7 years and cost $184,000/QALY gained. Reduction of the price of tisagenlecleucel to $200,000 or $350,000 would allow it to meet a $100,000/QALY or $150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold in all scenarios. Conclusion The long-term effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost effectiveness. At its current price, tisagenlecleucel represents reasonable value if it can keep a substantial fraction of patients in remission without transplantation; however, if all patients ultimately require a transplantation to remain in remission, it will not be cost effective at generally accepted thresholds.

The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the RFA plus NA versus RFA alone in patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria in China and the USA. A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients with HCC within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis and underwent RFA with or without NA therapy over their remaining life expectancy. Analysis was performed in two geographical cost settings: China and the USA. The RFA plus NA therapy provided an average of 7.57 years, whereas RFA monotherapy offered 5.83 years. The RFA plus NA therapy produced 5.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), whereas RFA monotherapy achieved 3.89 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the RFA plus NA therapy versus RFA monotherapy was $10368.19/QALY in China and $38805.45/QALY in the USA.

Sensitivity analysis revealed that the utility of recurrent HCC was the most sensitive parameter in all cost scenarios in both of the RFA plus NA therapy and RFA monotherapy groups.

DESIGN: Modelling study. SETTING: Genitourinary medicine (GUM) services in England. POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of 965 988 people, representing the annual number attending GUM services symptomatic of lower genitourinary tract infection. INTERVENTIONS: The decision tree model considered costs and reimbursement to GUM services associated with diagnosing and managing STIs. Three strategies using hypothetical point-of-care tests (POCTs) were compared with standard care (SC) using laboratory-based testing. The strategies were: A) dual POCT for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG); B) triplex POCT for CT-NG and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG); C) quadruplex POCT for CT-NG-MG and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). Data came from published literature and unpublished estimates. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were total costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) for each strategy (2016 GB, pound) and associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between each of the POC strategies and SC. Secondary outcomes were inappropriate treatment of STIs, onward STI transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease in women, time to cure and total attendances. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, POC strategy C, a quadruplex POCT, was the most cost-effective relative to the other strategies, with an ICER of pound36 585 per QALY gained compared with SC when using microcosting, and cost-savings of pound26 451 382 when using tariff costing.

We aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness of universal 1-time screening for HCV infection in all adults living in the US and to determine the prevalence of HCV antibody above which HCV testing is cost-effective. METHODS: We developed a Markov state transition model to estimate the effects of universal, 1-time screening of adults 18 years or older in the US, compared with the current guideline-based strategy of screening adults born from 1945 through 1965. We compared potential outcomes of 1-time universal screening of adults or birth cohort screening followed by antiviral treatment of those with HCV infection vs no screening. We measured effectiveness with quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs with 2017 US dollars. RESULTS: Based on our model, universal 1-time screening of US residents with general population prevalence of HCV antibody greater than 0.07% cost less than $50,000/QALY compared with a strategy of no screening. Compared with 1-time birth cohort screening, universal 1-time screening and treatment cost $11,378/QALY gained. Universal screening was cost-effective compared with birth cohort screening when the prevalence of HCV antibody positivity was greater than 0.07% among adults not in the cohort born from 1945 through 1965.

19167,Cost-effectiveness of a potential anti-tick vaccine with combined protection against Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis in Slovenia,"This study assessed cost-effectiveness of a potential anti-tick vaccine that would protect against both Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in a highly endemic setting of Slovenia. A Markov model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of a vaccine with potential combined protection against LB and TBE from the societal perspective. The model expressed time in annual cycles, followed a target population through their lifetime, and applied an annual discounting of 3%. A target population entered the model in a susceptible state, with time dependent probabilities to acquire LB/TBE. Disease manifestations were either resolved within one cycle, or a patient developed LB/TBE sequelae. The vaccination consisted of initial immunization and one revaccination. Estimates of LB/TBE direct and indirect costs, and data on natural course of LB/TBE were obtained from Slovenian databases. Effectiveness of the vaccine with potential combined protection against LB/TBE was derived from studies on existing TBE and LB vaccines, while utility estimates were collected from various literature sources. A vaccine with potential combined protection against LB/TBE was predicted to have an incremental cost of euro771,300 per 10,000 vaccinated persons, an incremental utility of 17QALYs and a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 46,061euro/QALY. Vaccine cost, effectiveness and discount rates were identified as the most influential model parameters. A wholesale price for a vaccine shot of euro9.13 would lead to cost savings followed by health gains for the vaccination strategy. The base-case ICER was below commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness, indicating that a combined LB/TBE vaccine might be a cost-effective option in Slovenia. With early Health Technology Assessment becoming increasingly important, this analysis still represents a rare example of cost-effectiveness assessment prior to market authorisation. Although obviously in such a situation some key parameters are unknown, our model sets up a tool to analyse pharmacoeconomic criteria that can help development of a cost-effective health technology, in this case a combined tick-borne diseases vaccine.",2018-01-26277,30197268,Ticks Tick Borne Dis,J Mihajlovic,2018,/,,No,30197268,"J Mihajlovic; J W R Hovius; H Sprong; P Bogovic; M J Postma; F Strle; Cost-effectiveness of a potential anti-tick vaccine with combined protection against Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis in Slovenia, Ticks Tick Borne Dis, 2018 Aug 30; ():1877-9603",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Immunization,Anti-tick vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,81 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,46061,Euro,2016,54962.59
19168,Microscopic examination of Gram-stained smears for anogenital gonorrhoea in men who have sex with men is cost-effective: evidence from a modelling study,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of three testing strategies with or without light microscopic Gram-stained smear (GSS) evaluation for the detection of anogenital gonorrhoea among men who have sex with men (MSM) at the Amsterdam STI clinic using a healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: Three testing strategies for MSM were compared: (1) GSS in symptomatic MSM only (currently practised strategy), (2) no GSS and (3) GSS in symptomatic and asymptomatic MSM. The three testing protocols include testing with nucleic acid amplification test to verify the GSS results in (1) and (3), or as the only test in (2). A transmission model was employed to calculate the influence of the testing strategies on the prevalence of anogenital gonorrhoea over 10 years. An economic model combined cost data on medical consultations, tests and treatment and utility data to estimate the number of epididymitis cases and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) associated with gonorrhoea. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the testing scenarios were estimated. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: No GSS testing compared with GSS in symptomatic MSM only (current strategy) resulted in nine extra epididymitis cases (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 2-22), 72 QALYs lost (95% UI: 59-187) and euro7300 additional costs (95% UI: -euro185 000 (i.e.cost-saving) to euro407 000) over 10 years. GSS testing in both symptomatic and asymptomatic MSM compared with GSS in symptomatic MSM only resulted in one prevented epididymitis case (95% UI: 0-2), 1.1 QALY gained (95% UI: 0.1-3.3), euro148 000 additional costs (95% UI: euro86 000 to-euro217 000) and an ICER of euro177 000 (95% UI: euro67 000-to euro705 000) per QALY gained over 10 years.

19170,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Patiromer and Spironolactone Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Hyperkalemia,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Certain patients with heart failure (HF) are unable to tolerate spironolactone therapy due to hyperkalemia. Patiromer is a novel agent used to treat hyperkalemia and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated. The potential clinical outcomes and economic value of using patiromer and spironolactone in patients with HF unable to otherwise tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia are unclear. The objective of this analysis was to model the potential pharmacoeconomic value of using patiromer and spironolactone in patients with a history of hyperkalemia that prevents them from utilizing spironolactone. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with patiromer, spironolactone, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV HF compared with ACEI alone. A Markov model was constructed to simulate a cohort of 65-year-old patients diagnosed with HF from the payer perspective across the lifetime horizon. Clinical inputs were derived from the RALES and OPAL-HK randomized trials of spironolactone and patiromer, respectively. Utility estimates and costs were derived from the literature and list prices. Outcomes assessed included hospitalization, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probability sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model findings. RESULTS: Treatment with patiromer-spironolactone-ACEI was projected to increase longevity compared with ACEI alone (5.29 vs. 4.62 life-years gained, respectively), greater QALYs (2.79 vs. 2.60), and costs (US$28,200 vs. US$18,200), giving an ICER of US$52,700 per QALY gained. The ICERs ranged from US$40,000 to US$85,800 per QALY gained in 1-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the use of spironolactone-patiromer-ACEI may provide clinical benefit and good economic value in patients with NYHA class III-IV HF unable to tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia.",2018-01-26282,30194623,Pharmacoeconomics,Mark Bounthavong,2018,/,,Yes,30194623,"Mark Bounthavong; Javed Butler; Chantal M Dolan; Jeffrey D Dunn; Kathryn A Fisher; Nina Oestreicher; Bertram Pitt; Paul J Hauptman; David L Veenstra; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Patiromer and Spironolactone Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Hyperkalemia, Pharmacoeconomics, 2018 Feb 2; ():1179-2027",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Patiromer-spironolactone-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor vs. Standard/Usual Care- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor only,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,52700,United States,2016,56828.92

Clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from the trial and projected over 20 years. For extrapolating survival beyond the trial, a novel SEER population-data approach is applied (primary analysis), with separate estimation via traditional parametric extrapolation methods. Costs for drugs and non-drug disease management are also incorporated. Based on an indirect treatment comparison, cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy versus pembrolizumab monotherapy is evaluated for patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)>/=50%. RESULTS: In the full non-squamous population, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is projected to increase life expectancy by 2.04 years versus chemotherapy (3.96 versus 1.92), for an approximate doubling of life years. Resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are $104,823/QALY and $87,242/life year.

19181,Do Integrated Systems of Stroke Care Improve Symptom to Surgery Times in Patients with Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis? A Single Centre Decision Tree Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of an integrated system of stroke care on symptom to surgery times, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life measures in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. METHODS: Patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a regional vascular centre between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2016, were identified from the National Vascular Registry (NVR). Risk of stroke on medical therapy for each patient was calculated using the Oxford stroke risk calculator. Symptom to surgery times were compared among patients referred from a stroke service providing an integrated stroke care and the stroke service in an adjacent NHS trust which provides standard urgent referral pathway. A decision analytic Markov process model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CEA versus medical treatment in patients who followed the standard and integrated pathways. This model examined the lifetime costs and health benefits of CEA through each pathway. RESULTS: A total of 376 patients underwent CEA, of whom 243 were managed through the integrated stroke pathway and 133 through the standard urgent referral pathway. Median symptom to surgery time was 11 (0-66) days for the former and 15 (3-90) days for the latter (p < .001). There was no significant difference in peri-operative stroke death rate between integrated (2.1%) and standard (1.5%) pathways (chi-square = 0.14, p = .73). CEA through the integrated pathway improved quality adjusted life expectancy by an additional 0.13 (0.64 QALYs [integrated pathway] to 0.51 QALYs [standard pathway]) and was associated with an incremental lifetime cost benefit of pound2203.4.

19182,The Cost-Effectiveness of Meniscal Repair Versus Partial Meniscectomy in the Setting of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with meniscal repair to ACL reconstruction with partial meniscectomy. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov disease progression model with a 40-year horizon was created simulating outcomes after both meniscal repair and partial meniscectomy at the time of ACL reconstruction. Event probabilities, costs, and utilities were used for the index procedures. The development of osteoarthritis and subsequent knee replacement were either calculated or selected from published literature. Difference in cost, difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effective ratio were calculated to determine which index procedure is most cost-effective. RESULTS: There is total direct cost from ACL reconstruction with meniscus repair of $17,898 compared with that with partial meniscectomy of $24,768 (cost savings of $6,870). There was an estimated gain of 18.00 QALYs after ACL reconstruction with meniscus repair compared with 17.16 QALYs with partial meniscectomy (increase of 0.84 QALYs). In this scenario, meniscus repair is the dominant index procedure at the time of ACL reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Meniscal repair at the time of ACL reconstruction is more cost-effective than partial meniscectomy.

19183,Cost-effectiveness of optimized adherence to prevention guidelines in European patients with coronary heart disease: Results from the EUROASPIRE IV survey,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of optimized guideline adherence in patients with a history of coronary heart disease. METHODS: An individual-based decision tree model was developed using the SMART risk score tool which estimates the 10-year risk for recurrent vascular events in patients with manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD). Analyses were based on the EUROASPIRE IV survey. Outcomes were expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Data from 4663 patients from 13 European countries were included in the analyses. The mean estimated 10-year risk for a recurrent vascular event decreased from 20.13% to 18.61% after optimized guideline adherence. Overall, an ICER of 52,968euro/QALY was calculated. The ICER lowered to 29,093euro/QALY when only considering high-risk patients (>/=20%) with decreasing ICERs in higher risk patients. Also, a dose-response relationship was seen with lower ICERs in older patients and in those patients with higher risk reductions. A less stringent LDL target (<2.5mmol/L vs. <1.8mmol/L) lowered the ICER to 32,591euro/QALY and intensifying cholesterol treatment in high-risk patients (>/=20%) instead of high-cholesterol patients lowered the ICER to 28,064euro/QALY. An alternative method, applying risk reductions to the CVD events instead of applying risk reductions to the risk factors lowered the ICER to 31,509euro/QALY. CONCLUSION: Depending on the method used better or worse ICERs were found. In addition, optimized guidelines adherence is more cost-effective in higher risk patients, in patients with higher risk reductions and when using a less strict LDL-C target.

19184,Cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy versus tubal ligation at the time of cesarean delivery,"BACKGROUND: Removal of the fallopian tubes at the time of hysterectomy or interval sterilization has become routine practice to prevent ovarian cancer. While emerging as a strategy, uptake of this procedure at the time of cesarean delivery for pregnant women seeking permanent sterilization has not been widely adopted due to perceptions of increased morbidity and operative difficulty with a lack of available data in this setting. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing strategies for long-term sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction at the time of cesarean delivery, including bilateral tubal ligation, opportunistic salpingectomy, and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model was constructed for pregnant women undergoing cesarean delivery who desired permanent sterilization in the US population, comparing 3 strategies: 1) bilateral tubal ligation, 2) bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy, and 3) postpartum LARC. This theoretic cohort consisted of 110,000 pregnant women desiring permanent sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery and ovarian cancer prevention at an average of 35 years who were monitored for an additional 40 years based on an average US female life expectancy of 75 years. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Effectiveness was measured as quality adjusted life years (QALY). Secondary outcomes included: the number of ovarian cancer cases and deaths, procedure-related complications, and unintended and ectopic pregnancies. One-, two-, and three-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000. RESULTS: Both bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy with cesarean delivery have favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. In the base case analysis, salpingectomy was more cost effective with an ICER of $23,189/QALY compared to tubal ligation. LARC after cesarean was not cost-effective (i.e. dominated). Although salpingectomy and tubal ligation were both cost-effective over a wide range of cost and risk estimates, the ICER analysis was highly sensitive to the uncertainty around the estimates of salpingectomy cancer risk reduction, risk of perioperative complications, and cost. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated that tubal ligation had a 49% chance of being the preferred strategy over salpingectomy. If the true salpingectomy risk of perioperative complications is >2% higher than tubal ligation or if the cancer risk reduction of salpingectomy is <52%, then tubal ligation is the preferred, more cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy with cesarean delivery are both cost-effective strategies for permanent sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction.

19186,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Sequential Treatment of Abaloparatide Followed by Alendronate Versus Teriparatide Followed by Alendronate in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved abaloparatide (ABL) for treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) at high risk of fracture. With increasing health care spending and drug prices, it is important to quantify the value of newly available treatment options for PMO. OBJECTIVE: To determine cost-effectiveness of ABL compared with teriparatide (TPTD) for treatment of women with PMO in the United States. METHODS: A discrete-event simulation (DES) model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness of ABL from the US health care perspective. The model included three 18-month treatment strategies with either placebo (PBO), TPTD, or ABL, all followed by additional 5-year treatment with alendronate (ALN). High-risk patients were defined as women with PMO 65 years old with a prior vertebral fracture. Baseline clinical event rates, risk reductions, and patient characteristics were based on the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE) trial. RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, the DES model yielded average total discounted per-patient costs of $10 212, $46 783, and $26 837 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 6.742, 6.781, and 6.792 for PBO/ALN, TPTD/ALN, and ABL/ALN, respectively. Compared with TPTD/ALN, ABL/ALN accrued higher QALYs at lower cost and produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $333 266/QALY relative to PBO/ALN.

19187,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Sequential Treatment of Abaloparatide Followed by Alendronate Versus Teriparatide Followed by Alendronate in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved abaloparatide (ABL) for treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) at high risk of fracture. With increasing health care spending and drug prices, it is important to quantify the value of newly available treatment options for PMO. OBJECTIVE: To determine cost-effectiveness of ABL compared with teriparatide (TPTD) for treatment of women with PMO in the United States. METHODS: A discrete-event simulation (DES) model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness of ABL from the US health care perspective. The model included three 18-month treatment strategies with either placebo (PBO), TPTD, or ABL, all followed by additional 5-year treatment with alendronate (ALN). High-risk patients were defined as women with PMO 65 years old with a prior vertebral fracture. Baseline clinical event rates, risk reductions, and patient characteristics were based on the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE) trial. RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, the DES model yielded average total discounted per-patient costs of $10 212, $46 783, and $26 837 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 6.742, 6.781, and 6.792 for PBO/ALN, TPTD/ALN, and ABL/ALN, respectively.

19189,Cost-effectiveness analysis of drugs for osteoporosis treatment in elderly Japanese women at high risk of fragility fractures: comparison of denosumab and weekly alendronate,"This study''s purpose was to clarify the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment. Denosumab treatment was cost-effective compared with alendronate treatment for elderly Japanese women at high risk of fragility fractures. Denosumab treatment might be cost-effective for patients with lower bone mineral density. PURPOSE: In Japan''s super-aged society, the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are a critical issue with implications for the medical economy. This study''s purpose was to clarify the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment with denosumab versus weekly alendronate for elderly Japanese women at high risk of fragility fractures. METHODS: A Markov model was used for simulation analysis. The modeled population was 75-year-old Japanese women with a bone mineral density (BMD) of 65% of the young adult mean (YAM) (T-score, - 2.87) and a history of previous vertebral body fracture. The simulation model was repeated until patient age reached 100 years or death. Analysis was performed from the societal perspective. Costs and epidemiological data were derived from previous studies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the simulation. We compared the ICER with willingness-to-pay. Additional analyses were performed with different combinations of age and BMD. Sensitivity analysis verified the robustness of the analysis. RESULTS: For the modeled population, the ICER of denosumab versus alendronate treatment was estimated at US$40,241/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER of denosumab for 80-year-old women whose BMD was 60% of YAM was estimated at US$22,469/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming willingness-to-pay as US$50,000/QALY, denosumab treatment for 75-year-old Japanese women with a BMD of 65% of YAM and a history of previous vertebral body fracture was cost-effective compared with alendronate treatment.

19191,Cost-effectiveness of on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with coronary artery disease: Results from the MASS III trial,"BACKGROUND: Recent trials have reported similar clinical outcomes between on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). However, long-term cost-effectiveness of these strategies is unknown. METHODS: A prespecified economic study was performed based on the MASS III trial. Costs were estimated for all patients based on observed healthcare resource usage over a 5-year follow-up. Health state utilities were evaluated with the SF-6D questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using a Markov model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis with the Monte-Carlo simulation and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were used to address uncertainty. RESULTS: Quality of life improved significantly in both groups during follow-up compared with baseline. At 5years, when comparing on-pump and off-pump CABG groups, no differences were found in cumulative life-years (4.851 and 4.766years, P=.319) and QALY gained (4.150 and 4.105 QALYs, P=.332). Mean cost in US dollars per patient during the trial did not differ significantly between the on-pump and off-pump groups ($5890.29 and $5674.75, respectively, P=.409). Over a lifetime horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of on-pump versus off-pump CABG was $12,576 per QALY gained, which is above the suggested cost-effectiveness threshold range (from $3210 to 10,122). In the sensitivity analysis, the probability that on-pump CABG is cost-effective compared to off-pump surgery for a willingness-to-pay threshold of $3212 per QALY gained was <1%. For the $10,122 per QALY threshold, the same probability was 35%.

19192,Cost-effectiveness of PoNDER health visitor training for mothers at lower risk of depression: findings on prevention of postnatal depression from a cluster-randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence for the cost-effectiveness of health visitor (HV) training to assess postnatal depression (PND) and deliver psychological approaches to women at risk of depression. Whether this approach is cost-effective for lower-risk women is unknown. There is a need to know the cost of HV-delivered universal provision, and how much it might cost to improve health-related quality of life for postnatal women. A sub-study of a cluster-randomised controlled trial in the former Trent region (England) previously investigated the effectiveness of PoNDER HV training in mothers at lower risk of PND. We conducted a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis at 6-months postnatal for all mothers with lower-risk status attributed to an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score <12 at 6-weeks postnatal. METHODS: Intervention HVs were trained in assessment and cognitive behavioural or person-centred psychological support techniques to prevent depression.

19195,Cost-effectiveness of a primary care multidisciplinary Risk Assessment and Management Program for patients with diabetes mellitus (RAMP-DM) over lifetime,"PURPOSE: The multidisciplinary Risk Assessment and Management Program for patients with diabetes mellitus (RAMP-DM) was found to be cost-saving in comparison with usual primary care over 5 years'' follow-up. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifetime. METHODS: We built a Discrete Event Simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifespan from public health service provider''s perspective. Transition probabilities among disease states were extrapolated from a cohort of 17,140 propensity score matched participants in RAMP-DM and those under usual primary care over 5-year''s follow-up. The mortality of patients with specific DM-related complications was estimated from a cohort of 206,238 patients with diabetes. Health preference and direct medical costs of DM patients referred to our previous studies among Chinese DM patients. RESULTS: RAMP-DM individuals gained 0.745 QALYs and cost US$1404 less than those under usual care. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that RAMP-DM had 86.0% chance of being cost-saving compared to usual care under the assumptions and estimates used in the model. The probability of RAMP-DM being cost-effective compared to usual care would be over 99%, when the willingness to pay threshold is HK$20,000 (US$ 2564) or higher.

19198,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of pay-for-performance in primary care in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Introduced in 2004, the United Kingdom''s (UK) Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is the world''s largest primary-care pay-for-performance programme. Given some evidence of the benefits and the substantial costs associated with the QOF, it remains unclear whether the programme is cost-effective. Therefore, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of continuing versus stopping the QOF. METHODS: We developed a lifetime simulation model to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for a UK population cohort aged 40-74 years (n = 27,070,862) exposed to the QOF and for a counterfactual scenario without exposure. Based on a previous retrospective cross-country analysis using data from 1994 to 2010, we assumed the benefits of the QOF to be a change in age-adjusted mortality of -3.68 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval -8.16 to 0.80). We used cost-effectiveness thresholds of pound30,000/QALY, pound20,000/QALY and pound13,000/QALY to determine the optimal strategy in base-case and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, continuing the QOF increased population-level QALYs and health-care costs yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound49,362/QALY. The ICER remained > pound30,000/QALY in scenarios with and without non-fatal outcomes or increased drug costs, and under differing assumptions about the duration of QOF benefit following its hypothetical discontinuation. The ICER for continuing the programme fell below pound30,000/QALY when QOF incentive payments were 36% lower (while preserving QOF mortality benefits), and in scenarios where the QOF resulted in substantial reductions in health-care spending or non-fatal cardiovascular disease events. Continuing the QOF was cost-effective in 18%, 3% and 0% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations using thresholds of pound30,000/QALY, pound20,000/QALY and pound13,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to stopping the QOF and returning all associated incentive payments to the National Health Service, continuing the QOF is not cost-effective. To improve population health efficiently, the UK should redesign the QOF or pursue alternative interventions.",2018-01-26386,30153827,BMC Med,Ankur Pandya,2018,16 / 1,135,No,30153827,"Ankur Pandya; Tim Doran; Jinyi Zhu; Simon Walker; Emily Arntson; Andrew M Ryan; Modelling the cost-effectiveness of pay-for-performance in primary care in the UK, BMC Med, 2018 Jan 30; 16(1):1741-7015; 135",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Other",Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) primary care pay-for-performance program vs. Stopping Quality and Outcomes Framework,Not Stated,74 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,49362,United Kingdom,2016,72153.38
19199,Is Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in Canadian Family Practices Cost-Effective in Patients 65 Years and Older?,"We present an economic evaluation of a recently completed cohort study in which 2054 seniors were screened for atrial fibrillation (AF) in 22 Canadian family practices. Using a Markov model, trial and literature data were used to project long-term outcomes and costs associated with 4 AF screening strategies for individuals aged 65 years or older: no screening, screen with 30-second radial manual pulse check (pulse check), screen with a blood pressure machine with AF detection (BP-AF), and screen with a single-lead electrocardiogram (SL-ECG). Costs and outcomes were discounted at 1.5% and the model used a lifetime horizon from a public payer perspective. Compared with no screening, screening for AF in Canadian family practice offices using pulse check or screen with a blood pressure machine with AF detection is the dominant strategy whereas screening with SL-ECG is a highly cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of CAD$4788. When different screening strategies were compared, screening with pulse check had the lowest expected costs ($202) and screening with SL-ECG had the highest expected costs ($222). The no-screening arm resulted in the lowest number of QALYs (8.74195) whereas pulse check and SL-ECG resulted in the highest expected QALYs (8.74362). Probabilistic analysis confirmed that pulse check had the highest probability of being cost-effective (63%) assuming a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY gained. Screening for AF in seniors during routine appointments with Canadian family physicians is a cost-effective strategy compared with no screening. Screening with a pulse check is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.",2018-01-26397,30144961,Can J Cardiol,Jean-Eric Tarride,2018,/,,No,30144961,"Jean-Eric Tarride; F Russell Quinn; Gord Blackhouse; Roopinder K Sandhu; Natasha Burke; David J Gladstone; Noah M Ivers; Lisa Dolovich; Andrea Thornton; Juliet Nakamya; Chinthanie Ramasundarahettige; Paul A Frydrych; Sam Henein; Ken Ng; Valerie Congdon; Richard V Birtwhistle; Richard Ward; Jeffrey S Healey; Is Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in Canadian Family Practices Cost-Effective in Patients 65 Years and Older?, Can J Cardiol, 2018 Jun 21; ():0828-282X",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Screening,Screen with 30 second radial manual pulse check vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,-7023.95,Canada,2016,-5724.69
