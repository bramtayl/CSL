20602,Screening for Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Migrants With CKD: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: In countries with a low tuberculosis (TB) incidence, TB disproportionately affects populations born abroad. TB persists in these populations through reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. Those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for reactivation and may benefit from LTBI screening and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Health administrative data from British Columbia, Canada, were used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating LTBI screening in those diagnosed with stage 4 or 5 CKD not requiring dialysis (late-stage CKD) and those who began dialysis therapy. SETTING & POPULATION: Permanent residents establishing residency in British Columbia, Canada, between 1985 and 2012 who had late-stage CKD diagnosed or began dialysis therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Screening with the tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) compared to no LTBI screening at the time of late-stage CKD diagnosis and time of dialysis therapy initiation. Treatment for those who tested positive was isoniazid for 9 months. OUTCOMES: Costs (2016 Can $), TB cases, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QALYs gained was calculated. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Discrete event simulation model using a health care system perspective, 1.5% discount rate, and 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: Screening with IGRA was superior to the tuberculin skin test in all situations. Screening with IGRA was less expensive and resulted in better outcomes compared to no screening in those initiating dialysis therapy from countries with an elevated TB incidence. In individuals with late-stage CKD, screening with IGRA was only cost-effective in those 60 years or older (cost per QALY gained, <$48,000) from countries with an elevated TB incidence. LIMITATIONS: This study has limitations in generalizability to different epidemiologic settings and in modeling complicated clinical decisions.

20613,A cost-utility analysis of decompressive hemicraniectomy versus medical treatment in the management of space-occupying brain oedema post middle cerebral artery infarction,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data from randomly controlled trials have indicated that a decompressive hemicraniectomy is more clinically effective than medical treatment in the management of space-occupying brain oedema post middle cerebral artery infarction. This economic evaluation compares the impact of the two options in the UK. No recent study has conducted an economic evaluation on this topic for the UK. METHOD: A cost-utility analysis over a time period of 1 year was used, measuring benefits in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in pound sterling, discounted to 2015 prices. The evaluation was from the perspective of the National Health Service, the largest healthcare provider in the UK. RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis found an incremental cost effectiveness of pound116 595.10 for every QALY gained if patients were offered a decompressive hemicraniectomy compared to the best medical treatment. DISCUSSION: This is above the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ''cost-effective'' threshold of pound20 000- pound30 000 per QALY, but lower mortality rates associated with the surgical alternative raises ethical considerations for healthcare providers in the UK.",2019-01-28873,30266037,Eur J Neurol,A Bhattacharyya,2019,26 / 2,313-e19,No,30266037,"A Bhattacharyya; A Tahir; A Chandrashekar; S Vasisht; L Stinson; J Omatseye; A cost-utility analysis of decompressive hemicraniectomy versus medical treatment in the management of space-occupying brain oedema post middle cerebral artery infarction, Eur J Neurol, 2019 Feb; 26(2):1351-5101; 313-e19",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",Decompressive hemicraniectomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Best medical treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,3.50,0.00,116595.1,United Kingdom,2015,194603.26

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov models were developed to compare three treatment strategies: first-line use of osimertinib, first-line use of the standard first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) followed by the second-line use of osimertinib, and the standard first-generation EGFR-TKI therapy (standard care [SOC]). Clinical data, cost, and utility data were mainly derived from published literatures. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) between the treatments. RESULTS: The resultant incremental cost per QALY gained for the first-line osimertinib versus SOC was $312,903 in the U.S. and $41,512 in China. The incremental cost per QALY for the second-line osimertinib versus SOC was $284,532 in the U.S. and $38,860 in China. The probability of the SOC strategy being cost-effective is 1.0 if the willingness to pay threshold is below $150,000/QALY in the U.S. and below $30,000/QALY in China. CONCLUSION: Osimertinib as first-line treatment could gain more health benefits in comparison with standard EGFR-TKIs or second-line use of osimertinib. However, because of the high cost of treatment, the cost-effectiveness analyses were not in favor of the first-line use of osimertinib from a public payer''s perspective in the U.S. and China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov models were developed to compare three treatment strategies: first-line use of osimertinib, first-line use of the standard first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) followed by the second-line use of osimertinib, and the standard first-generation EGFR-TKI therapy (standard care [SOC]).

20634,Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Image Guided Partial Breast Irradiation in Comparison to Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation,"PURPOSE: Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HWBI) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) represent two adjuvant radiation therapy options after breast-conserving surgery. We performed a cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of an external beam image guided APBI technique compared with HWBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: HWBI was defined as 40 Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast with or without a 10-Gy/5-fraction boost. APBI was 30 Gy in 5 fractions per Livi et al and was evaluated as both intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy. The decision analytical model measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years. Micro-costing was conducted to estimate the true cost of the different treatment regimens, and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. RESULTS: Based on micro-costing, the cost of HWBI was $4551 with boost and $3666 without boost, compared with $2966 for APBI. Including indirect costs, HWBI with boost cost $6160, HWBI without boost cost $4940, and APBI cost $3569. Cost savings for APBI compared with HWBI with and without boost was $1585 and $700 based on direct costs and $2591 and $1371 including indirect costs. APBI was also more effective, at 0.2300 quality-adjusted life years compared with 0.2289 for HWBI with or without boost. Thus, APBI was both less costly and more effective. Basing cost on Medicare reimbursement (IMRT) leads to APBI again dominating HWBI, but basing cost for APBI on reimbursement billed as stereotactic body radiation therapy leads to HWBI being far more cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Image guided partial breast irradiation is less costly to deliver and has slightly improved efficacy compared with HWBI, with or without a boost.

Cost savings for APBI compared with HWBI with and without boost was $1585 and $700 based on direct costs and $2591 and $1371 including indirect costs. APBI was also more effective, at 0.2300 quality-adjusted life years compared with 0.2289 for HWBI with or without boost. Thus, APBI was both less costly and more effective. Basing cost on Medicare reimbursement (IMRT) leads to APBI again dominating HWBI, but basing cost for APBI on reimbursement billed as stereotactic body radiation therapy leads to HWBI being far more cost-effective.

20636,Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Image Guided Partial Breast Irradiation in Comparison to Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation,"PURPOSE: Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HWBI) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) represent two adjuvant radiation therapy options after breast-conserving surgery. We performed a cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of an external beam image guided APBI technique compared with HWBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: HWBI was defined as 40 Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast with or without a 10-Gy/5-fraction boost. APBI was 30 Gy in 5 fractions per Livi et al and was evaluated as both intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy. The decision analytical model measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years. Micro-costing was conducted to estimate the true cost of the different treatment regimens, and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.

20638,A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of an Adjuvanted Subunit Vaccine for the Prevention of Herpes Zoster and Post-herpetic Neuralgia,"Background: Herpes zoster (HZ) develops in up to 50% of unvaccinated individuals, accounting for >1 million cases annually in the United States. A live attenuated HZ vaccine (LAV) is Food and Drug Administration approved for those age 50 years or older, though Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations are only for those age 60 years or older. LAV efficacy is ~70% for persons 50-59 years of age, with lower efficacy in older adults. A new 2-dose adjuvanted subunit vaccine (SUV) has >95% efficacy in persons 50-69 years of age and remains ~90% efficacious in persons vaccinated at age 70 years. Methods: To estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of SUV, LAV, and no vaccination (NoV) strategies, a Markov model was developed based on published data on vaccine efficacy, durability of protection, quality of life, resource utilization, costs, and disease epidemiology. The perspective was US societal, and the cycle length was 1 year with a lifelong time horizon. SUV efficacy was estimated to wane at the same rate as LAV. Outcomes evaluated included lifetime costs, discounted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: For individuals vaccinated at age 50 years, the ICER for LAV vs NoV was $118 535 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); at age 60 years, the ICER dropped to $42 712/QALY. SUV was more expensive but had better ICERs than LAV. At age 50, the ICER was $91 156/QALY, and it dropped to $19 300/QALY at age 60.

The Case of Ipilimumab for Metastatic Melanoma,"BACKGROUND: Innovations that extend life can generate option value and cost of experiencing future technologies. OBJECTIVES: To understand how consideration of option value may affect the potential cost-effectiveness of a treatment through a case study of ipilimumab for previously untreated metastatic melanoma. METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of ipilimumab in 2 scenarios: a conventional scenario, for which we constructed the model using the standard methods that rely on efficacy data directly from the phase III trial of ipilimumab, and an option value scenario, where we incorporated future hypothetical improvements in mortality for metastatic melanoma owing to innovations. We developed 2 approaches to incorporate option value. In the first approach, we forecasted mortality trends based on historical trends from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registry. Alternatively, we identified drugs being studied in clinical trials at the time of ipilimumab''s approval on clinicaltrials.gov and estimated their likelihood and timing of approval, potential efficacy, and cost. We accounted for increases in overall cancer treatment cost and unrelated medical cost in the option value scenario. RESULTS: In the option value scenario, using the SEER approach, the incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and the incremental cost increased by 6.2% and 3.8%, respectively, whereas the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) decreased by 2.3% compared with the conventional scenario.

20647,Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections,"PURPOSE: We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections for patients with a short-term indwelling urinary catheter. The model accounted for incidence of urinary tract infections with and without the use of prophylactic antibiotics, incidence of antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections, as well as costs associated with diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections and antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections. Costs were calculated from the health care system''s perspective. We conducted one-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that the use of prophylactic antibiotics is cost-saving in preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The use of prophylactic antibiotics resulted in lower costs and higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with no prophylactic antibiotics. Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal strategy changes to no prophylactic antibiotics when the incidence of urinary tract infections after prophylactic antibiotics exceeds 22% or the incidence of developing urinary tract infections without prophylactic antibiotics is less than 12%. Varying the costs of prophylactic antibiotics, urinary tract infection treatment, or antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infection treatment within a reasonable range did not change the optimal strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections is cost-effective under most conditions. These results were sensitive to the likelihood of developing catheter-associated urinary tract infections with and without prophylactic antibiotics.

20648,Cost-utility analysis of cataract surgery in the United States for the year 2018,"PURPOSE: To perform a cost-utility analysis of 2018 United States real dollars for cataract surgery. SETTING: Center for Value-Based Medicine, Hilton Head, South Carolina, USA. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. METHODS: A base-case 14-year cost-utility model using the ophthalmic cost perspective was used. Third-party insurer and societal cost perspectives were also analyzed. Patient outcomes and costs were discounted with net present value analysis at 3% a year. RESULTS: First-eye cataract surgery resulted in a 2.523 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain, a 33.3% patient value gain, and 25.5% quality-of-life gain. Bilateral surgery yielded a 44.1% patient value gain, while second-eye cataract surgery alone conferred an 8.1% value gain. First-eye cataract surgery resulted in a gain of 2.52 QALYs, while second-eye surgery added an incremental gain of 0.81 QALYs. The ophthalmic-cost-perspective average cost-utility ratio was $2526/2.523 = $1001/QALY for first-eye cataract surgery. The societal-cost-perspective average cost-utility ratio was -$370 018/2.523 = -$146 629/QALY. The second-eye ophthalmic-cost-perspective cost-utility ratio was $2526/0.814 = $3101/QALY, while the ophthalmic-cost-perspective cost-utility ratio for bilateral cataract surgery was $5052/3.338 = $1514/QALY. The 14-year U.S. 2018 real-dollar societal-cost-perspective net return on investment for first-eye cataract surgery was $370 018 above the $2526 cost expended for cataract surgery.

20650,Cost-effectiveness and satisfaction following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: does age matter?,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of age on the cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 patients were prospectively monitored for two years after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH), the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), and the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D). Complications and use of healthcare resources were recorded. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to express the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Propensity score-matching was used to compare those aged below and above 65 years of age. Satisfaction was determined using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Linear regression was used to identify variables that influenced the outcome at two years postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients (82.1%) completed the follow-up. Their mean age was 59.5 years (sd 9.7, 41 to 78). There were significant improvements in the mean DASH (preoperative 47.6 vs one-year 15.3; p < 0.001) and OSS scores (26.5 vs 40.5; p < 0.001). Functional improvements were maintained with no significant change between one and two years postoperatively. The mean preoperative EQ-5D was 0.54 increasing to 0.81 at one year (p < 0.001) and maintained at 0.86, two years postoperatively. There was no significant difference between those aged below or above 65 years of age with regards to postoperative shoulder function or EQ-5D gains. Smoking was the only characteristic that significantly adversely influenced the EQ-5D at two years postoperatively (p = 0.005). A total of 87 were promoters and five were passive, giving a mean NPS of 95 (87/92). The total mean cost per patient was pound3646.94 and the mean EQ-5D difference at one year was 0.2691, giving a mean ICER of pound13 552.36/QALY. At two years, this decreased further to pound5694.78/QALY. This was comparable for those aged below or above 65 years of age ( pound5209.91 vs pound5525.67). Smokers had an ICER that was four times more expensive. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair results in excellent patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, regardless of age.

20656,Chronic hepatitis B virus case-finding in UK populations born abroad in intermediate or high endemicity countries: an economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVES: The majority (>90%) of new or undiagnosed cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK are among individuals born in countries with intermediate or high prevalence levels (>/=2%). We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of increased HBV case-finding among UK migrant populations, based on a one-time opt out case-finding approach in a primary care setting. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness evaluation. A decision model based on a Markov approach was built to assess the progression of HBV infection with and without treatment as a result of case-finding. The model parameters, including the cost and effects of case-finding and treatment, were estimated from the literature. All costs were expressed in 2017/2018 British Pounds (GBPs) and health outcomes as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). INTERVENTION: Hepatitis B virus case-finding among UK migrant populations born in countries with intermediate or high prevalence levels (>/=2%) in a primary care setting compared with no intervention (background testing). RESULTS: At a 2% hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence, the case-finding intervention led to a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound13 625 per QALY gained which was 87% and 98% likely of being cost-effective at willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds of pound20 000 and pound30 000 per additional QALY, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the intervention would remain cost-effective under a pound20 000 WTP threshold as long as HBsAg prevalence among the migrant population is at least 1%. However, the results were sensitive to a number of parameters, especially the time horizon and probability of treatment uptake.

20657,Cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in the intermediate surgical risk population,"BACKGROUND: The recent PARTNER S3i trial compared transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the third-generation SAPIEN 3 device to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Using data from PARTNER S3i, we performed a contemporary cost-effectiveness analysis of current-generation TAVI versus SAVR from the Australian healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A Markov model with monthly cycles and a ten-year horizon was constructed to estimate costs, life-years and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with TAVI and SAVR. Efficacy inputs were derived from the PARTNER S3i study. Costs were estimated from published sources. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model uncertainty. RESULTS: TAVI was found to have higher immediate procedural costs than SAVR, driven primarily by the cost of the transcatheter valve. This was offset by a shorter length of hospitalisation following TAVI, such that the combined cost of initial procedure and hospitalisation was lower in TAVI compared to SAVR. With 5% annual discounting, total costs over ten-years were $50,515 AUD in TAVI and $60,144 AUD in SAVR, and TAVI was found to produce 0.33 more life years and 0.31 more QALYs than SAVR. Thus, from a health economic perspective, TAVI was dominant compared to SAVR. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, with TAVI being dominant in 68% of 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations and cost-effective in 92% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained.

20658,Cost-effectiveness of epileptic surgery compared with medical treatment in children with drug-resistant epilepsy,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy surgery is an alternative to continued antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to measure, model, and compare the medical costs and impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQL) of epilepsy surgery versus continued medical treatment with AEDs in children with DRE. METHODS: A decision analytic model was created to estimate the cost-effectiveness of epilepsy surgery relative to continued medical treatment with AEDs. The model was based on costing and effectiveness data collected from 105 children with DRE who were operated on at the Royal Children''s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. The mean cost of conducting epilepsy surgery was AU$ 61,417 per person. Effectiveness of continued medical treatment was sourced from best available literature. In the absence of published utility values for pediatric patients with epilepsy and ethical approval to contact patients directly, HRQL was estimated by four clinicians using the Child Health Utility 9 Dimension (CHU9D). Outcome measures were seizure freedom and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The costs over 7.6years of follow-up were AU$ 219,297 for the surgical treatment group compared with AU$ 170,583 for the medical treatment group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for surgically vs medical treatment was AU$ 76,538 per additional patient attaining seizure freedom and AU$ 75,541 per additional QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Epilepsy surgery resulted in a greater reduction of seizures and improvement in HRQL but was more expensive than continued medical treatment with AEDs.

20659,Cost Effectiveness of Interval Cytoreductive Surgery With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Stage III Ovarian Cancer on the Basis of a Randomized Phase III Trial,"PURPOSE: In the randomized open-label phase III OVHIPEC trial, the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to interval cytoreductive surgery (CRS) improved recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with stage III ovarian cancer. We studied the cost effectiveness of the addition of HIPEC to interval CRS in patients with ovarian cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov health-state transition model to measure costs and clinical outcomes. Transition probabilities were derived from the OVHIPEC trial by fitting survival distributions. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as euros per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), was calculated from a Dutch societal perspective, with a time horizon of 10 years. Univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the decision uncertainty. RESULTS: Total health care costs were euro70,046 (95% credibility interval [CrI], euro64,016 to euro76,661) for interval CRS compared with euro85,791 (95% CrI, euro78,766 to euro93,935) for interval CRS plus HIPEC. The mean QALY in the interval CRS group was 2.12 (95% CrI, 1.66 to 2.64 QALYs) and 2.68 (95% CrI, 2.11 to 3.28 QALYs) in the interval CRS plus HIPEC group. The ICER amounted to euro28,299/QALY. In univariable sensitivity analysis, the utility of recurrence-free survival and the number of days in the hospital affected the calculated ICER most. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the trial data, treatment with interval CRS and HIPEC in patients with stage III ovarian cancer was accompanied by a substantial gain in QALYs. The ICER is below the willingness-to-pay threshold in the Netherlands, indicating interval CRS and HIPEC is cost effective for this patient population. These results lend additional support for reimbursing the costs of treating these patients with interval CRS and HIPEC in countries with comparable health care systems.",2019-01-29076,31251694,J Clin Oncol,Simone N Koole,2019,/,JCO1900594,No,31251694,"Simone N Koole; Christiaan van Lieshout; Willemien J van Driel; Evi van Schagen; Karolina Sikorska; Jacobien M Kieffer; Jules H Schagen van Leeuwen; Henk W R Schreuder; Ralph H Hermans; Ignace H de Hingh; Jacobus van der Velden; Henriette J Arts; Leon F A G Massuger; Arend G Aalbers; Victor J Verwaal; Koen K Van de Vijver; Neil K Aaronson; Harm van Tinteren; Gabe S Sonke; Wim H van Harten; Valesca P Retel; Cost Effectiveness of Interval Cytoreductive Surgery With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Stage III Ovarian Cancer on the Basis of a Randomized Phase III Trial, J Clin Oncol, 2019 Jun 28; ():0732-183X; JCO1900594",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Surgical",Interval cytoreductive surgery + hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy vs. Interval cytoreductive surgery,Stage III; who received three neo-adjuvant chemotherapy cycles with carboplatin & paclitaxel 175 mg/m2,60 Years,60 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,4.00,1.50,28229,Euro,2017,33681.97
20660,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Pembrolizumab Plus Axitinib Versus Sunitinib in First-line Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma in China,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC), the KEYNOTE-426 study demonstrated a significant progression-free survival and overall survival for pembrolizumab plus axitinib in comparison with sunitinib. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib for previously untreated patients with aRCC in China. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the costs and health outcomes of treatment of aRCC with sunitinib or pembrolizumab plus axitinib. Univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of the model outcomes. Additional subgroup analyses were also performed. The primary outputs of the model included the total cost, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Pembrolizumab plus axitinib provided an additional 2.461 LYs (1.650 QALYs). The total cost per patient was US$178,725 for pembrolizumab plus axitinib and US$87,693 for sunitinib. The ICER for pembrolizumab plus axitinib was US$55,185/QALY versus sunitinib. Sensitivity analyses found the results to be most sensitive to pembrolizumab cost and overall hazard ratio. The results of subgroup analyses showed that the ICER remained greater than US$32,000/QALY across the all patient subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab plus axitinib is not likely to be cost effective versus sunitinib for patients with previously untreated aRCC at a threshold value of US$29,306/QALY.",2019-01-29078,31250401,Clin Drug Investig,Jun Chen,2019,/,,Yes,31250401,"Jun Chen; Gaoyun Hu; Zhuo Chen; Xiaomin Wan; Chongqing Tan; Xiaohui Zeng; Zeneng Cheng; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Pembrolizumab Plus Axitinib Versus Sunitinib in First-line Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma in China, Clin Drug Investig, 2019 Jun 27; ():1173-2563",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Pembrolizumab + axitinib vs. Sunitinib,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,55185,United States,2018,56878.08

This study aimed to determine the public health impact and cost effectiveness of an adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) compared to no vaccination and to the live attenuated vaccine (ZVL) in Canadians aged 60 years and older. METHODS: A multi-cohort Markov model has been adapted to the Canadian context using recent demographic and epidemiologic data. Simulations consisted of age-cohorts annually transitioning between health states. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at 1.5% per year. The perspective of the Canadian healthcare payer was adopted. A coverage of 80% for the first RZV and ZVL dose and a compliance of 75% for the second RZV dose were assumed. RESULTS: RZV was estimated to be cost effective compared with no vaccination with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $28,360 (Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in persons aged >/= 60 years, avoiding 554,504 HZ and 166,196 PHN cases. Compared with ZVL, RZV accrued more QALYs through the remaining lifetime and an increase in costs of approximately $50 million resulting in an average ICER of $2396. Results were robust under deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. HZ incidence rate and persistence of vaccine efficacy had the largest impact on cost effectiveness.

20663,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Non-Statin Lipid-Modifying Agents for Secondary Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Among Statin-Treated Patients in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Using non-statin lipid-modifying agents in combination with statin therapy provides additional benefits for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction, but their value for money has only been evaluated in high-income countries (HICs). Furthermore, studies mainly derive effectiveness data from a single trial or older meta-analyses. OBJECTIVES: Our study used data from the most recent network meta-analysis (NMA) and local parameters to assess the cost effectiveness of non-statin agents in statin-treated patients with a history of CVD. METHODS: A published Markov model was adopted to investigate lifetime outcomes: (1) number of recurrent CVD events prevented, (2) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, (3) costs and (4) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) and ezetimibe added to statin therapy. Event rates and effectiveness inputs were obtained from the NMA. Cost and utility data were gathered from published studies conducted in Thailand. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients receiving PCSK9i and ezetimibe experienced fewer recurrent CVD events (number needed to treat [NNT] 17 and 30) and more QALYs (0.168 and 0.096 QALYs gained per person). However, under the societal perspective and at current acquisition costs in 2018, ICERs of both agents were $US1,223,995 and 27,361 per QALY gained, respectively. Based on threshold analyses, the costs need to be reduced by 97 and 85%, respectively, for PCSK9i and ezetimibe to be cost-effective.

20667,Cost-effectiveness of endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric ERCP compared with device-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy,"BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is the second most common weight loss surgery in the United States. Treatment of pancreaticobiliary disease in this patient population is challenging due to the altered anatomy, which limits the use of standard instruments and techniques. Both nonoperative and operative modalities are available to overcome these limitations, including device-assisted (DAE) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), laparoscopic-assisted (LA) ERCP, and endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric ERCP (EDGE). The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of ERCP-based modalities for treatment of pancreaticobiliary diseases in post-RYGB patients. METHODS: A decision tree model with a 1-year time horizon was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of EDGE, DAE-ERCP, and LA-ERCP in post-RYGB patients. Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess a plausible range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, net monetary benefit calculations, and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed to assess how changes in key parameters affected model conclusions. RESULTS: EDGE resulted in the lowest total costs and highest total quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for a total of $5188/QALY, making it the dominant alternative compared with DAE-ERCP and LA-ERCP. In probabilistic analyses, EDGE was the most cost-effective modality compared with LA-ERCP and DAE-ERCP in 94.4 % and 97.1 % of simulations, respectively.

METHODS: A decision tree model with a 1-year time horizon was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of EDGE, DAE-ERCP, and LA-ERCP in post-RYGB patients. Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess a plausible range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, net monetary benefit calculations, and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed to assess how changes in key parameters affected model conclusions. RESULTS: EDGE resulted in the lowest total costs and highest total quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for a total of $5188/QALY, making it the dominant alternative compared with DAE-ERCP and LA-ERCP. In probabilistic analyses, EDGE was the most cost-effective modality compared with LA-ERCP and DAE-ERCP in 94.4 % and 97.1 % of simulations, respectively. CONCLUSION: EDGE was the most cost-effective modality in post-RYGB anatomy for treatment of pancreaticobiliary diseases compared with DAE-ERCP and LA-ERCP. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this conclusion was robust to changes in important model parameters.",2019-01-29096,31242509,Endoscopy,Hailey J James,2019,/,,No,31242509,"Hailey J James; Theodore W James; Stephanie B Wheeler; Jennifer C Spencer; Todd H Baron; Cost-effectiveness of endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric ERCP compared with device-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy, Endoscopy, 2019 Jun 26; ():1438-8812",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,Endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography vs. Standard/Usual Care- Laparoscopic-assisted ERCP,Had roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-28356.21,United States,2018,-29226.18
20669,Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis for the treatment of basilar tip aneurysms,"BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment of basilar tip aneurysms is less invasive than microsurgical clipping, but requires closer follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the additional costs associated with endovascular treatment of basilar tip aneurysms rather than microsurgical clipping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained clinical records and billing information for 141 basilar tip aneurysms treated with clip ligation (n=48) or endovascular embolization (n=93). Costs included direct and indirect costs associated with index hospitalization, as well as re-treatments, follow-up visits, imaging studies, rehabilitation, and disability. Effectiveness of treatment was quantified by converting functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score) into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was performed using cost/QALY ratios. RESULTS: Average index hospitalization costs were significantly higher for patients with unruptured aneurysms treated with clip ligation ($71 400 +/- $47 100) compared with coil embolization ($33 500 +/- $22 600), balloon-assisted coiling ($26 200 +/- $11 600), and stent-assisted coiling ($38 500 +/- $20 900). Multivariate predictors for higher index hospitalization cost included vasospasm requiring endovascular intervention, placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, longer length of stay, larger aneurysm neck and width, higher Hunt-Hess grade, and treatment-associated complications. At 1 year, endovascular treatment was associated with lower cost/QALY than clip ligation in unruptured aneurysms ($52 000/QALY vs $137 000/QALY, respectively, p=0.006), but comparable rates in ruptured aneurysms ($193 000/QALY vs $233 000/QALY, p=0.277). Multivariate predictors for higher cost/QALY included worse mRS score at discharge, procedural complications, and larger aneurysm width.

20671,Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the genicular nerves for chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on trial data,"BACKGROUND: For patients with painful knee osteoarthritis, long-term symptomatic relief may improve quality of life. Cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) has demonstrated significant improvements in pain, physical function and health-related quality of life compared with conservative therapy with intra-articular steroid (IAS) injections. This study aimed to establish the cost-effectiveness of CRFA compared with IAS for managing moderate to severe osteoarthritis-related knee pain, from the US Medicare system perspective. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis utilizing efficacy data (Oxford Knee Scores) from a randomized, crossover trial on CRFA (NCT02343003), which compared CRFA with IAS out to 6 and 12 months, and with IAS patients who subsequently crossed over to receive CRFA after 6 months. Outcomes included health benefits (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), costs and cost-effectiveness (expressed as cost per QALY gained). QALYs were estimated by mapping Oxford Knee Scores to the EQ-5D generic utility measure using a validated algorithm. Secondary analyses explored differences in the settings of care and procedures used in-trial versus real-world clinical practice. RESULTS: CRFA resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0.091 at an incremental cost of $1711, equating to a cost of US$18,773 per QALY gained over a 6-month time horizon versus IAS. Over a 12-month time horizon, the incremental QALY gain was 0.229 at the same incremental cost, equating to a cost of US$7462 per QALY gained versus IAS. Real-world cost assumptions resulted in modest increases in the cost per QALY gained to a maximum of US$21,166 and US$8296 at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that findings were robust to variations in efficacy and cost parameters.

20673,Cost-effectiveness analysis of long-course oxaliplatin and bolus of fluorouracil based preoperative chemoradiotherapy vs. 5x5Gy radiation plus FOLFOX4 for locally advanced resectable rectal cancer,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preoperative short-course radiotherapy (SCRT, 5 x 5 Gy) plus FOLFOX4 versus long-course oxaliplatin and bolus of fluorouracil based preoperative long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT, 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) in the management of cT4 or advanced cT3 rectal cancer (RC), both of which have been reported to achieve similar clinical effect in the NCT00833131 trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model compared SCRT plus chemotherapy and LCCRT, by simulating three health states (disease-free survival (DFS), progressive disease (PD) and death). The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life months (QALMs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Transition probabilities were based on the NCT00833131 trial. The costs were calculated from a Chinese payers'' perspective. Strategies were evaluated with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $2370.47 (3 x GDP) per QALM gained. Sensitivity analysis was performed to model uncertainty in these parameters. RESULTS: The overall costs for SCRT plus chemotherapy and LCCRT were $78,937 and $38,140 with effectiveness of 29.92 QALMs and 22.99 QALMs, respectively. SCRT plus chemotherapy increased costs and QALM by $40,797.34 and 6.93 compared to LCCRT, resulting in an ICER of $5884.56/QALM gained. In the DFS state, the whole cost for SCRT plus chemotherapy and LCCRT were $11,490.03 and $10,794.06 with an effectiveness of 21.70 QALMs and 19.65 QALMs, respectively. SCRT plus chemotherapy increased cost and QALM by $695.97 and 2.05 compared to LCCRT, resulting in a ICER of $339.50/QALM gained, which below the WTP. The utility associated with the DFS state was the most influential factor on the cost-effectiveness of SCRT plus chemotherapy. When the cost of PD state below $1920, the ICER of SCRT compared with LCCRT below the WTP. CONCLUSION: Compared with LCCRT, SCRT plus chemotherapy is a more cost-effective strategy for locally advanced resectable RC in the DFS state as well as in the all states when the cost of PD state below $1920.",2019-01-29116,31234886,Radiat Oncol,Shichao Wang,2019,14 / 1,113,No,31234886,"Shichao Wang; Feng Wen; Pengfei Zhang; Xin Wang; Qiu Li; Cost-effectiveness analysis of long-course oxaliplatin and bolus of fluorouracil based preoperative chemoradiotherapy vs. 5x5Gy radiation plus FOLFOX4 for locally advanced resectable rectal cancer, Radiat Oncol, 2019 Jun 24; 14(1):1748-717X; 113",QALY,China,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical","Short-course radiotherapy (SCRT, 5 × 5 Gy) plus FOLFOX4 vs. Long-course oxaliplatin and bolus of fluorouracil based preoperative long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT, 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions)",cT4 or advanced cT3 rectal cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,70620,United States,2018,72786.63
20674,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination strategies for adolescent girls and boys in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually transmitted infection worldwide. It causes several health consequences, in particular accounting for the majority of cervical cancer cases in women. In the United Kingdom, a vaccination campaign targeting 12-year-old girls started in 2008; this campaign has been successful, with high uptake and reduced HPV prevalence observed in vaccinated cohorts. Recently, attention has focused on vaccinating both sexes, due to HPV-related diseases in males (particularly for high-risk men who have sex with men) and an equity argument over equalising levels of protection. METHODS: We constructed an epidemiological model for HPV transmission in the UK, accounting for nine of the most common HPV strains. We complemented this with an economic model to determine the likely health outcomes (healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years) for individuals from the epidemiological model. We then tested vaccination with the three HPV vaccines currently available, vaccinating either girls alone or both sexes. For each strategy we calculated the threshold price per vaccine dose, i.e. the maximum amount paid for the added health benefits of vaccination to be worth the cost of each vaccine dose. We calculated results at 3.5% discounting, and also 1.5%, to consider the long-term health effects of HPV infection. RESULTS: At 3.5% discounting, continuing to vaccinate girls remains highly cost-effective compared to halting vaccination, with threshold dose prices of pound56- pound108. Vaccination of girls and boys is less cost-effective ( pound25- pound53). Compared to vaccinating girls only, adding boys to the programme is not cost-effective, with negative threshold prices (- pound6 to - pound3) due to the costs of administration. All threshold prices increase when using 1.5% discounting, and adding boys becomes cost-effective ( pound36- pound47). These results are contingent on the UK''s high vaccine uptake; for lower uptake rates, adding boys (at the same uptake rate) becomes more cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating girls is extremely cost-effective compared with no vaccination, vaccinating both sexes is less so. Adding boys to an already successful girls-only programme has a low cost-effectiveness, as males have high protection through herd immunity.

20679,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination strategies for adolescent girls and boys in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually transmitted infection worldwide. It causes several health consequences, in particular accounting for the majority of cervical cancer cases in women. In the United Kingdom, a vaccination campaign targeting 12-year-old girls started in 2008; this campaign has been successful, with high uptake and reduced HPV prevalence observed in vaccinated cohorts. Recently, attention has focused on vaccinating both sexes, due to HPV-related diseases in males (particularly for high-risk men who have sex with men) and an equity argument over equalising levels of protection. METHODS: We constructed an epidemiological model for HPV transmission in the UK, accounting for nine of the most common HPV strains. We complemented this with an economic model to determine the likely health outcomes (healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years) for individuals from the epidemiological model. We then tested vaccination with the three HPV vaccines currently available, vaccinating either girls alone or both sexes. For each strategy we calculated the threshold price per vaccine dose, i.e. the maximum amount paid for the added health benefits of vaccination to be worth the cost of each vaccine dose. We calculated results at 3.5% discounting, and also 1.5%, to consider the long-term health effects of HPV infection. RESULTS: At 3.5% discounting, continuing to vaccinate girls remains highly cost-effective compared to halting vaccination, with threshold dose prices of pound56- pound108. Vaccination of girls and boys is less cost-effective ( pound25- pound53).

20689,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination strategies for adolescent girls and boys in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually transmitted infection worldwide. It causes several health consequences, in particular accounting for the majority of cervical cancer cases in women. In the United Kingdom, a vaccination campaign targeting 12-year-old girls started in 2008; this campaign has been successful, with high uptake and reduced HPV prevalence observed in vaccinated cohorts. Recently, attention has focused on vaccinating both sexes, due to HPV-related diseases in males (particularly for high-risk men who have sex with men) and an equity argument over equalising levels of protection. METHODS: We constructed an epidemiological model for HPV transmission in the UK, accounting for nine of the most common HPV strains. We complemented this with an economic model to determine the likely health outcomes (healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years) for individuals from the epidemiological model. We then tested vaccination with the three HPV vaccines currently available, vaccinating either girls alone or both sexes. For each strategy we calculated the threshold price per vaccine dose, i.e. the maximum amount paid for the added health benefits of vaccination to be worth the cost of each vaccine dose. We calculated results at 3.5% discounting, and also 1.5%, to consider the long-term health effects of HPV infection. RESULTS: At 3.5% discounting, continuing to vaccinate girls remains highly cost-effective compared to halting vaccination, with threshold dose prices of pound56- pound108. Vaccination of girls and boys is less cost-effective ( pound25- pound53). Compared to vaccinating girls only, adding boys to the programme is not cost-effective, with negative threshold prices (- pound6 to - pound3) due to the costs of administration.

CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating girls is extremely cost-effective compared with no vaccination, vaccinating both sexes is less so. Adding boys to an already successful girls-only programme has a low cost-effectiveness, as males have high protection through herd immunity. If future health effects are weighted more heavily, threshold prices increase and vaccination becomes cost-effective.",2019-01-29117,31234784,BMC Infect Dis,Samik Datta,2019,19 / 1,552,No,31234784,"Samik Datta; Joshua Pink; Graham F Medley; Stavros Petrou; Sophie Staniszewska; Martin Underwood; Pam Sonnenberg; Matt J Keeling; Assessing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination strategies for adolescent girls and boys in the UK, BMC Infect Dis, 2019 Jun 24; 19(1):1471-2334; 552",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Immunization,"Historical vaccination, followed by girls & boys receiving quadrivalent HPV vaccine, cost = 0 GBP vs. Halted vaccination in 2017 with historical HPV vaccination for girls-only, using uptake rates from 2008-2016",Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2014,Not Stated
20699,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination strategies for adolescent girls and boys in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually transmitted infection worldwide. It causes several health consequences, in particular accounting for the majority of cervical cancer cases in women. In the United Kingdom, a vaccination campaign targeting 12-year-old girls started in 2008; this campaign has been successful, with high uptake and reduced HPV prevalence observed in vaccinated cohorts. Recently, attention has focused on vaccinating both sexes, due to HPV-related diseases in males (particularly for high-risk men who have sex with men) and an equity argument over equalising levels of protection. METHODS: We constructed an epidemiological model for HPV transmission in the UK, accounting for nine of the most common HPV strains. We complemented this with an economic model to determine the likely health outcomes (healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years) for individuals from the epidemiological model. We then tested vaccination with the three HPV vaccines currently available, vaccinating either girls alone or both sexes. For each strategy we calculated the threshold price per vaccine dose, i.e. the maximum amount paid for the added health benefits of vaccination to be worth the cost of each vaccine dose. We calculated results at 3.5% discounting, and also 1.5%, to consider the long-term health effects of HPV infection. RESULTS: At 3.5% discounting, continuing to vaccinate girls remains highly cost-effective compared to halting vaccination, with threshold dose prices of pound56- pound108. Vaccination of girls and boys is less cost-effective ( pound25- pound53). Compared to vaccinating girls only, adding boys to the programme is not cost-effective, with negative threshold prices (- pound6 to - pound3) due to the costs of administration.
