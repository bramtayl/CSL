17101,Cost-utility of biological treatment sequences for luminal Crohn's disease in Europe,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences with available biologics, including adalimumab (ADA), biosimilar infliximab (bsIFX), originator infliximab (IFX) and vedolizumab (VEDO) for luminal Crohn''s disease in nine European countries. METHODS: A Markov-model was constructed to simulate five-year medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on clinical efficacy were obtained from randomised controlled trials. Country-specific unit costs, discount rates and a third-party payer perspective were applied. RESULTS: The bsIFX versus conventional therapy resulted in the most favourable incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) ranging from euro34,580 (Hungary) to euro77,062/QALY (Sweden). Compared to bsIFX, the bsIFX-ADA sequence was more cost-effective than the bsIFX-VEDO sequence with ICURs varying between euro70,277 (France) and euro162,069/QALY (Germany). The ICURs of the bsIFX-ADA-VEDO sequence versus the bsIFX-ADA strategy were between euro206,266 (The Netherlands) and euro363,232/QALY (Spain). CONCLUSION: We are the first to compare cost-effectiveness of multiple biological sequences for luminal Crohn''s disease. Based on our findings, bsIFX can be recommended as a first-line treatment in patients unresponsive to conventional treatments. While biological sequences only slightly differ in their associated health gains, their costs vary greatly.

17110,Cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump therapy versus standard insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes in Denmark,"AIMS: The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has increased in recent years. Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) with low glucose suspend (LGS) (allowing temporary suspension of insulin delivery if blood glucose level falls below a pre-defined threshold level) provides additional benefits over CSII alone, but is associated with higher acquisition costs. Therefore, a cost-effectiveness analysis of SAP+LGS versus CSII in patients with T1D was performed. METHODS: Analyses were performed using the CORE Diabetes Model in two different patient cohorts in Denmark, one with hyperglycemia at baseline and one with increased risk for hypoglycemic events. Clinical input data were sourced from published literature. The analysis was performed over a lifetime time horizon from a societal perspective. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: In patients who were hyperglycemic at baseline the use of SAP+LGS versus CSII resulted in improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (12.44 versus 10.99 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) but higher mean lifetime costs (DKK 2,027,316 versus DKK 1,801,293) leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DKK 156,082 per QALY gained. For patients at increased risk for hypoglycemic events the ICER for SAP+LGS versus CSII was DKK 89,868 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The ICER for SAP+LGS versus CSII falls below commonly cited willingness-to-pay thresholds. Therefore, in Denmark, the use of SAP+LGS is likely to be considered cost-effective relative to CSII for patients with T1D who are either hyperglycemic, despite CSII use, or who experience frequent severe hypoglycemic events.",2017-01-23314,28432898,Diabetes Res Clin Pract,S Roze,2017,128 /,6-14,No,28432898,"S Roze; S de Portu; J Smith-Palmer; A Delbaere; W Valentine; M Ridderstrale; Cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump therapy versus standard insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes in Denmark, Diabetes Res Clin Pract, 2017 Feb 16; 128():0168-8227; 6-14",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sensor-augmented pump therapy and low glucose suspend vs. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion,Hyperglycemic,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,156082,Denmark,2015,25356.65

17112,Economic evaluation of ezetimibe treatment in combination with statin therapy in the United States,"AIMS: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ezetimibe with statin therapy vs statin monotherapy from a US payer perspective, assuming the impending patent expiration of ezetimibe. METHODS: A Markov-like economic model consisting of 28 distinct health states was used. Model population data were obtained from US linked claims and electronic medical records, with inclusion criteria based on diagnostic guidelines. Inputs came from recent clinical trials, meta-analyses, and cost-effectiveness analyses. The base-case scenario was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe 10 mg to statin in patients aged 35-74 years with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or stroke, and with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels >/=70 mg/dL over a lifetime horizon, assuming a 90% price reduction of ezetimibe after 1 year to take into account the impending patent expiration in the second quarter of 2017. Sub-group analyses included patients with LDL-C levels >/=100 mg/dL and patients with diabetes with LDL-C levels >/=70 mg/dL. RESULTS: The lifetime discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ezetimibe added to statin was $9,149 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for the base-case scenario. For patients with LDL-C levels >/=100 mg/dL, the ICER was $839/QALY; for those with diabetes and LDL-C levels >/=70 mg/dL, it was $560/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the model was sensitive to changes in cost of ezetimibe, rate reduction of non-fatal CHD, and utility weight for non-fatal CHD in the base-case and sub-group analyses.

This study explored a feasible and cost-efficient screening strategy for detecting persistent albuminuria among the high-risk population. METHODS: A cohort study including 157 clinically stable outpatients with a risk factor of CKD and whose laboratory tests revealed an albumin-creatinine-ratio (ACR) between 30 and 300 mg/g of creatinine during the previous 12 months was conducted to assess the validity of alternative screening strategies. Each participant collected three first morning urine samples in three consecutive months. These samples were labeled as DAY-1, MONTH-2 and MONTH-3. In the first month, a random spot sample in the afternoon of the first day and another morning sample on the second day were collected and labeled as Random and DAY-2. Persistent albuminuria was defined by abnormal ACR (>/=30 mg/g creatinine) for DAY-1, MONTH-2 and MONTH-3. Alternative strategies were DAY-1; Random; DAY-1 + Random; DAY-1 + DAY-2; and DAY-1 + Random + DAY-2. To evaluate the economic performance of those alternative strategies, a hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed based on the cohort study to simulate both clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate assumptions of the model and to examine the model''s robustness. RESULTS: Altogether, 82 patients exhibited persistent albuminuria. All of the five strategies had sensitivity higher than 90%. Of these strategies, Random had the lowest specificity (46.7%), and DAY-1 + Random + DAY-2 had the highest specificity (81.3%).

17120,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Skin Awareness Intervention for Early Detection of Skin Cancer Targeting Men Older Than 50 Years,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an educational intervention encouraging self-skin examinations for early detection of skin cancers among men older than 50 years. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was constructed to combine data from the Skin Awareness Trial and other published sources. The model incorporated a health system perspective and the cost and health outcomes for melanoma, squamous and basal cell carcinomas, and benign skin lesions. Key model outcomes included Australian costs (2015), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, and counts of skin cancers. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The mean cost of the intervention was A$5,298 compared with A$4,684 for usual care, whereas mean QALYs were 7.58 for the intervention group and 7.77 for the usual care group. The intervention was thus inferior to usual care. When only survival gain is considered, the model predicted the intervention would cost A$1,059 per life-year saved. The likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective up to A$50,000 per QALY gained was 43.9%. The model was stable to most data estimates; nevertheless, it relies on the specificity of clinical diagnosis of skin cancers and is subject to limited health utility data for people with skin lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention improved skin checking behaviors and encouraged men to seek medical advice about suspicious lesions, the overall costs and effects from also detecting more squamous and basal cell carcinomas and benign lesions outweighed the positive health gains from detecting more thin melanomas.",2017-01-23353,28408001,Value Health,Louisa G Gordon,2017,20 / 4,593-601,Yes,28408001,"Louisa G Gordon; Joshua Brynes; Peter D Baade; Rachel E Neale; David C Whiteman; Philippa H Youl; Joanne F Aitken; Monika Janda; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Skin Awareness Intervention for Early Detection of Skin Cancer Targeting Men Older Than 50 Years, Value Health, 2017 Apr; 20(4):1098-3015; 593-601",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Cancer screening: educational DVD about self-skin examination and the importance of presenting to a doctor if there were lesions of concern, postcard reminders to watch the DVD, a body chart to note down the location of skin lesions, and a colored brochure differentiating benign and malignant skin lesions. vs. colored brochure differentiating benign and malignant skin lesions",Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-3231.58,Australia,2015,-2654.24

METHODS: Analysis was conducted through a three-state Markov model and used data on the progression of disease with treatment from the gemcitabine arms of randomized controlled trials combined with estimates from the network meta-analysis for the newer regimens. Estimates of health care costs were obtained from local providers, and utilities were derived from the literature. The model estimates the effect of treatment regimens on costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) discounted at 5% per annum. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of greater than $30,666 per QALY, FOLFIRINOX would be the most optimal regimen. For a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the probability that FOLFIRINOX would be optimal was 57.8%. There was no price reduction for nab-paclitaxel when GnP was optimal.

17128,Cost-Effectiveness of TNF-Blocker Injection Spacing for Patients with Established Rheumatoid Arthritis in Remission: An Economic Evaluation from the Spacing of TNF-Blocker Injections in Rheumatoid Arthritis Trial,"BACKGROUND: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission, a disease activity-driven tapering of adalimumab or etanercept relying on progressive injection spacing has not been shown to be equivalent to a maintenance strategy at full dose in terms of disease activity in the Spacing of TNF-blocker injections in Rheumatoid ArthritiS Study (STRASS) trial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such a spacing strategy based on the data of the STRASS trial. METHODS: This is a cost-utility analysis of the STRASS trial, a French multicenter 18-month equivalence randomized open-label controlled trial that included patients at stable dose for at least 1 year, in remission for at least 6 months. Effectiveness was assessed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs involved in the study period were assessed from a payer perspective. The decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was calculated in the complete cases sample (n = 98). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted and the impact of missing data on DCER estimate was investigated. An acceptability analysis was performed. RESULTS: In the spacing arm, TNF-blockers were stopped for 34.1% of the patients, tapered for 43.2%, and maintained at full dose for 18.2%. The spacing strategy was associated with less QALYs gain (mean difference of -0.158; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.085 to -0.232) and reduced costs (mean difference of -euro8,440; 95% CI -6,507 to -10,212). The estimated DCER of the spacing strategy over the maintenance at full dose was euro53,417 saved per QALY lost (95% CI 32,230 to 104,700). CONCLUSIONS: The spacing strategy appears cost-effective, but the acceptability of such a QALY loss reported to the cost avoided remains to be evaluated, because no consensual threshold has been determined for willingness to accept as compared with willingness to pay.",2017-01-23355,28407999,Value Health,Antoine Vanier,2017,20 / 4,577-585,Yes,28407999,"Antoine Vanier; Xavier Mariette; Florence Tubach; Bruno Fautrel; STRASS Study Group; Cost-Effectiveness of TNF-Blocker Injection Spacing for Patients with Established Rheumatoid Arthritis in Remission: An Economic Evaluation from the Spacing of TNF-Blocker Injections in Rheumatoid Arthritis Trial, Value Health, 2017 Apr; 20(4):1098-3015; 577-585",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Spacing: disease activity–driven approach to taper bDMARD, on the basis of a predefined algorithm that progressively paced out subcutaneous injections according to the DAS28 score. vs. TNFblocker subcutaneous injections at the standard full regimen",Patients needed to be in clinical remission according to the DAS28 for at least 6 months.,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,18 Months,4.00,Not Stated,53417,Euro,2014,77650.11
17129,A Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 Testing in UK Women with Ovarian Cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (collectively termed ""BRCA"") testing in women with epithelial ovarian cancer, and testing for the relevant mutation in first- and second-degree relatives of BRCA mutation-positive individuals, compared with no testing. Female BRCA mutation-positive relatives of patients with ovarian cancer could undergo risk-reducing mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed that included the risks of breast and ovarian cancer; the costs, utilities, and effects of risk-reducing surgery on cancer rates; and the costs, utilities, and mortality rates associated with cancer. RESULTS: BRCA testing of all women with epithelial ovarian cancer each year is cost-effective at a UK willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with no testing, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound4,339/QALY. The result was primarily driven by fewer cases of breast cancer (142) and ovarian cancer (141) and associated reductions in mortality (77 fewer deaths) in relatives over the subsequent 50 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to variations in the input parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of germline BRCA mutation testing being cost-effective at a threshold of pound20,000/QALY was 99.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing germline BRCA testing in all patients with ovarian cancer would be cost-effective in the United Kingdom. The consequent reduction in future cases of breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of mutation-positive individuals would ease the burden of cancer treatments in subsequent years and result in significantly better outcomes and reduced mortality rates for these individuals.",2017-01-23356,28407998,Value Health,Anthony Eccleston,2017,20 / 4,567-576,Yes,28407998,"Anthony Eccleston; Anthony Bentley; Matthew Dyer; Ann Strydom; Wim Vereecken; Angela George; Nazneen Rahman; A Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 Testing in UK Women with Ovarian Cancer, Value Health, 2017 Apr; 20(4):1098-3015; 567-576",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,BRCA germline testing vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.50,3.50,4339,United Kingdom,2015,7242.02
17130,A Multigene Test Could Cost-Effectively Help Extend Life Expectancy for Women at Risk of Hereditary Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that women who carry gene variants that confer substantial risk for breast cancer consider risk-reduction strategies, that is, enhanced surveillance (breast magnetic resonance imaging and mammography) or prophylactic surgery. Pathogenic variants can be detected in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer syndromes by multigene panel testing. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether using a seven-gene test to identify women who should consider risk-reduction strategies could cost-effectively increase life expectancy. METHODS: We estimated effectiveness and lifetime costs from a payer perspective for two strategies in two hypothetical cohorts of women (40-year-old and 50-year-old cohorts) who meet the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined family history criteria for multigene testing. The two strategies were the usual test strategy for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and the seven-gene test strategy for variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, STK11, and PALB2. Women found to have a pathogenic variant were assumed to undergo either prophylactic surgery or enhanced surveillance. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the seven-gene test strategy compared with the BRCA1/2 test strategy was $42,067 per life-year gained or $69,920 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the 50-year-old cohort and $23,734 per life-year gained or $48,328 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the 40-year-old cohort. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the seven-gene test strategy cost less than $100,000 per life-year gained in 95.7% of the trials for the 50-year-old cohort.

17157,Quality of life and cost-utility of surgical treatment for patients with spinal metastases: prospective cohort study,"PURPOSE: Palliative surgery for patients with spinal metastasis provides good clinical outcomes. However, there have been few studies on quality of life (QOL) and cost-utility of this surgery. We aimed to elucidate QOL and cost-utility of surgical treatment for spinal metastasis. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 47 patients with spinal metastasis from 2010 to 2014 who had a surgical indication. Thirty-one patients who desired surgery underwent spinal surgery (surgery group). Sixteen patients who did not want to undergo spinal surgery (non-surgery group). The EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and relevant costs were measured at one, three, six, and 12 months after study enrollment. Health state values were obtained by Japanese EQ-5D scoring and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained were calculated for each group. Cost-utility was expressed as the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). RESULTS: Health state values improved from 0.036 at study enrollment to 0.448 at 12 months in the surgery group, but deteriorated from 0.056 to 0.019 in the non-surgery group, with a significant difference between groups (P < 0.05). The mean QALY gained at 12 months were 0.433 in the surgery group and 0.024 in the non-surgery group. The mean total cost per patient in the surgery group was $25,770 compared with $8615 in the non-surgery group. The ICUR using oneyear follow-up data was $42,003/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for spinal metastases is associated with significant improvement in health state value. In orthopaedic surgery, an ICUR less than $50,000/QALY gained is considered acceptable cost-effectiveness.

17158,Economic analysis of the breast cancer screening program used by the UK NHS: should the program be maintained?,"INTRODUCTION: One key tool thought to combat the spiraling costs of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis is the use of breast cancer screening. However, over recent years, more effective treatments and questions being raised over the safety implications of using mammography have led to the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening to be highlighted as an important issue to investigate. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted to appraise the breast cancer screening program. The analysis considered the breast cancer screening program and its utility over a 20-year period, accounting for the typical breast cancer screening period taking place between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). This accepted NHS threshold was utilized for analysis of pound20,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)- pound30,000/QALY gain. A systematic literature review was conducted to obtain relevant financial, health, and probability outcomes pertaining to the breast cancer screening program. RESULTS: The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated was at a value of pound11,546.11 with subsequent sensitivity analysis conducted around this value. Three sensitivity analyses were undertaken to evaluate ICERs of a range of scenarios which could occur as the following: 1) maximum costs at each node - pound17,254/QALY; 2) all costs are fixed costs: screening center costs, and staff are paid for regardless of use - pound14,172/QALY; and 3) combination of (1) and (2) to produce a worst case scenario pound20,823/QALY. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The majority of calculations suggested that breast cancer screening is cost-effective. However, in our worst case scenario, the ICER fell near the bottom ceiling ratio. This makes it unclear whether the program should be available in the future, as more evidence becomes available over the risks of screening and as some currently expensive chemotherapy drugs begin to lose patents.",2017-01-23393,28392714,Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press),Robert Morton,2017,9 /,217-225,No,28392714,"Robert Morton; Meelad Sayma; Manraj Singh Sura; Economic analysis of the breast cancer screening program used by the UK NHS: should the program be maintained?, Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press), 2017; 9():1179-1314; 217-225",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Breast cancer screening (mammography) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,Female,Full,20 Years,3.50,3.50,11546.11,United Kingdom,2016,16877.17
17159,Cost-effectiveness analysis of umeclidinium/vilanterol for the management of patients with moderate to very severe COPD using an economic model,"BACKGROUND: Bronchodilators such as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are central to the pharmacological management of COPD. Dual bronchodilation with umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI; 62.5/25 mug) is a novel LAMA/LABA combination approved for maintenance treatment for patients with COPD. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of maintenance treatment with UMEC/VI compared with tiotropium (TIO) 18 mug, open dual LAMA + LABA treatment, or no long-acting bronchodilator treatment in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with UMEC/VI treatment in patients with moderate to very severe COPD (GSK study number: HO-13-13411). Clinical efficacy, costs, utilities, and mortality obtained from the published literature were used as the model inputs. Costs are presented in US dollars based on 2015 prices. The model outputs are total costs, drug costs, other medical costs, number of COPD exacerbations, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3% annual rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effects of changing parameters on the uncertainty of the results. RESULTS: UMEC/VI treatment for moderate to very severe COPD was associated with lower lifetime medical costs ($82,344) compared with TIO ($88,822), open dual LAMA + LABA treatment ($114,442), and no long-acting bronchodilator ($86,751). Fewer exacerbations were predicted to occur with UMEC/VI treatment compared with no long-acting bronchodilator treatment. UMEC/VI provided an 0.11 and 0.25 increase in QALYs compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, and as such, dominated these cost-effectiveness analyses. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the results were robust. CONCLUSION: The results from this model suggest that UMEC/VI treatment would be dominant compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, and less costly than open dual LAMA + LABA treatment in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.",2017-01-23394,28392684,Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,Michele R Wilson,2017,12 /,997-1008,No,28392684,"Michele R Wilson; Jeetvan G Patel; Amber Coleman; Cheryl L McDade; Richard H Stanford; Stephanie R Earnshaw; Cost-effectiveness analysis of umeclidinium/vilanterol for the management of patients with moderate to very severe COPD using an economic model, Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis, 2017; 12():1176-9106; 997-1008",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Umeclidinium / Vilanterol (62.5/25 ug; delivering 55/22 ug administered once daily) vs. Tiotropium (TIO) (18 ug; delivering 10 ug administered once daily),Moderate to severe disease,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-59431.2,United States,2015,-64895.97

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with UMEC/VI treatment in patients with moderate to very severe COPD (GSK study number: HO-13-13411). Clinical efficacy, costs, utilities, and mortality obtained from the published literature were used as the model inputs. Costs are presented in US dollars based on 2015 prices. The model outputs are total costs, drug costs, other medical costs, number of COPD exacerbations, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3% annual rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effects of changing parameters on the uncertainty of the results. RESULTS: UMEC/VI treatment for moderate to very severe COPD was associated with lower lifetime medical costs ($82,344) compared with TIO ($88,822), open dual LAMA + LABA treatment ($114,442), and no long-acting bronchodilator ($86,751). Fewer exacerbations were predicted to occur with UMEC/VI treatment compared with no long-acting bronchodilator treatment. UMEC/VI provided an 0.11 and 0.25 increase in QALYs compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, and as such, dominated these cost-effectiveness analyses. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the results were robust. CONCLUSION: The results from this model suggest that UMEC/VI treatment would be dominant compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, and less costly than open dual LAMA + LABA treatment in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.",2017-01-23394,28392684,Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,Michele R Wilson,2017,12 /,997-1008,No,28392684,"Michele R Wilson; Jeetvan G Patel; Amber Coleman; Cheryl L McDade; Richard H Stanford; Stephanie R Earnshaw; Cost-effectiveness analysis of umeclidinium/vilanterol for the management of patients with moderate to very severe COPD using an economic model, Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis, 2017; 12():1176-9106; 997-1008",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Umeclidinium / Vilanterol (62.5/25 ug; delivering 55/22 ug administered once daily) vs. open dual LAMA + LABA treatment (TIO administered once daily and a LABA administered twice daily from separate inhalers),Moderate to severe disease,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2015,Not Stated
17161,Cost-effectiveness of a cascade screening program for the early detection of familial hypercholesterolemia,"BACKGROUND: Although familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) confers a high risk of coronary artery disease, most patients are undiagnosed, and little is known about the efficiency of genetic cascade screening programs at national level. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a national genetic cascade screening program in Spain. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed using a decision tree analysis. The choice in the decision tree was between implementation of the national program for FH (NPFH) or keeping the usual clinical care. The NPFH detects FH patients through total cholesterol measurement at primary care level and use of genetic testing in index cases and relatives. The payer (National Health System) and social (including the productivity lost) perspectives were considered. The outcome variables were coronary events avoided, deaths avoided, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: From the payer perspective, the application of the NPFH during 1 year prevents 847 coronary events and 203 deaths in the 9000 FH patients cohort during a 10-year follow-up, yielding an extra 767 QALYs, at a cost of euro29,608 per QALY gained. From the social perspective, the NPFH is dominant over the control (the cost decreases and the effectiveness increases). The sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the findings. CONCLUSION: The NPFH based on molecular testing is a cost-effective diagnostic and management strategy that supports government expenditure aimed at preventing coronary artery disease in FH patients in Spain.

Prednisolone and ciclosporin are the most commonly used treatments, although not previously compared within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of ciclosporin and prednisolone-initiated treatment for patients with PG. METHODS: Quality-of-life (EuroQoL EQ-5D-3L) and resource data were collected as part of the STOP-GAP trial: a multicentre, parallel-group, observer-blind RCT. Within-trial analysis used bivariate regression of costs and QALYs, with multiple imputation of missing data, informing a probabilistic assessment of incremental treatment cost-effectiveness from a health service perspective. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, when compared with prednisolone, ciclosporin was cost-effective due to a reduction in costs (net cost: - pound1160; 95%CI: (-2991 to 672) and improvement in quality of life (net QALYs: 0.055; 95%CI: 0.018 to 0.093). However, this finding appears driven by a minority of patients with large lesions (>/=20cm2 ) (net cost: - pound5310; 95%CI: -9729 to -891; net QALYs: 0.077; 95%CI: 0.004 to 0.151). The incremental cost-effectiveness of ciclosporin for the majority of patients with smaller lesions was pound23,374/QALY although the estimate is imprecise: the probability of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay of pound20,000/QALY was 43%. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the clinical findings of the STOP-GAP trial, patients with small lesions should receive treatment guided by the side effect profiles of the drugs and patient preference - neither strategy is clearly a preferred use of NHS resources.

17166,Cost-effectiveness of eculizumab treatment after kidney transplantation in patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome,"Background: Kidney transplantation in patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) is frequently complicated by recurrence of aHUS, often resulting in graft loss. Eculizumab prophylaxis prevents recurrence, improving graft survival. An alternative treatment strategy has been proposed where eculizumab is administered upon recurrence. We combined available evidence and performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of these competing strategies. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytical approach with Markov chain analyses was used to compare alternatives for aHUS patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD): (i) dialysis treatment, (ii) kidney transplantation, (iii) kidney transplantation with eculizumab therapy upon recurrence of aHUS, (iv) kidney transplantation with eculizumab induction consisting of 12 months of prophylaxis and (v) kidney transplantation with lifelong eculizumab prophylaxis. We assumed that all patients received a graft from a living donor and that recurrence probability was 28.4% within the first year of transplantation. Results: At 8.34 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and a cost of euro402 412, kidney transplantation without eculizumab was the least costly alternative. By comparison, dialysis was more costly and resulted in fewer QALYs gained. Eculizumab upon recurrence resulted in 9.55 QALYs gained at a cost of euro425 097. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was euro18 748 per QALY. Both eculizumab induction and lifelong eculizumab were inferior to eculizumab upon recurrence, as both resulted in fewer QALYs gained and higher costs. Conclusions: Kidney transplantation is more cost effective than dialysis to treat ESRD due to aHUS. Adding eculizumab treatment results in a substantial gain in QALYs.

17170,Mortality reduction and cost-effectiveness of performing hysterectomy at the time of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for prophylaxis against serous/serous-like uterine cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the survival benefit and cost-effectiveness of performing hysterectomy during risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) for BRCA1 mutation carriers. METHODS: Based on a recent prospective cohort study indicating an elevated incidence of serous/serous-like uterine cancers among BRCA1 mutation carriers, we constructed a modified Markov decision model from a payer perspective to inform decisions about performance of hysterectomy during RRSO at age 40. We assumed patients had previously undergone a risk-reducing mastectomy and had a residual risk of death from breast or ovarian cancer. Disease-specific survival, age-adjusted competing hysterectomy rates, and deaths from other causes were incorporated. Costs of risk-reducing surgery, competing hysterectomy, and care for serous/serous-like uterine cancer were included. RESULTS: A 40year old woman who undergoes RRSO+Hysterectomy gains 4.9 additional months of overall survival (40.38 versus 39.97 undiscounted years) compared to RRSO alone. The lifetime probabilities of developing or dying from serous/serous-like uterine cancer in the RRSO group are 3.5% and 2%, respectively. The RRSO alone strategy has an average cost of $9013 compared to $8803 for RRSO+Hysterectomy, and is dominated (less effective and more costly) when compared to RRSO+Hysterectomy. In an alternative analysis, delayed hysterectomy remains a cost-effective prevention strategy with an ICER of less than $100,000/year for up to 25years following RRSO at age 40. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of hysterectomy to RRSO in a 40year old BRCA1 mutation carrier results in a mean gain of 4.9 additional months of life and is cost-effective.",2017-01-23399,28390820,Gynecol Oncol,Laura J Havrilesky,2017,/,,No,28390820,"Laura J Havrilesky; Haley A Moss; Junzo Chino; Evan R Myers; Noah D Kauff; Mortality reduction and cost-effectiveness of performing hysterectomy at the time of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for prophylaxis against serous/serous-like uterine cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers, Gynecol Oncol, 2017 Apr 05; ():0090-8258",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy (RRSO) + Hysterectomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy (RRSO),BRCA1 mutation carriers,40 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,13479,United States,2015,14718.41
17171,Cost-effectiveness of different strategies to prevent breast and ovarian cancer in German women with a BRCA 1 or 2 mutation,"BACKGROUND: Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are at increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. This economic modeling study evaluated different preventive interventions for 30-year-old women with a confirmed BRCA (1 or 2) mutation. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and benefits [i.e., quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and life years gained (LYG)] associated with prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (BM), prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), BM plus BSO, BM plus BSO at age 40, and intensified surveillance. Relevant input data was obtained from a large German database including 5902 women with BRCA 1 or 2, and from the literature. The analysis was performed from the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) perspective. In order to assess the robustness of the results, deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: With costs of euro29,434 and a gain in QALYs of 17.7 (LYG 19.9), BM plus BSO at age 30 was less expensive and more effective than the other strategies, followed by BM plus BSO at age 40. Women who were offered the surveillance strategy had the highest costs at the lowest gain in QALYs/LYS. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost-saving was 57% for BM plus BSO. At a WTP of 10,000 euro per QALY, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 80%.

17175,Estimating cost-effectiveness associated with all-oral regimen for chronic hepatitis C in China,"BACKGROUND: All-oral regimens are associated with higher effectiveness and shorter treatment duration for chronic hepatitis C. Given its superior effect and enormous patients in China, clinicians or patients may be compelled to consider delaying treatment for all-oral regimen. OBJECTIVE: To estimate cost-effectiveness of delaying treatment for all-oral regimen in the subsequent years under different assumptions about their price and efficacy compared with standard of care in China. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NB) were calculated. And sensitivity analyses were also performed to assess the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: For treatment naive patients with Genotype 1, immediate treatment with all-oral regimen under assumed cost and efficacy at present was cost-effective compared with peginterferon alpha-2a (PegIFN) regimen at present with an ICER of $12536 per QALY gained and a positive NB of $6832 at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $21209. And it was more than 95% likely to be cost-effective if weekly drug cost was less than $1000. Moreover, patients delaying treatment for all-oral regimen in the 1st year were associated with increase in QALYs of 0.62 and increase in cost of $10114 compared with initiating PegIFN regimen at present, which resulted in a positive NB of $3115.

17181,Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Cochlear Implantation in Rural China,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost utility of cochlear implantation (CI) for severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) among children from rural settings in P.R. China (China). RESEARCH DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was undertaken using data generated from a single-center substudy of the Cochlear Pediatric Implanted Recipient Observational Study (Cochlear P-IROS). The data were projected over a 20-year time horizon using a decision tree model. SETTING: The Chinese healthcare payer and patient perspectives were adopted. INTERVENTION: Unilateral CI of children with a severe-to-profound SNHL compared with their preimplantation state of no treatment or amplification with hearing aids (""no CI"" status). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE/S: Incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The mean total discounted cost of unilateral CI was CNY 252,506 (37,876 USD), compared with CNY 29,005 (4,351 USD) for the no CI status from the healthcare payer plus patient perspective. A total discounted benefit of 8.9 QALYs was estimated for CI recipients compared with 6.7 QALYs for the no CI status. From the healthcare payer plus patient perspective, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for unilateral CI compared with no CI was CNY 100,561 (15,084 USD) per QALY. The healthcare payer perspective yielded an ICER of CNY 40,929 (6,139 USD) per QALY. Both ICERs fell within one to three times China''s gross domestic product per capita (GDP, 2011-2015), considered ""cost-effective"" by World Health Organization (WHO) standards. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with unilateral CI is a cost-effective hearing solution for children with severe to profound SNHL in rural China. Increased access to mainstream education and greater opportunities for employment, are potential downstream benefits of CI that may yield further societal and economic benefits. CI may be considered favorably for broader inclusion in medical insurance schemes across China.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

17183,Health Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness of Brief Clinician Tobacco Counseling for Youth and Adults,"PURPOSE: To help clinicians and care systems determine the priority for tobacco counseling in busy clinic schedules, we assessed the lifetime health and economic value of annually counseling youth to discourage smoking initiation and of annually counseling adults to encourage cessation. METHODS: We conducted a microsimulation analysis to estimate the health impact and cost effectiveness of both types of tobacco counseling in a US birth cohort of 4,000,000. The model used for the analysis was constructed from nationally representative data sets and structured literature reviews. RESULTS: Compared with no tobacco counseling, the model predicts that annual counseling for youth would reduce the average prevalence of smoking cigarettes during adult years by 2.0 percentage points, whereas annual counseling for adults will reduce prevalence by 3.8 percentage points. Youth counseling would prevent 42,686 smoking-attributable fatalities and increase quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 756,601 over the lifetime of the cohort. Adult counseling would prevent 69,901 smoking-attributable fatalities and increase QALYs by 1,044,392. Youth and adult counseling would yield net savings of $225 and $580 per person, respectively. If annual tobacco counseling was provided to the cohort during both youth and adult years, then adult smoking prevalence would be 5.5 percentage points lower compared with no counseling, and there would be 105,917 fewer smoking-attributable fatalities over their lifetimes.

17186,Health Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness of Asymptomatic Screening for Hypertension and High Cholesterol and Aspirin Counseling for Primary Prevention,"PURPOSE: Our aim was to update estimates of the health and economic impact of clinical services recommended for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for the comparative rankings of the National Commission on Prevention Priorities, and to explore differences in outcomes by sex and race/ethnicity. METHODS: We used a single, integrated, microsimulation model to generate comparable results for 3 services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force: aspirin counseling for the primary prevention of CVD and colorectal cancer, screening and treatment for lipid disorders (usually high cholesterol), and screening and treatment for hypertension. Analyses compare lifetime outcomes from the societal perspective for a US-representative birth cohort of 100,000 persons with and without access to each clinical preventive service. Primary outcomes are health impact, measured by the net difference in lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness, measured in incremental cost per QALY or cost savings per person in 2012 dollars. Results are also presented for population subgroups defined by sex and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Health impact is highest for hypertension screening and treatment (15,600 QALYs), but is closely followed by cholesterol screening and treatment (14,300 QALYs). Aspirin counseling has a lower health impact (2,200 QALYs) but is found to be cost saving ($31 saved per person). Cost-effectiveness for cholesterol and hypertension screening and treatment is $33,800 per QALY and $48,500 per QALY, respectively. Findings favor hypertension over cholesterol screening and treatment for women, and opportunities to reduce disease burden across all services are greatest for the non-Hispanic black population.

17188,Long-term cost-effectiveness of thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke in real life: An analysis based on data from the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke),"Background Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated substantial clinical benefit for thrombectomy in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and proximal anterior circulation arterial occlusion. Aim We investigated the long-term cost-effectiveness of thrombectomy after thrombolysis versus thrombolysis alone using real-world outcome data on need for health care, home help and nursing home care. Methods We used real-life resource use and survival data from the Swedish Stroke Register and pooled outcomes from five randomised controlled trials published in 2015 in a newly constructed Markov cost-effectiveness model with a societal perspective. Data were stratified by age (18-64; 65-74; 75-84 years) and modified Rankin scale at three months for patients with an index ischaemic stroke in 2014 fulfilling inclusion criteria NIHSS >/= 8 before treatment and treated with thrombolysis ( n = 710). Univariate sensitivity analyses explored robustness of results. A life-time perspective and 3% discount rate were applied. Results Thrombectomy increases the health care cost per patient (+GBP 9000) mainly because of intervention costs, but the reduced burden on the social services (home help services -GBP 13,000; nursing home care -GBP 26,000) implies overall cost savings. The average patient gain was 1.0 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with higher gains for younger age groups. Thrombectomy was a dominant strategy in the base case and all sensitivity analyses where social services were considered. Conclusion Thrombectomy has a small effect on hospital costs except for the direct intervention cost. However, thrombectomy is highly likely to lead to substantial cost savings in the social service sector, up to four times the increase in health-care costs.",2017-01-23434,28375069,Int J Stroke,Katarina Steen Carlsson,2017,/,1747493017701154,No,28375069,"Katarina Steen Carlsson; Gunnar Andsberg; Jesper Petersson; Bo Norrving; Long-term cost-effectiveness of thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke in real life: An analysis based on data from the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke), Int J Stroke, 2017 Jan 01; ():1747-4949; 1747493017701154",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thrombectomy after thrombolysis vs. Standard/Usual Care- Thrombolysis alone,Acute ischaemic stroke,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,-34558.27,United Kingdom,2015,-57679.55
17189,Economic evaluation of telephone-based concussion management for combat-related mild traumatic brain injury,"Introduction Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an unfortunately common repercussion of military service in a combat zone. The CONTACT study tested an individualized telephone support intervention employing problem solving therapy (PST) for mTBI in soldiers recently returned from deployment. We sought to determine the cost effectiveness of this intervention from a military healthcare system perspective. Methods We conducted an intent-to-treat post-hoc analysis by building a decision analytic model that evaluated the choice between using PST or education only (EO). The model included cost-minimization and cost-effectiveness analyses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the differences in costs of PST versus EO relative to the differences in the outcomes of participants. Results The PST intervention resulted in an annual per-enrolee cost of $1027 (95% CI: $836 to $1248), while EO costs were $32 (95% CI: $25 to $39), resulting in a net incremental cost of $996 per enrolee (95% CI: $806 to $1,217). The ICERs were $68,658/QALY based on EQ-5D (95% CI: -$463,535 to $596,661) and $49,284/QALY based on SF-6D (95% CI: $26,971 to $159,309). Estimates of treatment costs in a real-world setting were accompanied by substantially lower ICERs that are within accepted thresholds for willingness-to-pay. Discussion Although the intervention had short-term benefits sufficient to yield acceptable ICERs, there was no long-term effect of PST over EO observed in the study. Consequently, we suggest that future studies examine the use of low-cost approaches, such as booster relapse-prevention calls, that may lead to a sustained treatment benefit for this population.",2017-01-23439,28372513,J Telemed Telecare,John S Richardson,2017,/,1357633X17696586,No,28372513,"John S Richardson; Gregory F Guzauskas; Jesse R Fann; Nancy R Temkin; Nigel E Bush; Kathleen R Bell; Gregory A Gahm; Derek J Smolenski; Jo Ann Brockway; Ryan N Hansen; Economic evaluation of telephone-based concussion management for combat-related mild traumatic brain injury, J Telemed Telecare, 2017 Jan 01; ():1357-633X; 1357633X17696586",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Telephone-delivered problem-solving treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- Education only (educational brochures),Military service members recently returned from deployment experiencing combat-related mild traumatic brain injury,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,68658,United States,2015,74971.19
17190,Cost-effectiveness of a new urinary biomarker-based risk score compared to standard of care in prostate cancer diagnostics - a decision analytical model,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a new urinary biomarker-based risk score (SelectMDx; MDxHealth, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) to identify patients for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy and to compare this with the current standard of care (SOC), using only prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to select for TRUS-guided biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model were developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx as a reflex test vs SOC in men with a PSA level of >3 ng/mL. Transition probabilities, utilities and costs were derived from the literature and expert opinion. Cost-effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs of both diagnostic strategies, simulating the course of patients over a time horizon representing 18 years. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainty in assumptions. RESULTS: A diagnostic strategy including SelectMDx with a cut-off chosen at a sensitivity of 95.7% for high-grade prostate cancer resulted in savings of euro128 and a gain of 0.025 QALY per patient compared to the SOC strategy. The sensitivity analyses showed that the disutility assigned to active surveillance had a high impact on the QALYs gained and the disutility attributed to TRUS-guided biopsy only slightly influenced the outcome of the model. CONCLUSION: Based on the currently available evidence, the reduction of over diagnosis and overtreatment due to the use of the SelectMDx test in men with PSA levels of >3 ng/mL may lead to a reduction in total costs per patient and a gain in QALYs.",2017-01-23443,28370948,BJU Int,Siebren Dijkstra,2017,/,,No,28370948,"Siebren Dijkstra; Tim M Govers; Rianne J Hendriks; Jack A Schalken; Wim Van Criekinge; Leander Van Neste; Janneke P C Grutters; John P Michiel Sedelaar; Inge M van Oort; Cost-effectiveness of a new urinary biomarker-based risk score compared to standard of care in prostate cancer diagnostics - a decision analytical model, BJU Int, 2017 Mar 29; ():1464-4096",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Not Stated,patients with elevated PSA level (>3 ng/mL) undergo SelectMDx text followed by a systematic TRUS-guided biopsy if positive vs. Standard/Usual Care- patients with elevated PSA level (>3 ng/mL) undergo a systematic TRUS-guided biopsy,Men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen level (>3 ng/mL),Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,18 Years,4.00,1.50,-5120,Euro,2015,-6204.26
17191,Cost-effectiveness analysis of single-use negative pressure wound therapy dressings (sNPWT) to reduce surgical site complications (SSC) in routine primary hip and knee replacements,"We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of single-use negative pressure wound therapy in patients undergoing primary hip and knee replacements using effectiveness data from a recently completed non-blinded randomized controlled trial. A decision analytic model was developed from UK National Health Service perspective using data from a single-centre trial. 220 patients were randomized to treatment with either single-use negative pressure wound therapy or standard care i.e., film dressings of clinician choice and followed for 6 weeks. Outcomes included dressing changes, length of stay, surgical site complications, cost and quality adjusted life years. The randomized controlled trial reported a reduction in dressing changes (p = 0.002), SSC (p = 0.06) and LOS (p = 0.07) in favor of single-use negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care. The model estimated 0.116 and 0.115 QALY gained, 0.98 and 0.92 complications avoided for single-use negative pressure wound therapy and standard care, respectively. The cost/patient was pound5,602 ($7,954) and pound6,713 ($9,559) for single-use negative pressure wound therapy and standard care respectively resulting in cost-saving of pound1,132 ($1,607) in favor of single-use negative pressure wound therapy. Greater savings were observed in subgroups of higher risk patients with BMI >/= 35 and ASA >/= 3 i.e., pound7,955 ($11,296) and pound7,248 ($10,293), respectively. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, single-use negative pressure wound therapy can be considered a cost saving intervention to reduce surgical site complications following primary hip and knee replacements compared with standard care.

METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness (incremental [] cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]; or cost utility) of evolocumab plus standard of care (SoC; statins) versus SoC, assuming lifetime treatment. Cohorts with baseline LDL-C >100 mg/dL and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or CV event history (secondary prevention [SP]) were considered. Lifetime CV event rates were predicted either (1) using risk equations considering local risk factors (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cohort Study) adjusted to reflect the increased risk of FH patients or (2) using CV event rates from local registries (Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care) for SP patients. LDL-C relative reductions from evolocumab trials (Evolocumab 140 mg Q2W (bi-weekly) and 420 mg QM (monthly)) were converted into CV event reductions using rate ratios per millimole per liter (mmol/L; 38.67 mg/dL) from a meta-analysis of statin trials (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists'' Collaboration). FINDINGS: Predicted 10-year/lifetime CV risks were 50%/95% (FH) and 62%/82% (SP) for SoC and 27%/83% (FH) and 44%/69% (SP) for evolocumab plus SoC.

17194,MICE or NICE? An economic evaluation of clinical decision rules in the diagnosis of heart failure in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Detection and treatment of heart failure (HF) can improve quality of life and reduce premature mortality. However, symptoms such as breathlessness are common in primary care, have a variety of causes and not all patients require cardiac imaging. In systems where healthcare resources are limited, ensuring those patients who are likely to have HF undergo appropriate and timely investigation is vital. DESIGN: A decision tree was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of using the MICE (Male, Infarction, Crepitations, Edema) decision rule compared to other diagnostic strategies to identify HF patients presenting to primary care. METHODS: Data from REFER (REFer for EchocaRdiogram), a HF diagnostic accuracy study, was used to determine which patients received the correct diagnosis decision. The model adopted a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. RESULTS: The current recommended National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for identifying patients with HF was the most cost-effective option with a cost of pound4400 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to a ""do nothing"" strategy. That is, patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of HF should be referred straight for echocardiography if they had a history of myocardial infarction or if their NT-proBNP level was >/=400pg/ml.

17199,Long-term clinical outcomes and economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet versus care as usual in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy,"OBJECTIVE: To examine long-term retention rate, clinical outcomes, cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of the Ketogenic Diet (KD) compared with care as usual (CAU) in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy from a societal perspective. METHODS: Participants were randomized into a KD or CAU group. Seizure frequency, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), side-effects, seizure severity, health care costs, production losses, patient and family costs were assessed at baseline and during 16-months of follow-up. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e. cost per QALY and cost per responder) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are presented. RESULTS: 48 children were included in the analyses of this study (26 from KD group). In total, 58% of the KD group completed the follow-up of 16 months; 11 dropped-out for various reasons. At 16 months, 35% of the KD participants had a seizure reduction>/=50% from baseline, compared with 18% of the CAU participants. Mean costs per patient in the CAU group were euro53,367 (extrapolated) compared to euro61,019 per patient in the KD group, resulting in an ICER of euro46,564 per responder. Cost per QALY rose well above any acceptable ceiling ratio. At 4-months'' follow-up, the KD group showed significantly more gastro-intestinal problems compared to the CAU group. At 16 months, the KD group reported fewer problems compared to CAU. Furthermore, 46.2% of the KD group reported a decrease in severity of their worst seizure compared to 32% of the CAU group. CONCLUSION: The KD group resulted in more responders and showed greater improvement on seizure severity. Furthermore, the KD did not lead to worsening of side-effects other than gastro-intestinal problems (only at 4 months'' follow-up). However, as only a minimal difference in QALYs was found between the KD group and the CAU group, the resulting cost per QALY ratios were inconclusive.",2017-01-23464,28364726,Epilepsy Res,Ben F M Wijnen,2017,132 /,91-99,No,28364726,"Ben F M Wijnen; Reina J A de Kinderen; Danielle A J E Lambrechts; Debby Postulart; Albert P Aldenkamp; Marian H J M Majoie; Silvia M A A Evers; Long-term clinical outcomes and economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet versus care as usual in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy, Epilepsy Res, 2017 May; 132():1872-6844; 91-99",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,ketogenic diet vs. Standard/Usual Care,Intractable epilepsy,17 Years,1 Years,"Female, Male",Full,16 Months,4.00,4.00,46564,Euro,2013,68706.99

Materials and Methods: Cost effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov cohort simulation model, with Quality Adjusted Life Years as the unit of effectiveness. The strategies considered were a) current: biennial Papanicolaou smear cytology of females aged 20 or above, b) strong screening recommendation by mail to target regions, (effect: 12% increase in screening uptake, cost: 1000 Korean Won per person) c) regular universal screening recommendation by mail, (effect: 6% increase in screening uptake, cost: 500 Korean Won per person) and d) strong universal screening recommendation by mail (effect: 12% increase in screening uptake, cost: 1000 Korean Won per person). Distributional cost effectiveness analysis was conducted by calculating the cost effectiveness of strategies using the Atkinson Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio. Results: All strategies were under the threshold value, which was set as the Korean Gross Domestic Product of $25,990. In particular, the ''strong screening recommendation to target regions'' strategy was found to be the most cost effective (Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio: 7,361,145 Korean Won). This was also true when societal inequality aversion increased in the distributional cost effectiveness analysis. Conclusion: The ''strong screening recommendation to target regions'' strategy was the most cost effective approach, even when adjusting for inequality. As efficiency and equity are objectives concurrently sought in healthcare, these findings imply a need to develop appropriate economic evaluation methodologies to assess healthcare policies.",2017-01-23467,28361522,Cancer Res Treat,Tae-Hoon Lee,2017,/,,No,28361522,"Tae-Hoon Lee; Woorim Kim; Jaeyong Shin; Eun-Cheol Park; Sohee Park; Tae Hyun Kim; Strategic Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Improving National Cancer Screening Uptake in Cervical Cancer: A Focus on Regional Inequality in South Korea, Cancer Res Treat, 2017 Mar 30; ():2005-9256",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Current (baseline) vs. None,Null,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.00,1.00,7361145,South Korea,2016,6826.57
