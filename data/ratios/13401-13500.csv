13401,"Stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in France: comparative cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban), warfarin, and aspirin","OBJECTIVES: To conduct an economic evaluation of the currently prescribed treatments for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) including warfarin, aspirin, and novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) from a French payer perspective. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted in accordance to the new French guidelines of the Commission for Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP), to adopt the recommended efficiency frontier approach. A cohort of patients with NVAF eligible for stroke preventive treatment was simulated over lifetime. Clinical events modeled included strokes, systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant non-major bleeds, and myocardial infarction. Efficacy and bleeding data for warfarin, apixaban, and aspirin were obtained from ARISTOTLE and AVERROES trials, whilst efficacy data for other NOACs were from published indirect comparisons. Acute medical costs were obtained from a dedicated analysis of the French national hospitalization database (PMSI). Long-term medical costs and utility data were derived from the literature. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model projections. RESULTS: Warfarin and apixaban were the two optimal treatment choices, as the other five treatment strategies including aspirin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran in sequential dosages, dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban were strictly dominated on the efficiency frontier. Further, apixaban was a cost-effective alternative vs warfarin with an incremental cost of euro2314 and an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of 0.189, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro12,227/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban may be the most economically efficient alternative to warfarin in NVAF patients eligible for stroke prevention in France. All other strategies were dominated, yielding apixaban as a less costly yet more effective treatment alternative.

13406,Routine echocardiography screening for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors: a model-based estimation of the clinical and economic effects,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors treated with cardiotoxic therapies are recommended to have routine cardiac assessment every 1 to 5 years, but the long-term benefits are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of routine cardiac assessment to detect asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker treatment to reduce congestive heart failure (CHF) incidence in childhood cancer survivors. DESIGN: Simulation model. DATA SOURCES: Literature, including data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. TARGET POPULATION: Childhood cancer survivors. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Interval-based echocardiography assessment every 1, 2, 5, or 10 years, with subsequent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or beta-blocker treatment for patients with positive test results. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime risk for systolic CHF, lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The lifetime risk for systolic CHF among 5-year childhood cancer survivors aged 15 years was 18.8% without routine cardiac assessment (average age at onset, 58.8 years). Routine echocardiography reduced lifetime risk for CHF by 2.3% (with assessment every 10 years) to 8.7% (annual assessment). The ICER for assessment every 10 years was $111 600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with no assessment. Assessment every 5 years had an ICER of $117 900 per QALY, and ICERs for more frequent assessment exceeded $165 000 per QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to treatment effectiveness, absolute excess risk for CHF, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction asymptomatic period. The probability that assessment every 10 or 5 years was preferred at a $100 000-per-QALY threshold was 0.33 for the overall cohort. LIMITATION: Treatment effectiveness was based on adult data.

13407,Cost-effectiveness of the children's oncology group long-term follow-up screening guidelines for childhood cancer survivors at risk for treatment-related heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines are at high risk for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD), subsequent heart failure, and death. The consensus-based Children's Oncology Group (COG) Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines recommend lifetime echocardiographic screening for ALVD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the COG guidelines and to identify more cost-effective screening strategies. DESIGN: Simulation of life histories using Markov health states. DATA SOURCES: Childhood Cancer Survivor Study; published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Childhood cancer survivors. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Echocardiographic screening followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker therapies after ALVD diagnosis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in dollars per QALY, and cumulative incidence of heart failure. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The COG guidelines versus no screening have an ICER of $61 500, extend life expectancy by 6 months and QALYs by 1.6 months, and reduce the cumulative incidence of heart failure by 18% at 30 years after cancer diagnosis. However, less frequent screenings are more cost-effective than the guidelines and maintain 80% of the health benefits. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER was most sensitive to the magnitude of ALVD treatment efficacy; higher treatment efficacy resulted in lower ICER. LIMITATION: Lifetime non-heart failure mortality and the cumulative incidence of heart failure more than 20 years after diagnosis were extrapolated; the efficacy of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy in childhood cancer survivors with ALVD is undetermined (or unknown). CONCLUSION: The COG guidelines could reduce the risk for heart failure in survivors at less than $100 000/QALY.

13408,Direct healthcare costs and cost-effectiveness of acute coronary syndrome secondary prevention with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel: economic evaluation from the public payer's perspective in Poland based on the PLATO trial results,"BACKGROUND: Ticagrelor is the first reversibly binding oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist designed to reduce clinical thrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor has been proven to significantly reduce the rate of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke without an increase in the rate of overall major bleeding in patients who have an ACS with or without ST-segment elevation (STEMI and NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA). AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and healthcare costs associated with secondary prevention of ACS using ticagrelor or clopidogrel in patients after STEMI, NSTEMI and UA. METHODS: An economic model based on results from the PLATO trial was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of one-year therapy with ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The structure of the model consisted of two parts, i.e. the decision tree with one-year PLATO results and the Markov model with lifelong estimations, which exceeded PLATO follow-up data. The model was adjusted to Polish settings with country-specific data on death rates in the general population and direct medical costs calculated from the public payer's perspective. Costs were derived from the National Health Fund (NHF) and the Ministry of Health and presented in PLN 2013 values. Annual mean costs of second and subsequent years after stroke or MI were obtained from the literature. Uncertainty of assumed parameters was tested in scenarios and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The adopted model allowed the estimation of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for life years gained (LYG) and an incremental cost-utility ratio for quality adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: Total direct medical costs to the public payer at a one year horizon were 2,905 PLN higher with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel. However, mean healthcare costs at a one year horizon (excluding drug costs and concomitant drugs) were 690 PLN higher for patients treated with clopidogrel. In a lifetime horizon, results indicated that ticagrelor was the more cost-effective option compared to generic clopidogrel, with an incremental cost per LYG estimated at 21,566 PLN and an incremental costper QALY estimated at 24,965 PLN. CONCLUSIONS: In a lifetime horizon, which should be used when comparing technologies with different impacts on mortality, cost-effectiveness evaluation resulted in more favourable economic outcomes for ticagrelor than for generic clopidogrel, with the cost per QALY well below the recommended willingness to pay threshold in Poland (24,965 PLN vs. 111,381 PLN).",2014-01-16553,24846362,Kardiol Pol,Justyna Paweska,2014,72 / 9,823-30,No,24846362,"Justyna Paweska; Tomasz Macioch; Piotr Perkowski; Andrzej Budaj; Maciej Niewada; Direct healthcare costs and cost-effectiveness of acute coronary syndrome secondary prevention with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel: economic evaluation from the public payer's perspective in Poland based on the PLATO trial results, Kardiol Pol, ; 72(9):0022-9032; 823-30",QALY,Poland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ticagrelor (180 mg/daily dose) vs. Clopidogrel (75 mg/daily dose),with or without ST-segment elevation (STEMI and NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA),Not Stated,63 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,5.00,3.50,24965,Poland,2013,9202.69
13409,A cost-effectiveness study of intravenous immunoglobulin in childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura patients with life-threatening bleeding,"BACKGROUND: Although the international guideline recommends intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as the first-line treatment for childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) with life-threatening bleeding, ITP patients may not be able to access IVIG because of the limitation in health benefit packages especially in developing countries. There remains an important policy question as to whether IVIG used as a first-line treatment is worth the money spent. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of adding IVIG to the standard treatment of platelet transfusion and corticosteroids, for the treatment of childhood ITP with life-threatening bleeding in the context of Thailand. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a hybrid model consisting of a decision tree and Markov models was conducted with a societal perspective. The effectiveness and utility parameters were determined by systematic reviews, while costs and mortality parameters were determined using a retrospective electronic hospital database analysis. All costs were presented in 2012 US$. The discount rate of 3 % was applied for both costs and outcomes. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $3,172 per quality-adjusted life-year gained ($/QALY) for the addition of IVIG versus standard treatment alone. The probability of response to corticosteroids was the most influential parameter on ICER. According to the willingness-to-pay of Thailand, of approximately $3,861/QALY, the probability of IVIG being cost effective was 33 %. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of IVIG to standard treatment in the treatment of childhood ITP with life-threatening bleeding is possibly a cost-effective intervention in Thailand.

13410,Tocilizumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Since receiving a positive recommendation in England, Wales and Scotland, tocilizumab (TCZ) is one of the options available to clinicians for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in the UK. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding TCZ to the current treatment sequence of RA patients from a UK payer's perspective over a patient lifetime horizon. METHODS: An individual sampling model was developed to synthesise all clinical and economic inputs. Two scenarios were explored separately: patients contraindicated to methotrexate (MTX) and those MTX tolerant. For each scenario, the analysis compared three strategies. The standard of care (SoC) strategy included a sequence of the most commonly prescribed biologics; the other two comparator strategies considered the addition of TCZ to SoC at first line and second line. Patient characteristics were representative of UK patients. Treatment efficacy and quality-of-life evidence were synthesised from clinical trials and secondary sources. An analysis of a patient registry informed the model parameters regarding treatment discontinuation. The safety profile of all treatments in a given strategy was based on a network meta-analysis and literature review. Resource utilisation, treatment acquisition, administration, monitoring and adverse event treatment costs were considered. All costs reflect 2012 prices. Uncertainty in model parameters was explored by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the MTX-contraindicated population, if TCZ was added to the SoC in first line, the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound7,300 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; if added in second line, the estimated ICER was pound11,400 per QALY. In the MTX-tolerant population, the estimated costs and QALYs of the TCZ strategy were similar to those of the SoC strategy. Sensitivity analysis showed that parameters that affect the treatment cost (such as patient weight) can have a noticeable impact on the overall cost-effectiveness results.

13413,Tocilizumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Since receiving a positive recommendation in England, Wales and Scotland, tocilizumab (TCZ) is one of the options available to clinicians for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in the UK. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding TCZ to the current treatment sequence of RA patients from a UK payer's perspective over a patient lifetime horizon. METHODS: An individual sampling model was developed to synthesise all clinical and economic inputs. Two scenarios were explored separately: patients contraindicated to methotrexate (MTX) and those MTX tolerant. For each scenario, the analysis compared three strategies. The standard of care (SoC) strategy included a sequence of the most commonly prescribed biologics; the other two comparator strategies considered the addition of TCZ to SoC at first line and second line.

13414,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Early Reconstruction Versus Rehabilitation and Delayed Reconstruction for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears,"BACKGROUND: An initial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear can be treated with surgical reconstruction or focused rehabilitation. The KANON (Knee Anterior cruciate ligament, NON-surgical versus surgical treatment) randomized controlled trial compared rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction (ACLR) to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACLR and found no difference at 2 years by an intention-to-treat analysis of total Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) results. PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of early versus delayed ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed for a cost-utility analysis of early reconstruction (ER) versus rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (DR). Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from 2 sources: the KANON study and the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) database. Collectively, these 2 sources provided data from 928 ACL-injured patients. Utilities were measured by the Short Form-6 dimensions (SF-6D). Costs were estimated from a societal perspective in 2012 US dollars. Costs and utilities were discounted in accordance with the United States Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Principal outcome measures were average incremental costs, incremental effectiveness (as measured by QALYs), and net health benefits. Willingness to pay was set at $50,000, which is the currently accepted standard in the United States. RESULTS: In the base case, the ER group resulted in an incremental gain of 0.28 QALYs over the DR group, with a corresponding lower overall cost to society of $1572. Effectiveness gains were driven by the low utility of an unstable knee and the lower utility for the DR group. The cost of rehabilitation and the rate of additional surgery drove the increased cost of the DR group. The most sensitive variable was the rate of knee instability after initial rehabilitation. When the rate of instability falls to 51.5%, DR is less costly, and when the rate of instability falls below 18.0%, DR becomes the preferred cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSION: An economic analysis of the timing of ACLR using data exclusively from the KANON trial, MOON cohort, and national average reimbursement revealed that early ACLR was more effective (improved QALYs) at a lower cost than rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACLR. Therefore, early ACLR should be the preferred treatment strategy from a societal health system perspective.",2014-01-16571,24801663,Am J Sports Med,Richard C 3rd Mather,2014,42 / 7,1583-1591,No,24801663,"Richard C 3rd Mather; Carolyn M Hettrich; Warren R Dunn; Brian J Cole; Bernard R Jr Bach; Laura J Huston; Emily K Reinke; Kurt P Spindler; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Early Reconstruction Versus Rehabilitation and Delayed Reconstruction for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears, Am J Sports Med, 2014 Jul; 42(7):1552-3365; 1583-1591",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction (ACLR) vs. Rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACLR,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-5610.71,United States,2012,-6324.71
13415,Prevention and screening programs for anterior cruciate ligament injuries in young athletes: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common among young athletes. Biomechanical studies have led to the development of training programs to improve neuromuscular control and reduce ACL injury rates as well as screening tools to identify athletes at higher risk for ACL injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these training methods and screening strategies for preventing ACL injuries. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was created to evaluate three strategies for a population of young athletes participating in organized sports: (1) no training or screening, (2) universal neuromuscular training, and (3) universal screening, with neuromuscular training for identified high-risk athletes only. Risk of injury, risk reduction from training, and sensitivity and specificity of screening were based on published data from clinical trials. Costs of training and screening programs were estimated on the basis of the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key model parameters to evaluate their effect on base case conclusions. RESULTS: Universal neuromuscular training of all athletes was the dominant strategy, with better outcomes and lower costs compared with screening. On average, the implementation of a universal training program would save $100 per player per season, and would reduce the incidence of ACL injury from 3% to 1.1% per season. Screening was not cost-effective within the range of reported sensitivity and specificity values. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Given its low cost and ease of implementation, neuromuscular training of all young athletes represents a cost-effective strategy for reducing costs and morbidity from ACL injuries.

In 12 scenarios, we explored the impact of different assumptions on the incremental cost-effectiveness ration (ICER) of PCV13 over PCV10.Taking only direct effects on invasive pneumococcal disease into account, PCV13 was not found to be cost-effective, at a price difference of ?11 per dose. If herd protection, replacement and non-invasive disease were also taken into account, the ICER of PCV13 compared with PCV10 was below ?30?000/QALY gained in 11 of 12 scenarios.

13418,Cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and perfusion imaging for delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm are significant complications following SAH leading to cerebral infarction, functional disability, and death. In recent years, CTA and CTP have been used to increase the detection of delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm. Our aim was to perform comparative-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analyses evaluating CTA and CTP for delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm in aneurysmal SAH from a health care payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision model comparing CTA and CTP with transcranial Doppler sonography for detection of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia in SAH. The clinical pathways were based on the ""Guidelines for the Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association"" (2012). Outcome health states represented mortality and morbidity according to functional outcomes. Input probabilities of symptoms and serial test results from CTA and CTP, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and digital subtraction angiography were directly derived from an SAH cohort by using a multinomial logistic regression model. Expected benefits, measured as quality-adjusted life years, and costs, measured in 2012 US dollars, were calculated for each imaging strategy. Univariable, multivariable, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the independent and combined effect of input parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The transcranial Doppler ultrasound strategy yielded 13.62 quality-adjusted life years at a cost of $154,719. The CTA and CTP strategy generated 13.89 quality-adjusted life years at a cost of $147,097, resulting in a gain of 0.27 quality-adjusted life years and cost savings of $7622 over the transcranial Doppler ultrasound strategy. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust to plausible input parameter uncertainty. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results yielded 96.8% of iterations in the right lower quadrant, representing higher benefits and lower costs. CONCLUSIONS: Our model results suggest that CTA and CTP are the preferred imaging strategy in SAH, compared with transcranial Doppler ultrasound, leading to improved clinical outcomes and lower health care costs.",2014-01-16582,24812015,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,P C Sanelli,2014,35 / 9,1714-20,No,24812015,"P C Sanelli; A Pandya; A Z Segal; A Gupta; S Hurtado-Rua; J Ivanidze; K Kesavabhotla; D Mir; A I Mushlin; M G M Hunink; Cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and perfusion imaging for delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, ; 35(9):0195-6108; 1714-20",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Computer tomography angiography and perfusion imaging (CTAP) vs. Standard/Usual Care- transcranial doppler sonography (TCD),experiencing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH),Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-28229.63,United States,2012,-31821.99
13419,Withdrawal of immunosuppression following pediatric liver transplantation: a Markov analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Survivors of pediatric liver transplantation are at risk for developing complications related to posttransplant immunosuppressive medications. Withdrawal is possible in selected patients but carries the risk of graft rejection and loss. We modeled the effect of withdrawing immunosuppressive medications on survival, cost, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in a hypothetical cohort of pediatric patients who received transplantation for biliary atresia with stable liver enzymes and no recent episodes of rejection, and who were free from immunosuppression-related adverse effects. METHODS: A decision analysis tree was developed, and Monte Carlo simulations were used to track patients through the model during a 10-year time course with 1-year cycles. Data from the literature were used to assign probabilities to major clinical events and preference-based utility scores to the values of health outcomes. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: Patients following the withdrawal strategy had a 10-year survival rate of 95.8% and experienced 8.61 QALYs versus 88.6% survival and 8.01 QALYs for those taking immunosuppressive medications. Each additional QALY is attained at a cost of -$18,992.41 and was therefore cost saving. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in our model who had their immunosuppression withdrawn had improved survival and QALYs with lower costs. Although every effort was made to validate the model, it is limited by the accuracy of the underlying assumptions. Therefore, clinical trials are needed to determine predictors of successful immunosuppression withdrawal to allow for personalization of medication regimens.",2014-01-16584,24813534,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Saeed Mohammad,2014,59 / 2,182-9,No,24813534,"Saeed Mohammad; Zhe Li; Michael Englesbe; Anton Skaro; Estella Alonso; Withdrawal of immunosuppression following pediatric liver transplantation: a Markov analysis, J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr, ; 59(2):1536-4801; 182-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Withdrawal from immunosuppressive medication (cyclosporine) following liver transplantation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Continuing immunosupressive medications,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-18994.08,United States,2010,-22544.11
13420,Cost-effectiveness of classroom-based cognitive behaviour therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in adolescents: a trial-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: A substantial minority of adolescents suffer from depression and it is associated with increased risk of suicide, social and educational impairment, and mental health problems in adulthood. A recently conducted randomized controlled trial in England evaluated the effectiveness of a manualized universally delivered age-appropriate CBT programme in school classrooms. The cost-effectiveness of the programme for preventing low mood and depression for all participants from a health and social care sector perspective needs to be determined. METHODS: A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis based on a cluster-randomized controlled trial (trial registration--ISRCTN 19083628) comparing classroom-based CBT with usual school provision of Personal Social and Health Education. Per-student cost of intervention was estimated from programme records. The study was undertaken in eight mixed-sex U.K. secondary schools, and included 3,357 school children aged 12 to 16 years (in the two trial arms evaluated in the cost-effectiveness analysis). The main outcome measures were individual self-reported data on care costs, Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs, based on the EQ-5D health-related quality-of-life instrument) and symptoms of depression (Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire) at baseline, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Although there was lower quality-adjusted life-years over 12 months (-.05 QALYs per person, 95% confidence interval -.09 to -.005, p = .03) with CBT, this is a 'clinically' negligible difference, which was not found in the complete case analyses. There was little evidence of any between-arm differences in SMFQ scores (0.19, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.95, p = .62), or costs ( pound142, 95% CI - pound132 to pound415, p = .31) per person for CBT versus usual school provision.

13421,In Denmark kidney transplantation is more cost-effective than dialysis,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 5,000 Danish patients are being treated for end-stage renal disease, for which the two treatment options are dialysis and transplantation. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of kidney transplantation versus dialysis from a public health-care perspective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a decision analytic model. The model was designed as a Markov model in which all relevant costs and effects of the two alternative treatments were included. Deterministic data were used alongside the best available evidence from the literature. To estimate the overall uncertainty concerning the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a probabilistic sensitivity analysis with second-order Monte Carlo simulations was carried out on a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients. RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was 1,032,934 DKK for dialysis compared with 810,516 DKK for transplantation. When comparing kidney transplantation with dialysis, kidney transplantation was cost-saving and resulted in additional QALYs. When taking the overall uncertainty associated with the ICER into account, an incremental cost-effectiveness scatter plot supported that transplantation was dominating and that the results were robust. In addition, a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that transplantation had a 99.93% likelihood of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay value of 0 DKK. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness ratio was favourable for kidney transplantation when compared with dialysis. In view of this, it was concluded that transplantation is preferable to dialysis when treating patients with end-stage renal disease. FUNDING: not relevant.

13422,Three-year cost-effectiveness model for non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dextranomer copolymer compared with sacral nerve stimulation after conservative therapy for the management of fecal incontinence,"BACKGROUND: Two new therapies for fecal incontinence (FI) are now available: non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dextranomer copolymer (NASHA/Dx) and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of NASHA/Dx compared with SNS and conservative therapy (CT) for the treatment of FI after CT failure. METHODS: Decision tree models with Markov subbranches were developed to compare all direct costs and outcomes during a 3-year period from the viewpoint of the US third-party payer. Costs (in 2013 US dollars) of devices, medical and surgical care, and hospitalization were included. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incontinence-free days (IFDs). Both costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for each outcome. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of results and model stability. A budget impact analysis was also undertaken to estimate the potential cost and savings of NASHA/Dx for a payer with 1,000,000 covered lives. RESULTS: For the 3-year cost-effectiveness models, the expected cost was $9053 for CT, $14,962 for NASHA/Dx, and $33,201 for SNS. The numbers of QALYs were 1.769, 1.929, and 2.004, respectively. The numbers of IFDs were 128.8, 267.6, and 514.8, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per additional IFD gained were $42.60 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $73.76 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $62.55 for SNS vs CT. The incremental costs per QALY gained were $37,036 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $244,509 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $103,066 for SNS vs CT. The budget impact analysis evaluated the financial effect on the health care system of the use of NASHA/Dx and SNS. For the scenarios evaluated, when all of the patients receive NASHA/Dx, the net annual effect to the health care payer budget ranged from $571,455 to $2,857,275. When all of the patients receive SNS, the net annual effect to the health care payer budget ranged from $1,959,323 to $9,796,613. CONCLUSION: Both NASHA/Dx and SNS have produced significant improvements in FI symptoms for affected patients. NASHA/Dx is a cost-effective and more efficient use of resources for the treatment of FI when compared with SNS. The budget impact analysis suggests that although reimbursement for NASHA/Dx treatment initially adds costs to the health care system, it is significantly less expensive than SNS for patients who are candidates for either treatment.",2014-01-16590,24815061,Clin Ther,Mitchell A Bernstein,2014,36 / 6,890-905.e3,Yes,24815061,"Mitchell A Bernstein; Christopher H Purdy; Alison Becker; Raf Magar; Three-year cost-effectiveness model for non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dextranomer copolymer compared with sacral nerve stimulation after conservative therapy for the management of fecal incontinence, Clin Ther, ; 36(6):1879-114X; 890-905.e3",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dexatranomer copolymer (NASHA/Dx) treatment vs. sacral nervestimulation (SNS),conservative therapy (CT) failure,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,244509,United States,2013,271645.06

For the scenarios evaluated, when all of the patients receive NASHA/Dx, the net annual effect to the health care payer budget ranged from $571,455 to $2,857,275. When all of the patients receive SNS, the net annual effect to the health care payer budget ranged from $1,959,323 to $9,796,613. CONCLUSION: Both NASHA/Dx and SNS have produced significant improvements in FI symptoms for affected patients. NASHA/Dx is a cost-effective and more efficient use of resources for the treatment of FI when compared with SNS.

13424,Three-year cost-effectiveness model for non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dextranomer copolymer compared with sacral nerve stimulation after conservative therapy for the management of fecal incontinence,"BACKGROUND: Two new therapies for fecal incontinence (FI) are now available: non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dextranomer copolymer (NASHA/Dx) and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of NASHA/Dx compared with SNS and conservative therapy (CT) for the treatment of FI after CT failure. METHODS: Decision tree models with Markov subbranches were developed to compare all direct costs and outcomes during a 3-year period from the viewpoint of the US third-party payer. Costs (in 2013 US dollars) of devices, medical and surgical care, and hospitalization were included. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incontinence-free days (IFDs). Both costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for each outcome. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of results and model stability. A budget impact analysis was also undertaken to estimate the potential cost and savings of NASHA/Dx for a payer with 1,000,000 covered lives. RESULTS: For the 3-year cost-effectiveness models, the expected cost was $9053 for CT, $14,962 for NASHA/Dx, and $33,201 for SNS. The numbers of QALYs were 1.769, 1.929, and 2.004, respectively. The numbers of IFDs were 128.8, 267.6, and 514.8, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per additional IFD gained were $42.60 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $73.76 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $62.55 for SNS vs CT. The incremental costs per QALY gained were $37,036 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $244,509 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $103,066 for SNS vs CT. The budget impact analysis evaluated the financial effect on the health care system of the use of NASHA/Dx and SNS.

13425,Cost-effectiveness of a multifactorial fracture prevention program for elderly people admitted to nursing homes,"BACKGROUND: Fractures are one of the most costly consequences of falls in elderly patients in nursing homes. OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a 'multifactorial fracture prevention program' provided by a multidisciplinary team with 'no prevention' in newly admitted nursing home residents. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov-based simulation model to establish the effectiveness of a multifaceted fall prevention program from the perspective of statutory health insurance (SHI) and long-term care insurance (LCI). The rate of falls was used to estimate the clinical and economic consequences resulting from hip and upper limb fractures. Robustness of the results was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared to no prevention a multifactorial prevention program for nursing home residents resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of 21,353 euro per quality-adjusted life-year. The total costs for SHI/LCI would result in 1.7 euro million per year. Results proved to be robust following deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Multifactorial fracture prevention appears to be cost-effective in preventing fractures in nursing home residents.

13426,Cost-effectiveness of a physiotherapist-led service for orthopaedic outpatients,"OBJECTIVE: Non-surgical treatment can be effective for many musculoskeletal conditions. Improving access to these options may improve the efficiency of hospitals. The Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinic and Multidisciplinary Service offers early comprehensive assessment and coordinated, patient-centred care within a multidisciplinary framework. Our aim was to assess its cost-effectiveness compared with usual orthopaedic care. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the quality-adjusted life years and health care costs from the perspective of health care payers for outpatients with low back, knee or shoulder conditions compared to usual orthopaedic care. Data were obtained from a retrospective chart review, administrative sources, literature and expert opinion. The time frame was five years and all costs were reported in 2011 $AUD. RESULTS: Compared with usual orthopaedic care, the physiotherapist-led service costs an additional $495 per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained. The model remained cost-effective over a range of one-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The physiotherapist-led service is likely to be highly cost-effective.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to estimate life expectancy, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Efficacy data were derived from a phase III clinical trial. Life expectancy and quality of life data were collected from the literature. A modified Delphi method was used to gather expert opinion on resource use for an IFI. Unit costs were captured from hospital and pharmacy pricelists. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to investigate the impact of uncertainty in the model parameters on the cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: The estimated mean direct cost per patient with posaconazole prophylaxis was 46,893 Swedish kronor (SEK) (euro5,387) and SEK50,017 (euro5,746) with standard azoles. Prophylaxis with posaconazole resulted in 0.075 QALYs gained compared with standard azoles. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of SEK500,000/QALY the PSA demonstrated a more than 95 % probability that posaconazole is cost effective versus standard azoles for the prevention of IFI in high-risk neutropenic patients in Sweden. CONCLUSION: Given the assumptions, methods, and data used, posaconazole is expected to be cost effective compared with standard azoles when used as antifungal prophylaxis in AML or MDS patients with chemotherapy-induced prolonged neutropenia in Sweden.",2014-01-16598,24820968,Clin Drug Investig,Johan Lundberg,2014,34 / 7,483-9,Yes,24820968,"Johan Lundberg; Martin Hoglund; Magnus Bjorkholm; Orjan Akerborg; Economic evaluation of posaconazole versus fluconazole or itraconazole in the prevention of invasive fungal infection in high-risk neutropenic patients in Sweden, Clin Drug Investig, ; 34(7):1173-2563; 483-9",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Posaconazole (200 mg 3 times daily) as prophylaxis for prolonged neutropenia vs. fluconazole (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) as prophylaxis for prolonged neutropenia,Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-386773.31,Sweden,2012,-64424.34
13428,A Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis of transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system in high surgical risk patients with significant mitral regurgitation,"OBJECTIVE: In patients with significant mitral regurgitation (MR) at high risk of mortality and morbidity from mitral valve surgery, transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip System is associated with a reduction in MR and improved quality-of-life and functional status compared with baseline. The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MitraClip therapy compared with standard of care in patients with significant MR at high risk for mitral valve surgery from a Canadian payer perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs, life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per life year and QALY gained for patients receiving MitraClip therapy compared with standard of care. Treatment-specific overall survival, risk of clinical events, quality-of-life, and resource utilization were obtained from the Endovascular Valve Edge-to-Edge REpair High Risk Study (EVEREST II HRS). Health utility and unit costs (CAD $2013) were taken from the published literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of alternative assumptions and parameter uncertainty on results. RESULTS: The base case incremental cost per QALY gained was $23,433. RESULTS were most sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding overall survival, time horizon, and risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed MitraClip therapy to have a 92% chance of being cost-effective compared with standard of care at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained. STUDY LIMITATIONS: Key limitations include the small number of patients included in the EVEREST II HRS which informed the analysis, the limited data available to inform clinical events and disease progression in the concurrent comparator group, and the lack of a comparator group from a randomized control trial.

13430,Cost-effectiveness of specialized treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy versus usual care for tinnitus,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary tinnitus treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with care as usual. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial including an economic evaluation from a health-care and societal perspective, using a one-year time horizon. SETTING: Audiologic center. PATIENTS: A referred sample of 626 patients with tinnitus were eligible for participation. Approximately 492 patients were included in the study. Eighty-six (35%) of 247 patients in the usual care group, and 74 (30%) of 245 patients in the specialized care group were lost to follow-up by month 12. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as measured with the Health Utilities Index Mark III and cost in US dollars. RESULTS: Compared with patients receiving usual care, patients who received specialized care gained on average 0.015 QALYs (95% bootstrapped confidence interval [BCI], -0.03 to 0.06). The incremental costs from a societal perspective are $357 (95% BCI,-$1,034 to $1,785). The incremental cost per QALY from a societal perspective amounted to $24,580. The probability that SC is cost-effective from a societal perspective is 58% for a willingness to pay for a QALY of $45,000. CONCLUSION: Specialized multidisciplinary tinnitus treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy is cost-effective as compared with usual care.

13431,The cost-effectiveness of CT-guided sacroiliac joint injections: a measure of QALY gained,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to estimate the total cost and the quality of life years (QALY) gained for computer tomography (CT)-guided sacroiliac joint (SIJ) injections. The cost per QALY gained for the procedure is the primary end-point of this study. METHODS: In our 1-year prospective institutional study, we gathered 30 patients undergoing CT-guided SIJ injections for degenerative changes at the SIJ space. Patient-reported outcomes included both the US population-based EQ-5D (EuroQol) index score and the EQ-visual analog scale (VAS). The EQ-5D is based on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety depression. Utility expenditures were based on hospital charges at our institution. RESULTS: All 30 patients had one pre-injection physician visit followed by 43 initial injections (13 bilateral). Each patient underwent one CT scan, and three patients required additional plain films. In the 1 year following the injections, 26 physician visits were documented. Five patients required repeat CT-guided injections. Total 1-year cost for all 30 patients was $34 874.00. Mean decrease in EQ-VAS was 0.60 (P = 0.187). The mean 1-year gain of 0.58 EQ-5D QALY reached statistical significance (P < 0.001). The cost per QALY gained by CT-guided sacroiliac injections was $2004.29. DISCUSSION: In one of the first cost analyses of CT-guided sacroiliac injections, we found that the procedure improves pain and activities of daily living. The cost per QALY gained by CT-guided sacroiliac injections falls well below the threshold cost of 1 QALY, suggesting that the procedure is strongly cost-effective.",2014-01-16614,24773478,Neurol Res,Mohamad Bydon,2014,36 / 10,915-20,No,24773478,"Mohamad Bydon; Mohamed Macki; Rafael De la Garza-Ramos; Mina Youssef; Ziya L Gokaslan; Sherif Meleka; Ali Bydon; The cost-effectiveness of CT-guided sacroiliac joint injections: a measure of QALY gained, Neurol Res, ; 36(10):1743-1328; 915-20",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Computer tomography- Guided Sacroiliac Joint Injections vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,2004,United States,2012,2259.02
13432,Cost-effectiveness and clinical implications of advanced bearings in total knee arthroplasty: a long-term modeling analysis,"BACKGROUND: Polyethylene (PE) wear is a major contributor to implant loosening following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Advanced bearings are therefore required in TKA to reduce or eliminate wear-related loosening. A recently introduced bearing that combines oxidized zirconium with highly cross-linked PE has been shown to drastically reduce wear in in vitro settings, due to its improved tribological characteristics in both tibial and femoral components. However, there are no data on its cost-effectiveness. DATA AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of this low-wear bearing from a German societal perspective. The model population was derived from a registry of 75,000 patients requiring TKA. The model allocated patients to receive either a low-wear or standard articulation, and followed them until death. Revisions and re-revision were included. Input values were derived from registry databases or from published reports in the literature. Threshold analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to estimate model robustness. RESULTS: The low-wear articulation prevented 24 (2.4 percent) revisions and 8 (0.8 percent) re-revisions. The total incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the low-wear articulation was EUR 16,474 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). For patients aged less than 55 years, an ICER of EUR 653 per QALY was observed. For patients aged over 75 years, this value was EUR 83,300. Threshold and probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that these findings were reasonably robust. CONCLUSION: Low-wear articulations may be considered cost-effective, although the cost effectiveness is age-dependent, with the cost per QALY being significantly lower for younger people than for older people.",2014-01-16616,24774225,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Peter Fennema,2014,30 / 2,218-25,No,24774225,"Peter Fennema; Thomas J Heyse; Carin A Uyl-de Groot; Cost-effectiveness and clinical implications of advanced bearings in total knee arthroplasty: a long-term modeling analysis, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, ; 30(2):0266-4623; 218-25",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Advanced bearing combining oxidized zirconium with highly cross-linked polyethylene (PE) vs. Standard/Usual Care,undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA),Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,16475,Euro,2011,26378.55
13433,The cost-utility of aflibercept for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration compared to bevacizumab and ranibizumab and the influence of model parameters,"BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a blinding disease placing considerable burden on society due to blindness-associated costs. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs) are effective in reducing the incidence of blindness, but at potentially high costs, depending on the cost of the drug used. Aflibercept has been introduced as an anti-VEGF equally effective to ranibizumab, but less costly. For this new drug, new cost-effectiveness analyses are needed, and AMD models used today give biased results. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of aflibercept compared to bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and no treatment and studied the influence of commonly used model parameters. METHODS: A patient-level, visual acuity-based, 2-eye model was developed. Data on effectiveness were derived from randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab. Utility and resource utilization were assessed in interviews with AMD patients. Costs were based on standard health care cost prices. Time horizons were two and five years. A societal perspective was employed. RESULTS: Over five years, costs associated with aflibercept treatment were <euro>36,030, with 2.15 QALYs. Costs associated with the bevacizumab regimens, ABC study as-needed (PRN); CATT study PRN; and CATT study 1x/month, were <euro>19,367; <euro>26,746; and <euro>30,520, with 2.16; 2.17; and 2.15 QALYs, respectively. Costs associated with ranibizumab PRN and 1x/month were <euro>45,491 and <euro>74,837 with 2.16 and 2.15 QALYs, respectively. 'No treatment' was associated with <euro>9530 and 1.96 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios versus 'no treatment' were: aflibercept-<euro>140,274; bevacizumab-<euro>51,062 (ABC PRN), <euro>83,256 (CATT PRN) and <euro>110,361 (1x/month); ranibizumab-<euro>181,667 (PRN) and <euro>349,773 (1x/month). Results were highly dependent on whether only one or both eyes were included, length of time horizon, and whether the costs of blindness and low-vision were included in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Aflibercept is a cost-effective treatment for AMD over ranibizumab. However, aflibercept is not a cost-effective treatment when compared to bevacizumab.

We investigated the cost-effectiveness of aflibercept compared to bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and no treatment and studied the influence of commonly used model parameters. METHODS: A patient-level, visual acuity-based, 2-eye model was developed. Data on effectiveness were derived from randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab. Utility and resource utilization were assessed in interviews with AMD patients. Costs were based on standard health care cost prices. Time horizons were two and five years. A societal perspective was employed. RESULTS: Over five years, costs associated with aflibercept treatment were <euro>36,030, with 2.15 QALYs. Costs associated with the bevacizumab regimens, ABC study as-needed (PRN); CATT study PRN; and CATT study 1x/month, were <euro>19,367; <euro>26,746; and <euro>30,520, with 2.16; 2.17; and 2.15 QALYs, respectively. Costs associated with ranibizumab PRN and 1x/month were <euro>45,491 and <euro>74,837 with 2.16 and 2.15 QALYs, respectively. 'No treatment' was associated with <euro>9530 and 1.96 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios versus 'no treatment' were: aflibercept-<euro>140,274; bevacizumab-<euro>51,062 (ABC PRN), <euro>83,256 (CATT PRN) and <euro>110,361 (1x/month); ranibizumab-<euro>181,667 (PRN) and <euro>349,773 (1x/month). Results were highly dependent on whether only one or both eyes were included, length of time horizon, and whether the costs of blindness and low-vision were included in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Aflibercept is a cost-effective treatment for AMD over ranibizumab. However, aflibercept is not a cost-effective treatment when compared to bevacizumab. Application of inappropriate model assumptions leads to a biased cost-saving estimate of the cost-effectiveness of aflibercept. Therefore, cost-effectiveness analyses should be conducted with appropriate models.",2014-01-16617,24777708,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Mari Elshout,2014,252 / 12,1911-20,No,24777708,"Mari Elshout; Margriet I van der Reis; Carroll A B Webers; Jan S A G Schouten; The cost-utility of aflibercept for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration compared to bevacizumab and ranibizumab and the influence of model parameters, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol, ; 252(12):1435-702X; 1911-20",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ranibizumab vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 2 years",4.00,1.50,181667,Euro,2012,263327.79
13436,Incremental cost-effectiveness of adult spinal deformity surgery: observed quality-adjusted life years with surgery compared with predicted quality-adjusted life years without surgery,"OBJECT: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis is critical to the efficient allocation of health care resources; however, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for adult spinal deformity (ASD) has eluded the literature, due in part to inherent empirical difficulties when comparing surgical and nonsurgical patients. Using observed preoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients who later underwent surgery, this study builds a statistical model to predict hypothetical quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) without surgical treatment. The analysis compares predicted QALYs to observed postoperative QALYs and forms the resulting ICER. METHODS: This was a single-center (Baylor Scoliosis Center) retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing primary surgery for ASD. Total costs (expressed in 2010 dollars) incurred by the hospital for each episode of surgical care were collected from administrative data and QALYs were calculated from the 6-dimensional Short-Form Health Survey, each discounted at 3.5% per year. Regression analysis was used to predict hypothetical QALYs without surgery based on preoperative longitudinal data for 124 crossover surgical patients with similar diagnoses, baseline HRQOL, age, and sex compared with the surgical cohort. Results were projected through 10-year follow-up, and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) was estimated using nonparametric bootstrap methods. RESULTS: Three-year follow-up was available for 120 (66%) of 181 eligible patients, who were predominantly female (89%) with average age of 50. With discounting, total costs averaged $125,407, including readmissions, with average QALYs of 1.93 at 3-year follow-up. Average QALYs without surgery were predicted to be 1.6 after 3 years. At 3- and 5-year follow-up, the ICER was $375,000 and $198,000, respectively. Projecting through 10-year follow-up, the ICER was $80,000. The 10-year CEAC revealed a 40% probability that the ICER was $80,000 or less, a 90% probability that the ICER was $90,000 or less, and a 100% probability that the ICER was less than $100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the WHO's suggested upper threshold for cost-effectiveness (3 times per capita GDP, or $140,000 in 2010 dollars), the analysis reveals that surgical treatment for ASD is cost-effective after a 10-year period based on predicted deterioration in HRQOL without surgery. The ICER well exceeds the WHO threshold at earlier follow-up intervals, highlighting the importance of the durability of surgical treatment in assessing the value of surgical intervention. Due to the study's methodology, the results are dependent on the predicted deterioration in HRQOL without surgery. As such, the results may not extend to patients whose HRQOL would remain steady without surgery. Future research should therefore pursue a direct comparison of QALYs for surgical and nonsurgical patients to better understand the cost-effectiveness of surgery for the average ASD patient.",2014-01-16633,24785485,Neurosurg Focus,Ian McCarthy,2014,36 / 5,E3,No,24785485,"Ian McCarthy; Michael O'Brien; Christopher Ames; Chessie Robinson; Thomas Errico; David W Jr Polly; Richard Hostin; International Spine Study Group; Incremental cost-effectiveness of adult spinal deformity surgery: observed quality-adjusted life years with surgery compared with predicted quality-adjusted life years without surgery, Neurosurg Focus, ; 36(5):1092-0684; E3",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgery vs. None,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,80000,United States,2010,94952.12
13437,Cost-effectiveness of testing hepatitis B-positive pregnant women for hepatitis B e antigen or viral load,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of testing pregnant women with hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive) for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and administering maternal antiviral prophylaxis if indicated, to decrease breakthrough perinatal HBV transmission from the U.S. health care perspective. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed for a 2010 birth cohort of 4 million neonates to estimate the cost-effectiveness of two strategies: testing HBsAg-positive pregnant women for 1) HBeAg or 2) HBV load. Maternal antiviral prophylaxis is given from 28 weeks of gestation through 4 weeks postpartum when HBeAg is positive or HBV load is high (10 copies/mL or greater). These strategies were compared with the current recommendation. All neonates born to HBsAg-positive women received recommended active-passive immunoprophylaxis. Effects were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and all costs were in 2010 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: The HBeAg testing strategy saved $3.3 million and 3,080 QALYs and prevented 486 chronic HBV infections compared with the current recommendation. The HBV load testing strategy cost $3 million more than current recommendation, saved 2,080 QALYs, and prevented 324 chronic infections with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,583 per QALY saved compared with the current recommendations.

13441,A comparative effectiveness analysis of visual field outcomes after projected glaucoma screening using SD-OCT in African American communities,"PURPOSE: To assess the impact on visual function of community glaucoma screening in an African American population using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS: Using a Monte Carlo microsimulation model with a 10-year time horizon, we analyzed the efficacy of SD-OCT screening on visual field outcomes in a population of African Americans who are not otherwise seeking office-based care. Outcomes included classification of visual field severity, quality-adjusted life years, and direct health care costs. RESULTS: Assuming a 60% follow-up rate, screening decreased the prevalence of undiagnosed glaucoma from 75% to 38%, and decreased the prevalence of severe visual field loss in patients with glaucoma from 29.1% to 23.9%. Conversely, screening increased the prevalence of mild visual field loss in patients with glaucoma from 9.2% to 18.7%. From initial screening through confirmatory eye examination, the screening program (""screen only"") cost $98 per screened individual, and $2561 per new diagnosis of glaucoma. When considering the costs of initial screening though the resultant treatment, the screening program (""screen and treat"") had an average annual cost of $79 and $2138, respectively, over a 10-year time period. The cost of one quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by screening, including management and treatment, in comparison with opportunistic case finding, ranged from $46,416 to $67,813. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that community SD-OCT screening in an African American population will minimize glaucoma-related visual morbidity. Ideally, strategies to maximize treatment efficacy through improved medication adherence and improved compliance with follow-up should be identified and implemented before instituting a screening program.",2014-01-16638,24787570,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Dana M Blumberg,2014,55 / 6,3491-500,No,24787570,"Dana M Blumberg; Reena Vaswani; Eva Nong; Lama Al-Aswad; George A Cioffi; A comparative effectiveness analysis of visual field outcomes after projected glaucoma screening using SD-OCT in African American communities, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, ; 55(6):0146-0404; 3491-500",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Community-based screening using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Doctor's office-based screening using (SD-OCT),Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,3.00,Not Stated,46416,United States,2013,51567.33
13442,Cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors in Barrett's esophagus,"BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in patients with Barrett's esophagus. PPIs are prescribed for virtually all patients with Barrett's esophagus, irrespective of the presence of reflux symptoms, and represent a de facto chemopreventive agent in this population. However, long-term PPI use has been associated with several adverse effects, and the cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention with PPIs has not been evaluated. AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of PPIs for the prevention of EAC in Barrett's esophagus without reflux. METHODS: We designed a state-transition Markov microsimulation model of a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old white men with Barrett's esophagus. We modeled chemoprevention with PPIs or no chemoprevention, with endoscopic surveillance for all treatment arms. Outcome measures were life-years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incident EAC cases and deaths, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Assuming 50% reduction in EAC, chemoprevention with PPIs was a cost-effective strategy compared to no chemoprevention. In our model, administration of PPIs cost $23,000 per patient and resulted in a gain of 0.32 QALYs for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $12,000/QALY. In sensitivity analyses, PPIs would be cost-effective at $50,000/QALY if they reduce EAC risk by at least 19%. CONCLUSIONS: Chemoprevention with PPIs in patients with Barrett's esophagus without reflux is cost-effective if PPIs reduce EAC by a minimum of 19%. The identification of subgroups of Barrett's esophagus patients at increased risk for progression would lead to more cost-effective strategies for the prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma.",2014-01-16648,24795040,Dig Dis Sci,Reem Z Sharaiha,2014,59 / 6,1222-30,No,24795040,"Reem Z Sharaiha; Daniel E Freedberg; Julian A Abrams; Y Claire Wang; Cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors in Barrett's esophagus, Dig Dis Sci, ; 59(6):0163-2116; 1222-30",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Chemoprevention with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) - generic omeprazole (20mg daily) vs. Standard/Usual Care- no chemoprevention,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,Male,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,11760,United States,2011,13530.86
13443,Prohibiting consent: what are the costs of denying permanent contraception concurrent with abortion care?,"OBJECTIVE: Oregon and federal laws prohibit giving informed consent for permanent contraception when presenting for an abortion. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the number of unintended pregnancies associated with this barrier to obtaining concurrent tubal occlusion and abortion, compared with the current policy, which limits women to obtaining interval tubal occlusion after abortion. The secondary objectives were to compare the financial costs, quality-adjusted life years, and the cost-effectiveness of these policies. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a decision-analytic model examining a theoretical population of women who requested tubal occlusion at time of abortion. Model inputs came from the literature. We examined the primary and secondary outcomes stratified by maternal age (>30 and <30 years). A Markov model incorporated the possibility of multiple pregnancies. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all variables and a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted. RESULTS: For every 1000 women age <30 years in Oregon who did not receive requested tubal occlusion at the time of abortion, over 5 years there would be 1274 additional unintended pregnancies and an additional $4,152,373 in direct medical costs. Allowing women to receive tubal occlusion at time of abortion was the dominant strategy.

The trade-off is delayed and potentially devastating treatment-related neurotoxicity (NT). METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model compared CMT with chemotherapy alone in age-stratified patients with PCNSL. Baseline probabilities were derived from a systematic literature review. Direct and lost productivity costs were collected from a Canadian perspective and presented in Can$ in 2011. Outcomes were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life expectancy was 1.55 QALYs for CMT and 1.53 QALYs for chemotherapy alone. In younger patients (aged <60 years), CMT yielded 2.44 QALYs, compared with 1.89 QALYs for chemotherapy alone, yielding an expected benefit with CMT of 0.55 QALYs or 6.6 quality-adjusted months. The CMT strategy dominated in younger patients, as it was Can$11 951 less expensive than chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy-alone strategy dominated in older patients, as it was Can$11 244 less expensive than CMT, and there was no difference in QALYs between the strategies.

13447,Combined modality therapy versus chemotherapy alone as an induction regimen for primary central nervous system lymphoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: In immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), combined modality therapy (CMT) using high-dose methotrexate and radiotherapy (WBRT) has improved response rates compared with chemotherapy alone. The trade-off is delayed and potentially devastating treatment-related neurotoxicity (NT). METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model compared CMT with chemotherapy alone in age-stratified patients with PCNSL. Baseline probabilities were derived from a systematic literature review. Direct and lost productivity costs were collected from a Canadian perspective and presented in Can$ in 2011. Outcomes were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life expectancy was 1.55 QALYs for CMT and 1.53 QALYs for chemotherapy alone. In younger patients (aged <60 years), CMT yielded 2.44 QALYs, compared with 1.89 QALYs for chemotherapy alone, yielding an expected benefit with CMT of 0.55 QALYs or 6.6 quality-adjusted months. The CMT strategy dominated in younger patients, as it was Can$11 951 less expensive than chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy-alone strategy dominated in older patients, as it was Can$11 244 less expensive than CMT, and there was no difference in QALYs between the strategies. The model was robust in sensitivity analyses of key variables tested through the plausible ranges obtained from costing sources and published literature.

13448,Cost-effectiveness of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for mild acute gallstone pancreatitis,"BACKGROUND: A recent Cochrane review suggested that laparoscopic cholecystectomy carried out early following mild gallstone pancreatitis was safe. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 3 days of admission, during the same admission but after more than 3 days, or electively in a subsequent admission. METHODS: A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed estimating mean costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient in the UK National Health Service with a 1-year time horizon. A decision tree model was constructed and populated with probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources for mild gallstone pancreatitis, including one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The costs of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 3 days of admission, beyond 3 days but in the same admission, and electively in a subsequent admission were euro 2748, euro 3543 and euro 3752 respectively; the QALYs were 0.888, 0.888 and 0.884 respectively. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy had a 91 per cent probability of being cost-effective at the maximum willingness to pay for a QALY commonly used in the UK. It is acknowledged that many hospitals do not have access to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, especially at weekends, and that implementing a 3-day target is unrealistic without allocating new resources that could erode the cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for mild gallstone pancreatitis within 3 days of admission is cost-effective, but may not be feasible without significant resource allocation.

13454,Cost effectiveness of a gene expression score and myocardial perfusion imaging for diagnosis of coronary artery disease,"BACKGROUND: Over 3 million patients annually present with symptoms suggestive of obstructive coronary artery disease (oCAD) in the United States (US), but a cardiac etiology is found in as few as 10% of cases. Usual care may include advanced cardiac testing with myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), with attendant radiation risks and increased costs of care. We estimated the cost effectiveness of CAD diagnostic strategies including ""no test,"" a gene expression score (GES) test, MPI, and sequential strategies combining GES and MPI. METHODS: We developed a Markov-based decision analysis model to simulate outcomes and costs in patients presenting to clinicians with symptoms suggestive of oCAD in the US. We estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each strategy. RESULTS: In our base case, the 2-threshold GES strategy is the most cost-effective strategy at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained, with an ICER of approximately $72,000 per QALY gained relative to no testing. Myocardial perfusion imaging alone and the 1-threshold strategy are weakly dominated. In sensitivity analysis, ICERs fall as the probability of oCAD increases from the base case value of 15%. The ranking of ICERs among strategies is sensitive to test costs, including the time cost for testing. The analysis reveals ways to improve on prespecified GES thresholds.

Extending Standard TAM by 5 additional years (Extended TAM) can improve survival and BC recurrences. In postmenopausal women, the use of extended aromatase inhibitors (Extended AI) after Standard TAM is an alternative to Extended TAM. This study examines the cost-effectiveness (CE) of extending Standard TAM with Extended TAM vs. Extended AI in postmenopausal HR+ early-stage BC patients. Three treatments were assessed: (1) Standard TAM; (2) Extended TAM; (3) Extended AI through a Markov model using a Canadian health system perspective, lifetime time-horizon, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and a 5 % discount rate for future costs and utilities. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated, and the impact of parameter uncertainty was assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analyses (SA) using conventional CE thresholds. The estimated total per person costs in 2012 Canadian dollars [$1.00 CAD = $0.99 US 2012] were the least for Extended TAM ($8,623 CAD) and most for Extended AI ($9,432 CAD). Extended AI was the most effective regimen, while Standard TAM was the least. Extended AI was cost-effective at conventional thresholds vs. Extended TAM (ICER: $3,402 CAD/QALY) which was robust to the SA.

METHODS: CARDERA enrolled 467 patients with active RA of <24-months duration. All patients received MTX; half received step-down prednisolone and half ciclosporin in a placebo-controlled factorial design. Differences in mean costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 24-months follow-up were estimated using patient-level data from a UK health service perspective and 2011-12 costs. RESULTS: Two-year costs for each treatment strategy showed primary care costs were negligible across all groups. Drug costs were lowest with MTX/ciclosporin and triple therapy. Hospital costs were lowest with MTX/prednisolone and triple therapy. Triple therapy was least costly and most effective; it dominated all other strategies. At positive values for a QALY in the typical UK range ( pound20 000-30 000) the probability that triple therapy was the most cost-effective strategy was 0.9.

METHODS: CARDERA enrolled 467 patients with active RA of <24-months duration. All patients received MTX; half received step-down prednisolone and half ciclosporin in a placebo-controlled factorial design. Differences in mean costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 24-months follow-up were estimated using patient-level data from a UK health service perspective and 2011-12 costs. RESULTS: Two-year costs for each treatment strategy showed primary care costs were negligible across all groups. Drug costs were lowest with MTX/ciclosporin and triple therapy. Hospital costs were lowest with MTX/prednisolone and triple therapy. Triple therapy was least costly and most effective; it dominated all other strategies. At positive values for a QALY in the typical UK range ( pound20 000-30 000) the probability that triple therapy was the most cost-effective strategy was 0.9. Results were robust to methods used to impute missing data.

13473,Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccines for adults in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: In 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) revised recommendations for adult pneumococcal vaccination to include a sequential regimen of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for certain high-risk adults with immunocompromising conditions. This study, from a payer perspective, examined: (1) the cost-effectiveness of the new 2012 ACIP vaccine policy recommendation relative to the 1997 ACIP recommendation; (2) the cost-effectiveness of potential future pneumococcal vaccination policies; and (3) key assumptions that influence study results. METHODS: A static cohort model that incorporated costs, health outcomes, and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses associated with invasive pneumococcal disease and non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP) was developed to evaluate seven pneumococcal vaccination strategies for a 50-year-old adult cohort over a 50-year period using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: For objective 1, the 2012 ACIP recommendation is the more economically efficient strategy (ICER was $25,841 per QALY gained vs. no vaccination). For objective 2, the most efficient vaccination policy would be to maintain the 2012 recommendation for PPSV23 for healthy and immunocompetent adults with comorbidities, and to modify the recommendation for adults with immunocompromising conditions by replacing PPSV23 with a sequential regimen of PCV13 and PPSV23 at age 65 (ICER was $23,416 per QALY gained vs. no vaccination). For objective 3, cost-effectiveness ratios for alternative pneumococcal vaccine policies were highly influenced by assumptions used for vaccine effectiveness against NBPP and accounting for the herd protection effects of pediatric PCV13 vaccination on adult pneumococcal disease. CONCLUSION: Modifying the 2012 recommendation to include an additional dose of PCV13 at age 65, followed by PPSV23, for adults with immunocompromising conditions appears to be a cost-effective vaccine policy.

13476,The cost-effectiveness of solifenacin vs. trospium in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder in the German National Health Service,"OBJECTIVE: To carry out a cost-utility analysis comparing initial treatment of patients with overactive bladder (OAB) with solifenacin 5 mg/day versus either trospium 20 mg twice a day or trospium 60 mg/day from the perspective of the German National Health Service. METHODS: A decision analytic model with a 3 month cycle was developed to follow a cohort of OAB patients treated with either solifenacin or trospium during a 1 year period. Costs and utilities were accumulated as patients transitioned through the four cycles in the model. Some of the solifenacin patients were titrated from 5 mg to 10 mg/day at 3 months. Utility values were obtained from the published literature and pad use was based on a US resource utilization study. Adherence rates for individual treatments were derived from a United Kingdom general practitioner database review. The change in the mean number of urgency urinary incontinence episodes/day from after 12 weeks was the main outcome measure. Baseline effectiveness values for solifenacin and trospium were calculated using the Poisson distribution. Patients who failed second-line therapy were referred to a specialist visit. Results were expressed in terms of incremental cost-utility ratios. RESULTS: Total annual costs for solifenacin, trospium 20 mg and trospium 60 mg were euro970.01, euro860.05 and euro875.05 respectively. Drug use represented 43%, 28% and 29% of total costs and pad use varied between 45% and 57%. Differences between cumulative utilities were small but favored solifenacin (0.6857 vs. 0.6802 to 0.6800). The baseline incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from euro16,657 to euro19,893 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: The difference in cumulative utility favoring solifenacin was small (0.0055-0.0057 QALYs). A small absolute change in the cumulative utilities can have a marked impact on the overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and care should be taken when interpreting the results. CONCLUSION: Solifenacin would appear to be cost-effective with an ICER of no more than euro20,000/QALY.

13478,Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of bipolar I disorder patients with mixed episodes,"OBJECTIVE: Around one-third of patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) experience mixed episodes, characterized by both mania and depression, which tend to be more difficult and costly to treat. Atypical antipsychotics are recommended for the treatment of mixed episodes, although evidence of their efficacy, tolerability, and cost in these patients is limited. This study evaluates, from a UK National Health Service perspective, the cost-effectiveness of asenapine vs olanzapine in BD-I patients with mixed episodes. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was assessed using a Markov model. Efficacy was informed by a post-hoc analysis of two short-term clinical trials, with response measured as a composite Young Mania Rating Score and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale end-point. Probabilities of discontinuation and relapse to manic, mixed, and depressive episodes were sourced from published meta-analyses. Direct costs (2012-2013 values) included drug acquisition, monitoring, and resource use related to bipolar disorder as well as selected adverse events. Benefits were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: For treating mixed episodes, asenapine generated 0.0187 more QALYs for an additional cost of pound24 compared to olanzapine over a 5-year period, corresponding to a pound1302 incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The higher acquisition cost of asenapine was roughly offset by the healthcare savings conferred through its greater efficacy in treating these patients. The model shows that benefits were driven by earlier response to asenapine during acute treatment and were maintained during longer-term follow-up. RESULTS were sensitive to changes in key parameters including short and longer-term efficacy, unit cost, and utilities, but conclusions remained relatively robust. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS suggest that asenapine is a cost-effective alternative to olanzapine in mixed episode BD-I patients, and may have specific advantages in this population, potentially leading to healthcare sector savings and improved outcomes. Limitations of the analysis stem from gaps in clinical and economic evidence for these patients and should be addressed by future clinical trials.",2014-01-16705,24720805,J Med Econ,Laura Sawyer,2014,17 / 7,508-19,Yes,24720805,"Laura Sawyer; Jean-Michel Azorin; Stacey Chang; Claudia Rinciog; Alice Guiraud-Diawara; Caroline Marre; Karina Hansen; Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of bipolar I disorder patients with mixed episodes, J Med Econ, ; 17(7):1369-6998; 508-19",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Asenapine (ASE) vs. olanzapine (OLA),"Mixed episodes, characterized by the presence of both mania and depression",Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,1302,United Kingdom,2013,2262.57
13479,A comparison of open and endovascular revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischemia in a clinical decision model,"OBJECTIVE: Open revascularization (OR) has been the treatment of choice for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) for many years, but endovascular revascularization (EV) has been increasingly used with good short-term results. In this study, we evaluated the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EV and OR in patients with CMI refractory to conservative management. METHODS: A Markov-state transition model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2012 (TreeAge Inc, Williamstown, Mass) to simulate a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 65-year-old female patients with CMI requiring treatment with either OR or EV. Data for the model, including perioperative and long-term overall mortality risks, disease-specific mortality risks, complications, and reintervention and patency rates, were retrieved from original studies and systematic reviews about CMI. Costs were analyzed with the 2013 Medicare database. Outcomes evaluated were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs from the health care perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed and different clinical scenarios evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess robustness of the model. RESULTS: For a reference-case 65-year-old female patient with CMI and an average risk for operation, EV is preferred with 10.03 QALYs (95% credibility interval [CI], 9.76-10.29) vs 9.59 after OR (95% CI, 9.29-9.87). The difference is comparable to 5 months in perfect health: 0.44 QALY (95% CI, 0.13-0.76). For 65-year-old men, this was 8.71 QALYs (95% CI, 8.48-8.94) for EV vs 8.42 (95% CI, 8.14-8.63) for OR. Sensitivity analysis showed that for younger patients, EV results in a higher increase in QALYs compared with older patients. Total expected reinterventions per patient are 1.70 for EV vs 0.30 for OR. Total expected health care costs for the reference-case patient were $39,942 (95% CI, $28,509-$53,380) for OR and $38.217 (95% CI, $29,329-$48,309) for EV. For men, this was $39,375 (95% CI, $28,092-$52,853) for OR and $35,903 (95% CI, $27,685-$45,597) for EV. For patients younger than 60 years, EV is a more expensive treatment strategy compared with OR, but with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for EV of less than $60,000/QALY. For patients 60 years and older, EV dominated OR as preferential treatment because effectiveness was higher than for OR and costs were lower. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this decision analysis model suggest that EV is favored over OR for patients with CMI in all age groups. Although EV is associated with more expected reinterventions, EV appears to be cost-effective for all age groups.",2014-01-16707,24721175,J Vasc Surg,Wouter Hogendoorn,2014,60 / 3,715-25.e2,No,24721175,"Wouter Hogendoorn; M G Myriam Hunink; Felix J V Schlosser; Frans L Moll; Bart E Muhs; Bauer E Sumpio; A comparison of open and endovascular revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischemia in a clinical decision model, J Vasc Surg, ; 60(3):0741-5214; 715-25.e2",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular revascularization (EV) vs. Open revascularization (OR),Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-3920.45,United States,2013,-4355.55
13480,The cost-utility of open prostatectomy compared with active surveillance in early localised prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: There is an on-going debate about whether to perform surgery on early stage localised prostate cancer and risk the common long term side effects such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Alternatively these patients could be closely monitored and treated only in case of disease progression (active surveillance). The aim of this paper is to develop a decision-analytic model comparing the cost-utility of active surveillance (AS) and radical prostatectomy (PE) for a cohort of 65 year old men with newly diagnosed low risk prostate cancer. METHODS: A Markov model comparing PE and AS over a lifetime horizon was programmed in TreeAge from a German societal perspective. Comparative disease specific mortality was obtained from the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group trial. Direct costs were identified via national treatment guidelines and expert interviews covering in-patient, out-patient, medication, aids and remedies as well as out of pocket payments. Utility values were used as factor weights for age specific quality of life values of the German population. Uncertainty was assessed deterministically and probabilistically. RESULTS: With quality adjustment, AS was the dominant strategy compared with initial treatment. In the base case, it was associated with an additional 0.04 quality adjusted life years (7.60 QALYs vs. 7.56 QALYs) and a cost reduction of euro6,883 per patient (2011 prices). Considering only life-years gained, PE was more effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro96,420/life year gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of developing metastases under AS and utility weights under AS are a major sources of uncertainty. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that AS was more likely to be cost-effective even under very high willingness to pay thresholds. CONCLUSION: AS is likely to be a cost-saving treatment strategy for some patients with early stage localised prostate cancer. However, cost-effectiveness is dependent on patients' valuation of health states. Better predictability of tumour progression and modified reimbursement practice would support widespread use of AS in the context of the German health care system.

13481,Cost-effectiveness analysis of intensity modulated radiation therapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for anal cancer,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for anal cancer and determine disease, patient, and treatment parameters that influence the result. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov decision model was designed with the various disease states for the base case of a 65-year-old patient with anal cancer treated with either IMRT or 3D-CRT and concurrent chemotherapy. Health states accounting for rates of local failure, colostomy failure, treatment breaks, patient prognosis, acute and late toxicities, and the utility of toxicities were informed by existing literature and analyzed with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base case, mean costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy in years (QALY) for IMRT and 3D-CRT were $32,291 (4.81) and $28,444 (4.78), respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $128,233/QALY for IMRT compared with 3D-CRT. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that IMRT was cost-effective in 22%, 47%, and 65% of iterations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY, respectively.

13482,Cost-effectiveness of different strategies to manage patients with sciatica,"The aim of this paper is to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for managing patients with sciatica. A deterministic model structure was constructed based on information from the findings from a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, published sources of unit costs, and expert opinion. The assumption was that patients presenting with sciatica would be managed through one of 3 pathways (primary care, stepped approach, immediate referral to surgery). Results were expressed as incremental cost per patient with symptoms successfully resolved. Analysis also included incremental cost per utility gained over a 12-month period. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty. The model demonstrated that none of the strategies resulted in 100% success. For initial treatments, the most successful regime in the first pathway was nonopioids, with a probability of success of 0.613. In the second pathway, the most successful strategy was nonopioids, followed by biological agents, followed by epidural/nerve block and disk surgery, with a probability of success of 0.996. Pathway 3 (immediate surgery) was not cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified that the use of the highest cost estimates results in a similar overall picture.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the most cost-effective strategy for dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention for ACS. DESIGN: Decision-analytic model. DATA SOURCES: Published literature, Medicare claims, and life tables. TARGET POPULATION: Patients having percutaneous coronary intervention for ACS. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Five strategies were examined: generic clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and genotyping for polymorphisms of CYP2C19 with carriers of loss-of-function alleles receiving either ticagrelor (genotyping with ticagrelor) or prasugrel (genotyping with prasugrel) and noncarriers receiving clopidogrel.

13490,Cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) compared to standard medical care without ERT in the Dutch cohort of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD I). DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a life-time state-transition model of the disease's natural course. Transition probabilities, effectiveness data and costs were derived from retrospective data and prospective follow-up of the Dutch study cohort. SETTING: The tertiary referral center for Gaucher disease in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The Dutch cohort of patients with GD I. INTERVENTION: ERT versus standard medical care without ERT in symptomatic patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Years free of end organ damage (YFEOD) (splenectomy, bone complication, malignancy, multiple complications), quality adjusted life years (QALY), and costs. RESULTS: Over an 85 year lifetime, an untreated GD I patient will generate 48.9 YFEOD and 55.86 QALYs. Starting ERT in a symptomatic patient increases the YFEOD by 12.8 years, while the number of QALYs gained increases by 6.27. The average yearly ERT medication costs range between euro 124,000 and euro 258,000 per patient. The lifetime costs of ERT starting in the symptomatic stage are euro 5,716,473 against euro 171,780 without ERT, a difference of euro 5,544,693. Consequently, the extra costs per additional YFEOD or per additional QALY are euro 434,416 and euro 884,994 respectively. After discounting effects by 1.5% and costs by 4% and under a reasonable scenario of ERT unit cost reduction by 25%, these incremental cost-effectiveness ratios could decrease to euro 149,857 and euro 324,812 respectively. DISCUSSION: ERT is a highly potential drug for GD I with substantial health gains. The conservatively estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are substantially lower than for Pompe and Fabry disease. We suggest that the high effectiveness has contributed importantly to acceptance of reimbursement of ERT for GD I. The present study may further support discussions on acceptable price limits for ultra-orphan products.",2014-01-16723,24731506,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Laura van Dussen,2014,9 /,51,No,24731506,"Laura van Dussen; Marieke Biegstraaten; Carla E M Hollak; Marcel G W Dijkgraaf; Cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease, Orphanet J Rare Dis, ; 9():1750-1172; 51",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,85 Years,0 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,1.00,4.00,423540,Euro,2009,712027.3
13491,The cost-effectiveness of the Argus II retinal prosthesis in Retinitis Pigmentosa patients,"BACKGROUND: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary genetic disease causing bilateral retinal degeneration. RP is a leading cause of blindness resulting in incurable visual impairment and drastic reduction in the Quality of life of the patients. Second Sight Medical Products Inc. developed Argus II, a retinal prosthesis system for treating RP. Argus II is the world's first ever-commercial implant intended to restore some vision in the blind patients. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Argus(R) II Retinal Prosthesis System (Argus II) in Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patients. METHOD: A multi -state transition Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of Argus II versus usual care in RP from the perspective of healthcare payer. A hypothetical cohort of 1000 RP patients aged 46 years followed up over a (lifetime) 25-year time horizon. Health outcomes were expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct healthcare costs expressed in 2012 euro. Results are reported as incremental cost per ratios (ICERs) with outcomes and costs discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. RESULTS: The ICER for Argus II was euro14,603/QALY. Taking into account the uncertainty in model inputs the ICER was euro14,482/QALY in the probabilistic analysis. In the scenarios of an assumption of no reduction on cost across model visual acuity states or a model time horizon as short as 10 years the ICER increased to euro31,890/QALY and euro49,769/QALY respectively. CONCLUSION: This economic evaluation shows that Argus II is a cost-effective intervention compared to usual care of the RP patients.

There have also been no economic evaluation studies of CHB drug treatments conducted in Thailand yet. In order to fill this gap in policy research, the objective of this study was to compare the cost-utility of each drug therapy (Figure 1) with palliative care in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using an economic evaluation model was performed to compare each drug treatment for HBeAg-positive CHB patients. A Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes during a lifetime horizon based on a societal perspective. Direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs were included, and health outcomes were denoted in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The results were presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai baht (THB) per LY or QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were applied to investigate the effects of model parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The ICER values of providing generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir when drug resistance occurred, generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir based on the road map guideline, and tenofovir monotherapy were -14,000 (USD -467), -8,000 (USD -267) , and -5,000 (USD -167) THB per QALY gained, respectively. However, when taking into account all parameter uncertainties in the model, providing generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir when drug resistance occurred (78% and 75%) and tenofovir monotherapy (18% and 24%) would yield higher probabilities of being cost-effective at the societal willingness to pay thresholds of 100,000 (USD 3,333) and 300,000 (USD 10,000) THB per QALY gained in Thailand, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the policy recommendations from this study, the Thai government decided to include tenofovir into the NLED in addition to generic lamivudine which is already on the list.

In order to fill this gap in policy research, the objective of this study was to compare the cost-utility of each drug therapy (Figure 1) with palliative care in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using an economic evaluation model was performed to compare each drug treatment for HBeAg-positive CHB patients. A Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes during a lifetime horizon based on a societal perspective. Direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs were included, and health outcomes were denoted in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The results were presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai baht (THB) per LY or QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were applied to investigate the effects of model parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The ICER values of providing generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir when drug resistance occurred, generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir based on the road map guideline, and tenofovir monotherapy were -14,000 (USD -467), -8,000 (USD -267) , and -5,000 (USD -167) THB per QALY gained, respectively. However, when taking into account all parameter uncertainties in the model, providing generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir when drug resistance occurred (78% and 75%) and tenofovir monotherapy (18% and 24%) would yield higher probabilities of being cost-effective at the societal willingness to pay thresholds of 100,000 (USD 3,333) and 300,000 (USD 10,000) THB per QALY gained in Thailand, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the policy recommendations from this study, the Thai government decided to include tenofovir into the NLED in addition to generic lamivudine which is already on the list. Moreover, the results have shown that the preferred treatment regimen involves using generic lamivudine as the first-line drug with tenofovir added if drug resistance occurs in HBeAg-positive CHB patients.",2014-01-16726,24731689,BMC Health Serv Res,Narisa Tantai,2014,14 /,170,Yes,24731689,"Narisa Tantai; Usa Chaikledkaew; Tawesak Tanwandee; Pitsaphun Werayingyong; Yot Teerawattananon; A cost-utility analysis of drug treatments in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B in Thailand, BMC Health Serv Res, ; 14():1472-6963; 170",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tenofovir monotherapy vs. Palliative care,Not Stated,Not Stated,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-5158.73,Thailand,2010,-193.41
