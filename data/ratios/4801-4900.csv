4801,Cost effectiveness of the German screen-and-treat strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis,"BACKGROUND: The German osteology umbrella organization, Dachverband Osteologie (DVO), has published a new guideline for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures. According to the guideline, women are screened using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Those with an absolute 10-year fracture risk > or =30% are treated with bisphosphonates such as alendronate or risedronate for 4 years or with teriparatide for 18 months. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of the screen-and-treat strategy versus no intervention in women of the general population aged 50-90 years in Germany. METHODS: Cost-utility and budget-impact analyses were performed from the perspective of the statutory health insurance (SHI). A Markov model with a 1-year cycle length simulated costs and benefits (QALYs), discounted at 3%, over a lifetime horizon. The number of women correctly diagnosed by pre-tests and DXA as having a 10-year fracture risk of > or =30% was estimated for different age groups (50-60, 60-70, 70-80 and 80-90 years). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated; all costs are presented in euro, year 2006 values. Robustness of the results was tested by a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Alendronate was the most cost-effective drug in all age groups; the ICERs were euro 3849, euro 16 589, euro 6600 and euro 2337 per QALY for 50-, 60-, 70- and 80-year-old women, respectively, followed by risedronate. Teriparatide was dominated in every age group. Implementing the screen-and-treat strategy would result in annual costs of euro 175 million for alendronate (euro 181 million for risedronate) or 0.14% of the SHI annual budget. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: While the screen-and-treat strategy would result in a substantial cost increase for the SHI, the use of alendronate within such a strategy appears cost effective when compared with many generally accepted medical interventions.",2008-01-03730,18489201,Pharmacoeconomics,Dirk Mueller,2008,26 / 6,513-36,Yes,18489201,"Dirk Mueller; Eva Weyler; Afschin Gandjour; Cost effectiveness of the German screen-and-treat strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2008; 26(6):1179-2027; 513-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for osteoporosis and treating those with a positive result with risedronate vs. No intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,4570,Euro,2006,7370.54

4811,Cost-utility analysis of varenicline versus existing smoking cessation strategies using the BENESCO Simulation model: application to a population of US adult smokers,"BACKGROUND: Of 1 346 700 total deaths each year in the US, an estimated 440 100 are smoking related, making it the leading preventable cause of premature death in the US. Despite the health and economic benefits of smoking cessation being well documented, reimbursement coverage for smoking cessation therapies is generally limited in the US and elsewhere. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of varenicline, an alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, recently approved to aid smoking cessation. METHODS: A Markov model, the Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes (BENESCO) model, was developed to simulate the lifetime direct costs and consequences of a hypothetical cohort of US adult smokers who make a one-time attempt to quit smoking. The smoking cessation strategies compared were varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy and unaided quitting. The model used the hazard ratios from the Cancer Prevention Study (CPS)-II study for the mortality of smoking-related diseases as a proxy to calculate the relative risks of the incidence and prevalence of these diseases, following previously developed methodology. The costs (year 2005 values) and utilities for the included smoking-related diseases (lung cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease [COPD], coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke and asthma exacerbations), and the efficacies of the smoking cessation strategies, were sourced from the published literature. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% pa. Probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted.

4814,Cost-effectiveness of statins in the prevention of coronary heart disease events in middle-aged Finnish men,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 40 mg in primary and secondary prevention of CHD in Finland. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of statin therapy on the incidence of CHD and the expected total costs of the disease were described using a Markov state transition model. Due to the limited amount of evidence concerning mortality and morbidity for rosuvastatin, the model was used to transmute the efficiency data of all statins (decrease in total cholesterol) into long-term endpoints (myocardial infarction, death) using risk functions of the FINRISK and 4S studies. The study followed a characterized cohort of 55-year-old Finnish men with an average 3.3-6.6% baseline risk of dying from cardiovascular disease within a 10-year period. Main outcome measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, compared with simvastatin, measured as cost of life years gained (euro/LYG) and cost of quality adjusted life years gained (euro/QALY). RESULTS: The use of rosuvastatin increased the life expectancy by 0.27 years on average (LYG) compared with simvastatin, producing additional 0.08 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Compared with simvastatin, the cost of one LYG with rosuvastatin was euro10 834 and the cost of one QALY gained was euro36 548 (discount rate 5% per annum). Corresponding figures for atorvastatin were euro31 286/LYG and euro105 599/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: If the decision makers' willingness to pay for a QALY gained is around euro40 000 there is a high probability (>50%) that rosuvastatin represents a cost-effective form of therapy in the prevention of CHD in middle-aged men with an average 3.3-6.6% risk of dying within 10 years from cardiovascular disease.

4816,Biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 vs. insulin glargine in insulin naïve type 2 diabetes patients: modelling the long-term health economic implications in a Swedish setting,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 (BIAsp 70/30) treatment vs. insulin glargine in insulin naïve, type 2 diabetes patients failing oral antidiabetic drugs in a Swedish setting. METHODS: A published and validated computer simulation model (the CORE Diabetes Model) was used to project life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and costs over patient lifetimes. Cohort characteristics [54.5% male, mean age 52.4 years, 9 years mean diabetes duration, mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.77%] and treatment effects were based on results from the Initiate Insulin by Aggressive Titration and Education (INITIATE) clinical trial. Direct medical costs were accounted in 2006 Swedish Kronor (SEK) and economic and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: Biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 treatment when compared with insulin glargine treatment was associated with improvements in discounted life expectancy of 0.21 years (13.10 vs. 12.89 years) and QALE of 0.21 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (9.16 vs. 8.96 QALYs). Reductions in the incidence of diabetes-related complications in the BIAsp 70/30 treatment arm led to reduced total costs of SEK 10,367 when compared with insulin glargine (SEK 396,475 vs. SEK 406,842) over patient lifetimes. BIAsp 70/30 treatment was projected to be dominant (cost and lifesaving) when compared with insulin glargine in the base case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 treatment was associated with improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs compared with insulin glargine treatment over patient lifetimes. These results were driven by improved HbA1c levels associated with BIAsp 70/30 compared with insulin glargine and the accompanying reduction in diabetes-related complications despite increases in body mass index.",2008-01-03742,18479280,Int J Clin Pract,G Goodall,2008,62 / 6,869-76,No,18479280,"G Goodall; J H Jendle; W J Valentine; V Munro; A B Brandt; J A Ray; S Roze; V Foos; A J Palmer; J H Jendle; W J Valentine; V Munro; A B Brandt; J A Ray; S Roze; V Foos; A J Palmer; Biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 vs. insulin glargine in insulin naïve type 2 diabetes patients: modelling the long-term health economic implications in a Swedish setting, Int J Clin Pract, 2008-Jun; 62(6):1368-5031; 869-76",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 vs. Insulin glargine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,-49366.67,Sweden,2006,-8610.72
4817,Cost-effectiveness of live attenuated influenza vaccine versus inactivated influenza vaccine among children aged 24-59 months in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recently expanded the influenza vaccine recommendation to include children 24-59 months of age. In a large head-to-head randomized controlled trial, live attenuated influenza vaccine, trivalent (LAIV) demonstrated a 54% relative reduction in culture-confirmed influenza illness compared with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) among children aged 24-59 months. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative cost and benefit between two influenza vaccines (LAIV and TIV) for healthy children 24-59 months of age. METHODS: Using patient-level data from the clinical trial supplemented with cost data from published literature, we modeled the cost-effectiveness of these two vaccines. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and cases of influenza avoided. The analysis used the societal perspective. RESULTS: Due to its higher acquisition cost, LAIV increased vaccination costs by USD7.72 per child compared with TIV. However, compared with TIV, LAIV reduced the number of influenza illness cases and lowered the subsequent healthcare use of children and productivity losses of parents. The estimated offsets in direct and indirect costs saved USD15.80 and USD37.72 per vaccinated child, respectively. LAIV had a net total cost savings of USD45.80 per child relative to TIV. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that the model was robust across a wide range of relative vaccine efficacy and cost estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its increased relative vaccine efficacy over TIV, LAIV reduced the burden of influenza and lowered both direct health care and societal costs among children 24-59 months of age.",2008-01-03751,18462851,Vaccine,Bryan R Luce,2008,26 / 23,2841-8,Yes,18462851,"Bryan R Luce; Kristin L Nichol; Robert B Belshe; Kevin D Frick; Su Xia Li; Audra Boscoe; Matthew D Rousculp; Parthiv J Mahadevia; Kristin L Nichol; Robert B Belshe; Kevin D Frick; Su Xia Li; Audra Boscoe; Matthew D Rousculp; Parthiv J Mahadevia; Cost-effectiveness of live attenuated influenza vaccine versus inactivated influenza vaccine among children aged 24-59 months in the United States, Vaccine, 2008-Jun-02; 26(23):1873-2518; 2841-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Live attenuated influenza vaccine, trivalent (LAIV) vs. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV)",Not Stated,59 Months,24 Months,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.00,-127222.22,United States,2006,-163325.94
4818,Radiofrequency ablation versus nephron-sparing surgery for small unilateral renal cell carcinoma: cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation versus nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) in patients with small (<or=4-cm) renal cell carcinoma (RCC), given a commonly accepted level of societal willingness to pay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate life expectancy and lifetime costs for 65-year-old patients with a small RCC treated with RF ablation or NSS. The model incorporated RCC presence, treatment effectiveness and costs, and short- and long-term outcomes. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to identify treatment preference under an assumed $75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) societal willingness-to-pay threshold level, within proposed ranges for guiding implementation of new health care interventions. The effect of changes in key parameters on strategy preference was addressed in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: By using base-case assumptions, NSS yielded a minimally greater average quality-adjusted life expectancy than did RF ablation (2.5 days) but was more expensive. NSS had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,152,529 per QALY relative to RF ablation, greatly exceeding $75,000 per QALY. Therefore, RF ablation was considered preferred and remained so if the annual probability of post-RF ablation local recurrence was up to 48% higher relative to that post-NSS. NSS preference required an estimated NSS cost reduction of $7500 or RF ablation cost increase of $6229. Results were robust to changes in most model parameters, but treatment preference was dependent on the relative probabilities of local recurrence after RF ablation and NSS, the short-term costs of both, and quality of life after NSS. CONCLUSION: RF ablation was preferred over NSS for small RCC treatment at a societal willingness-to-pay threshold level of $75,000 per QALY. This result was robust to changes in most model parameters, but somewhat dependent on the relative probabilities of post-RF ablation and post-NSS local recurrence, NSS and RF ablation short-term costs, and post-NSS quality of life, factors which merit further primary investigation.",2008-01-03757,18458248,Radiology,Pari V Pandharipande,2008,248 / 1,169-78,No,18458248,"Pari V Pandharipande; Debra A Gervais; Peter R Mueller; Chin Hur; G Scott Gazelle; Debra A Gervais; Peter R Mueller; Chin Hur; G Scott Gazelle; Radiofrequency ablation versus nephron-sparing surgery for small unilateral renal cell carcinoma: cost-effectiveness analysis, Radiology, 2008-Jul; 248(1):0033-8419; 169-78",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) vs. Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RF),Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1152529,United States,2006,1479599.12
4819,An economic evaluation of the expanded food and nutrition education program,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the New York State Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program using economic methodology. DESIGN: Data were collected by nutrition educators in a pretest, posttest design with an epidemiological modeling approach to assess costs and estimate potential health benefits of the state program. SETTING: Cooperative Extension, 35 counties. PARTICIPANTS: 5730 low-income participants. INTERVENTION: Series of 6 or more food and nutrition lessons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost (program and participant); health benefits in quality adjusted life years (QALYs); and monetized benefits: society's willingness to pay for QALYs, and benefits of avoiding or delaying health care costs and loss of productivity. ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness estimated from behavior change and QALY weights. Cost-benefit ratios estimated from costs and monetized benefits. Sensitivity analyses provided ranges where lack of agreement exists around parameters' values. RESULTS: Cost was $892/graduate. Cost-effectiveness was 245 QALYs saved, at $20863/QALY (sensitivity 42-935 QALYs, $5467-$130311 per QALY). Societal willingness to pay benefit-to-cost ratio was $9.58:$1.00 (sensitivity $1.44-$41.92:$1:00); narrow governmental benefit-to-cost ratio was $0.82:$1.00 (sensitivity $0.08-$4.33:$1:00).

4820,Risk attitudes to treatment among patients with severe intermittent claudication,"OBJECTIVES: To determine claudication patients' risk attitude to invasive treatment and whether this treatment is cost effective. METHODS: Quality of life and health state utility status of 50 consecutive patients with severe intermittent claudication was assessed and compared with ankle-brachial pressure index values (ABPI) and results from treadmill tests before and after endovascular or open revascularization. Health utility scores were then calculated and used in a cost-utility analysis. RESULTS: Before surgery, patients were assigned a utility score of 0.51 (EQ-5D index) for their disease, and the standard gamble (SG) and time trade-off (TTO) median scores were 0.88 and 0.70, respectively. Before treatment, a weak correlation (r = 0.43, P < .001) between having a high risk perception of treatment and patients' walking distance were observed, where patients able to walk short distances accepted a higher risk. After treatment, ABI (P = .003) and walking distance (P = .002) improved significantly as well the physical components of the quality of life instruments (P < .001). The surgical treatment generated an improvement in quality of life expressed in QALYs equivalent to 0.17. With an estimated survival of 5 years, it adds up to a value of 0.85, corresponding to a sum of 51,000 US dollars gained.

4823,The cost-effectiveness a disease management programme for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and heart failure in primary care,"Objective To determine if a disease management programme for patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure represents an efficient use of health services resources. Design We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a cluster randomised control trial of 1163 patients with coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure in 20 primary care practices in the UK. Practices were randomised to either a control group, where patients received standard general practice care, or an intervention group where patients had access to a specialist nurse led disease management programme. We estimated costs in both groups for coronary heart disease related resource use. The main outcome measure used in the economic evaluation was quality adjusted life years (QALY) measured using the EuroQol. Results The disease management programme was associated with an increase in the QALY measured of 0.03 per year and an increase in the total NHS costs of GBP 425 (Euros 621), of this only GBP 83 (Euros 121) was directly associated with the provision of the nurse clinics.

4827,An economic evaluation of a perindopril-based blood pressure lowering regimen for patients who have suffered a cerebrovascular event,"OBJECTIVES: Cerebrovascular disease (or stroke) is one of the main causes of long-term disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The economic impact of stroke is clearly seen, as it is the largest single cause of bed occupancy in hospitals in England and accounts for 6% of hospital costs. This analysis is the first to quantify the economic consequences of a blood pressure lowering regimen based on the PROGRESS study (perindopril-based regimen), for reducing future cardiovascular events. DESIGN: A Markov decision analytical model was used to estimate the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of blood pressure lowering in the treatment of patients presenting with a cerebrovascular event. The health states are based upon Barthel indices for which resource utilisation and health benefits have previously been estimated. SETTING: The participants for the economic analysis were obtained from the PROGRESS study database. 6,105 clinical study participants were recruited through both primary and secondary care centres. PARTICIPANTS: The mean age was 64 years; 70% were male in the original study. INTERVENTIONS: In the PROGRESS study, blood pressure lowering by a perindopril-based regimen was compared to standard care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year for the duration of the study (4 years) and for a time span of 20 years. RESULTS: Using only direct hospital medical costs, the cost per QALY for a perindopril based regimen is pound6,927 for the base study period and pound10,133 for a 20-year time period. These results are sensitive to the cost of perindopril, the cost of the stroke unit, length of stay, and to a lesser extent, the cost of indapamide. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates a cost-effective treatment for patients suffering a cerebrovascular event with a blood pressure lowering regimen. The findings of this study are in line with current decisions and guidance by the national institute for health and clinical excellence (NICE) in England.",2008-01-03776,18446392,Eur J Health Econ,Manouchehr Tavakoli,2008,/,,Yes,18446392,"Manouchehr Tavakoli; Neil Pumford; Mark Woodward; Alex Doney; John Chalmers; Stephen Macmahon; Ronald Macwalter; Neil Pumford; Mark Woodward; Alex Doney; John Chalmers; Stephen MacMahon; Ronald Macwalter; An economic evaluation of a perindopril-based blood pressure lowering regimen for patients who have suffered a cerebrovascular event, Eur J Health Econ, 2008-Apr-30; ():1618-7598",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Peridophil vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,4 Years,3.50,3.50,6927,United Kingdom,2005,16710.37
4828,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) for node-positive breast cancer: modeling the downstream effects","Purpose BCIRG 001 demonstrated prolonged disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) but increased toxicity for adjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) versus 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC) in women with node positive breast cancer (BC). This study evaluates quality-adjusted survival and cost-effectiveness of adjuvant TAC versus FAC, taking downstream decisions and events into account, including palliative chemotherapy with taxanes. Methods We developed a Markov model for a cohort of women with node positive BC eligible for adjuvant anthracyclines. Data input included clinical and resource utilization data collected prospectively from BCIRG 001. Treatment decisions and outcomes with disease recurrence were based on a systematic literature review with validity reviewed by a national panel of Canadian BC oncologists. Direct costs for resource utilization following Canadian practice patterns were included. Unit costs were obtained from provincial cost list and published drug list prices. Utility scores were derived from the literature. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained for TAC versus FAC was calculated. Results For 1,000 women with node positive BC, the model showed that TAC would lead to a gain of 313 QALY (370 life years) at an additional cost of $5.8 Million Canadian dollars (Cdn) compared to FAC, over a 10-year time horizon. The ICER of TAC versus FAC was $18,505.54 Cdn per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the model. By one-way sensitivity analyses of over 50 model variables, 95% of the cumulative ICER variation was from $6,000 to $28,000 Cdn/QALY. By multivariate Monte Carlo simulation, there was a 70% probability that the ICER would be under $50,000 CdN/QALY.

4829,Cost-effectiveness of intensified versus conventional multifactorial intervention in type 2 diabetes: results and projections from the Steno-2 study,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive versus conventional therapy for 8 years as applied in the Steno-2 study in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to incorporate event and risk data from Steno-2 and account Danish-specific costs to project life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and lifetime direct medical costs expressed in year 2005 Euros. Clinical and cost outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes and discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Intensive treatment was associated with increased life expectancy, QALE, and lifetime costs compared with conventional treatment. Mean +/- SD undiscounted life expectancy was 18.1 +/- 7.9 years with intensive treatment and 16.2 +/- 7.3 years with conventional treatment (difference 1.9 years). Discounted life expectancy was 13.4 +/- 4.8 years with intensive treatment and 12.4 +/- 4.5 years with conventional treatment. Lifetime costs (discounted) for intensive and conventional treatment were euro45,521 +/- 19,697 and euro41,319 +/- 27,500, respectively (difference euro4,202). Increased costs with intensive treatment were due to increased pharmacy and consultation costs. Discounted QALE was 1.66 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) higher for intensive (10.2 +/- 3.6 QALYs) versus conventional (8.6 +/- 2.7 QALYs) treatment, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2,538 per QALY gained. This is considered a conservative estimate because accounting prescription of generic drugs and capturing indirect costs would further favor intensified therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From a health care payer perspective in Denmark, intensive therapy was more cost-effective than conventional treatment. Assuming that patients in both arms were treated in a primary care setting, intensive therapy became dominant (cost- and lifesaving).",2008-01-03783,18443195,Diabetes Care,Peter Gaede,2008,31 / 8,1510-5,No,18443195,"Peter Gaede; William J Valentine; Andrew J Palmer; Daniel M D Tucker; Morten Lammert; Hans-Henrik Parving; Oluf Pedersen; William J Valentine; Andrew J Palmer; Daniel M D Tucker; Morten Lammert; Hans-Henrik Parving; Oluf Pedersen; Cost-effectiveness of intensified versus conventional multifactorial intervention in type 2 diabetes: results and projections from the Steno-2 study, Diabetes Care, 2008-Aug; 31(8):0149-5992; 1510-5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensified care at Steno Diabetes Center vs. Conventional care according to National guidelines,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2538,Euro,2005,4186.94
4830,Cost-utility analysis of deferasirox compared to standard therapy with desferrioxamine for patients requiring iron chelation therapy in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the cost-utility of deferasirox (Exjade) compared to standard therapy using desferrioxamine (Desferal) for the control of iron overload in patients receiving frequent blood transfusions. The perspective adopted was that of the National Health Service in the UK. METHODS: Phase II/III clinical trials have shown deferasirox in the recommended doses of 20-30 mg/kg per day to have similar efficacy to desferrioxamine at equivalent doses in the control of chronic iron overload. The main difference between them is in the mode of administration. Desferrioxamine is administered parenterally as a slow subcutaneous infusion typically infused 8-12 hours a day for 5-7 days a week. In comparison, deferasirox provides 24 hour chelation via a once daily oral tablet dispersed in water or juice. An excel based economic model was developed to evaluate the annual healthcare costs and quality of life, or utility, benefits associated with differences in mode of administration, using beta-thalassaemia as the reference case. A community utility study using time trade-off methods was performed to determine utility outcomes associated with iron chelation therapy (ICT) mode of administration. RESULTS: In the reference case (patient mean weight 42 kg), deferasirox 'dominated' desferrioxamine, i.e. resulted in lower net costs and higher quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Drug dose and cost is patient weight related. Incremental cost per QALY gained was pound 7775 for patients with a mean weight of 62 kg. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-utility analysis did not take drug compliance into account. However, Deferasirox is cost-effective compared to standard iron chelation therapy with desferrioxamine, due to the cost and quality of life benefits derived from a simpler and more convenient oral mode of administration.",2008-01-03786,18439348,Curr Med Res Opin,J Karnon,2008,24 / 6,1609-21,No,18439348,"J Karnon; K Tolley; J Oyee; K Jewitt; D Ossa; R Akehurst; K Tolley; J Oyee; K Jewitt; D Ossa; R Akehurst; Cost-utility analysis of deferasirox compared to standard therapy with desferrioxamine for patients requiring iron chelation therapy in the United Kingdom, Curr Med Res Opin, 2008-Jun; 24(6):0300-7995; 1609-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Desferasirox 20-30mg/kg daily; 24 hour chelation via a once daily oral tablet in water or juice vs. Desferrioxamine 20-30mg/kg daily; administered parenterally as a slow subcutaneous infusion 8-12 hours a day for 5-7 days/week,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-8920.46,United States,2007,-11134.8

Materials and methods A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the Markov model from the combined view of Korean National Health Insurance and patients. The model allowed assessment from the beginning of the first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy following primary surgery until death. Relevant clinical data were obtained from the clinical trial BCIRG 001 and data for local treatment patterns and direct medical costs were obtained from three Korean hospitals. Results Over a life time horizon, the life expectancy of TAC was 0.9 years longer than that of FAC.

4832,Cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea in British Columbia,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Patients experience a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is the first-line therapy for OSAH, improves sleepiness, vigilance and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of CPAP therapy versus no treatment for OSAH patients who are drivers. METHODS: A Markov decision analytical model with a five-year time horizon was used. The study population consisted of male and female patients, between 30 and 59 years of age, who were newly diagnosed with moderate to severe OSAH. The model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CPAP therapy in reducing rates of MVCs and improving quality of life. Utility values were obtained from previously published studies. Rates of MVCs under the CPAP and no CPAP scenarios were calculated from Insurance Corporation of British Columbia data and a systematic review of published studies. MVCs, equipment and physician costs were obtained from the British Columbia Medical Association, published cost-of-illness studies and the price lists of established vendors of CPAP equipment in British Columbia. Findings were examined from the perspectives of a third-party payer and society. RESULTS: From the third-party payer perspective, CPAP therapy was more effective but more costly than no CPAP (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] of $3,626 per quality-adjusted life year). From the societal perspective, the ICER was similar ($2,979 per quality-adjusted life year). The ICER was most dependent on preference elicitation method used to obtain utility values, varying almost sixfold under alternative assumptions from the base-case analysis.

The objective of the current analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding sitagliptin to the regimens of patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) above the International Diabetes Federation goal (6.5%) while on MF in six European countries: Austria, Finland, Portugal, Scotland (United Kingdom), Spain and Sweden. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model, which employed the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model risk equations for predicting risks of diabetes-related complication, was used. Lifetime costs and benefits were projected for alternative treatment strategies of adding sitagliptin, compared with adding rosiglitazone or a SU to MF in patients not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy. Changes in HbA1C as well as side effects associated with these different treatment strategies were based on clinical trial data. Mean baseline values from local epidemiologic studies involving patients with type 2 diabetes not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy were included in the current analysis. Costs of medications, side effects and direct costs of diabetes-related complications were based on country-specific data. UKPDS-based disutility weights associated with diabetes complications were incorporated. Disutilities associated with medication side effects were based on published data. All future costs and benefits were discounted according to local guidelines on cost-effectiveness analysis. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying key input parameters. FINDINGS: The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) associated with the addition of sitagliptin to MF, compared with adding rosiglitazone, in the different countries analysed ranged from treatment with sitagliptin being dominant (cost saving with improved health outcome) to its being cost-effective [4,766 euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)]. Treatment with sitagliptin added to MF was cost-effective compared with adding a SU, with discounted ICER values ranging from 5949 euros/QALY to 20,350 euros/QALY across countries. Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes in input parameters, including clinical efficacy, costs and utility weights for both diabetes-related complications and hypoglycaemia.

The objective of the current analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding sitagliptin to the regimens of patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) above the International Diabetes Federation goal (6.5%) while on MF in six European countries: Austria, Finland, Portugal, Scotland (United Kingdom), Spain and Sweden. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model, which employed the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model risk equations for predicting risks of diabetes-related complication, was used. Lifetime costs and benefits were projected for alternative treatment strategies of adding sitagliptin, compared with adding rosiglitazone or a SU to MF in patients not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy. Changes in HbA1C as well as side effects associated with these different treatment strategies were based on clinical trial data. Mean baseline values from local epidemiologic studies involving patients with type 2 diabetes not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy were included in the current analysis. Costs of medications, side effects and direct costs of diabetes-related complications were based on country-specific data. UKPDS-based disutility weights associated with diabetes complications were incorporated. Disutilities associated with medication side effects were based on published data. All future costs and benefits were discounted according to local guidelines on cost-effectiveness analysis. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying key input parameters. FINDINGS: The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) associated with the addition of sitagliptin to MF, compared with adding rosiglitazone, in the different countries analysed ranged from treatment with sitagliptin being dominant (cost saving with improved health outcome) to its being cost-effective [4,766 euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)]. Treatment with sitagliptin added to MF was cost-effective compared with adding a SU, with discounted ICER values ranging from 5949 euros/QALY to 20,350 euros/QALY across countries. Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes in input parameters, including clinical efficacy, costs and utility weights for both diabetes-related complications and hypoglycaemia.

4848,Updated estimates of survival and cost effectiveness for imatinib versus interferon-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine for newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia,"BACKGROUND: For trials in which participants are followed beyond the main study period to assess long-term outcomes, economic evaluations conducted using short-term data should be systematically updated to reflect new information. METHODS: We used 60-month survival data from the IRIS (International Randomized study of Interferon vs STI571) trial to update previously published cost-effectiveness estimates, based on 19 months of follow-up, of imatinib versus interferon (IFN)-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. For patients treated with imatinib, we used the 60-month data to calibrate the survival curves generated from the original cost-effectiveness model. We used historical data to model survival for patients randomized to IFNalpha. We updated costs for medical resources using 2006 Medicare reimbursement rates and applied average wholesale prices (AWPs) and wholesale acquisition costs (WACs) to study medications. RESULTS: Five-year survival for patients randomized to imatinib was better than predicted in the original model (89.4% vs 83.2%). We estimated remaining life expectancy with first-line imatinib to be 19.1 life-years (3.8 life-years over the original model) and 15.2 QALYs (3.1 QALYs over the original estimate). Estimates for IFNalpha remained at 9.1 life-years and 6.3 QALYs. When we applied AWPs to study medications, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $US 51,800-57,500 per QALY. When we applied WACs, ICERs were $US 42,000-46,200 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Although the analysis revealed that the original survival estimates were conservative, the updated cost-effectiveness ratios were consistent with, or slightly higher than, the original estimates, depending on the method for assigning costs to study medications.",2008-01-03800,18429659,Pharmacoeconomics,Shelby D Reed,2008,26 / 5,435-46,Yes,18429659,"Shelby D Reed; Kevin J Anstrom; Yanhong Li; Kevin A Schulman; Updated estimates of survival and cost effectiveness for imatinib versus interferon-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine for newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia, Pharmacoeconomics, 2008; 26(5):1179-2027; 435-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with imatinib vs. Interferon alpha plus low-dose cytarabine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,57103,United States,2006,73307.96
4849,Different strategies for screening and prevention of type 2 diabetes in adults: cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To compare four potential screening strategies, and subsequent interventions, for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: (a) screening for type 2 diabetes to enable early detection and treatment, (b) screening for type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, intervening with lifestyle interventions in those with a diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance to delay or prevent diabetes, (c) as for (b) but with pharmacological interventions, and (d) no screening. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on development and evaluation of probabilistic, comprehensive economic decision analytic model, from screening to death. SETTING: A hypothetical population, aged 45 at time of screening, with above average risk of diabetes. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials and epidemiological studies retrieved from electronic bibliographic databases; supplementary data obtained from the Department of Health statistics for England and Wales, the screening those at risk (STAR) study, and the Leicester division of the ADDITION study. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed to simulate the long term effects of each screening strategy, in terms of both clinical and cost effectiveness outcomes. The base case model assumed a 50 year time horizon with discounting of both costs and benefits at 3.5%. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate assumptions of the model and to identify which model inputs had most impact on the results. RESULTS: Estimated costs for each quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained (discounted at 3.5% a year for both costs and benefits) were pound14,150 (euro17 560; $27,860) for screening for type 2 diabetes, pound6242 for screening for diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance followed by lifestyle interventions, and pound7023 for screening for diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance followed by pharmacological interventions, all compared with no screening. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 the probability of the intervention being cost effective was 49%, 93%, and 85% for each of the active screening strategies respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, with appropriate intervention for those with impaired glucose tolerance, in an above average risk population aged 45, seems to be cost effective.

4852,Intrathecal baclofen therapy in children with intractable spastic cerebral palsy: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"In a Dutch national study, we recently established the effectiveness and safety of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion (CITB) in children with intractable spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Because prospective studies on the cost-effectiveness of CITB in children with spastic CP are lacking, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside our prospective national study. We compared the costs and health effects of CITB with those of standard treatment only, from the health care perspective for a 1-year period. Health effects were expressed in terms of a visual analogue scale for individual problems and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We included eight females and seven males, aged between 7 and 17 years (mean age 13y 8mo [SD 3y]). Eleven children had spastic CP and four had spastic-dyskinetic CP. One child was clsssified on the Gross Motor Function Classification System at Level III, two at Level IV, and 12 at Level V. CITB was more effective and more costly than standard treatment only. Gaining one QALY cost on average 32,737 euros. We conclude that based on the threshold-willingness to pay for one QALY in the Netherlands (80,000 euros), our results confirm the cost-effectiveness of CITB for carefully selected children with intractable spastic CP.",2008-01-03807,18422682,Dev Med Child Neurol,M A Hoving,2008,50 / 6,450-5,No,18422682,"M A Hoving; S M A A Evers; A J H A Ament; E P M van Raak; J S H Vles; S M A A Evers; A J H A Ament; E P M van Raak; J S H Vles; Intrathecal baclofen therapy in children with intractable spastic cerebral palsy: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Dev Med Child Neurol, 2008-Jun; 50(6):0012-1622; 450-5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion vs. Standard treatment only,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,32737,Euro,2003,52128.14

Tailored (escalating-dose) prophylaxis (EscDose), beginning at a low frequency and escalating with repeated bleeding may prevent arthropathy at a lower cost than standard prophylaxis (SP). From a societal perspective, we compared the incremental cost per joint-haemorrhage that is avoided and quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained of SP and EscDose to on-demand (Demand) therapy in severe haemophilia A boys treated to age 6 using a decision analytic model. Costs included factor VIII (FVIII), professional visits and tests, central venous placement/complications, hospitalization, home programmes and parents' lost work-days. Resource utilization was estimated by surveying 17 Canadian clinics. The natural history of bleeding and other probabilities were determined from a longitudinal chart review (n = 24) and published literature. EscDose costs an additional $3192 per joint-haemorrhage that was avoided compared with Demand whereas SP costs an additional $9046 per joint-haemorrhage that was avoided compared with EscDose. Clinic costs and lost wages were reduced by 60-80% for EscDose and SP compared with Demand. EscDose attained more QALYs than SP and Demand on account of less bleeding than Demand and lower need for ports than SP. The incremental cost per QALY for EscDose vs. Demand was $542 938. EscDose was less expensive with similar QALYs compared to SP. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all probability- and cost-estimates, and showed the model was sensitive to the cost of FVIII and the SP and target joint utilities.

EscDose costs an additional $3192 per joint-haemorrhage that was avoided compared with Demand whereas SP costs an additional $9046 per joint-haemorrhage that was avoided compared with EscDose. Clinic costs and lost wages were reduced by 60-80% for EscDose and SP compared with Demand. EscDose attained more QALYs than SP and Demand on account of less bleeding than Demand and lower need for ports than SP. The incremental cost per QALY for EscDose vs. Demand was $542 938. EscDose was less expensive with similar QALYs compared to SP. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all probability- and cost-estimates, and showed the model was sensitive to the cost of FVIII and the SP and target joint utilities.

4855,Cost effectiveness of self monitoring of blood glucose in patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes: economic evaluation of data from the DiGEM trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of self monitoring of blood glucose alone or with additional training in incorporating the results into self care, in addition to standardised usual care for patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Incremental cost utility analysis from a healthcare perspective. Data on resource use from the randomised controlled diabetes glycaemic education and monitoring (DiGEM) trial covered 12 months before baseline and 12 months of trial follow-up. Quality of life was measured at baseline and 12 months using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire. SETTING: Primary care in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 453 patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Standardised usual care (control) compared with additional self monitoring of blood glucose alone (less intensive self monitoring) or with training in self interpretation of the results (more intensive self monitoring). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years and healthcare costs (sterling in 2005-6 prices). RESULTS: The average costs of intervention were pound89 (euro113; $179) for standardised usual care, pound181 for less intensive self monitoring, and pound173 for more intensive self monitoring, showing an additional cost per patient of pound92 (95% confidence interval pound80 to pound103) in the less intensive group and pound84 ( pound73 to pound96) in the more intensive group. No other significant cost difference was detected between the groups. An initial negative impact of self monitoring on quality of life occurred, averaging -0.027 (95% confidence interval-0.069 to 0.015) for the less intensive self monitoring group and -0.075 (-0.119 to -0.031) for the more intensive group. CONCLUSIONS: Self monitoring of blood glucose with or without additional training in incorporating the results into self care was associated with higher costs and lower quality of life in patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes. In light of this, and no clinically significant differences in other outcomes, self monitoring of blood glucose is unlikely to be cost effective in addition to standardised usual care.

4857,Effectiveness and costs of screening for aneurysms every 5 years after subarachnoid hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND: Patients who survive after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are at risk for a recurrence despite successful treatment of the ruptured aneurysm and may therefore benefit from screening for new aneurysms. METHODS: We screened 610 patients with SAH with CT angiography 2-18 years after clipping of the aneurysms. Results of screening were used as input for a Markov decision model. We compared the expected number of recurrent hemorrhages, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs associated with the strategies ""screening every 5 years"" and ""no screening."" RESULTS: Screening individuals with previous SAH prevented almost half of the recurrences, slightly increased life expectancy (from 21.06 to 21.08 years), but reduced QALYs (from 12.18 to 12.04) and increased costs (from $2,750 to $4,165 per patient). Screening was cost-saving without increasing QALYs in patients with a more than twofold risk above baseline of both aneurysm formation and rupture and it was cost-saving while increasing QALYs if both risks were at least 4.5 times higher. In patients with reduced quality of life because of fear for a recurrence, screening increased QALYs at a maximum cost of $17,422 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In general, screening patients with previous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) cannot be recommended. Screening can save costs and increase quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in patients with a relatively high risk of both aneurysm formation and rupture, and increases QALYs at acceptable costs in patients with fear for a recurrence. More data are needed on risk factors for aneurysm formation and rupture in patients with previous SAH and on management of fear for a recurrence to identify patients who can benefit from screening.",2008-01-03813,18420481,Neurology,Marieke J H Wermer,2008,70 / 22,2053-62,No,18420481,"Marieke J H Wermer; Hendrik Koffijberg; Irene C van der Schaaf; Effectiveness and costs of screening for aneurysms every 5 years after subarachnoid hemorrhage, Neurology, 2008-May-27; 70(22):1526-632X; 2053-62",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for new aneurysm every five years vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,-10107.14,United States,2006,-12975.4
4858,A cost-utility analysis in patients receiving enteral tube feeding at home and in nursing homes,"A cost-utility analysis was undertaken of enteral tube feeding (ETF) in patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Mortality during ETF was established in nursing homes (n7007) or at home (n2888). Quality of life was measured (EuroQol) on a sub-sample (n25). Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over 3 years and the cost/QALY were calculated. The cost/QALY (1 pound=1.482 euros; 30/06/05) for patients receiving ETF at home was 12,817 pounds (10,351 pounds-16,826 pounds using 95% CI for quality of life) and insensitive to the frequency of home visits (50-150% of the average frequency; 11,851 pounds-13,782 pounds), outcome of patients reverting to full oral feeding (0-100% survival; 11,023 pounds-14,440 pounds), and computed outcome of a 'control' group not given ETF (0.125-0.25 year survival; 12,991 pound-14,006 pounds). The cost/QALY in nursing homes (10,304 pounds-68,064 pounds) varied depending on the state contribution to non-medical costs and is above and below the threshold (30,000 pounds/QALY). The data suggest the cost-effectiveness of ETF in patients with CVA receiving ETF at home or in nursing homes, where the non-medical costs are paid privately, compares favourably with other interventions. The cost-effectiveness of ETF in nursing homes when the state pays all non-medical costs compares unfavourably with other treatments, raising economic, clinical, and ethical concerns.",2008-01-03815,18417257,Clin Nutr,Marinos Elia,2008,31 / 2,416-23,No,18417257,"Marinos Elia; Rebecca J Stratton; Rebecca J Stratton; A cost-utility analysis in patients receiving enteral tube feeding at home and in nursing homes, Clin Nutr, ; 31(2):0261-5614; 416-23",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Long-term enteral tube feeding at home vs. No enteral tube feeding,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,12817,United Kingdom,2005,30919.12
4859,Cost-effectiveness of treatments for adolescent depression: results from TADS,"OBJECTIVE: While the evidence base for treatments for adolescent depression is building, little is known about the relative efficiency of such treatments. Treatment costs are a relevant concern given the competing demands on family and health care budgets. The authors evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three active treatments among adolescents with major depressive disorder. METHOD: Volunteers (N=439) ages 12 to 18 with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder participated in a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 13 U.S. academic and community clinics from 2000 to 2004. Subjects included those participants who did not drop out and had evaluable outcome and cost data at 12 weeks (N=369). Subjects were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either fluoxetine alone (10-40 mg/day), CBT alone, CBT combined with fluoxetine (10-40 mg/day), or placebo (equivalent to 10-40 mg/day). Both placebo and fluoxetine were administered double-blind; CBT alone and CBT in combination with fluoxetine were administered unblinded. Societal cost per unit of improvement on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were compared. RESULTS: Results ranged from an incremental cost over placebo of $24,000 per QALY for treatment with fluoxetine to $123,000 per QALY for combination therapy treatment. The cost-effectiveness ratio for CBT treatment was not evaluable due to negative clinical effects. The models were robust on a variety of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Both fluoxetine and combination therapy are at least as cost-effective in the short-term as other treatments commonly used in primary care (using a threshold of $125,000/QALY).

4863,Cost-utility analysis of telemedicine and ophthalmoscopy for retinopathy of prematurity management,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine and standard ophthalmoscopy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) management. METHODS: Models were developed to represent ROP examination and treatment using telemedicine and standard ophthalmoscopy. Cost-utility analysis was performed using decision analysis, evidence-based outcome data from published literature, and present value modeling. Visual outcome data were converted to patient preference-based time trade-off utility values based on published literature. Costs of disease management were determined based on 2006 Medicare reimbursements. Costs per quality-adjusted life year gained by telemedicine and ophthalmoscopy for ROP management were compared. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed on the following variables: discount rate (0%-7%), incidence of treatment-requiring ROP (1%-20%), sensitivity and specificity of ophthalmoscopic diagnosis (75%-100%), percentage of readable telemedicine images (75%-100%), and sensitivity and specificity of telemedicine diagnosis (75%-100%). RESULTS: For infants with birth weight less than 1500 g using a 3% discount rate for costs and outcomes, the costs per quality-adjusted life year gained were $3193 with telemedicine and $5617 with standard ophthalmoscopy. Sensitivity analysis resulted in ranges of costs per quality-adjusted life year from $1235 to $18,898 for telemedicine and from $2171 to $27,215 for ophthalmoscopy.

One-way sensitivity analysis was performed on the following variables: discount rate (0%-7%), incidence of treatment-requiring ROP (1%-20%), sensitivity and specificity of ophthalmoscopic diagnosis (75%-100%), percentage of readable telemedicine images (75%-100%), and sensitivity and specificity of telemedicine diagnosis (75%-100%). RESULTS: For infants with birth weight less than 1500 g using a 3% discount rate for costs and outcomes, the costs per quality-adjusted life year gained were $3193 with telemedicine and $5617 with standard ophthalmoscopy. Sensitivity analysis resulted in ranges of costs per quality-adjusted life year from $1235 to $18,898 for telemedicine and from $2171 to $27,215 for ophthalmoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is more cost-effective than standard ophthalmoscopy for ROP management.

4867,Cost-effectiveness analysis of adding a quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the cervical cancer screening programme in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVE: Based on positive safety and efficacy data, a quadrivalent Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) vaccine has been approved in Switzerland to prevent HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 infections. The objective of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of an HPV vaccination in Switzerland. DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection was adapted to the Swiss context and followed a hypothetical cohort of 41,200 girls aged 11 years over their lifetime. Main epidemiological and economic parameters were extracted from the literature. Two strategies were compared: conventional cytological screening only and HPV vaccination followed by conventional cytological screening. A coverage rate of 80% was used and the vaccine was assumed to provide a lifelong protection. Analyses were performed from the direct health care cost perspective including only direct medical costs. RESULTS: Compared to screening only, adding a quadrivalent HPV vaccine could prevent over lifetime 62% of cervical cancers and related deaths, 19% of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN 1), 43% of CIN 2, 45% of CIN 3 and 66% of genital warts per cohort. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated to be CHF 45,008 per Life Year Gained (LYG) and CHF 26,005 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was robust to all parameters, but was most sensitive to the need for a booster and discount rates. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to commonly accepted standard thresholds in Europe and other vaccination strategies implemented in Switzerland, adding a quadrivalent HPV vaccine alongside the current cervical cancer screening programme is likely to be cost-effective in Switzerland.",2008-01-03821,18413014,Curr Med Res Opin,Thomas D Szucs,2008,24 / 5,1473-83,No,18413014,"Thomas D Szucs; Nathalie Largeron; Konstantin J Dedes; Rachid Rafia; Stève Bénard; Cost-effectiveness analysis of adding a quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the cervical cancer screening programme in Switzerland, Curr Med Res Opin, 2008-May; 24(5):0300-7995; 1473-83",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine vs. Conventional cytological screening,Not Stated,11 Years,11 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,26005,Switzerland,2006,26658.52
4868,Cost-effectiveness of endarterectomy in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis,"BACKGROUND: Long-term health outcomes and costs are important when deciding whether a strategy of carotid endarterectomy in addition to best medical management should be recommended for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy compared with a strategy of best medical management alone. METHODS: Based on data from the randomized Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST), a national vascular database and other published sources, expected costs and health outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of both treatment strategies were estimated using decision-analytical modelling. Cost-effectiveness was established for a Swedish setting from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed that the incremental cost per QALY of a strategy with carotid endarterectomy for 65- and 75-year-old men (women) was 34,557 euros (311,133 euros) and 58,930 euros (779,776 euros) respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the duration of the treatment effect after 5 years of follow-up in the ACST was important for the cost-effectiveness results.

4872,Cost-effectiveness analysis of thiazolidinediones in uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients receiving sulfonylureas and metformin in Thailand,"OBJECTIVE: The national essential drug committee in Thailand suggested that only one of thiazolidinediones be included in hospital formulary but little was know about their cost-effectiveness values. This study aims to determine an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pioglitazone 45 mg compared with rosiglitazone 8 mg in uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients receiving sulfonylureas and metformin in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov diabetes model (Center for Outcome Research model) was used in this study. Baseline characteristics of patients were based on Thai diabetes registry project. Costs of diabetes were calculated mainly from Buddhachinaraj hospital. Nonspecific mortality rate and transition probabilities of death from renal replacement therapy were obtained from Thai sources. Clinical effectiveness of thiazolidinediones was retrieved from a meta-analysis. All analyses were based on the government hospital policymaker perspective. Both cost and outcomes were discounted with the rate of 3%. Base-case analyses were analyzed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of sensitive analyses were performed. RESULTS: In base-case analysis, the pioglitazone group had a better clinical outcomes and higher lifetime costs. The incremental cost per QALY gained was 186,246 baht (US$ 5389). The acceptability curves showed that the probability of pioglitazone being cost-effective was 29% at the willingness to pay of one time of Thai gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita). The effect of pioglitazone on %HbA1c decrease was the most sensitive to the final outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that in type 2 diabetic patients who cannot control their blood glucose under the combination of sulfonylurea and metformin, the use of pioglitazone 45 mg fell in the cost-effective range recommended by World Health Organization (one to three times of GDP per capita) on average, compared to rosiglitazone 8 mg. Nevertheless, based on sensitivity analysis, its probability of being cost-effective was quite low.

4873,"Cost-utility analysis of intensive blood glucose control with metformin versus usual care in overweight type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Beijing, P.R. China","OBJECTIVE: The UKPDS 34 and 51 showed that intensive blood glucose control with metformin is cost-saving and increases life expectancy in overweight type 2 diabetic patients in the United Kingdom. Diabetes is becoming an important health problem in urban China. This study addresses the effects and costs of intensive blood glucose control in this setting, aimed at supporting decision-making on the allocation of scarce resources. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the costs and effectiveness of intensive blood glucose control in overweight type 2 diabetes patients in Beijing, compared with usual care in accordance with clinical practice. The analysis was carried out from a health-care perspective. RESULTS: The base-case analysis (3% discount rate) shows that the average incremental costs of 11 years of intensive treatment with metformin are 126.6 K RMB (16.4 K US$) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is sensitive to the costs of medication alternatives for metformin in the intensive treatment group and to the discount rate used (0%: 105.6 K RMB (13.7 K US$) per QALY gained; 5%: 171.0 K RMB (22.2 K US$) per QALY gained). After 20 and 30 years (lifetime) follow-up, the ICERs become increasingly favorable, 90.1 K RMB (11.7 K US$) and 74.3 K RMB (9.6 K US$), respectively. The ICER is most sensitive to the costs of medication alternatives for metformin in the intensive treatment group, and to the discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of the findings depends on the maximum willingness to pay for a QALY in China, which has not officially been defined. If this would be three times the gross domestic product per capita, a value that has been suggested in the literature, lifetime intensive blood glucose control is likely to be cost-effective.

4874,Economic implications of entecavir treatment in suppressing viral replication in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in China from a perspective of the Chinese Social Security program,"OBJECTIVES: Of estimated 112 million persons infected with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in China, 15% to 40% will eventually develop liver complications. Most patients do not actively seek antiviral agents for treatment due in part to lack of good understanding of the disease. Entecavir is a new therapeutic option for CHB patients and the purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of entecavir treatment in China, based on projected clinical benefits from its superior viral suppression efficacy. METHODS: The analysis was based on the perspective of the Chinese Social Security program. Adjusted relative risks on the association between viral load (VL) and clinical end points (liver cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma) were derived from a publication of a Taiwan CHB prospective cohort with 42,115 person-years of follow-up, and applied to patients enrolled in a randomized phase III trial in China. In this trial, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (by polymerase chain reaction assay) was the key efficacy end point after 48 weeks of treatment with either entecavir or lamivudine monotherapy. Entecavir and lamivudine daily prices were assumed to be Renminbi Yuan (RMB) 40 and 16.71, respectively. Life expectancy tables were based on China vital statistics. Direct medical cost and utility scores for different phases of CHB were estimated from published China specific data, and costs were adjusted to 2006 values using the Chinese Consumer Price Index. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate parameter uncertainty on event distribution and treatment failure rates beyond the trial period. RESULTS: A total of 519 subjects were enrolled in the study, comprising of 82% males, 87% HBeAg+, and a mean age of 30 years. Based on the efficacy measurement of the percentage of patients achieving HBV DNA <300 copies/ml at week 48, entecavir was superior to lamivudine (78.7% vs. 46.7%, respectively [P < 0.05]). In the base case, compared with lamivudine, 1 year of entecavir therapy gained 0.305 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at an incremental cost of 5368 RMB, with a 3% annual discount. Compared with lamivudine, using entecavir cost an incremental 17,590 RMB per QALY gained (95% CI 6333-56,407).

4878,Health-economic analysis: cost-effectiveness of scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab for Crohn's disease--modelling outcomes in active luminal and fistulizing disease in adults,"BACKGROUND: Infliximab has been shown to be efficacious in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab in luminal and fistulizing CD patients. METHODS: Markov models were constructed to simulate the progression of adult CD patients with and without fistulae during treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg). Transitions were estimated from published clinical trials of infliximab. Standard care, comprising immunomodulators and/or corticosteroids was used as a comparator. An average weight of 60 kg was used to estimate the dose of infliximab. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over 5 years. The primary effectiveness measurement was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using EQ-5D. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the infliximab efficacy estimates, costs and utilities. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained was pound 26,128 in luminal CD and pound 29,752 in fistulizing CD at 5 years.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab in luminal and fistulizing CD patients. METHODS: Markov models were constructed to simulate the progression of adult CD patients with and without fistulae during treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg). Transitions were estimated from published clinical trials of infliximab. Standard care, comprising immunomodulators and/or corticosteroids was used as a comparator. An average weight of 60 kg was used to estimate the dose of infliximab. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over 5 years. The primary effectiveness measurement was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using EQ-5D. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the infliximab efficacy estimates, costs and utilities. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained was pound 26,128 in luminal CD and pound 29,752 in fistulizing CD at 5 years. Results were robust and remained in the range of pound 23,752- pound 38,848 for luminal CD and pound 27,047- pound 44,206 for fistulizing CD.

4880,Cost-effectiveness of using continuous positive airway pressure in the treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to estimate the cost-effectiveness of using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the management of patients with severe obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) compared with no treatment from the perspective of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of CPAP compared with no treatment. The model depicted the management of a 55-year-old patient with severe OSAHS as defined by an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) >30 and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >or=12). The model spans a period of 14 years. RESULTS: According to the model, 57% of untreated patients are expected to be alive at the end of 14 years compared with 72% of patients treated with CPAP. Untreated patients are expected to cost the NHS pound10 645 (95% CI pound7988 to pound14,098) per patient over 14 years compared with pound9672 (95% CI pound8057 to pound12,860) per CPAP-treated patient. Treatment with CPAP for a period of 1 year was found not to be a cost-effective option since the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is expected to be > pound20,000, but after 2 years of treatment the cost per QALY gained is expected to be pound10,000 or less and, after 13 years of treatment, CPAP becomes a dominant treatment (ie, more effective than no treatment for less cost). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the model, CPAP was found to be clinically more effective than no treatment and, from the perspective of the UK's NHS, a cost-effective strategy after a minimum of 2 years of treatment.",2008-01-03833,18408048,Thorax,J F Guest,2008,63 / 10,860-5,No,18408048,"J F Guest; M T Helter; A Morga; J R Stradling; M T Helter; A Morga; J R Stradling; Cost-effectiveness of using continuous positive airway pressure in the treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome in the UK, Thorax, 2008-Oct; 63(10):0040-6376; 860-5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) vs. No treatment,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,14 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2006,Not Stated
4881,A markov model of the cost effectiveness of olanzapine treatment for agitation and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antipsychotics have long been used to treat agitation and psychosis related to Alzheimer's disease, but in a limited fashion because of troubling adverse effects. The new atypical antipsychotics are thought to be at least as effective as first-generation drugs and to cause fewer adverse effects. These drugs, however, are currently not US FDA-approved for use among elderly demented subjects due to a slight increase in the risk of death and serious cardiovascular events within this population. However, their favourable adverse effect profile has led many physicians to prescribe these drugs as first-line therapy for behaviourally disturbed patients with Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials to evaluate the use of atypical antipsychotics have produced varying results, and clarity has not yet been achieved. Thus, a quantitative summary of the risks and benefits may help inform complex decisions that must be made in this area. In this study we set out to compare the expected costs and outcomes for a community-dwelling cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease with agitation and/or psychosis who are (a) untreated, or (b) treated with olanzapine. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model using the best published data from several sources for Alzheimer's disease patient progression and treatment. This model allowed us to compare the expected costs and outcomes associated with olanzapine treatment compared with no treatment for a synthetic cohort of US adults aged > or =65 years. The model cycles every 6 months and continues until all patients die from Alzheimer's disease progression or from co-morbid conditions. Outcome estimates included the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The robustness of the estimates was examined by sensitivity analyses of key parameters, including cost of care, olanzapine effectiveness and Alzheimer's disease progression rates. RESULTS: Results indicated that olanzapine was a cost-effective treatment for agitation and psychosis related to Alzheimer's disease when compared with no treatment (ICER <$US50,000). In addition, sensitivity analyses demonstrated that olanzapine remained cost effective despite multiple variations of several parameters, both alone and concurrently. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine treatment for agitation and psychosis related to Alzheimer's disease is cost effective when compared with no treatment. Further analysis should be performed as atypical antipsychotics become generic, as more information on health utilities in the Alzheimer's disease population becomes available, and to compare atypical antipsychotics with first-generation antipsychotics.",2008-01-03834,18407715,Clin Drug Investig,Stephanie Kirbach,2008,28 / 5,291-303,Yes,18407715,"Stephanie Kirbach; Kit Simpson; Paul J Nietert; Jacobo Mintzer; A markov model of the cost effectiveness of olanzapine treatment for agitation and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, Clin Drug Investig, 2008; 28(5):1173-2563; 291-303",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Olanzapine treatment vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,13 Years,3.00,3.00,37331,United States,2006,47924.97
4882,Cost-effectiveness analysis of management strategies for obscure GI bleeding,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Of patients who are seen with GI hemorrhage, approximately 5% will have a small-bowel source. Management of these patients entails considerable expense. We performed a decision analysis to explore the optimal management strategy for obscure GI hemorrhage. METHODS: We used a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare no therapy (reference arm) to 5 competing modalities for a 50-year-old patient with obscure overt bleeding: (1) push enteroscopy, (2) intraoperative enteroscopy, (3) angiography, (4) initial anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) followed by retrograde DBE if the patient had ongoing bleeding, and (5) small-bowel capsule endoscopy (CE) followed by DBE guided by the CE findings. The model included prevalence rates for small-bowel lesions, sensitivity for each intervention, and the probability of spontaneous bleeding cessation. We examined total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) over a 1-year time period. RESULTS: An initial DBE was the most cost-effective approach. The no-therapy arm cost $532 and was associated with 0.870 QALYs compared with $2407 and 0.956 QALYs for the DBE approach, which resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $20,833 per QALY gained. Compared to the DBE approach, an initial CE was more costly and less effective. The initial DBE arm resulted in an 86% bleeding cessation rate compared to 76% for the CE arm and 59% for the no-therapy arm. The model results were robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses. LIMITATIONS: The short time horizon of the model, because of the lack of long-term data about the natural history of rebleeding from small-intestinal lesions. CONCLUSIONS: An initial DBE is a cost-effective approach for patients with obscure bleeding.

METHODS: A published computer simulation model of diabetes was used to predict life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and incidence of diabetes-related complications. Baseline cohort characteristics (age 61.6 years, duration of diabetes 13.2 years, 45.1% male, HbA(1c) 8.2%, BMI 29.8 kg/m(2)) and treatment effects were derived from the PREDICTIVE observational study. Country-specific complication costs were derived from published sources. The analyses were run over 35-year time horizons from third-party payer perspectives in Spain, Italy and Poland and from a societal perspective in Sweden. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at country-specific discount rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IAsp was associated with improvements in discounted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy, and a reduced incidence of most diabetes-related complications versus HI in all four settings. IAsp was associated with societal cost-savings in Sweden (SEK 2470), direct medical cost-savings in Sweden and Spain (SEK 8248 and euro 1382, respectively), but increased direct costs in Italy (euro 2235) and Poland (euro 743). IAsp was associated with improved quality-adjusted life expectancy in Sweden (0.077 QALYs), Spain (0.080 QALYs), Italy (0.120 QALYs) and Poland (0.003 QALYs). CONCLUSIONS: IAsp was dominant versus HI in both Sweden and Spain, would be considered cost-effective in Italy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 18,597 per QALY gained, but would not be considered cost-effective in Poland.",2008-01-03843,18400145,Curr Med Res Opin,James L Palmer,2008,24 / 5,1417-28,No,18400145,"James L Palmer; Gordon Goodall; Steffen Nielsen; Robert W Kotchie; William J Valentine; Andrew J Palmer; Stéphane Roze; Cost-effectiveness of insulin aspart versus human soluble insulin in type 2 diabetes in four European countries: subgroup analyses from the PREDICTIVE study, Curr Med Res Opin, 2008-May; 24(5):0300-7995; 1417-28",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin aspart (IASp) vs. Human soluble insulin (HI),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,-139194.81,Sweden,2005,-24770.19
4885,Cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary fall prevention program in community-dwelling elderly people: a randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN 64716113),"OBJECTIVES: Multidisciplinary and multifactorial interventions seem to be effective in preventing falls. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary fall prevention program compared with usual Dutch healthcare in community-dwelling people 65 years of age or older who experienced a fall. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were performed from a societal perspective. Falls and healthcare utilization were continuously measured for 12 months. Daily functioning and quality of life were measured at baseline, after 4 and 12 months. Bootstrap analyses were performed to estimate uncertainty of the findings and sensitivity analysis to assess the generalizability of assumptions made. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six participants were randomly allocated to the experimental group and 167 to the control group. The overall response rate was 74 percent. Healthcare and patient and family costs of both groups were comparable. Our analyses showed no effect of the intervention program on falls, daily functioning, or quality of life measures. CONCLUSIONS: The multidisciplinary intervention program to prevent falls was not cost-effective compared with usual care in the Netherlands. Notwithstanding our findings, however, falls still have an important impact on society and individuals in terms of costs and effects.

4886,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy for diabetic foot ulcers,"BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been proposed as an adjunct to standard methods of care for diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Its use may decrease the risk of infection and lower extremity amputations (LEAs). As part of a Canadian assessment, we estimated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of HBOT in this application. METHODS: We developed a decision model comparing adjunctive HBOT with standard care alone. The population was a 65-year-old cohort with DFU. The time horizon was 12 years taken from a Ministry of Health perspective. The health states were a healed wound with or without a minor LEA, an unhealed wound with no related surgery, and a major LEA. Efficacy data were based on outcomes reported in studies included in a literature review. Cost and capacity needs for treating DFU patients in Canada were estimated using prevalence data from the literature, and cost and utilization data from government records. RESULTS: The 12-year cost for patients receiving HBOT was CND$40,695 compared with CND$49,786 for standard care alone. Outcomes were 3.64 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for those receiving HBOT and 3.01 QALYs for controls. Estimated cost to treat all prevalent DFU cases in Canada was CND$14.4-19.7 million/year over 4 years. If seven-person HBOT chambers were used, a further nineteen to thirty-five machines would be required nationally. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive HBOT for DFU is cost-effective compared with standard care.

4887,Economic evaluation of chronic hepatitis B treatments in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and its sequelae are major health problems in Taiwan. The purpose of the present study was the economic evaluation of short-duration treatments of CHB and longer duration antiviral treatment for up to 5 years. METHODS: Ten-health state CHB disease progression Markov models were used for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB patients, respectively, that included the emergence of antiviral resistance. The perspective of this economic evaluation was the Taiwan health-care system. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: Short-course therapies of up to 1-year treatment had limited impact on improving patient survival. Long-term viral suppression with lamivudine and adefovir sequential rescue therapies (including add-on therapies) for up to 5 years were found to be highly cost-effective by international standards (estimated to be NT$580,000 per quality adjusted life year [QALY] for Taiwan). When Taiwan-specific model inputs were used for HBeAg-positive CHB, the cost per QALY for lamivudine plus adefovir sequential antiviral therapy increased by approximately 100% over the base-case estimate, but was still well within the estimated NT$580,000 per QALY threshold.

4891,High-dose chemotherapy for patients with high-risk breast cancer: a clinical and economic assessment using a quality-adjusted survival analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The benefit of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) has not been clearly demonstrated. It may offer disease-free survival improvement at the expense of major toxicity and increasing cost. We evaluated the trade-offs between toxicity, relapse, and costs using a quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis was conducted in the context of a randomized trial (PEGASE 01) evaluating the benefit of HDC for 314 patients with high-risk breast cancer. A Q-TWiST analysis was first performed to compare HDC with standard chemotherapy. We then used the results of this Q-TWiST analysis to inform a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) comparison between treatments. RESULTS: Q-TWiST durations were in favor of HDC, whatever the weighting coefficients used for the analysis. This benefit was significant when the weighting coefficient related to the time spent after relapse was low (<0.38). For quite high values of this coefficient (>0.78), HDC offered no benefit. For intermediate values, the results depended on the weighting coefficient attributed to the toxicity period. The incremental cost per QALY ranged from 12,691euro/QALY to 26,439euro/QALY, according to the coefficients used to weight toxicity and relapse. CONCLUSION: The benefits of HDC outweigh the burdens of treatment for a wide range of utility coefficients. Economic impact is not a barrier to HDC diffusion in this situation. Nevertheless, no significant benefit was demonstrated for a certain range of utility values.",2008-01-03855,18391594,Am J Clin Oncol,Patricia Marino,2008,31 / 2,117-24,No,18391594,"Patricia Marino; Henri Roché; Jean-Paul Moatti; High-dose chemotherapy for patients with high-risk breast cancer: a clinical and economic assessment using a quality-adjusted survival analysis, Am J Clin Oncol, 2008-Apr; 31(2):1537-453X; 117-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,High dose chemotherapy vs. Standard chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,19063,Euro,1999,31547.37
4892,An economic evaluation of VAC therapy compared with wound dressings in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness ofVacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) therapy (KCI Medical), based on a comparison with both traditional and advanced wound dressings, for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in the US. METHOD: A Markov model was designed to estimate the cost per amputation avoided and the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of VAC therapy, compared with both traditional and advanced dressings. Over a one-year period the Markov model simulated 1000 patients using transition probabilities obtained from the literature.The health states used in the model were: uninfected ulcer; infected ulcer; infected ulcer post-amputation; healed; healed post-amputation; amputation; and death. Patients initially treated with VAC switched to the advanced dressing after three months of treatment if their wound remained unhealed. Patients treated with traditional or advanced dressings were assumed to continue with their treatment for the full 12 months if they remained unhealed. RESULTS: The model results demonstrate improved healing rates (61% versus 59%), more QALYs (0.54 versus 0.53) and an overall lower cost of care ($52,830 versus $61,757 per person) for patients treated with VAC therapy compared with advanced dressings.Vacuum Assisted Closure was also shown to be a dominant intervention when compared with traditional dressings. CONCLUSION: The model results indicate thatVAC therapy is less costly and more effective than both traditional and advanced dressings.The results are robust to changes in key parameters, including the transition probabilities, the cost ofVAC therapy and the utility weights applied to health states.",2008-01-03858,18389832,J Wound Care,S Flack,2008,17 / 2,71-8,No,18389832,"S Flack; J Apelqvist; M Keith; P Trueman; D Williams; An economic evaluation of VAC therapy compared with wound dressings in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, J Wound Care, 2008-Feb; 17(2):0969-0700; 71-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vacuum assisted closure therapy vs. Traditional dressings,Not Stated,65 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Month,Not Stated,Not Stated,-3143714.25,United States,2006,-4035852.33

4894,Cost-effectiveness of naturopathic care for chronic low back pain,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of naturopathic care (acupuncture, relaxation exercises, exercise and dietary advice, and a back care booklet) compared to standardized physiotherapy education and a back care booklet (control treatment) for low back pain in a sample (N = 70) of warehouse workers. DESIGN: Economic evaluation based upon the results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to determine the cost-effectiveness of naturopathic care to society as a whole, to the employer, and to participants. RESULTS: Naturopathic care (as compared to the control treatment) significantly improved quality-adjusted life-years over the 6-month study period (3-month intervention period and 3-month follow-up period) by 0.0256 (95% CI: 0.0075, 0.0437)--roughly equivalent to 9.4 ""perfect health"" days. Naturopathic care also significantly reduced societal costs by $1212 per participant. From the perspective of the employer, the intervention cost $154 per absentee day avoided (compared to employer costs of lost productivity of $172 per day) and had a return on investment of 7.9% under the healthcare coverage limits set by this employer and assuming the employer paid the full cost of naturopathic care. Participants experienced savings in adjunctive care of $1096 per participant. CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomized control trial shows naturopathic care to be more cost-effective than a standardized physiotherapy education regimen in the treatment of chronic low back pain.

4895,Biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis in the Medicare program: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Since the introduction of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act and its associated demonstration project, coverage of selected biologic drugs has been expanded for Medicare beneficiaries. For rheumatoid arthritis, coverage was extended to etanercept, adalimumab, and anakinra in addition to the previously covered infliximab. We undertook to develop a model to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) generated by each of the 4 biologic agents. METHODS: Data were drawn from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and from a large longitudinal outcomes databank. Uncertainty was addressed using probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses. A lifetime horizon and Medicare viewpoint were adopted. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, anakinra was the least effective and least costly strategy. Etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab were similar in terms of effectiveness, but infliximab was more costly. If decision makers are willing to pay a maximum of $50,000/QALY, the probability that infliximab is cost-effective is <1%. Findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. Only if the dose of infliximab remains constant over time is this likely to be a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is unlikely to be cost-effective in the Medicare population compared with either etanercept or adalimumab.

4900,Surveillance of cirrhosis for hepatocellular carcinoma: a cost-utility analysis,"Using a decision-analytic model, we evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individuals with cirrhosis. Separate cohorts with cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were simulated. Results were also combined to approximate a mixed aetiology population. Comparisons were made between a variety of surveillance algorithms using alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) assay and/or ultrasound at 6- and 12-monthly intervals. Parameter estimates were obtained from comprehensive literature reviews. Uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the mixed aetiology cohort, 6-monthly AFP+ultrasound was predicted to be the most effective strategy. The model estimates that, compared with no surveillance, this strategy may triple the number of people with operable tumours at diagnosis and almost halve the number of people who die from HCC. The cheapest strategy employed triage with annual AFP (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): 20,700 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 pounds per QALY the most cost-effective strategy used triage with 6-monthly AFP (ICER: 27,600 pounds per QALY gained). The addition of ultrasound to this strategy increased the ICER to 60,100 pounds per QALY gained. Surveillance appears most cost-effective in individuals with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, potentially due to younger age at diagnosis of cirrhosis. Our results suggest that, in a UK NHS context, surveillance of individuals with cirrhosis for HCC should be considered effective and cost-effective. The economic efficiency of different surveillance strategies is predicted to vary markedly according to cirrhosis aetiology.",2008-01-03867,18382459,Br J Cancer,J Thompson Coon,2008,98 / 7,1166-75,No,18382459,"J Thompson Coon; G Rogers; P Hewson; D Wright; R Anderson; S Jackson; S Ryder; M Cramp; K Stein; Surveillance of cirrhosis for hepatocellular carcinoma: a cost-utility analysis, Br J Cancer, 2008-Apr-08; 98(7):0007-0920; 1166-75",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual alpha foetoprotein triage surveillance vs. No surveilllance,Not Stated,70 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.50,3.50,20700,United Kingdom,2004,51985.64
