23501,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of a multidisciplinary health-care model for patients with type-2 diabetes implemented in the public sector in Mexico: A quasi-experimental, retrospective evaluation","OBJECTIVE: In 2007, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mexico implemented a multidisciplinary health-care model (MHC) for patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D), which has proven more effective in controlling this condition than the conventional health-care model (CHC). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of the MHC vs. the CHC for patients with T2D using a quasi-experimental, retrospective design. Epidemiologic and cost data were obtained from a randomly selected sample of health-care units, using medical records as well as patient- and facility-level data. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of the MHC at one, 10 and 20 years using a simulation model. RESULTS: The average cumulative costs per patient at 20 years were US$4,225 for the MHC and US$4,399 for the CHC. With a willingness to pay one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (US$8,910), the incremental net benefits per patient were US$1,450 and US$3,737 at 10 and 20 years, respectively. The MHC was cost-effective from the third year onward; however, increasing coverage to 500 patients per year rendered it cost-effective at year one. CONCLUSIONS: The MHC is cost-effective at 10 and 20 years. Cost-effectiveness can be achieved in the short term by increasing MHC coverage. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

23504,Timing of parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism with end-stage renal disease: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism associated with end-stage renal disease is characterized by progression from secondary hyperparathyroidism to an autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone that leads to adverse health outcomes. Rates of parathyroidectomy (PTX) have decreased with the use of calcimimetics. Optimal timing of PTX in relation to kidney transplant remains controversial. We aimed to identify the most cost-effective strategy for patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism undergoing kidney transplant. METHODS: We constructed a patient level state transition microsimulation to compare 3 management schemes: cinacalcet with kidney transplant, cinacalcet with PTX before kidney transplant, or cinacalcet with PTX after kidney transplant. Our base case was a 55-year-old on dialysis with tertiary hyperparathyroidism awaiting kidney transplant. Outcomes, including quality-adjusted life years, surgical complications, and mortality, were extracted from the literature, and costs were estimated using Medicare reimbursement data. RESULTS: Our base case analysis demonstrated that cinacalcet with PTX before kidney transplant was dominant, with a lesser cost of $399,287 and greater quality-adjusted life years of 10.3 vs $497,813 for cinacalcet with PTX after kidney transplant (quality-adjusted life years 9.4) and $643,929 for cinacalcet with kidney transplant (quality-adjusted life years 7.4). CONCLUSION: Cinacalcet alone with kidney transplant is the least cost-effective strategy. Patients with end-stage renal disease-related tertiary hyperparathyroidism should be referred for PTX, and it is most cost-effective if performed prior to kidney transplant.

23507,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of a patient visit support system for blindness reduction in Japanese patients with glaucoma,"Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness (CE) and budget impact (BI) of introducing a patient visit support system (ACT Pack R) along with standard of care (SoC), in glaucoma treatment in Japan. Methods: A Markov model was designed to estimate the CE and BI of introducing the support system from Japanese payer and governmental perspective, respectively. Inputted data for CE and BI analysis were referred from published literature and based on medical specialists'' inputs. Base case scenario for CE considered the support system cost of 30,000 yen per patient per year and a time horizon of 45 years. BI analysis compared the financial impact due to introduction of support system with SoC compared to SoC alone scenario on Japanese healthcare system with a time horizon of 20 years. Results: The base case of CE analysis showed the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with the support system was 3,241,729 yen/QALY (29,470 USD/QALY). The sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of this support system being cost-effective at a threshold of 5 million yen/QALY (45,455 USD/QALY) was 53.26%. Blindness reduction after introduction of this support system was 8.68%. The BI analysis showed that the introduction of support system will lead to a cumulative cost savings of 1,132 billion yen (10 billion US dollars) for Japanese healthcare system over 20 years of time horizon.

23512,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of infliximab and its biosimilar in patients with refractory moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease using real world evidence in Thailand,"Aims: This study aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of infliximab and its biosimilar compared to conventional therapy in refractory moderate-to-severe Crohn''s disease (CD) in Thailand. Materials and Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits of infliximab from a societal perspective. Our analyses consisted of three choices of treatment (conventional therapy, infliximab originator, and biosimilar) and three treatment scenarios (infliximab 2 years and 3 years if relapse, infliximab 2 years and lifelong if relapse, and infliximab lifelong). The input parameters were obtained from the CD registry and systematic literature reviews. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. Threshold sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the optimal drug prices. Finally, budget impact analyses were conducted. Results: None of the scenarios were cost-effective at Thai willingness-to-pay threshold (4,706 USD/QALY gained). The lowest ICER of 30,121 USD/QALY gained was reported in the scenario that included only standard dose of infliximab biosimilar with the maximum of 5-year treatment. The drug prices need to be reduced by at least 72% to allow infliximab biosimilar to be cost-effective. The 5-year budget impact was only 695,958 USD for the current biosimilar price. Conclusions: Infliximab for the treatment of refractory moderate-to-severe CD in Thailand would be cost-effective if the drug prices were significantly decreased. The best value for money strategy was infliximab biosimilar with a restricted duration of treatment.

Materials and Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits of infliximab from a societal perspective. Our analyses consisted of three choices of treatment (conventional therapy, infliximab originator, and biosimilar) and three treatment scenarios (infliximab 2 years and 3 years if relapse, infliximab 2 years and lifelong if relapse, and infliximab lifelong). The input parameters were obtained from the CD registry and systematic literature reviews. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. Threshold sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the optimal drug prices. Finally, budget impact analyses were conducted. Results: None of the scenarios were cost-effective at Thai willingness-to-pay threshold (4,706 USD/QALY gained). The lowest ICER of 30,121 USD/QALY gained was reported in the scenario that included only standard dose of infliximab biosimilar with the maximum of 5-year treatment. The drug prices need to be reduced by at least 72% to allow infliximab biosimilar to be cost-effective. The 5-year budget impact was only 695,958 USD for the current biosimilar price. Conclusions: Infliximab for the treatment of refractory moderate-to-severe CD in Thailand would be cost-effective if the drug prices were significantly decreased.

23516,Cost-Effectiveness of Cannabidiol Adjunct Therapy versus Usual Care for the Treatment of Seizures in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a novel therapy for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a rare, treatment-refractory epileptic encephalopathy. Two pivotal trials found CBD 20 mg/kg/day conferred a reduction from baseline in median drop seizure frequency of 44% and 42%, respectively, compared with 22% and 17%, respectively, in the usual care arms. No economic evaluations have been published to date. This analysis assessed the cost effectiveness of CBD adjunct therapy compared with usual care alone in LGS from the US payer perspective. METHODS: We developed a lifetime horizon Markov decision analytic model. Efficacy, healthcare costs (2020 US$), and health state utilities were ascertained from published clinical trials, retrospective analyses, and time trade-off interviews conducted in the UK, respectively. Fifteen-year-old patients entering the model transitioned to states representing a percentage reduction in drop seizure frequency from baseline, where they remained until reverting back to baseline drop seizure frequency, or death. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate parameter uncertainty, and scenario analyses investigated the impact of various assumptions. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Compared with usual care alone, CBD yielded 0.7 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and $314,900 additional healthcare expenditure, resulting in $451,800 per QALY. Uncertainty in health state utilities were the largest contributor to uncertainty in the results. Results from the 5000-simulation probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0% chance of CBD being cost effective at a $150,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, with a 95% credible range for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $325,300-$690,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: CBD does not appear to be a cost-effective therapeutic option in LGS patients at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY.",2020-01-33295,0,Pharmacoeconomics,EE Neuberger,2020,/,,Yes,Not Stated,"EE Neuberger; JJ Carlson; DL Veenstra; Cost-Effectiveness of Cannabidiol Adjunct Therapy versus Usual Care for the Treatment of Seizures in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, Pharmacoeconomics, 2020; ():1179-2027",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,cannabidiol vs. Standard/Usual Care- one to five concomitant antiepileptic drugs,"treatment refractory drop seizures, on one to five concomitant antiepileptic drugs",15 Years,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,451800,United States,2020,451800
23517,Cost-effectiveness of routine calcitonin screening and fine-needle aspiration biopsy in preoperative diagnosis of medullary thyroid Cancer in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: examine the cost-effectiveness of routine Calcitonin (Ctn) screening test in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov chain model was developed that compares fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) with Ctn screening vs. FNAB-only in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule with non-highly suspicious findings. Follow-up time was set as 10 years. Costs and probabilities values were obtained from literature, and National Cancer Database. Cost data is expressed in U.S$ and effectiveness is expressed in Quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated comparing both study arms. RESULTS: Routine Ctn screening was cost-effective compared to FNAB-only in all tested categories except when cutoff value of 10 pg/ml was applied. Among the tested categories, the application of universal routine Ctn screening with Ctn value > 50 pg/ml considered a positive test produced the most cost-saving scenario. The final accrued cost at the end of 10 years in the FNAB-only arm was $4238.93 with a final effectiveness of 8.717 QALY. While the final cost in the FNAB-with routine Ctn screening was $4345.04 with a final effectiveness of 8.722 QALY. ICER of routine Ctn screening compared to FNAB-only was $23278.61/QALY (<Willing-To-Pay threshold of $50,000/QALY). Based on sensitivity analyses, Ctn testing is cost-effective if the test cost is less than $236.03. CONCLUSIONS: Routine Ctn screening is a cost-effective strategy in US if the cost is less than $236.03. Although Ctn screening is not perfect in detecting MTC at early stages, it is a cost-effective alternative of discovering MTC after thyroid lobectomy or on follow-up of a thyroid nodule.

23520,Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab with axitinib as first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma,"Objective: Pembrolizumab/axitinib significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and increased objective response rate versus sunitinib in the phase III trial KEYNOTE-426 among previously untreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab/axitinib versus other first-line treatments of advanced RCC from a US public healthcare payer perspective. Methods: A partitioned survival model with three states (progression-free, progressed, death) evaluated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for pembrolizumab/axitinib and other first-line regimens: sunitinib, pazopanib, and avelumab/axitinib in the overall population; and sunitinib, cabozantinib, and nivolumab/ipilimumab in the subgroup with intermediate/poor prognostic risk. Costs of treatments, adverse events, and medical resources were estimated. OS, PFS, and treatment duration were extrapolated using parametric models fitted to KEYNOTE-426 data and hazard ratios from network meta-analyses. Utilities were derived through mixed-effects regressions of KEYNOTE-426 EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Levels data. Results: In the overall population, pembrolizumab/axitinib was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $95,725/QALY versus sunitinib and $128,210/QALY versus pazopanib, and was dominant (lower cost, higher effectiveness) versus avelumab/axitinib, with incremental QALY gains of 2.73, 2.40, and 1.80 versus these therapies, respectively. In the intermediate/poor-risk subgroup, base-case ICERs for pembrolizumab/axitinib were $101,030/QALY versus sunitinib, $6,989/QALY versus cabozantinib, and $130,934/QALY versus nivolumab/ipilimumab, with incremental QALY gains of 2.62, 1.78, and 1.06 versus these therapies. Conclusions: In this economic evaluation, pembrolizumab/axitinib was associated with higher life expectancy and QALYs and, based on typical willingness-to-pay thresholds of $150,000-$180,000/QALY, was found cost-effective versus other first-line treatments for advanced RCC in the US.",2020-01-33301,0,J.

23523,Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab with axitinib as first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma,"Objective: Pembrolizumab/axitinib significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and increased objective response rate versus sunitinib in the phase III trial KEYNOTE-426 among previously untreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab/axitinib versus other first-line treatments of advanced RCC from a US public healthcare payer perspective. Methods: A partitioned survival model with three states (progression-free, progressed, death) evaluated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for pembrolizumab/axitinib and other first-line regimens: sunitinib, pazopanib, and avelumab/axitinib in the overall population; and sunitinib, cabozantinib, and nivolumab/ipilimumab in the subgroup with intermediate/poor prognostic risk. Costs of treatments, adverse events, and medical resources were estimated. OS, PFS, and treatment duration were extrapolated using parametric models fitted to KEYNOTE-426 data and hazard ratios from network meta-analyses. Utilities were derived through mixed-effects regressions of KEYNOTE-426 EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Levels data. Results: In the overall population, pembrolizumab/axitinib was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $95,725/QALY versus sunitinib and $128,210/QALY versus pazopanib, and was dominant (lower cost, higher effectiveness) versus avelumab/axitinib, with incremental QALY gains of 2.73, 2.40, and 1.80 versus these therapies, respectively. In the intermediate/poor-risk subgroup, base-case ICERs for pembrolizumab/axitinib were $101,030/QALY versus sunitinib, $6,989/QALY versus cabozantinib, and $130,934/QALY versus nivolumab/ipilimumab, with incremental QALY gains of 2.62, 1.78, and 1.06 versus these therapies. Conclusions: In this economic evaluation, pembrolizumab/axitinib was associated with higher life expectancy and QALYs and, based on typical willingness-to-pay thresholds of $150,000-$180,000/QALY, was found cost-effective versus other first-line treatments for advanced RCC in the US.",2020-01-33301,0,J.

23525,Effects of Home-Based Physical Exercise on Days at Home and Cost-Effectiveness in Pre-Frail and Frail Persons: Randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVES: Frailty increases the risks of hospitalization, institutionalization, and death. Our objective was to study the effects of home-based physical exercise on the number of days spent at home among pre-frail and frail persons, versus usual care. In addition, utilization and costs of health care and social services, cost-effectiveness, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) were explored. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, with year-long supervised exercise for 60 minutes twice a week versus usual care. Follow-up for 24 months after randomization. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 299 home-dwelling persons in South Karelia, Finland. Main inclusion criteria: >=65 years, meeting at least 1 of the frailty phenotype criteria, Mini-Mental State Examination score >=17. METHODS: Primary outcome, days spent at home over 24 months, was calculated deducting days in inpatient care, in nursing homes, and days after death. HRQoL was assessed (15D questionnaire) at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Utilization data were retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: The participants'' mean age was 82.5 (SD 6.3), 75% were women, 61% were pre-frail and 39% frail. After 24 months, there was no difference between groups in days spent at home [incidence rate ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.09]. After 12 months, the costs per person-year were 1.60-fold in the exercise group (95% CI 1.23-1.98), and after 24 months, 1.23-fold (95% CI 0.95-1.50) versus usual care. Over 12 months, the exercise group gained 0.04 quality-adjusted life-years and maintained the baseline 15D level, while the score in the usual care group deteriorated (P for group <.001, time 0.002, interaction 0.004). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Physical exercise did not increase the number of days spent at home. Exercise prevented deterioration of HRQoL, and in the frail subgroup, all intervention costs were compensated with decreased utilization of other health care and social services over 24 months.

23526,A cost-utility analysis of increasing percutaneous coronary intervention use in elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes in six European countries,"AIMS: Percutaneous coronary intervention reduces mortality in acute coronary syndrome patients but the cost-utility of increasing its use in elderly acute coronary syndrome patients is unknown. METHODS: We assessed the efficiency of increased percutaneous coronary intervention use compared to current practice in patients aged >=75 years admitted for acute coronary syndrome in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain with a semi-Markov state transition model. In-hospital mortality reduction estimates by percutaneous coronary intervention use and costs were derived from the EUROpean Treatment & Reduction of Acute Coronary Syndromes cost analysis EU project (n = 28,600). Risk of recurrence and out-of-hospital all-cause mortality were obtained from the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database from North-Eastern Spain (n = 55,564). In-hospital mortality was modelled using stratified propensity score analysis. The 8-year acute coronary syndrome recurrence risk and out-of-hospital mortality were estimated with a multistate survival model. The scenarios analysed were to increase percutaneous coronary intervention use among patients with the highest, moderate and lowest probability of receiving percutaneous coronary intervention based on the propensity score analysis. RESULTS: France, Greece and Portugal showed similar total costs/1000 individuals (7.29-11.05 m ); while in Germany, Italy and Spain, costs were higher (13.53-22.57 m ). Incremental cost-utility ratios of providing percutaneous coronary intervention to all patients ranged from 2262.8 /quality adjusted life year gained for German males to 6324.3 /quality adjusted life year gained for Italian females. Increasing percutaneous coronary intervention use was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 10,000 /quality adjusted life year gained for all scenarios in the six countries, in males and females. CONCLUSION: Compared to current clinical practice, broadening percutaneous coronary intervention use in elderly acute coronary syndrome patients would be cost-effective across different healthcare systems in Europe, regardless of the selected strategy.",2020-01-33304,0,Breast Cancer Res.

METHODS: We assessed the efficiency of increased percutaneous coronary intervention use compared to current practice in patients aged >=75 years admitted for acute coronary syndrome in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain with a semi-Markov state transition model. In-hospital mortality reduction estimates by percutaneous coronary intervention use and costs were derived from the EUROpean Treatment & Reduction of Acute Coronary Syndromes cost analysis EU project (n = 28,600). Risk of recurrence and out-of-hospital all-cause mortality were obtained from the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database from North-Eastern Spain (n = 55,564). In-hospital mortality was modelled using stratified propensity score analysis. The 8-year acute coronary syndrome recurrence risk and out-of-hospital mortality were estimated with a multistate survival model. The scenarios analysed were to increase percutaneous coronary intervention use among patients with the highest, moderate and lowest probability of receiving percutaneous coronary intervention based on the propensity score analysis.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the hospitals'' perspective within a multicentre randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessors and intention-to-treat analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and forty-one adults awaiting elective upper abdominal surgery attending pre-anaesthetic clinics at three public hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental group received an information booklet and a 30-minute face-to-face session, involving respiratory education and breathing exercise training, with a physiotherapist. The control group received the information booklet only. OUTCOME MEASURES: The probability of cost-effectiveness and incremental net benefits was estimated using bootstrapped incremental PPC and QALY cost-effectiveness ratios plotted on cost-effectiveness planes and associated probability curves through a range of willingness-to-pay amounts. Cost-effectiveness modelling utilised 21-day postoperative hospital cost audit data and QALYs estimated from Short Form-Six Domain health utilities and mortality to 12 months. RESULTS: Preoperative physiotherapy had 95% probability of being cost-effective with an incremental net benefit to participating hospitals of A$4,958 (95% CI 10 to 9,197) for each PPC prevented, given that the hospitals were willing to pay $45,000 to provide the service. Cost-utility for QALY gains was less certain. Sensitivity analyses strengthened cost-effectiveness findings. Improved cost-effectiveness and QALY gains were detected when experienced physiotherapists delivered the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative physiotherapy aimed at preventing PPCs was highly likely to be cost-effective from the hospitals'' perspective. For each PPC prevented, preoperative physiotherapy is likely to cost the hospitals less than the costs estimated to treat a PPC after surgery. Potential QALY gains require confirmation.

METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of active monitoring, surgery, and radiotherapy was evaluated within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) randomised controlled trial from a UK NHS perspective at 10 years'' median follow-up. Prostate cancer resource-use collected from hospital records and trial participants was valued using UK reference-costs. QALYs (quality-adjusted-life-years) were calculated from patient-reported EQ-5D-3L measurements. Adjusted mean costs, QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated; cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty; subgroup analyses considered age and disease-risk. RESULTS: Adjusted mean QALYs were similar between groups: 6.89 (active monitoring), 7.09 (radiotherapy), and 6.91 (surgery). Active monitoring had lower adjusted mean costs (5913) than radiotherapy (7361) and surgery (7519). Radiotherapy was the most likely (58% probability) cost-effective option at the UK NICE willingness-to-pay threshold (20,000 per QALY).

23579,Long-term Cost-Effectiveness of Dexcom G6 Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring Versus Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes in the U.K,"OBJECTIVE: A long-term health economic analysis was performed to establish the cost-effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) (Dexcom G6) versus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) alone in U.K.-based patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The analysis used the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical input data were sourced from the DIAMOND trial in adults with T1D. Simulations were performed separately in the overall population of patients with baseline HbA1c >=7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and a secondary analysis was performed in patients with baseline HbA1c >=8.5% (69 mmol/mol). The analysis was performed from the National Health Service healthcare payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon. RESULTS: In the overall population, G6 RT-CGM was associated with a mean incremental gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.49 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus SMBG (mean [SD] 11.47 [2.04] QALYs versus 9.99 [1.84] QALYs). Total mean (SD) lifetime costs were also pounds sterling (GBP) 14,234 higher with RT-CGM (GBP 102,468 [35,681] versus GBP 88,234 [39,027]) resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 9,558 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the findings were sensitive to changes in the quality-of-life benefit associated with reduced fear of hypoglycemia and avoidance of fingerstick testing as well as the HbA1c benefit associated with RT-CGM use. CONCLUSIONS: For U.K.-based T1D patients, the G6 RT-CGM device is associated with significant improvements in clinical outcomes and, over patient lifetimes, is a cost-effective disease management option relative to SMBG on the basis of a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP 20,000 per QALY gained.

23581,Cost-effectiveness of a preventive self-care health management program for community-dwelling older adults: a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a preventive self-care health management program for community-dwelling older adults as compared to usual care. DESIGN/INTERVENTION: A cost-effectiveness analysis was executed alongside a randomised controlled trial. Nurse case managers provided interventions, including holistic assessment, empowerment of self-care, preventive health behaviours and self-efficacy with co-produced care planning, supported by nursing students. The control group received social control calls. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 271) or control (n = 269) group. The intervention was conducted in collaboration with 11 community centres under four non-government organisations in various districts of Hong Kong. MEASUREMENTS: Cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were collected pre (baseline, 0 months) and post intervention (3 months) and 3 months after completion of the program (6 months). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the groups were calculated, dividing the difference in cost by the difference in QALYs. RESULTS: Analysis showed that the net incremental QALY gain was 0.0014 (3 months) and 0.0033 (6 months) when the intervention group was compared to the control group. The probability of being cost-effective at 6 months was 53.2% and 53.4%, based on the cost-effectiveness thresholds recommended by both the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ($200,000/QALYs) and the World Health Organization (Hong Kong gross domestic product/capita, HK$381,780). CONCLUSIONS: The results provide some evidence to suggest that the addition of a home-based, preventive self-care health management program may have effects on cost outcomes for community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong.

23583,"Clinical Benefits, Harms, and Cost-Effectiveness of Breast Cancer Screening for Survivors of Childhood Cancer Treated With Chest Radiation: A Comparative Modeling Study","BACKGROUND: Surveillance with annual mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for female survivors of childhood cancer treated with chest radiation, yet benefits, harms, and costs are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening strategies in childhood cancer survivors. DESIGN: Collaborative simulation modeling using 2 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network breast cancer models. DATA SOURCES: Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and published data. TARGET POPULATION: Women aged 20 years with a history of chest radiotherapy. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Payer. INTERVENTION: Annual MRI with or without mammography, starting at age 25, 30, or 35 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer deaths averted, false-positive screening results, benign biopsy results, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Lifetime breast cancer mortality risk without screening was 10% to 11% across models. Compared with no screening, starting at age 25 years, annual mammography with MRI averted the most deaths (56% to 71%) and annual MRI (without mammography) averted 56% to 62%. Both strategies had the most screening tests, false-positive screening results, and benign biopsy results. For an ICER threshold of less than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, screening beginning at age 30 years was preferred. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Assuming lower screening performance, the benefit of adding mammography to MRI increased in both models, although the conclusions about preferred starting age remained unchanged. LIMITATION: Elevated breast cancer risk was based on survivors diagnosed with childhood cancer between 1970 and 1986. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation (at ages 25 to 30 years) of annual breast cancer screening with MRI, with or without mammography, might reduce breast cancer mortality by half or more in survivors of childhood cancer.

23594,Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility and cost-effectiveness (TRIAL-STIM)? a randomised controlled trial,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Although a temporary SCS screening trial is widely used to determine whether a patient should receive permanent SCS implant, its evidence base is limited. We aimed to establish the clinical utility, diagnostic accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of an SCS screening trial. A multicentre single-blind, parallel two-group randomised controlled superiority trial was undertaken at three centres in United Kingdom. Patients were randomised 1:1 to either SCS screening trial strategy (TG) or no trial screening strategy (NTG). Treatment was open label, but outcome assessors were masked. The primary outcome measure was numerical rating scale (NRS) pain at six-months follow-up. Between June 2017 and September 2018, 105 participants were enrolled and randomised (TG=54, NTG=51). Mean NRS pain decreased from 7.47 at baseline (before SCS implantation) to 4.28 at 6-months in TG and from 7.54 to 4.49 in NTG (mean group difference: 0.2, 95% CI: -1.2 to 0.9, p=0.89). We found no difference between TG and NTG in the proportion of pain responders or other secondary outcomes. SCS screening trial had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 78 to 100) and specificity of 8% (95% CI: 1 to 25). The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of TG versus NTG was 78,895 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In conclusion, although the SCS screening trial may have some diagnostic utility, there was no evidence that an SCS screening trial strategy provides superior patient outcomes or is cost-effective compared to a no trial screening approach.",2020-01-33322,0,Curr.

23596,The cost-effectiveness of prostate health index for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men,"BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate health index (PHI) have been used as biomarkers for prostate cancer detection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PHI for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men. METHOD: We developed a Markov model for Chinese male patient aged 50-75 years old. The PSA strategy was to offer TRUS-PB for all patients with elevated PSA of 4-10 ng/mL. The PHI strategy was to offer PHI for patients with elevated PSA of 4-10 ng/mL. TRUS-PB would only be offered for patients with PHI >35.0. Model inputs were extracted from local data when available. The cost per quality-adjusted life years gained for both strategies were calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in relation to the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold were compared. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were also constructed. RESULTS: With a Markov model of 25 screening cycles from age 50 to 75 years, the mean total costs per man were estimated to be USD 27,439 in the PSA strategy and USD 22,877 in the PHI strategy. The estimated effects were estimated to be 15.70 in the PSA strategy and 16.05 in the PHI strategy. The PHI strategy was associated with an expected decrease in cost of USD 4562 and an expected gain of 0.35 QALY, resulting in an ICER of USD -13056.56. The results were shown to be robust upon one-way sensitivity analysis. Upon Monte Carlo simulation, the PHI strategy was more cost-effective for 100% of the iterations. The PHI strategy demonstrated dominance over the PSA strategy regardless of what WTP threshold we use. CONCLUSIONS: A PHI-based screening strategy may be more cost-effective than a PSA-based strategy for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men. These results support consideration of a PHI-based approach for prostate cancer in Hong Kong.",2020-01-33324,0,Health Qual.

23597,Economic analysis of Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence: a UK-based cost-utility analysis,"Background: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a debilitating and highly prevalent condition in the UK. The condition is associated with a significant economic burden for affected patients and society. Current treatment options for SUI include minimally invasive therapies, medication and surgical intervention for the most serious cases. Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology is a recently developed device for the treatment of SUI that relies on neuromuscular external electrical stimulation (NEES) technology. The clinical efficacy of the device has been proven in previous studies, but existing evidence surrounding its economic viability is limited. Objectives: To assess the cost-utility of the Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology Therapy device for the treatment of SUI amongst women in a UK setting. Methods: An economic model was developed to consider the cost-utility (cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) of Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology compared with current practice. A Markov model was developed, with costs and health effects estimated over the lifetime of the patient in the base-case analysis. The model was developed to reflect the treatment pathways typically followed by patients with SUI in the UK. Parameter uncertainty was explored in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Base-case results indicate that Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology results in cost savings and QALY gains over the patient''s lifetime. In the ""cure"" analysis, the intervention is 250 less costly and leads to a 0.03 QALY gain per patient, while in the ""improvement analysis"", the intervention is 327 less costly and leads to a 0.13 QALY gain per patient. Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analyses show that the likelihood of Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology being cost-effective is greater than 74% across all willingness-to-pay thresholds in the two analyses presented. Conclusions: Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology is a potentially cost-effective treatment option for patients with SUI who have failed first-line treatment. It could reduce costs to the health care service and improve quality-of-life for selected patients over their lifetime.",2020-01-33327,0,Injury Prev.,M Javanbakht,2020,/,1-12,No,Not Stated,"M Javanbakht; A Mashayekhi; A Monga; J Atkinson; M Branagan-Harris; Economic analysis of Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence: a UK-based cost-utility analysis, Injury Prev., 2020; ():1369-6998; 1-12",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Medical Device,"innovo non-invasive pelvic floor exerciser vs. Standard/Usual Care- lifestyle changes, kegel exercises and pelvic floor muscles training",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-8333.33,United Kingdom,2018,-11477.07
23598,Wide Area Transepithelial Sampling with Computer-Assisted Analysis (WATS3D) Is Cost-Effective in Barrett's Esophagus Screening,"BACKGROUND: Wide area transepithelial sampling with three-dimensional computer-assisted analysis (WATS3D) is an adjunct to the standard random 4-quadrant forceps biopsies (FB, ""Seattle protocol"") that significantly increases the detection of Barrett''s esophagus (BE) and associated neoplasia in patients undergoing screening or surveillance. AIMS: To examine the cost-effectiveness of adding WATS3D to the Seattle protocol in screening patients for BE. METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two alternative BE screening strategies in chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease patients: FB with and without WATS3D. The reference case was a 60-year-old white male with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Effectiveness was measured by the number needed to screen to avert one cancer and one cancer-related death, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost was measured in 2019 US$, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured in $/QALY using thresholds for cost-effectiveness of $100,000/QALY and $150,000/QALY. Cost was measured in 2019 US$. Cost and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Between 320 and 337 people would need to be screened with WATS3D in addition to FB to avert one additional cancer, and 328-367 people to avert one cancer-related death. Screening with WATS3D costs an additional $1219 and produced an additional 0.017 QALYs, for an ICER of $71,395/QALY. All one-way sensitivity analyses resulted in ICERs under $84,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for BE in 60-year-old white male GERD patients is more cost-effective when WATS3D is used adjunctively to the Seattle protocol than with the Seattle protocol alone.",2020-01-33329,0,Cancer Prev.

23599,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy compared with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in previously untreated adults who have a high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score of 50% or greater in Singapore. Materials and methods: A partitioned-survival analysis model was developed from a healthcare system''s perspective that extrapolated clinical and economic outcomes of first-line pembrolizumab (maximum treatment duration of 2 years) versus platinum doublet chemotherapy over a 10-year time horizon for patients with advanced NSCLC. The model consisted of three health states: alive with no progression, alive with progression, and dead. Key clinical inputs were based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves from the interim (median follow-up = 11.2 months) and updated analysis (median follow-up = 25.2 months) of the KEYNOTE-024 randomized controlled trial. Local cost data were applied. Utilities were derived from published international estimates. Both one-way and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to identify key drivers of the results. Results: Using the results from the updated analysis of KEYNOTE-024, patients treated with pembrolizumab experienced more quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), but incurred higher costs compared to chemotherapy over a 10-year time horizon (pembrolizumab: 1.9983 QALYs, SGD215,761; chemotherapy: 1.1317 QALYs, SGD70,444). The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was SGD167,692 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to the cost of pembrolizumab, followed by the time horizon. Multivariate PSA indicated that pembrolizumab had 0% probability of being cost-effective at a hypothetical willingness-to-pay threshold of SGD100,000 per QALY gained. Conclusion: While pembrolizumab is superior to standard chemotherapy in improving overall survival and progression-free survival, results suggest that it is unlikely to be cost-effective at its current price in Singapore. Factors including clinical effectiveness, safety, and budget impact should also be considered when making national funding decisions.",2020-01-33331,0,Injury Prev.,MIA Aziz,2020,/,1-9,No,Not Stated,"MIA Aziz; LE Tan; WHG Tan; CK Toh; LPY Loke; F Pearce; K Ng; Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, Injury Prev., 2020; ():1369-6998; 1-9",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,pembrolizumab monotherapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- platinum doublet chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,167692,Singapore,2017,128329.74
23600,Cost and cost-effectiveness of a simplified treatment model with direct-acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C in Cambodia,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In 2016, Medecins Sans Frontieres established the first general population Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and treatment site in Cambodia, offering free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. This study analysed the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. METHODS: Costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of the intervention were projected with a Markov model over a lifetime horizon, discounted at 3%/year. Patient-level resource-use and outcome data, treatment costs, costs of HCV-related healthcare and EQ-5D-5L health states were collected from an observational cohort study evaluating the effectiveness of DAA treatment under full and simplified models of care compared to no treatment; other model parameters were derived from literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost/QALY gained) were compared to an opportunity cost-based willingness-to-pay threshold for Cambodia ($248/QALY). RESULTS: The total cost of testing and treatment per patient for the full model of care was $925(IQR $668-1631), reducing to $376(IQR $344-422) for the simplified model of care. EQ-5D-5L values varied by fibrosis stage: decompensated cirrhosis had the lowest value, values increased during and following treatment. The simplified model of care was cost saving compared to no treatment, while the full model of care, although cost-effective compared to no treatment ($187/QALY), cost an additional $14 485/QALY compared to the simplified model, above the willingness-to-pay threshold for Cambodia. This result is robust to variation in parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The simplified model of care was cost saving compared to no treatment, emphasizing the importance of simplifying pathways of care for improving access to HCV treatment in low-resource settings.
