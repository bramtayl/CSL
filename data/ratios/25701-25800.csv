25701,Cost-effectiveness of current and optimal treatment for schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND: This paper is part of a project to identify the proportion of the burden of each mental disorder averted by current and optimal interventions, and the cost-effectiveness of both. AIMS: To use epidemiological data on schizophrenia to model the cost-effectiveness of current and optimal treatment. METHOD: Calculate the burden of schizophrenia in the years lived with disability (YLD) component of disability-adjusted life-years lost, the proportion averted by current interventions, the proportion that could be averted by optimal treatment and the cost-effectiveness of both. RESULTS: Current interventions avert some 13% of the burden, whereas 22% could be averted by optimal treatment. Current interventions cost about AUS 200,000 dollars per YLD averted, whereas optimal treatment at a similar cost could increase the number of YLDs averted by two-thirds. Even so, the majority of the burden of schizophrenia remains unavertable.

25703,Is antenatal syphilis screening still cost effective in sub-Saharan Africa,"To estimate the cost effectiveness of on-site antenatal syphilis screening and treatment in Mwanza, Tanzania. To compare this intervention with other antenatal and child health interventions, specifically the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT).The economic costs of adding the intervention to routine antenatal care were assessed. Cost effectiveness (CE) ratios of the intervention were obtained for low birth weight (LBW) live births and stillbirths averted and cost per DALY saved. Cost per DALY saved was also estimated for previous CE studies of syphilis screening. The CE of the intervention at different syphilis prevalence rates was modelled.The economic cost of the intervention is $1.44 per woman screened, $20 per woman treated, and $187 per adverse birth outcome averted. The cost per DALY saved is $110 with LBW as the only adverse outcome. When including stillbirth, this estimate improves 10-fold to $10.56 per DALY saved. The cost per DALY saved from all syphilis screening studies ranged from $3.97 to $18.73.Syphilis screening is shown to be at least as cost effective as PMTCT and more cost effective than many widely implemented interventions. There is urgent need for scaling up syphilis screening and treatment in high prevalence areas. The CE of screening interventions is highly dependent on disease prevalence. In combination, PMTCT and syphilis screening and treatment interventions may achieve economies of scope and thus improved efficiency.",2003-01-0436,14573832,Sex Transm Infect,F Terris-Prestholt,2003,79 / 5,375-81,No,14573832,"F Terris-Prestholt; D Watson-Jones; K Mugeye; L Kumaranayake; L Ndeki; H Weiss; J Changalucha; J Todd; F Lisekie; B Gumodoka; D Mabey; R Hayes; Andrew J.

25704,Economic evaluation of zinc and copper use in treating acute diarrhea in children: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effects of zinc and copper in reducing diarrheal morbidity have important cost implications. This health services research study evaluated the cost of treating a child with acute diarrhea in the hospital, the impact of micronutrient supplementation on the mean predicted costs and its cost-effectiveness as compared to using only standard oral rehydration solution (ORS), from the patient""s and government""s (providers) perspective. METHODS: Children aged 6 months to 59 months with acute diarrhea were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or control. The intervention was a daily dose of 40 mg of zinc sulfate and 5 mg of copper sulfate powder dissolved in a liter of standard ORS (n = 102). The control was 50 mg of standard ORS powder dissolved in a liter of standard ORS (n = 98). The cost measures were the total mean cost of treating acute diarrhea, which included the direct medical, the direct non-medical and the indirect costs. The effectiveness measures were the probability of diarrhea lasting leq; 4 days, the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality. RESULTS: The mean total cost of treating a child with acute diarrhea was US $14 of which the government incurred an expenditure of 66%. The factors that increased the total were the number of stools before admission (p = 0.01), fever (p = 0.01), increasing grade of dehydration (p = 0.00), use of antibiotics (p = 0.00), use of intra-venous fluids (p = 0.00), hours taken to rehydrate a child (p = 0.00), the amount of oral rehydration fluid used (p = 0.00), presence of any complications (p = 0.00) and the hospital stay (p = 0.00). The supplemented group had a 8% lower cost of treating acute diarrhea, their cost per unit health (diarrhea lasting leq; 4 days) was 24% less and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated cost savings (in Rupees) with the intervention [-452; 95%CI (-11306, 3410)]. However these differences failed to reach conventional levels of significance. CONCLUSION: An emphasis on the costs and economic benefits of an alternative therapy is an important aspect of health services research. The cost savings and the attractive cost-effectiveness indicates the need to further assess the role of micronutrients such as zinc and copper in the treatment of acute diarrhea in a larger and more varied population.",2003-99-00584,14498987,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Archana Patel,2003,1 / 1,7,Yes,14498987,"Archana Patel; Leena Dhande; Manwar Rawat; Economic evaluation of zinc and copper use in treating acute diarrhea in children: A randomized controlled trial, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2003-Aug-29; 1(1):1478-7547; 7",DALY,India,Not Stated,Other,Zinc and copper supplementation added to standard oral rehydration solution vs. Standard/Usual Care- oral rehydration solution (ORS) (1 liter),Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,12.00,5.00,-400,India,1996,-19.27
25705,"Cost-effectiveness of routine immunization to control Japanese encephalitis in Shanghai, China","OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of inactivated and live attenuated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines given to infants and children in Shanghai. METHODS: A decision-analytical model was constructed in order to compare costs and outcomes for three hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 children followed from birth in 1997 to the age of 30 years who received either no JE vaccine, inactivated JE vaccine (P3), or live attenuated JE vaccine (SA 14-14-2). Cumulative incidences of JE from birth to 30 years of age in the pre-immunization era, i.e. before 1968, were used to estimate expected rates of JE in the absence of vaccination. The economic consequences were measured as cost per case, per death, and per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for the two JE immunization programmes. FINDINGS: In comparison with no JE immunization, a programme using the P3 vaccine would prevent 420 JE cases and 105 JE deaths and would save 6456 DALYs per 100,000 persons; the use of the SA 14-14-2 vaccine would prevent 427 cases and 107 deaths and would save 6556 DALYs per 100,000 persons. Both kinds of immunization were cost saving but the SA 14-14-2 vaccine strategy resulted in a saving that was 47% greater (512,456 US dollars) than that obtained with the P3 vaccine strategy (348,246 US dollars).

25707,The cost-effectiveness of policies for the safe and appropriate use of injection in healthcare settings,"OBJECTIVE: Poor injection practices transmit potentially life-threatening pathogens. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of policies for the safe and appropriate use of injections in ten epidemiological subregions of the world in terms of cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. METHODS: The incidence of injection-associated hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections was modelled for a year 2000 cohort over a 30-year time horizon. The consequences of a ""do nothing"" scenario were compared with a set of hypothetical scenarios that incorporated the health gains of effective interventions. Resources needed to implement effective interventions were costed for each subregion and expressed in international dollars (I dollars). FINDINGS: Worldwide, the reuse of injection equipment in the year 2000 accounted for 32%, 40%, and 5% of new HBV, HCV and HIV infections, respectively, leading to a burden of 9.18 million DALYs between 2000 and 2030. Interventions implemented in the year 2000 for the safe (provision of single-use syringes, assumed effectiveness 95%) and appropriate (patients-providers interactional group discussions, assumed effectiveness 30%) use of injections could reduce the burden of injection-associated infections by as much as 96.5% (8.86 million DALYs) for an average yearly cost of 905 million I dollars (average cost per DALY averted, 102; range by region, 14-2293). Attributable fractions and the number of syringes and needles required represented the key sources of uncertainty.

We modelled the cost-effectiveness of policies for the safe and appropriate use of injections in ten epidemiological subregions of the world in terms of cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted.

FINDINGS: Worldwide, the reuse of injection equipment in the year 2000 accounted for 32%, 40%, and 5% of new HBV, HCV and HIV infections, respectively, leading to a burden of 9.18 million DALYs between 2000 and 2030.

25733,A cost effective small hospital in Bangladesh: what it can mean for emergency obstetric care,"Mortality has improved dramatically in most of South Asia as a consequence of modest economic improvement, better nutrition and a combination of health education, immunization, family planning and home treatment of certain common diseases, especially diarrhea and respiratory infections. However, death rates are still much higher than in parts of the world with fully developed health services and residual mortality is largely due to conditions which require very basic hospital services such as surgery for complications of pregnancy, infections and trauma, transfusion, intravenous fluids, oxygen and intensive antibiotics. All of these can be made available in very simple and unsophisticated hospital facilities. It has generally been assumed that the cost of such facilities would be high, and cost effectiveness much less than that of preventive, educational and home care programs. In 1995, our 50 bed hospital in rural Bangladesh had a cost per patient-day of 525 Bangladesh Takas (US dollars 13.15) and a cost per capita for the population served of 25 Takas (US dollars 0.62) per year. Every month 180 patients were admitted, one-third with clearly life-threatening or disabling conditions which could be successfully treated in such a facility. We adapted the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) method of cost effectiveness analysis to calculate the DALYs (years of disability-free life) preserved for individual patients during a 3-month period, using what we considered to be very conservative estimates of the threat to life and the efficacy of treatment. The total cost of all hospital activities over the 3 months was divided by the sum of the DALYS for those patients who were successfully treated for clearly life threatening or disabling conditions, to give a cost per DALY of 437 Takas (US dollars 10.93). This compares favorably with estimates by others of a cost per DALY of US dollars 30 for measles immunization, 20 for acute lower respiratory infection detection and home treatment, or 2 for tetanus immunization of pregnant women. Sixty-two percent of the DALYS saved came from emergency obstetric care (EmOC) related activities. We conclude that cost effective basic hospital service can be added to immunization, family planning and other basic health services now available in countries like Bangladesh with a very low increase in total cost and that the benefits which would accrue, particularly for maternal and perinatal mortality, would be great.",2003-99-00734,12676406,Int J Gynaecol Obstet,C McCord,2003,81 / 1,83-92,No,12676406,"C McCord; Q Chowdhury; A cost effective small hospital in Bangladesh: what it can mean for emergency obstetric care, Int J Gynaecol Obstet, 2003-Apr; 81(1):0020-7292; 83-92",DALY,Bangladesh,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical, Surgical",All hospital activities related to treatment for potentially life threatening diseases vs. None,all patients admitted to a rural hospital,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,10.93,United States,1995,18.56
25734,Colorectal cancer screening in Australia: an economic evaluation of a potential biennial screening program using faecal occult blood tests,"To evaluate whether the introduction of a national, co-ordinated screening program using the faecal occult blood test represents 'value-for-money' from the perspective of the Australian Government as third-party funder.The annual equivalent costs and consequences of a biennial screening program in 'steady-state' operation were estimated for the Australian population using 1996 as the reference year. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the years of life lost (YLLs) averted, and the health service costs were modelled, based on the epidemiology and the costs of colorectal cancer in Australia together with the mortality reduction achieved in randomised controlled trials. Uncertainty in the model was examined using Monte Carlo simulation methods.We estimate a minimum or 'base program' of screening those aged 55 to 69 years could avert 250 deaths per annum (95% uncertainty interval 99-400), at a gross cost of dollarsA55 million (95% UI dollarsA46 million to dollarsA96 million) and a gross incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dollarsA17,000/DALY (95% UI dollarsA13,000/DALY to dollarsA52,000/DALY). Extending the program to include 70 to 74-year-olds is a more effective option (cheaper and higher health gain) than including the 50 to 54-year-olds.The findings of this study support the case for a national program directed at the 55 to 69-year-old age group with extension to 70 to 74-year-olds if there are sufficient resources.

This study set out to estimate these costs and effects.Analyses were carried out for 12 epidemiological World Health Organization subregions of the world. A population model was used to estimate the impact of evidence-based personal and nonpersonal interventions--including brief physician advice, taxation, roadside random breath testing, restricted sales access and advertising bans. Costs were measured in international dollars (I$); population-level intervention effects were gauged in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) were computed.The most costly interventions to implement are brief advice in primary care and roadside breath testing of drivers. In populations with a high prevalence of heavy drinkers (more than 5%, such as Europe and North America), the most effective and cost-effective intervention was taxation (more than 500 DALYs averted per 1 million population; CER < I$500 per DALY averted). In populations with a lower prevalence of heavy drinking, however, taxation is estimated to be less cost effective overall than other, more targeted strategies, such as brief physician advice, roadside breath testing and advertising bans.The most efficient public health response to the burden of alcohol use depends on the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use, which is related to overall per capita consumption.

A population model was used to estimate the impact of evidence-based personal and nonpersonal interventions--including brief physician advice, taxation, roadside random breath testing, restricted sales access and advertising bans.
