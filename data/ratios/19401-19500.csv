19401,Interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis screening of solid-organ transplant recipients is cost-effective,"OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease with high mortality for solid-organ transplantation. Preventive therapy of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been considered to reduce TB risk and improve outcomes of transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs); QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold in-Tube (QFT) and T-SPOT((R)).TB (TSPOT)), for kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients in low TB incidence countries. METHODS: Decision trees and Markov models were developed for four strategies; QFT, TSPOT, the tuberculin skin test (TST) and no screening. Targeted populations were hypothetical cohorts of kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients aged 40 years using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. Per-person costs, effectiveness and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated and compared. RESULTS: QFT was the most cost-effective (Kidney; US$ 5679, 3.026 QALYs, Liver; US$ 5914, 2.365 QALYs, Lung; US$ 6092, 3.761 QALYs). No screening was the least effective. Cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to BCG vaccination rate, and the costs of screening tests and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TB screening using IGRA with individualized TB risk assessment and follow-up monitoring of drug toxicity during LTBI treatment is recommended for solid organ transplantation, on the basis of the benefits and cost-effectiveness.",2018-01-26753,30009853,J Infect,A Kowada,2018,/,,No,30009853,"A Kowada; Interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis screening of solid-organ transplant recipients is cost-effective, J Infect, 2018 Sep 1; ():1532-2742",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Immunization,QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube vs. Tuberculin skin test,non-Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated lung transplant recipients,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,10683,United States,2016,11519.99
19402,Cost-effectiveness of monitoring endoxifen levels in breast cancer patients adjuvantly treated with tamoxifen,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. Recurrence rates in breast cancer are considered to be dependent on the serum concentration of endoxifen, the active metabolite of tamoxifen. The goal of this study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of periodically monitoring serum concentrations of endoxifen in adjuvant estrogen receptor alfa (ERalpha) positive breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen in the Netherlands. METHODS: A Markov model with disease-free survival (DFS), recurrent disease (RD), and death states was constructed. The benefit of drug monitoring was modeled via a difference in the fraction of patients achieving adequate serum concentrations. Robustness of results to changes in model assumptions were tested through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Monitoring of endoxifen added 0.0115 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and saved euro 1564 per patient in the base case scenario. Deterministic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a large effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the differences in costs and utilities between the DFS and RD states. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of euro 0 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 89.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, monitoring of endoxifen in adjuvant ERalpha + breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen is likely to add QALYs and save costs from a healthcare payer perspective. We advise clinicians to consider integrating serum endoxifen concentration monitoring into standard adjuvant tamoxifen treatment of ERalpha + breast cancer patients.",2018-01-26764,30006796,Breast Cancer Res Treat,M van Nuland,2018,/,,No,30006796,"M van Nuland; R A Vreman; R M T Ten Ham; A H M de Vries Schultink; H Rosing; J H M Schellens; J H Beijnen; A M Hovels; Cost-effectiveness of monitoring endoxifen levels in breast cancer patients adjuvantly treated with tamoxifen, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2018 Jul 13; ():0167-6806",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Diagnostic,Monitoring endoxifen serum concentrations and subsequent personalized dosing of tamoxifen vs. Standard/Usual Care- No monitoring,Patients adjuvantly treated with tamoxifen,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,4.50,1.50,-136000,Euro,2017,-162271.01
19403,Cost-effectiveness of Daratumumab-based Triplet Therapies in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma,"PURPOSE: The prominent efficacy of the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) or the addition to bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) was proven previously for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, the cost-effectiveness of adding daratumumab to traditional doublet regimens versus doublet regimens alone (DRd vs Rd; DVd vs Vd) was unknown. METHODS: We developed a semi-Markov model by using a US payer perspective and 10-year time horizon to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for treatments. Clinical data were obtained from the POLLUX (Phase 3 Study Comparing DRd Versus Rd in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma [RRMM]) and CASTOR (Phase 3 Study Comparing DVd Versus Vd in Subjects with RRMM) trials. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty. FINDINGS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for DVd compared with Vd was $284,180 per QALY; the ICER for DRd compared with Rd was $1,369,062 per QALY. Only when the price of daratumumab was reduced to 37% (US $702/vial) of the current price could the addition of daratumumab to Vd be cost-effective under the US willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $50,000/QALY. However, under no discount level of the daratumumab price is the addition of daratumumab to Rd acceptable. When the WTP increased to $300,000/QALY, the addition of DVd had a 56.7% probability of being cost-effective compared with the Vd regimen. IMPLICATIONS: Due to the high price of daratumumab, neither the addition of daratumumab to Rd nor Vd proved to be cost-effective under US WTP.

19405,Economic Evaluation of the Hepatitis C Virus Treatment Extension to Early-Stage Fibrosis Patients: Evidence from the PITER Real-World Cohort,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of two planning strategies of the second-generation direct-acting antiviral interferon-free regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. METHODS: A lifetime multicohort model comprised 8125 real-life patients enrolled in the PITER (Italian platform for the study of viral hepatitis) registry, implemented by the ISS (Istituto Superiore di Sanita). Two treatment planning strategies were compared: 1) policy 1-treat all patients regardless of the stage of fibrosis (F0-F4) with second-generation direct-acting antivirals and 2) policy 2-treat patients at F3/F4 stage and those who are prioritized by the scientific guidelines first, and the remaining patients when they reach the F3 stage. Clinical outcomes and costs were evaluated by using a lifetime horizon Markov model and adopting the third-party payer perspective. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A sensitivity analysis was run to explore first- and second-order uncertainty and heterogeneity. An expected value of perfect information analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: Policy 1 exhibits an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro8,775/QALY gained and remains less than euro30,000/QALY in 94% of realizations produced by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Such a proportion increases to 97% when adopting a threshold of euro40,000/QALY gained.

19406,A cost-effectiveness analysis of reslizumab in the treatment of poorly controlled eosinophilic asthma,"INTRODUCTION: Poorly controlled severe eosinophilic asthma is difficult and costly to manage. Reslizumab, an add-on treatment for adults with severe eosinophilic asthma, reduces the number of exacerbations and improves the quality of life (QoL). The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reslizumab. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of add-on reslizumab with the standard-of-care (SOC) from the US societal perspective over a five-year time horizon. Efficacy and safety inputs for the model were based on data from two clinical trials (NCT01287039 and NCT01285323). Other model inputs, including mortality rates, costs, and utility, were estimated from literature, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). One-way, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed. Adherence, treatment response, and the placebo effect were evaluated in separate scenario analyses. RESULTS: The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $697 403 (2017 USD) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). In the PSA, reslizumab becomes cost-effective in 50% of the iterations at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $689 000. The model is most sensitive to the QoL improvement with reslizumab treatment in the one-way and threshold analyses. The response and adherence models had lower ICERs than the base model but still above $500 000. The ICER of the placebo effect model was $29 820. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in QoL and exacerbation rates with reslizumab are associated with high costs, making reslizumab unlikely to be cost-effective at the $200 000 WTP threshold.",2018-01-26780,30003833,J Asthma,Jenny Lam,2018,/,1-10,No,30003833,"Jenny Lam; Joel W Hay; Jonathan Salcedo; Nicholas J Kenyon; A cost-effectiveness analysis of reslizumab in the treatment of poorly controlled eosinophilic asthma, J Asthma, 2018 Aug 29; ():1532-4303; 1-10",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"Reslizumab add-on to standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, short-acting beta-agonists, oral corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, cromolyn sodium",Poorly controlled eosinophilic asthma,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,0.00,697403,United States,2017,736355.94
19407,Cost-effectiveness of perampanel for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) in epilepsy: A Spanish perspective,"BACKGROUND: Persistent seizures are associated with physical injury, reduced quality of life, and psychosocial impairment. Perampanel is approved for the adjunctive treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of perampanel as adjunctive therapy to other antiepileptic drugs (AED) compared with AED maintenance therapy alone for the treatment of PGTCS. METHODS: We developed a Markov model for PGTCS where transitions were based on treatment response rates. The analysis was conducted over a 33-year time horizon from the Spanish National Health Service (NHS) and societal perspectives. Efficacy data were derived from clinical studies. Resource use, market shares, costs, and utilities were obtained from Kantar Health''s National Health and Wellness Survey. Drug costs were obtained from the Consejo General de Colegios Oficiales de Farmaceuticos. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case analysis from the NHS perspective, perampanel was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro16,557/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) relative to AED maintenance therapy for the treatment of PGTCS. Incremental costs were euro5475 and incremental QALYs were 0.33. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the ICERs were strongly influenced by discounting rate for costs and health effects, with little influence of other parameters, including perampanel cost and utilities. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability of perampanel being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000/QALY was 89.3%.

19409,Cost-effectiveness of aprepitant in Japanese patients treated with cisplatin-containing highly emetogenic chemotherapy,"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains a major adverse event in cancer chemotherapy. Although aprepitant is effective in preventing CINV, an increment in financial burden for uniform use of aprepitant is a concern. The aim of the present study was to define the cost-effectiveness of aprepitant from the perspective of the Japanese National Health Insurance system. Based on the results of a randomized phase II trial comparing an aprepitant-containing regimen versus a nonaprepitant regimen in Japanese patients who received cisplatin-containing highly emetogenic chemotherapy, a decision analytic model was developed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated both in the outpatient care setting (OCS) and in the inpatient care setting (ICS). The use of the aprepitant-containing regimen was associated with improved quality of life compared with the nonaprepitant regimen, with an increment in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of 0.0016. The incremental total medical costs associated with the use of the aprepitant regimen were lower in the OCS than in the ICS, 6192 JPY (56.92 USD) and 9820 JPY (90.27 USD), respectively. The ICER was calculated as 3 906 698 JPY (35 910 USD) per QALY gained in the OCS and 6 195 781 JPY (56 952 USD) per QALY gained in the ICS. Cost-effectiveness of the aprepitant-containing antiemetic therapy was limited to the OCS, considering the threshold of willingness-to-pay commonly accepted (5 million JPY [45 960 USD] in Japan and 50 000 USD in the USA).

This study estimated the cost-effectiveness and health-related outcomes of HCV screening and DAA treatment of a targeted population in Korea, where anti-HCV prevalence was 0.6% in 2015. METHODS: A Markov model simulating the natural history of HCV infection was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of two strategies: no screening vs screening and DAA treatment. Screening was performed by integration of the anti-HCV test into the National Health Examination Program. From a healthcare system''s perspective, the cost-utility and the impact on HCV-related health events of one-time anti-HCV screening and DAA treatment in Korean population aged 40-65 years was analysed with a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: The HCV screening and DAA treatment strategy increased quality-adjusted life years (QALY) by 0.0015 at a cost of $11.27 resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $7435 per QALY gained compared with no screening. The probability of the screening strategy to be cost-effective was 98.8% at a willingness-to-pay of $27 205.

19413,Cost-effectiveness and health-related outcomes of screening for hepatitis C in Korean population,"BACKGROUND/AIM: In the era of direct-acting antivirals (DAA), active screening for hidden hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is important for HCV elimination. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness and health-related outcomes of HCV screening and DAA treatment of a targeted population in Korea, where anti-HCV prevalence was 0.6% in 2015. METHODS: A Markov model simulating the natural history of HCV infection was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of two strategies: no screening vs screening and DAA treatment. Screening was performed by integration of the anti-HCV test into the National Health Examination Program. From a healthcare system''s perspective, the cost-utility and the impact on HCV-related health events of one-time anti-HCV screening and DAA treatment in Korean population aged 40-65 years was analysed with a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: The HCV screening and DAA treatment strategy increased quality-adjusted life years (QALY) by 0.0015 at a cost of $11.27 resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $7435 per QALY gained compared with no screening. The probability of the screening strategy to be cost-effective was 98.8% at a willingness-to-pay of $27 205. Deterministic sensitivity analyses revealed the ICERs were from $4602 to $12 588 and sensitive to screening costs, discount rates and treatment acceptability. Moreover, it can prevent 32 HCV-related deaths, 19 hepatocellular carcinomas and 15 decompensated cirrhosis per 100 000 screened persons.

19414,Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of rifaximin-alpha for the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: Rifaximin-alpha 550 mg twice daily plus lactulose has demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrence of episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) and the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE)-related hospitalizations compared with lactulose alone. This analysis estimated the cost effectiveness of rifaximin-alpha 550 mg twice daily plus lactulose versus lactulose alone in United Kingdom (UK) cirrhotic patients with OHE. METHOD: A Markov model was built to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The perspective was that of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Clinical data was sourced from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an open-label maintenance study in cirrhotic patients in remission from recurrent episodes of OHE. Health-related utility was estimated indirectly from disease-specific quality of life RCT data. Resource use data describing the impact of rifaximin-alpha on hospital admissions and length of stay for cirrhotic patients with OHE was from four single-center UK audits. Costs (2012) were derived from published sources; costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. The base-case time horizon was 5 years. RESULTS: The average cost per patient was pound22,971 in the rifaximin-alpha plus lactulose arm and pound23,545 in the lactulose arm, a saving of pound573. The corresponding values for benefit were 2.35 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and 1.83 QALYs per person, a difference of 0.52 QALYs. This translated into a dominant base-case ICER. Key parameters that impacted the ICER included number of hospital admissions and length of stay. CONCLUSION: Rifaximin-alpha 550 mg twice daily in patients with recurrent episodes of OHE was estimated to generate cost savings and improved clinical outcomes compared to standard care over 5 years.",2018-01-26796,29995455,Curr Med Res Opin,Ellen Berni,2018,/,1-8,No,29995455,"Ellen Berni; Daniel Murphy; James Whitehouse; Pete Conway; Paola Di Maggio; Craig J Currie; Chris Poole; Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of rifaximin-alpha for the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy in the United Kingdom, Curr Med Res Opin, 2018 Jan 25; ():0300-7995; 1-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Rifaximin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Lactulose alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, Lifetime, 2, 10 years",3.50,3.50,-1103.85,United Kingdom,2012,-1972.65

Objective: To examine whether it is more cost-effective to transplant HCV-infected or HCV-uninfected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. Design: Markov state-transition decision model. Data Sources: MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from relevant English-language articles. Target Population: HCV-infected patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis in the United States. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Health care system. Intervention: Transplant of an HCV-infected kidney followed by HCV treatment versus transplant of an HCV-uninfected kidney preceded by HCV treatment. Outcome Measures: Effectiveness, measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs, measured in 2017 U.S. dollars. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Transplant of an HCV-infected kidney followed by HCV treatment was more effective and less costly than transplant of an HCV-uninfected kidney preceded by HCV treatment, largely because of longer wait times for uninfected kidneys. A typical 57.8-year-old patient receiving hemodialysis would gain an average of 0.50 QALY at a lifetime cost savings of $41 591. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Transplant of an HCV-infected kidney followed by HCV treatment continued to be preferred in sensitivity analyses of many model parameters. Transplant of an HCV-uninfected kidney preceded by HCV treatment was not preferred unless the additional wait time for an uninfected kidney was less than 161 days. Limitation: The study did not consider the benefit of decreased HCV transmission from treating HCV-infected patients. Conclusion: Transplanting HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients increased quality-adjusted life expectancy and reduced costs compared with transplanting HCV-uninfected kidneys into HCV-infected patients.

19416,"Stereoelectroencephalography for Refractory Epileptic Patients Considered for Surgery: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Economic Evaluation","BACKGROUND: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) has been shown to be a valuable tool for the anatomoelectroclinical definition of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in patients with medically refractory epilepsy considered for surgery (RES patients). In Spain, many of those patients are not offered this diagnostic procedure. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of SEEG to define the EZ in RES patients compared to no SEEG intervention, ie, remaining with further antiepileptic drugs. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review with meta-analyses on the effectiveness and safety of SEEG. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model, which simulates the costs and health outcomes of individuals for a lifetime horizon from the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. The effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We ran extensive sensitivity analyses, including a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The EZ was found in 92% of patients who underwent SEEG (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-0.96); 72% were eligible for epilepsy surgery (95% CI: 0.66-0.78) and 33% were free of seizures after surgery (95% CI: 0.27-0.42). Of the patients who underwent surgery, 47% were free of seizures after surgery (95% CI: 0.37-0.58). Complications related to implantation and monitoring of SEEG and the subsequent intervention occurred in 1.3% of patients (95% CI: 0.01-0.02). In the base case analysis, SEEG led to higher QALYs and healthcare costs with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10 368 EUR per QALY (95% CI: dominant-113 911), making the probability of cost-effectiveness between 75% and 88%. Further sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the study were robust.

19422,Cost-effectiveness of PCV13 vaccination in Belgian adults aged 65-84 years at elevated risk of pneumococcal infection,"BACKGROUND: The Belgian Superior Health Council (SHC) recently added a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to its recommendations for adult pneumococcal vaccination. This study addresses the policy question regarding whether a single dose of PCV13 should be reimbursed among Belgian adults aged 65-84 years with chronic comorbidities (""moderate-risk"") or immunosuppression (""high-risk""). METHODS: A cohort model was developed to project lifetime risks, consequences, and costs of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Parameter values were estimated using published literature and available databases, and were reviewed by Belgian experts. PCV13 effectiveness was assumed to be durable during the first 5 years following receipt, and to progressively decline thereafter with 15 years protection. The Belgian National Health Insurance perspective was employed. RESULTS: Use of PCV13 (vs. no vaccine) in moderate/high-risk persons aged 65-84 years (n = 861,467; 58% vaccination coverage) would be expected to prevent 527 cases of IPD, 1,744 cases of pneumococcal CAP and 176 pneumococcal-related deaths, and reduce medical care costs by euro20.1 million. Vaccination costs, however, would increase by euro36.9 million and thus total overall costs would increase by euro16.8 million. Cost per QALY gained was euro17,126. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, use of PCV13 was cost-effective in 97% of 1,000 simulations.

19423,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Versus Proton Therapy for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"PURPOSE: To compared the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated proton beam therapy (PBT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the management of stage III-IVB oropharynx cancer (OPC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to compare IMRT with PBT for a 65-year-old patient with stage IVA OPSCC. We assumed PBT led to a 25% reduction in long-term xerostomia, short-term dysgeusia, and the need for gastrostomy tube. Fewer dental complications were also expected with PBT. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated, and value of information analyses were performed. The societal willingness-to-pay was defined as $100K per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The ICERs for PBT for favorable human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive OPC were $288,000/QALY and $390,000/QALY in the payer perspective (PP) and societal perspective, respectively. Under nearly every scenario, PBT was not cost-effective, with ICERs above $150,000/QALY in the PP. The ICERs for HPV-negative OPC were typically greater than $250K/QALY in both perspectives. For HPV-positive patients, the ICER was less than $100,000/QALY in the PP only in younger patients who experienced a 50% reduction in both xerostomia and gastrostomy use. On probabilistic sensitivity analyses, there were 0% and 0.4% probabilities that PBT was cost-effective for 65- and 55-year old patients, respectively.

19424,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Versus Proton Therapy for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"PURPOSE: To compared the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated proton beam therapy (PBT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the management of stage III-IVB oropharynx cancer (OPC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to compare IMRT with PBT for a 65-year-old patient with stage IVA OPSCC. We assumed PBT led to a 25% reduction in long-term xerostomia, short-term dysgeusia, and the need for gastrostomy tube. Fewer dental complications were also expected with PBT. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated, and value of information analyses were performed. The societal willingness-to-pay was defined as $100K per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The ICERs for PBT for favorable human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive OPC were $288,000/QALY and $390,000/QALY in the payer perspective (PP) and societal perspective, respectively. Under nearly every scenario, PBT was not cost-effective, with ICERs above $150,000/QALY in the PP. The ICERs for HPV-negative OPC were typically greater than $250K/QALY in both perspectives. For HPV-positive patients, the ICER was less than $100,000/QALY in the PP only in younger patients who experienced a 50% reduction in both xerostomia and gastrostomy use. On probabilistic sensitivity analyses, there were 0% and 0.4% probabilities that PBT was cost-effective for 65- and 55-year old patients, respectively. The value of information was zero or negligible for all ages and perspectives at willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY and only meaningful in the PP for younger patients at a willingness-to-pay of $150,000/QALY.

19425,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, debilitating disease affecting an estimated 1.5 million patients in the US. The condition is associated with a substantial health and economic burden. An economic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib (a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor) versus biologic therapies commonly prescribed in the US for the treatment of RA. METHODS: A cost-utility model was developed whereby sequences of treatments were evaluated. Response to treatment was modeled by HAQ change, and informed by a network meta-analysis. Mortality, resource use and quality of life were captured in the model using published regression analyses based on HAQ score. Treatment discontinuation was linked to response to treatment and to adverse events. Patients were modeled as having had an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR), or to a first biologic therapy (TNFi-IR). RESULTS: The tofacitinib strategy was associated with cost savings compared with alternative treatment sequences across all modeled scenarios (i.e. in both the MTX-IR and TNFi-IR scenarios), with lifetime cost savings per patient ranging from $65,205 to $93,959 (2015 costs). Cost savings arose due to improved functioning and the resulting savings in healthcare expenditure, and lower drug and administration costs. The tofacitinib strategies all resulted in an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with additional QALYs per patient ranging from 0.01 to 0.22.

19429,Cost-effectiveness of three different strategies for the treatment of first recurrent Clostridium difficile infection diagnosed in a community setting,"OBJECTIVE: A significant portion of patients with Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) experience recurrence, and there is little consensus on its treatment. With the availability of newer agents for CDI and the added burdens of recurrent disease, a cost-effectiveness analysis may provide insight on the most efficient use of resources. DESIGN: A decision-tree analysis was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of 3 possible treatments for patients with first CDI recurrence: oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or bezlotoxumab plus vancomycin. The model was performed from a payer''s perspective with direct cost inputs and a timeline of 1 year. A systematic review of literature was performed to identify clinical, utility, and cost data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $100,000 per QALY gained. The robustness of the model was tested using one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Vancomycin had the lowest cost ($15,692) and was associated with a QALY gain of 0.8019 years. Bezlotoxumab plus vancomycin was a dominated strategy. Fidaxomicin led to a higher QALY compared to vancomycin, at an incremental cost of $500,975 per QALY gained. Based on our WTP threshold, vancomycin alone was the most cost-effective regimen for treating the first recurrence of CDI. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the model''s robustness.

This study aimed to investigate cost-effectiveness of HZ subunit vaccine for older adults at different age in Hong Kong. METHODS: A life-long Markov model was designed to simulate outcomes of four alternatives: Vaccination at model entry (age 50years); deferring vaccination to 60years; deferring vaccination to 70years; and no vaccination. Outcome measures included direct cost, indirect cost, HZ and post-herpetic neuralgia incidences, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) loss, and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER). Model clinical inputs were derived from literature. HZ treatment costs were collected from a cohort of HZ patients (n=218). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In base-case analysis, vaccination at 50years showed highest QALYs saved and increment cost (0.00258; USD166), followed by deferring to 60years (0.00215 QALYs saved; USD102) and deferring to 70years (0.00134 QALYs; USD62) when comparing to no vaccination.

19434,Cost-effectiveness analysis of capecitabine monotherapy versus capecitabine plus oxaliplatin in elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer,"BACKGROUND: There is no single standard chemotherapy regimen for elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). A phase III trial has confirmed that both capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin are well tolerated for elderly patients with AGC, but their economic influence in China is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to estimate the effects of capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin in elderly patients with AGC on health and economic outcomes in China. METHODS: We created a Markov model based on data from a Korean clinical phase III trial to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of elderly patients in the capecitabine monotherapy (X) group and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) group. The costs were obtained from published reports and the local health system. The utilities were assumed on the basis of the published literature. Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (Monte Carlo simulations) were performed. RESULTS: In the cost-effectiveness analysis, X had a lower total cost ($45,731.68) and cost-effectiveness ratio ($65,918.93/QALY). The one-way sensitivity analysis suggested that the most influential parameter was the risk of requiring second-line chemotherapy in XELOX group. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted that the X regimen was cost-effective 100% of the time, given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $26,598.

This study offers a comparative analysis of PCV13 and PPSV23 in Korea''s adults, stratified by age and risk group. A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed from the healthcare perspective. Data sources included the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service, Korea Centre for Disease Control & Prevention and Korean medical institutions. An expert panel tested data validity. The CAPiTA trial and Cochrane meta-analysis were used to obtain vaccine effectiveness data. Regardless of co-morbidity, when the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy was compared to that using PPSV23-only, in elderly populations, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 3,300 USD per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). For the risk group aged >/=65 years, the ICER of the addition of PCV13 over the existing PPSV23-only strategy was 3,404 USD/QALY. However, on replacing PPSV23 with PCV13, for all elderly populations, an ICER of 1,421 USD/QALY resulted; for the risk group aged >/=65 years, the ICER was 1,736 USD/QALY. For the 18-64 year-old risk group, the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy yielded an ICER of 3,629 USD/QALY over the PPSV23-only strategy, and 6,643 USD/QALY compared to no vaccination.

19441,Economic Evaluation for USA of Systemic Chemotherapies as First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Treatments for metastatic pancreatic cancer include monotherapy with gemcitabine (GEM); combinations of GEM with oxaliplatin (OX + GEM), cisplatin (CIS + GEM), capecitabine (CAP + GEM), or nab-paclitaxel (NAB-P + GEM); and the non-GEM combination FOLFIRINOX. Combination therapies have yielded better survival outcomes than GEM alone. A sponsor-independent economic evaluation of these regimens has not been conducted for USA. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost utility and cost effectiveness of these regimens from the payer perspective for USA. METHODS: A three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed disease, death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years; life-years) was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility and cost-effectiveness ratios. FOLFIRINOX clinical data were obtained from trial and indirect estimates were obtained from network meta-analyses. Lifetime horizon and 3%/year discount rates were used. RESULTS: FOLFIRINOX was the most expensive regimen and GEM the least costly regimen. Compared to GEM, all but one (CIS + GEM) regimen were found to be more effective in quality-adjusted life-years and life-years. Compared to GEM, the incremental cost-utility ratios for CAP + GEM, OX-GEM, NAB-P + GEM, and FOLFIRINOX, were US$180,503, US$197,993, US$204,833, and US$265,718 per additional quality-adjusted life-year, respectively; and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were US$88,181, US$87,620, US$135,683, and US$167,040 per additional life-year, respectively.

Combination therapies have yielded better survival outcomes than GEM alone. A sponsor-independent economic evaluation of these regimens has not been conducted for USA. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost utility and cost effectiveness of these regimens from the payer perspective for USA. METHODS: A three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed disease, death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years; life-years) was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility and cost-effectiveness ratios.

19455,Economic Evaluation for USA of Systemic Chemotherapies as First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Treatments for metastatic pancreatic cancer include monotherapy with gemcitabine (GEM); combinations of GEM with oxaliplatin (OX + GEM), cisplatin (CIS + GEM), capecitabine (CAP + GEM), or nab-paclitaxel (NAB-P + GEM); and the non-GEM combination FOLFIRINOX. Combination therapies have yielded better survival outcomes than GEM alone. A sponsor-independent economic evaluation of these regimens has not been conducted for USA. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost utility and cost effectiveness of these regimens from the payer perspective for USA. METHODS: A three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed disease, death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years; life-years) was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility and cost-effectiveness ratios. FOLFIRINOX clinical data were obtained from trial and indirect estimates were obtained from network meta-analyses. Lifetime horizon and 3%/year discount rates were used. RESULTS: FOLFIRINOX was the most expensive regimen and GEM the least costly regimen. Compared to GEM, all but one (CIS + GEM) regimen were found to be more effective in quality-adjusted life-years and life-years. Compared to GEM, the incremental cost-utility ratios for CAP + GEM, OX-GEM, NAB-P + GEM, and FOLFIRINOX, were US$180,503, US$197,993, US$204,833, and US$265,718 per additional quality-adjusted life-year, respectively; and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were US$88,181, US$87,620, US$135,683, and US$167,040 per additional life-year, respectively.

19456,Cost-Effectiveness of Melanoma Screening in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, and preventive care guidelines in IBD favor annual skin examinations. Here we estimate the cost-effectiveness of annual melanoma screening in IBD. METHODS: Melanoma screening was defined as receiving annual total body skin examinations starting at age 40 from a dermatologist. Screening was compared to US background total body skin examination rates performed by primary care practitioners. A Markov model was used to estimate intervention costs and effectiveness. Future costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3% per year over a lifetime horizon. Strategies were compared using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Annual melanoma screening cost an average of $1961 per patient, while no screening cost $81 per patient. Melanoma screening was more effective, gaining 9.2 QALYs per 1000 persons, at a cost of $203,400/QALY gained. Screening every other year was the preferred strategy, gaining 6.2 QALYs per 1000 persons and costing $143,959/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested the relative risk of melanoma in IBD, melanoma progression, and screening costs were most influential with clinically plausible variation, leading to scenarios costing < $100,000/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested screening every other year was cost-effective in 17.4% of iterations. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for melanoma in IBD patients was effective but expensive.

19459,Universal screening at age 1-2 years as an adjunct to cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia in the UK: A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is widely underdiagnosed. Cascade testing (CT) of relatives has been shown to be feasible, acceptable and cost-effective in the UK, but requires a supply of index cases. Feasibility of universal screening (US) at age 1-2 years was recently demonstrated. We examined whether this would be a cost-effective adjunct to CT in the UK, given the current and plausible future undiagnosed FH prevalence. METHODS: Seven cholesterol and/or mutation-based US+/-reverse cascade testing (RCT) alternatives were compared with no US in an incremental analysis with a healthcare perspective. A decision model was used to estimate costs and outcomes for cohorts exposed to the US component of each strategy. RCT case ascertainment was modelled using recent UK CT data, and probabilistic Markov models estimated lifetime costs and health outcomes for the cohorts screened under each alternative. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations were run for each model, and average outcomes reported. Further uncertainty was explored deterministically. Threshold analysis investigated the association between undiagnosed FH prevalence and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: A strategy involving cholesterol screening followed by diagnostic genetic testing and RCT was the most cost-effective modelled (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) versus no US pound12,480/quality adjusted life year (QALY); probability of cost-effectiveness 96.8% at pound20,000/QALY threshold).

19466,Cost-Effectiveness of a Bone-Anchored Annular Closure Device Versus Conventional Lumbar Discectomy in Treating Lumbar Disc Herniations,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis of an annular closure device (ACD) based on data from a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) OBJECTIVE.: Determine the cost-effectiveness of a novel ACD in a patient population at high risk for recurrent herniation following discectomy SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Lumbar disc herniation patients with annular defect widths >/= 6 mm are at high risk for recurrent herniation following limited discectomy. Recurrent herniation is associated with worse clinical outcomes and greater healthcare costs. A novel ACD may reduce the incidence of recurrent herniation and the associated burdens. METHODS: A decision analytical modeling approach with a Markov method was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ACD versus conventional discectomy. Health states were created by projecting visual analogue scale (VAS) onto Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Direct costs were calculated based on Humana and Medicare 2014 claims to represent private and public payer data, respectively. Indirect costs were calculated for lost work days using 2016 US average annual wages. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollars per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was compared to willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: Patients with the ACD had less symptomatic reherniations, reoperations, and complications and gained 0.0328 QALYs within the first 2 years. Total direct medical costs for the ACD group were similar to control. When productivity loss was considered, using the ACD became $2,076 cheaper, per patient, than conventional discectomy. Based on direct costs alone, the ICER comparing ACD to control equaled $6,030 per QALY. When indirect costs are included, the ICER became negative, which indicates that superior quality of life was attained at less cost. CONCLUSIONS: For lumbar disc herniations patients with annular defects >/= 6 mm, the ACD was, at 2-years, a highly cost-effective surgical modality compared to conventional lumbar discectomy.

19467,Cost-Effectiveness of a Bone-Anchored Annular Closure Device Versus Conventional Lumbar Discectomy in Treating Lumbar Disc Herniations,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis of an annular closure device (ACD) based on data from a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) OBJECTIVE.: Determine the cost-effectiveness of a novel ACD in a patient population at high risk for recurrent herniation following discectomy SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Lumbar disc herniation patients with annular defect widths >/= 6 mm are at high risk for recurrent herniation following limited discectomy. Recurrent herniation is associated with worse clinical outcomes and greater healthcare costs. A novel ACD may reduce the incidence of recurrent herniation and the associated burdens. METHODS: A decision analytical modeling approach with a Markov method was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ACD versus conventional discectomy. Health states were created by projecting visual analogue scale (VAS) onto Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Direct costs were calculated based on Humana and Medicare 2014 claims to represent private and public payer data, respectively. Indirect costs were calculated for lost work days using 2016 US average annual wages. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollars per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was compared to willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: Patients with the ACD had less symptomatic reherniations, reoperations, and complications and gained 0.0328 QALYs within the first 2 years.

19468,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Sacubitril-Valsartan Compared with Enalapril in Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Sacubitril-valsartan is a new medication that has recently been recommended as a replacement for enalapril in the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of sacubitril-valsartan compared with enalapril. METHODS: An analytical decision model was developed to estimate the long-term costs and outcomes from a healthcare perspective. Clinical inputs were mostly derived from the PARADIGM-HF study. Enalapril-related costs, risk of non-cardiovascular death, and all-cause readmission rate were based on data from Thailand. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and presented for the year 2017. A series of sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: For the base-case, the increased cost (144,146 vs. 16,048 Thai baht [THB]) of sacubitril-valsartan was associated with gains in both life-years (9.214 vs. 8.367 years) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (7.698 vs. 6.909) compared with enalapril, yielding an ICER of 162,276 THB/QALY ($US4857.11/QALY). This ICER is not considered to be cost effective at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) level of 160,000 THB/QALY. The risk of cardiovascular death and costs of both sacubitril-valsartan and hospitalization influenced the ICER. At a WTP of 160,000 THB/QALY, sacubitril-valsartan had a 48% probability of being a cost-effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: At its current price in Thailand, sacubitril-valsartan may not represent good value for the nations''s limited healthcare resources. The cost of sacubitril-valsartan needs to reduce by approximately 2% to yield an ICER below the threshold.",2018-01-26927,29926351,Am J Cardiovasc Drugs,Rungroj Krittayaphong,2018,/,,No,29926351,"Rungroj Krittayaphong; Unchalee Permsuwan; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Sacubitril-Valsartan Compared with Enalapril in Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction in Thailand, Am J Cardiovasc Drugs, 2018 Jun 21; ():1175-3277",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Sacubitril-valsartan vs. Enalapril,Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of <= 40% and New York Heart Association functional class II-IV,Not Stated,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,162276,Thailand,2017,5052.3
19469,The Effects of Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty on Medicare Spending and Beneficiary Outcomes: Implications for the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model,"BACKGROUND: After the first year in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, hospitals must repay Medicare for spending above a target price. Hospitals are incentivized to reduce spending in a 90-day episode and generate internal cost savings through, for example, the use of lower-cost implants. METHODS: We used a Markov model to compare quality-adjusted life-years and lifetime costs of total hip arthroplasty, under Medicare fee-for-service (baseline) and under alternative revision rate assumptions (prospective CJR scenarios). Results were generated for 65-year-old and 75-year-old male and female Medicare beneficiaries using baseline spending and revision rates from Medicare claims. We estimated the impact of CJR on 90-day spending. We ran sensitivity analyses for revision rates. RESULTS: Under willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000, the baseline scenario was more cost-effective than the CJR scenario for a 65-year-old male patient if the revision risk increases by at least 7% (95% confidence interval for CJR savings: 4%-22%), 5% (range, 3%-7%), or 3% (range, 1%-5%), respectively. For males aged 75 years and females, revision risk needs to increase by a greater percentage under CJR relative to baseline for Medicare fee-for-service to be more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: The CJR model holds great promise. However, it incentivizes hospitals to choose lower-cost implants and adopt newer technology more slowly, which could potentially increase revision rates and offset benefits of the program.

Hospitals are incentivized to reduce spending in a 90-day episode and generate internal cost savings through, for example, the use of lower-cost implants. METHODS: We used a Markov model to compare quality-adjusted life-years and lifetime costs of total hip arthroplasty, under Medicare fee-for-service (baseline) and under alternative revision rate assumptions (prospective CJR scenarios). Results were generated for 65-year-old and 75-year-old male and female Medicare beneficiaries using baseline spending and revision rates from Medicare claims. We estimated the impact of CJR on 90-day spending. We ran sensitivity analyses for revision rates. RESULTS: Under willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000, the baseline scenario was more cost-effective than the CJR scenario for a 65-year-old male patient if the revision risk increases by at least 7% (95% confidence interval for CJR savings: 4%-22%), 5% (range, 3%-7%), or 3% (range, 1%-5%), respectively.

19485,A Modeling Study of the Cost-Effectiveness of a Risk-Stratified Surveillance Program for Melanoma in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Population-wide screening for melanoma is unlikely to be cost-effective. Nevertheless, targeted surveillance of high-risk individuals may be. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of various surveillance strategies in the UK population, stratified by risk using a simple self-assessment tool scoring between 0 and 67. METHODS: A decision model comparing alternative surveillance policies from the perspective of the UK National Health Service over 30 years was developed. The strategy with the highest expected net benefit for each risk score was identified, resulting in a compound risk-stratified policy describing the most cost-effective population-wide strategy. The overall expected cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and associated uncertainty were reported. RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategy is for those with a Williams score of 15 to 21 (relative risk [RR] of 0.79-1.60 vs. a mean score of 17 in the United Kingdom) to be offered a one-off full-body skin examination, and for those with a score of 22 or more (RR 1.79+) to be enrolled into a quinquennial monitoring program, rising to annual recall for those with a risk score greater than 43 (RR 20.95+). Expected incremental cost would be pound164 million per annum (~0.1% of the National Health Service budget), gaining 15,947 additional QALYs and yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound10,199/QALY gained (51.3% probability < pound30,000). CONCLUSIONS: The risk-stratified policy would be expensive to implement but cost-effective compared with typical UK thresholds ( pound20,000- pound30,000/QALY gained), although decision uncertainty is high. Phased implementation enrolling only higher risk individuals would be substantially less expensive, but with consequent foregone health gain.",2018-01-26955,29909870,Value Health,Edward C F Wilson,2018,21 / 6,658-668,Yes,29909870,"Edward C F Wilson; Juliet A Usher-Smith; Jon Emery; Pippa Corrie; Fiona M Walter; A Modeling Study of the Cost-Effectiveness of a Risk-Stratified Surveillance Program for Melanoma in the United Kingdom, Value Health, 2018 Jun; 21(6):1098-3015; 658-668",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Screening,Different frequency of melanoma screening depending on Williams risk score (risk-stratified) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Status quo (melanoma screening in patients concerned about a skin lesion),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,10198.57,United Kingdom,2015,17021.94

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision analytical model in men with elevated prostate specific antigen (3 ng/ml or greater) in which 1 biomarker test was used to determine which hypothetical individuals required biopsy. In the current standard of care strategy all individuals underwent biopsy. Model parameters were derived from a comprehensive review of the literature. Costs were calculated from a health sector perspective and converted into 2017 United States dollars. RESULTS: The cost and QALYs (quality adjusted life-years) of the current standard of care, which was transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy, was $3,863 and 18.085, respectively. Applying any of the 3 biomarkers improved quality adjusted survival compared to the current standard of care. The cost of SelectMDx, the PHI and the EPI was lower than performing prostate biopsy in all patients. However, the PHI was more costly and less effective than the SelectMDx strategy. The EPI provided the highest QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $58,404 per QALY. The use of biomarkers could reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies by 24% to 34% compared to the current standard of care.

CONCLUSIONS: Applying biomarkers in men with elevated prostate specific antigen to determine the need for biopsy improved quality adjusted survival by decreasing the number of biopsies performed and the treatment of indolent disease. Using SelectMDx or the EPI following elevated prostate specific antigen but before proceeding to biopsy is a cost-effective strategy in this setting.",2018-01-26964,29906434,J Urol,Niranjan J Sathianathen,2018,/,,No,29906434,"Niranjan J Sathianathen; Karen M Kuntz; Fernando Alarid-Escudero; Nathan L Lawrentschuk; Damien M Bolton; Declan G Murphy; Christopher J Weight; Badrinath R Konety; Incorporating Biomarkers into the Primary Prostate Biopsy Setting: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, J Urol, 2018 Jul 27; ():0022-5347",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Screening",4kscore Prostate biomarker test used to determine whether biopsy required vs. Standard/Usual Care- EPI -ExoDx Prostate biomarker test used to determine whether biopsy required,Elevated prostate specific antigen,50 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-377500,United States,2017,-398584.99
19490,Contrasting Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Screening Under Commercial Insurance vs. Medicare,"OBJECTIVES: Most cost-effectiveness analyses of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening assume Medicare payment rates and a lifetime horizon. Our aims were to examine the implications of differential payment levels and time horizons for commercial insurers vs. Medicare on the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening. METHODS: We used our validated Markov cohort simulation of CRC screening in the average risk US population to examine CRC screening at ages 50-64 under commercial insurance, and at ages 65-80 under Medicare, using a health-care sector perspective. Model outcomes included discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs per person, and incremental cost/QALY gained. RESULTS: Lifetime costs/person were 20-44% higher when assuming commercial payment rates rather than Medicare rates for people under 65. Most of the substantial clinical benefit of screening at ages 50-64 was realized at ages >/=65. For commercial payers with a time horizon of ages 50-64, fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) were cost-effective (<$61,000/QALY gained), but colonoscopy was costly (>$185,000/QALY gained). Medicare experienced substantial clinical benefits and cost-savings from screening done at ages <65, even if screening was not continued. Among those previously screened, continuing FOBT and FIT under Medicare was cost-saving and continuing colonoscopy was highly cost-effective (<$30,000/QALY gained), and initiating any screening in those previously unscreened was highly effective and cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling suggests that CRC screening is highly cost-effective over a lifetime even when considering higher payment rates by commercial payers vs. Medicare.
