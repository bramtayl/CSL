15701,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir in difficult to treat Japanese patients chronically infected with hepatitis C genotype 1b,"AIM: Standard of care for chronic hepatitis C in Japan is currently a pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha + ribavirin (PR)-based regimen, notably associated with efficacy and tolerability issues. The advent of novel direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has provided more efficacious and better tolerated treatments. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of the daclatasvir + asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) DAA regimen in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b who had previously not responded to or were ineligible for IFN-containing regimens. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using an established Markov model compared DCV + ASV with simeprevir + PR (SMV + PR), telaprevir + PR (TVR + PR) and no treatment using Japanese-specific model inputs, with costs and utility values discounted at 2%. A cohort of patients was simulated until death and predicted quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and costs were estimated. A subgroup analysis of patients with no DCV resistance was conducted. RESULTS: In all scenarios, DCV + ASV was predicted to be dominant over the comparator; namely, DCV + ASV was associated with increased QALY gains and decreased cost. In patients treated during the chronic hepatitis C stage, cost reductions were yen1 057 288-2 619 206, and in patients treated during the compensated cirrhosis (CC) stage, reductions were yen1 032 224-2 531 930. QALY gains were 0.749-2.609 and 0.874-3.043, respectively. Results improved when considering the subgroup of patients without DCV resistance. CONCLUSION: Cost-effectiveness conclusions are similar for patients treated in the chronic hepatitis C and CC disease stages, with DCV + ASV expected to be cost-saving versus standard of care in Japan for patients with HCV genotype 1b patients who have failed prior therapy or are IFN-ineligible/intolerant.",2016-01-21024,26440999,Hepatol Res,Phil McEwan,2016,46 / 5,423-33,No,26440999,"Phil McEwan; Thomas Ward; Samantha Webster; Yong Yuan; Anupama Kalsekar; Isao Kamae; Masahiro Kobayashi; Ann Tang; Hiromitsu Kumada; Estimating the cost-effectiveness of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir in difficult to treat Japanese patients chronically infected with hepatitis C genotype 1b, Hepatol Res, 2016 Mar; 46(5):1386-6346; 423-33",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Daclatasvir (DCV) + Asunaprevir (ASV) vs. Telaprevir (TVR) + pegylated interferon (PR),Prior-nonresponder; hepatitis C genotype 1b,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,2.00,2.00,-1512507.25,Japan,2014,-15680.56
15702,Health and Economic Impact of Switching from a 4-Valent to a 9-Valent HPV Vaccination Program in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials have shown the 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to be highly effective against types 31/33/45/52/58 compared with the 4-valent. Evidence on the added health and economic benefit of the 9-valent is required for policy decisions. We compare population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 9- and 4-valent HPV vaccination in the United States. METHODS: We used a multitype individual-based transmission-dynamic model of HPV infection and disease (anogenital warts and cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers), 3% discount rate, and societal perspective. The model was calibrated to sexual behavior and epidemiologic data from the United States. In our base-case, we assumed 95% vaccine-type efficacy, lifelong protection, and a cost/dose of $145 and $158 for the 4- and 9-valent vaccine, respectively. Predictions are presented using the mean (80% uncertainty interval [UI] = 10(th)-90(th) percentiles) of simulations. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, the 4-valent gender-neutral vaccination program is estimated to cost $5500 (80% UI = 2400-9400) and $7300 (80% UI = 4300-11 000)/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with and without cross-protection, respectively. Switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral program is estimated to be cost-saving irrespective of cross-protection assumptions. Finally, the incremental cost/QALY gained of switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral program (vs 9-valent girls/4-valent boys) is estimated to be $140 200 (80% UI = 4200->1 million) and $31 100 (80% UI = 2100->1 million) with and without cross-protection, respectively. Results are robust to assumptions about HPV natural history, screening methods, duration of protection, and healthcare costs. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral HPV vaccination program is likely to be cost-saving if the additional cost/dose of the 9-valent is less than $13.

15706,Colectomy with Permanent End Ileostomy Is More Cost-Effective than Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis for Crohn's Colitis,"BACKGROUND: Much of the economic burden of Crohn's disease (CD) is related to surgery. Twenty percent of patients with CD have isolated colonic disease. While permanent end ileostomy (EI) is generally the procedure of choice for patients with refractory CD colitis, single-center experiences suggest that restorative proctocolectomy (IPAA) is durable in select patients. AIMS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of total colectomy with permanent EI versus IPAA in medically refractory colonic CD. METHODS: We used a lifetime Markov model with 6-month cycles to simulate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost. In each of the EI and IPAA strategies, patients could transition between multiple health states. One-way and multivariable sensitivity analysis and tornado analysis were performed to identify thresholds for factors influencing cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: IPAA was more effective than EI surgery with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $70,715 per QALY gained. We identified the following variables of importance in our model: (1) the cost of the EI surgery, (2) the cost of infliximab, and (3) the cost of gastroenterology ambulatory visit and labs. Threshold analysis revealed that if the costs associated with EI surgery exceeded $20,167 or if the utility of IPAA with CD remission without medical therapy exceeded 0.37, IPAA became the more cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with medically refractory CD isolated to the colon, colectomy with permanent EI is more cost-effective than IPAA unless the costs associated with the EI surgery exceed $20,167 or if the utility associated with IPAA and CD remission exceeds 0.37.",2016-01-21041,26434930,Dig Dis Sci,Sasha Taleban,2016,61 / 2,550-9,No,26434930,"Sasha Taleban; Martijn G H van Oijen; Eric A Vasiliauskas; Phillip R Fleshner; Bo Shen; Andrew F Ippoliti; Stephan R Targan; Gil Y Melmed; Colectomy with Permanent End Ileostomy Is More Cost-Effective than Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis for Crohn's Colitis, Dig Dis Sci, 2016 Feb; 61(2):0163-2116; 550-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis vs. Colectomy with permanent end ileostomy,"70-kg, 30-year-old male with medically refractory Crohn’s disease with extensive colitis and no small bowel inflammation or perianal disease.",30 Years,30 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,70715,United States,2014,77308.98

Few economic studies have compared these products. PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of aripiprazole (ARI-LAI), paliperidone (PP-LAI), olanzapine (OLZ-LAI), and risperidone (RIS-LAI) in patients with chronic schizophrenia in Finland. METHODS: A 1-year decision tree model was adapted with guidance from an expert panel. Patients started hospitalized in relapse; those who responded continued treatment, others were switched to secondary drugs, then clozapine in the event of 2nd line failure. Rates of adherence, stable disease, relapse, and hospitalization were taken from pivotal trials, and utilities from published research. Included were direct costs paid by the Finnish Ministry of Health, in 2015 euros. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), hospitalization rates, and rates of relapse not requiring hospitalization. Model robustness was assessed using a series of 1-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Expected costs were lowest for PP-LAI at 41,148euro, followed by 41,543euro for ARI-LAI, 42,067euro for RIS-LAI and 45,406euro for OLZ-LAI.

15710,Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of liraglutide therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes in France,"OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to compare the projected long-term clinical and cost implications associated with liraglutide, sitagliptin and glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus failing to achieve glycemic control on metformin monotherapy in France. METHODS: Clinical input data for the modeling analysis were taken from two randomized, controlled trials (LIRA-DPP4 and LEAD-2). Long-term (patient lifetime) projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2013 Euros; euro) were made using a validated computer simulation model of type 2 diabetes. Costs were taken from published France-specific sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Liraglutide was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.25 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and an increase in mean direct healthcare costs of euro2558 per patient compared with sitagliptin. In the comparison with glimepiride, liraglutide was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.23 QALYs and an increase in direct costs of euro4695.

15711,Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of liraglutide therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes in France,"OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to compare the projected long-term clinical and cost implications associated with liraglutide, sitagliptin and glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus failing to achieve glycemic control on metformin monotherapy in France. METHODS: Clinical input data for the modeling analysis were taken from two randomized, controlled trials (LIRA-DPP4 and LEAD-2). Long-term (patient lifetime) projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2013 Euros; euro) were made using a validated computer simulation model of type 2 diabetes. Costs were taken from published France-specific sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Liraglutide was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.25 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and an increase in mean direct healthcare costs of euro2558 per patient compared with sitagliptin. In the comparison with glimepiride, liraglutide was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.23 QALYs and an increase in direct costs of euro4695. Based on these estimates, liraglutide was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro10,275 per QALY gained vs sitagliptin and euro20,709 per QALY gained vs glimepiride in France.

METHODS: Study design was a cost-effectiveness analysis of different treatment strategies for POAG. We developed 3 Markov models (one for each glaucoma stage: early, moderate and advanced), using a hypothetical cohort of POAG patients, from the perspective of the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) and a horizon of the average life expectancy of the Brazilian population. Different strategies were tested according to disease severity. For early glaucoma, we compared observation, laser and medications. For moderate glaucoma, medications, laser and surgery. For advanced glaucoma, medications and surgery. Main outcome measures were ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio), medical direct costs and QALY (quality-adjusted life year). RESULTS: In early glaucoma, both laser and medical treatment were cost-effective (ICERs of initial laser and initial medical treatment over observation only, were R$ 2,811.39/QALY and R$ 3,450.47/QALY). Compared to observation strategy, the two alternatives have provided significant gains in quality of life. In moderate glaucoma population, medical treatment presented the highest costs among treatment strategies. Both laser and surgery were highly cost-effective in this group.

15717,Using continuous quantitative capnography for emergency department procedural sedation: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis,"End-tidal CO2 has been advocated to improve safety of emergency department (ED) procedural sedation by decreasing hypoxia and catastrophic outcomes. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of routine use of continuous waveform quantitative end-tidal CO2 monitoring for ED procedural sedation in prevention of catastrophic events. Markov modeling was used to perform cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate societal costs per prevented catastrophic event (death or hypoxic brain injury) during routine ED procedural sedation. Estimates for efficacy of capnography and safety of sedation were derived from the literature. This model was then applied to all procedural sedations performed in US EDs with assumptions selected to maximize efficacy and minimize cost of implementation. Assuming that capnography decreases the catastrophic adverse event rate by 40.7% (proportional to efficacy in preventing hypoxia), routine use of capnography would decrease the 5-year estimated catastrophic event rate in all US EDs from 15.5 events to 9.2 events (difference 6.3 prevented events per 5 years). Over a 5-year period, implementing routine end-tidal CO2 monitoring would cost an estimated $2,830,326 per prevented catastrophic event, which translates into $114,007 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analyses suggest that reasonable assumptions continue to estimate high costs of prevented catastrophic events. Continuous waveform quantitative end-tidal CO2 monitoring is a very costly strategy to prevent catastrophic complications of procedural sedation when applied routinely in ED procedural sedations.",2016-01-21369,28032265,Intern Emerg Med,Nicholas Matthew Mohr,2016,/,,No,28032265,"Nicholas Matthew Mohr; Andrew Stoltze; Azeemuddin Ahmed; Elizabeth Kiscaden; Dan Shane; Using continuous quantitative capnography for emergency department procedural sedation: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis, Intern Emerg Med, 2016 Dec 28; ():1970-9366",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,End- tidal Carbon Dioxide monitoring (Continuous waveform capnography) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Routine emergency department seadation,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,114007,United States,2016,122939.19

However, the cost-effectiveness of BNP-guided care is uncertain and guidelines do not uniformly recommend it. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of BNP-guided care in patient subgroups defined by age and ejection fraction. METHODS: We used a Markov model with a 3-month cycle length to estimate the lifetime health service costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental net monetary benefits (iNMBs) of BNP-guided versus clinically guided care in 3 patient subgroups: (1) HFrEF patients <75 years; (2) HFpEF patients <75 years; and (3) HFrEF patients >/=75 years. There is no evidence of benefit in patients with HFpEF aged >/=75 years. We used individual patient data meta-analyses and linked primary care, hospital and mortality data to inform the key model parameters. We performed probabilistic analysis to assess the uncertainty in model results. RESULTS: In younger patients (<75 years) with HFrEF, the mean QALYs (5.57 vs 5.02) and costs ( pound63 527 vs pound58 139) were higher with BNP-guided care. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per QALY, the positive iNMB ( pound5424 (95% CI pound987 to pound9469)) indicates that BNP-guided care is cost-effective in this subgroup. The evidence of cost-effectiveness of BNP-guided care is less strong for younger patients with HFpEF ( pound3155 (- pound10 307 to pound11 613)) and older patients (>/=75 years) with HFrEF ( pound2267 (- pound1524 to pound6074)). BNP-guided care remained cost-effective in the sensitivity analyses, albeit the results were sensitive to assumptions on its sustained effect. CONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence that BNP-guided care is a cost-effective alternative to clinically guided care in younger patients with HFrEF.

15721,Cost-Effectiveness of Solitaire Stent Retriever Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke: Results From the SWIFT-PRIME Trial (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke),"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical trials have demonstrated improved 90-day outcomes for patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with stent retriever thrombectomy plus tissue-type plasminogen activator (SST+tPA) compared with tPA. Previous studies suggested that this strategy may be cost-effective, but models were derived from pooled data and older assumptions. METHODS: In this prospective economic substudy conducted alongside the SWIFT-PRIME trial (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke), in-trial costs were measured for patients using detailed medical resource utilization and hospital billing data. Utility weights were assessed at 30 and 90 days using the EuroQol-5 dimension questionnaire. Post-trial costs and life-expectancy were estimated for each surviving patient using a model based on trial data and inputs derived from a contemporary cohort of ischemic stroke survivors. RESULTS: Index hospitalization costs were $17 183 per patient higher for SST+tPA than for tPA ($45 761 versus $28 578; P<0.001), driven by initial procedure costs. Between discharge and 90 days, costs were $4904 per patient lower for SST+tPA than for tPA ($11 270 versus $16 174; P=0.014); total 90-day costs remained higher with SST+tPA ($57 031 versus $44 752; P<0.001). Higher utility values for SST+tPA led to higher in-trial quality-adjusted life years (0.131 versus 0.105; P=0.005). In lifetime projections, SST+tPA was associated with substantial gains in quality-adjusted life years (6.79 versus 5.05), cost savings of $23 203 per patient and was economically dominant when compared with tPA in 90% of bootstrap replicates. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke enrolled in the SWIFT-PRIME trial, SST increased initial treatment costs, but was projected to improve quality-adjusted life-expectancy and reduce healthcare costs over a lifetime horizon compared with tPA.

15722,Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Monovalent C Versus Quadrivalent ACWY Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccination in Canada,"BACKGROUND: In Quebec, one dose of monovalent C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Men-C-Con) is offered at 12 months of age and a booster dose in grade 9 (14-15 years of age). In other Canadian provinces, a quadrivalent ACWY vaccine (Men-4-Con) is increasingly used for adolescents. An economic analysis was performed to assess the value of a switch from Men-C-Con to Men-4-Con. METHODS: A compartmental static simulation model was developed to assess the burden of AWY invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in a cohort of 100,000 persons with different vaccination programs. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed, including variation in vaccine price difference ($12; range $0 to $20), AWY-IMD rate (0.08/100,000 to 0.28/100,000 person-years), level of herd immunity generated by adolescent vaccination (from zero to disease elimination) and discounting rate (0%, 3% or 6%). RESULTS: In the low AWY-IMD rate base scenario, replacing Men-C-Con by Men-4-Con for adolescents would reduce disease burden by 16% (no herd effect) to 58% (moderate herd effect), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) between $445,000/QALY and $167,000/QALY in a societal perspective. In the high AWY-IMD rate scenario, ICER would be in the $97,000/QALY to $19,000/QALY range. CONCLUSION: Based on the epidemiologic conditions in Quebec and in most other Canadian provinces, the benefits of Men-4-Con in reducing the burden of disease would be low for a high cost.

15730,Cost-Effectiveness of Left Ventricular Assist Devices in Ambulatory Patients With Advanced Heart Failure,"OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as destination therapy in ambulatory patients with advanced heart failure. BACKGROUND: LVADs improve survival and quality of life in inotrope-dependent heart failure, but data are limited as to their value in less severely ill patients. METHODS: We determined costs of care among Medicare beneficiaries before and after LVAD implantation from 2009 to 2010. We used these costs and efficacy data from published studies in a Markov model to project the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of destination LVAD therapy compared with that of medical management. We discounted costs and benefits at 3% annually and report costs as 2016 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: The mean cost of LVAD implantation was $175,420. The mean cost of readmission was lower before LVAD than after ($12,377 vs. $19,465, respectively; p < 0.001), while monthly outpatient costs were similar ($3,364 vs. $2,974, respectively; p = 0.54). In the lifetime simulation model, LVAD increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (4.41 vs. 2.67, respectively), readmissions (13.03 vs. 6.35, respectively), and costs ($726,200 vs. $361,800, respectively) compared with medical management, yielding an ICER of $209,400 per QALY gained and $597,400 per life-year gained. These results were sensitive to LVAD readmission rates and outpatient care costs; the ICER would be $86,900 if these parameters were 50% lower. CONCLUSIONS: LVADs in non-inotrope-dependent heart failure patients improved quality of life but substantially increased lifetime costs because of frequent readmissions and costly follow-up care.

The object of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options in the treatment of advanced hormone-naive prostate cancer in China. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was carried out from the Chinese societal perspective. The efficacy data were obtained from the STAMPEDE trial and health utilities were derived from previous studies. Transition probabilities were calculated based on the survival in each group. The primary endpoint in the analysis was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and model uncertainties were explored by 1-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: SOC alone generated an effectiveness of 2.65 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a lifetime cost of $20,969.23.

15733,Addition of docetaxel and/or zoledronic acid to standard of care for hormone-naive prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of the addition of docetaxel and/or zoledronic acid to the standard of care (SOC) for hormone-naive prostate cancer has been evaluated in the STAMPEDE trial. The object of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options in the treatment of advanced hormone-naive prostate cancer in China. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was carried out from the Chinese societal perspective. The efficacy data were obtained from the STAMPEDE trial and health utilities were derived from previous studies. Transition probabilities were calculated based on the survival in each group. The primary endpoint in the analysis was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and model uncertainties were explored by 1-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: SOC alone generated an effectiveness of 2.65 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a lifetime cost of $20,969.23. At a cost of $25,001.34, SOC plus zoledronic acid was associated with 2.69 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $100,802.75/QALY compared with SOC alone.

15734,The budget impact and cost-effectiveness of defibrotide for treatment of veno-occlusive disease with multi-organ dysfunction in patients post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant,"BACKGROUND: A Phase-3 study of defibrotide compared with historical controls demonstrated a 23% improvement in 100-day survival post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) among patients with veno-occlusive disease with multi-organ dysfunction (VOD with MOD). AIM: To estimate the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing defibrotide to a transplant center. METHODS: The authors developed a budget impact model from the perspective of a bone-marrow transplant center. It was estimated that 2.3% of adults and 4.2% of children would develop VOD with MOD following HSCT based on a retrospective hospital database analysis and the effect that treating patients with defibrotide would have on costs for adult and pediatric centers was estimated. A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was also developed to capture the long-term cost-effectiveness of defibrotide. Projected life expectancies in the two groups were estimated based on trial data, transplant registry data, studies of long-term survival among HSCT patients, and US population life-tables. RESULTS: There was an estimated 3% increase ($330,706) per year in total adult transplantation center costs associated with adopting defibrotide, and a <1% increase ($106,385) for pediatric transplant centers, assuming 100 transplants per year. In the CUA, the lifetime increase in cost per patient was $106,928, life expectancy increased by 3.74 years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 2.24. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $47,736 per QALY gained; 88% probability defibrotide was cost-effective at a $100,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSION: The budget impact of defibrotide for a transplant center is relatively modest compared to the overall cost of transplantation. Defibrotide provides an important survival advantage for VOD with MOD patients, and the life years gained lead to defibrotide being highly cost-effective.",2016-01-21408,28008770,J Med Econ,David L Veenstra,2017,20 / 5,1-27,Yes,28008770,"David L Veenstra; Gregory F Guzauskas; Kathleen F Villa; Denise M Boudreau; The budget impact and cost-effectiveness of defibrotide for treatment of veno-occlusive disease with multi-organ dysfunction in patients post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant, J Med Econ, 2017 May; 20(5):1369-6998; 1-27",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Defibrotide vs. Standard/Usual Care,Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients who develop Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) with multi-organ dysfunction (MOD),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,47736,United States,2014,52187.25
15735,A discrete event simulation to model the cost-utility of fingolimod and natalizumab in rapidly evolving severe relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: Two disease-modifying therapies are licensed in the EU for use in rapidly-evolving severe (RES) relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), fingolimod and natalizumab. Here a discrete event simulation (DES) model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of natalizumab and fingolimod in the RES population, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, is reported. METHODS: A DES model was developed to track individual RES patients, based on Expanded Disability Status Scale scores. Individual patient characteristics were taken from the RES sub-groups of the pivotal trials for fingolimod. Utility data were in line with previous models. Published costs were inflated to NHS cost year 2015. Owing to the confidential patient access scheme (PAS) discount applied to fingolimod in the UK, a range of discount levels were applied to the fingolimod list price, to capture the likelihood of natalizumab being cost-effective in a real-world setting. RESULTS: At the lower National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) threshold of pound20,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), fingolimod only required a discount greater than 0.8% of list price to be cost-effective. At the upper threshold of pound30,000/QALY employed by the NICE, fingolimod was cost-effective if the confidential discount is greater than 2.5%. Sensitivity analyses conducted using fingolimod list-price showed the model to be most sensitive to changes in the cost of each drug, particularly fingolimod. CONCLUSIONS: The DES model shows that only a modest discount to the UK fingolimod list-price is required to make fingolimod a more cost-effective option than natalizumab in RES RRMS.",2016-01-21409,28008769,J Med Econ,Stephen Montgomery,2017,20 / 5,1-17,Yes,28008769,"Stephen Montgomery; Maciej Maruszczak; David Slater; Jeanette Kusel; Richard Nicholas; Nicholas Adlard; A discrete event simulation to model the cost-utility of fingolimod and natalizumab in rapidly evolving severe relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the UK, J Med Econ, 2017 May; 20(5):1369-6998; 1-17",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fingolimod vs. Natalizumab,Rapidly evolving severe (RES) relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,15313.06,United Kingdom,2015,25558.29
15736,The cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide versus liraglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Spain in patients with BMI >/=30 kg/m2,"OBJECTIVE: Dulaglutide 1.5 mg once weekly is a novel glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, for the treatment of type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide once weekly vs liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily for the treatment of T2DM in Spain in patients with a BMI >/=30 kg/m2. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to estimate costs and outcomes from the perspective of Spanish National Health System, capturing relevant direct medical costs over a lifetime time horizon. Comparative safety and efficacy data were derived from direct comparison of dulaglutide 1.5 mg vs liraglutide 1.8 mg from the AWARD-6 trial in patients with a body mass index (BMI) >/=30 kg/m2. All patients were assumed to remain on treatment for 2 years before switching treatment to basal insulin at a daily dose of 40 IU. One-way sensitivity analyses (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore the sensitivity of the model to plausible variations in key parameters and uncertainty of model inputs. RESULTS: Under base case assumptions, dulaglutide 1.5 mg was less costly and more effective vs liraglutide 1.8 mg (total lifetime costs euro108,489 vs euro109,653; total QALYS 10.281 vs 10.259). OWSA demonstrated that dulaglutide 1.5 mg remained dominant given plausible variations in key input parameters. Results of the PSA were consistent with base case results. LIMITATIONS: Primary limitations of the analysis are common to other cost-effectiveness analyses of chronic diseases like T2DM and include the extrapolation of short-term clinical data to the lifetime time horizon and uncertainty around optimum treatment durations. CONCLUSION: The model found that dulaglutide 1.5 mg was more effective and less costly than liraglutide 1.8 mg for the treatment of T2DM in Spain. Findings were robust to plausible variations in inputs.

15739,Potential Cost-Effectiveness of an Influenza Vaccination Program Offering Microneedle Patch for Vaccine Delivery in Children,"OBJECTIVE: The influenza vaccine coverage rate of children is low in Hong Kong. Microneedle patches (MNPs) is a technology under development for painless delivery of vaccines. This study aimed to examine the potential clinical outcomes and direct medical costs of an influenza program offering MNP vaccine to children who have declined intramuscular (IM) vaccine in Hong Kong. METHODS: A decision model was designed to compare potential outcomes between IM vaccine program and a program offering MNP vaccine to those declined IM vaccine (IM/MNP program) in a hypothetical cohort of children over one-year time horizon. The model outcomes included direct medical cost, influenza infection rate, mortality rate, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss. Model inputs were retrieved from published literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of model results. RESULTS: In base-case analysis, IM/MNP program was more costly per child (USD19.13 versus USD13.69; USD1 = HKD7.8) with lower influenza infection rate (98.9 versus 124.8 per 1,000 children), hospitalization rate (0.83 versus 1.05 per 1,000 children) and influenza-related mortality rate (0.00042 versus 0.00052 per 1,000 children) when compared to IM program. The incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER) of IM/MNP program versus IM program was 27,200 USD/QALY. Using gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Hong Kong (USD40,594) as threshold of willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY, one-way sensitivity analysis found ICER of IM/MNP to exceed WTP when duration of illness in outpatient setting was <5.7 days or cost per MNP vaccine was >1.39-time of IM vaccine cost. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, IM/MNP program was the preferred option in 57.28% and 91.68% of the time, using 1x and 3x GDP per capita as WTP threshold, respectively.

Apixaban resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness of US$39,351, US$27,039, US$41,298, and US$48,896 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg, respectively. In Monte-Carlo analyses, apixaban 5 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, warfarin, and dabigatran 110 mg were cost effective in 83, 10.4, 7, and 0.8%, respectively, of the simulations using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$50,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was more cost effective than warfarin, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with AF.

15745,Cost-Effectiveness of a National Opportunistic Screening Program for Atrial Fibrillation in Ireland,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a national atrial fibrillation screening program in Ireland involving annual opportunistic pulse palpation of all those older than 65 years during general practitioner consultations, with an electrocardiogram being performed if an irregular pulse is detected. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was used to simulate costs and clinical outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of men and women with and without screening over the course of 25 years, using a societal perspective. RESULTS: Screening was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro23,004/quality-adjusted life-year compared with routine care. Nevertheless, if the relative risk of stroke and systematic embolism in screen-detected patients is more than 12% lower than that in patients with atrial fibrillation identified through routine practice, then screening would not be considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro45,000/quality-adjusted life-year. An analysis comparing alternative combinations of start age and screening interval found that less frequent screening with a later start age may be more cost-effective than an annual screening from age 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Annual opportunistic screening of men and women aged 65 years and older in primary care in Ireland is likely to be cost-effective using conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds, assuming that those detected through screening have a comparable stroke risk profile as those detected through routine practice. Raising the start age of screening or increasing the screening interval may improve the cost-effectiveness of a prospective screening program.",2016-01-21448,27987649,Value Health,Patrick S Moran,2016,19 / 8,985-995,Yes,27987649,"Patrick S Moran; Conor Teljeur; Patricia Harrington; Susan M Smith; Breda Smyth; Joseph Harbison; Charles Normand; Mairin Ryan; Cost-Effectiveness of a National Opportunistic Screening Program for Atrial Fibrillation in Ireland, Value Health, 2016 Dec; 19(8):1098-3015; 985-995",QALY,Ireland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual opportunistic aarial fibrillation (AF) screening program vs. None,with irregular pulse,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,5.00,5.00,23004,Euro,2014,33439.97
15746,Cost-Effectiveness of Quadrivalent versus Trivalent Influenza Vaccine in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Designed to overcome influenza B mismatch, new quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) contain one additional B strain compared with trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs). OBJECTIVE: To examine the expected public health impact, budget impact, and incremental cost-effectiveness of QIV versus TIV in the United States. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was used to predict the annual incidence of influenza over the 20-year-period of 2014 to 2034 under either a TIV program or a QIV program. A decision tree model was interfaced with the transmission model to estimate the public health impact and the cost-effectiveness of replacing TIV with QIV from a societal perspective. Our models were informed by published data from the United States on influenza complication probabilities and relevant costs. The incremental vaccine price of QIV as compared with that of TIV was set at US $5.40 per dose. RESULTS: Over the next 20 years, replacing TIV with QIV may reduce the number of influenza B cases by 27.2% (16.0 million cases), resulting in the prevention of 137,600 hospitalizations and 16,100 deaths and a gain of 212,000 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The net societal budget impact would be US $5.8 billion and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio US $27,411/QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 100% and 96.5% of the simulations fell below US $100,000/QALY and US $50,000/QALY, respectively.

15747,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nivolumab Compared with Ipilimumab for the Treatment of BRAF Wild-Type Advanced Melanoma in Australia,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab versus ipilimumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with BRAF-advanced melanoma (BRAF-AM) from an Australian health system perspective. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to simulate the progress of Australian patients with BRAF-AM. The model had a 10-year time horizon with outcomes discounted at 5% annually. For the nivolumab group, risks of progression and death were based on those observed in the nivolumab arm of a phase III trial (nivolumab vs. dacarbazine). Progression-free survival and overall survival were extrapolated using parametric survival modeling with a log-logistic distribution. In the absence of head-to-head evidence, overall survival and progression-free survival for ipilimumab were estimated on the basis of an indirect comparison using published data. Costs of managing AM were estimated from a survey of Australian clinicians. The cost of ipilimumab was based on the reimbursement price in Australia. The cost of nivolumab was based on expected reimbursement prices in Australia. Quality-of-life data were obtained within the trial using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. RESULTS: Compared with ipilimumab, nivolumab therapy over 10 years was estimated to yield 1.58 life-years and 1.30 quality-adjusted life-years per person, at a (discounted) net cost of US $39,039 per person. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for nivolumab compared with ipilimumab were US $25,101 per year of life saved and $30,475 per quality-adjusted life-year saved.

15748,Operative Treatment of Rib Fractures in Flail Chest Injuries: A Meta-analysis and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Flail chest is a common injury sustained by patients who experience high-energy blunt chest trauma and results in severe respiratory compromise because of altered mechanics of respiration. There has been increased interest in operative fixation of these injuries with the intention of restoring the mechanical integrity of the chest wall, and several studies have shown that ventilation requirements and pulmonary complications may be decreased with operative intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fixation of rib fractures in flail chest injuries using cost-effectiveness analysis, supported by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: This was a 2-part study in which we initially conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on outcomes after operative fixation of flail chest injuries, evaluating intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, pneumonia, and need for tracheostomy. The results were then applied to a decision-analysis model comparing the costs and outcomes of operative fixation versus nonoperative treatment. The validity of the results was tested using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Operative treatment decreased mortality, pneumonia, and tracheotomy (risk ratios of 0.44, 0.59, and 0.52, respectively), as well as time in ICU and total LOS (3.3 and 4.8 days, respectively). Operative fixation was associated with higher costs than nonoperative treatment ($23,682 vs. $8629 per case, respectively) and superior outcomes (32.60 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) vs. 30.84 QALY), giving it an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $8577/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical fixation of rib fractures sustained from flail chest injuries decreased ICU time, mortality, pulmonary complications, and hospital LOS and resulted in improved health care-related outcomes and was a cost-effective intervention. These results were sensitive to overall complication rates, and operations should be conducted by surgeons or combined surgical teams comfortable with both thoracic anatomy and exposures as well as with the principles and techniques of internal fixation.

15749,Should HIV testing for all pregnant women continue? Cost-effectiveness of universal antenatal testing compared to focused approaches across high to very low HIV prevalence settings,"INTRODUCTION: HIV testing is the entry point for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Decreasing external funding for the HIV response in some low- and middle-income countries has triggered the question of whether a focused approach to HIV testing targeting pregnant women in high-burden areas should be considered. This study aimed at determining and comparing the cost-effectiveness of universal and focused HIV testing approaches for pregnant women across high to very low HIV prevalence settings. METHODS: We conducted a modelling analysis on health and cost outcomes of HIV testing for pregnant women using four country-based case scenarios (Namibia, Kenya, Haiti and Viet Nam) to illustrate high, intermediate, low and very low HIV prevalence settings. We used subnational prevalence data to divide each country into high-, medium- and low-burden areas, and modelled different antenatal and testing coverage in each. RESULTS: When HIV testing services were only focused in high-burden areas within a country, mother-to-child transmission rates remained high ranging from 18 to 23%, resulting in a 25 to 69% increase in new paediatric HIV infections and increased future treatment costs for children. Universal HIV testing was found to be dominant (i.e. more QALYs gained with less cost) compared to focused approaches in the Namibia, Kenya and Haiti scenarios. The universal approach was also very cost-effective compared to focused approaches, with $ 125 per quality-adjusted life years gained in the Viet Nam-based scenario of very low HIV prevalence. Sensitivity analysis further supported the findings.

Decreasing external funding for the HIV response in some low- and middle-income countries has triggered the question of whether a focused approach to HIV testing targeting pregnant women in high-burden areas should be considered. This study aimed at determining and comparing the cost-effectiveness of universal and focused HIV testing approaches for pregnant women across high to very low HIV prevalence settings. METHODS: We conducted a modelling analysis on health and cost outcomes of HIV testing for pregnant women using four country-based case scenarios (Namibia, Kenya, Haiti and Viet Nam) to illustrate high, intermediate, low and very low HIV prevalence settings. We used subnational prevalence data to divide each country into high-, medium- and low-burden areas, and modelled different antenatal and testing coverage in each. RESULTS: When HIV testing services were only focused in high-burden areas within a country, mother-to-child transmission rates remained high ranging from 18 to 23%, resulting in a 25 to 69% increase in new paediatric HIV infections and increased future treatment costs for children.

15761,Should all anticoagulated patients with head injury receive a CT scan? Decision-analysis modelling of an observational cohort,"OBJECTIVES: It is not currently clear whether all anticoagulated patients with a head injury should receive CT scanning or only those with evidence of traumatic brain injury (eg, loss of consciousness or amnesia). We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CT for all compared with selective CT use for anticoagulated patients with a head injury. DESIGN: Decision-analysis modelling of data from a multicentre observational study. SETTING: 33 emergency departments in England and Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 3566 adults (aged >/=16 years) who had suffered blunt head injury, were taking warfarin and underwent selective CT scanning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimated expected benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were the entire cohort to receive a CT scan; estimated increased costs of CT and also the potential cost implications associated with patient survival and improved health. These values were used to estimate the cost per QALY of implementing a strategy of CT for all patients compared with observed practice based on guidelines recommending selective CT use. RESULTS: Of the 1420 of 3534 patients (40%) who did not receive a CT scan, 7 (0.5%) suffered a potentially avoidable head injury-related adverse outcome. If CT scanning had been performed in all patients, appropriate treatment could have gained 3.41 additional QALYs but would have incurred pound193 149 additional treatment costs and pound130 683 additional CT costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound94 895/QALY gained for unselective compared with selective CT use is markedly above the threshold of pound20-30 000/QALY used by the UK National Institute for Care Excellence to determine cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: CT scanning for all anticoagulated patients with head injury is not cost-effective compared with selective use of CT scanning based on guidelines recommending scanning only for those with evidence of traumatic brain injury.

DESIGN: A Markov decision model populated using data from updated systematic reviews and meta-analyses, with attributable costs from NHS sources. Data on local control and mortality were obtained from updates of existing systematic reviews conducted for the NICE guideline on cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract. Procedure costs were sourced from NHS reference costs 2013/14 by applying tariffs associated with the appropriate health resource group code SETTING: The UK National Health Service. POPULATION: Patients with early stage (T1 and T2) cancers of the laryngeal glottis. INTERVENTIONS: Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and radiation therapy (RT). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total costs, incremental costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Radiation therapy as the initial treatment strategy was found to be more expensive ( pound2654 versus pound623) and less effective (QALY reduction of 0.141 and 0.04 in T1a and T1b-T2 laryngeal cancers, respectively) than TLM.

A once-daily oral regimen of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) for 12 weeks was found to be a safe and efficacious treatment for HCV in patients with CKD. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of EBR/GZR in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced CKD patients compared with no treatment (NoTx) and pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (peg-IFN/RBV) using a computer-based model of the natural history of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, CKD and liver disease. Data on baseline characteristics of the simulated patients were obtained from NHANES, 2000-2010. Model inputs were estimated from published studies. Cost of treatment with EBR/GZR and peg-INF/RBV were based on wholesale acquisition cost. All costs were from a third-party payer perspective and were expressed in 2015 U.S. dollars. We estimated lifetime incidence of liver-related complications, liver transplantation, kidney transplantation, end-stage live disease mortality and end-stage renal disease mortality; lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALY); and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR). The model predicted that EBR/GZR will significantly reduce the incidence of liver-related complications and prolong life in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection and CKD compared with NoTx or use of peg-IFN/RBV. EBR/GZR-based regimens resulted in higher average remaining QALYs and higher costs (11.5716, $191 242) compared with NoTx (8.9199, $156 236) or peg-INF/RBV (10.2857, $186 701). Peg-IFN/RBV is not cost-effective, and the ICUR of EBR/GZR compared with NoTx was $13 200/QALY. Treatment of a patient on haemodialysis with EBR/GZR resulted in a higher ICUR ($217 000/QALY).

15766,A Trial-Based Economic Evaluation Comparing Spinal Cord Stimulation With Best Medical Treatment in Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,"The objective was to perform an economic evaluation comparing spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in combination with best medical treatment (BMT) with BMT in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients. Alongside a prospective 2-center randomized controlled trial, involving 36 painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients with severe lower limb pain not responding to conventional therapy, an economic evaluation was performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were based on: 1) societal costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 2) direct health care costs and the number of successfully treated patients, respectively, both with a time horizon of 12 months. Bootstrap and secondary analyses were performed to address uncertainty. Total societal cost amounted to euro26,539.18 versus euro5,313.45 per patient in the SCS and BMT group, respectively. QALYs were .58 versus .36 and the number of successfully treated patients was 55% versus 7% for the SCS and BMT group, respectively. This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro94,159.56 per QALY and euro34,518.85 per successfully treated patient, respectively. Bootstrap analyses showed that the probability of SCS being cost-effective ranges from 0 to 46% with willingness to pay threshold values ranging between euro20,000 and euro80,000 for a QALY. Secondary analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of SCS became more favorable after correcting for baseline cost imbalance between the 2 groups, extending the depreciation period of SCS material to 4 years, and extrapolation of the data up to 4 years. Although SCS was considerably more effective compared with BMT, the substantial initial investment that is required resulted in SCS not being cost-effective in the short term. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to baseline cost imbalances between the groups and the depreciation period of the SCS material. PERSPECTIVE: Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and the humanistic and economic burden is high. This article presents the cost-effectiveness of SCS in patients suffering from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy from a societal and health care perspective with a time horizon of 12 months.",2016-01-21487,27965045,J Pain,Rachel Slangen,2017,18 / 4,,No,27965045,"Rachel Slangen; Catharina G Faber; Nicolaas C Schaper; Elbert A Joosten; Robert T van Dongen; Alfons G Kessels; Maarten van Kleef; Carmen D Dirksen; A Trial-Based Economic Evaluation Comparing Spinal Cord Stimulation With Best Medical Treatment in Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, J Pain, 2017 Apr; 18(4):1526-5900",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Spinal cord stimulation in combination with best medical treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- Best medical treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,4.00,1.50,94159.56,Euro,2012,136485.04

Interferon-free treatment represents an opportunity for these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) in CHC elderly patients. METHODS: A Markov model of CHC natural history was built. This study focuses on CHC patients older than 65 years, stratified according to genotype (1/4, 2 and 3), liver fibrosis (METAVIR F1 to F4), age and frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail and frail). DAAs combination vs no treatment was simulated for each theoretical population, assessing life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in a lifetime time horizon and by the Healthcare System perspective. RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased with age and frailty status in all fibrosis stages. For robust F3 and F4 patients ICERs remained below the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of 40 000euro/QALY up to age 75 and 86 years, respectively, depending on drug price and sustained virological response probability (sensitivity analysis). Notably, in F4 and frail subjects older than 75 years, ICER was more sensitive to non-liver-related mortality rate. In elderly F1 and F2 patients, ICERs were below WTP only up to 77 years old, with wide variability among frailty phenotypes.

Notably, in F4 and frail subjects older than 75 years, ICER was more sensitive to non-liver-related mortality rate. In elderly F1 and F2 patients, ICERs were below WTP only up to 77 years old, with wide variability among frailty phenotypes.
