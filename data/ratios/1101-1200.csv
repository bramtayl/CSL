1101,Optimal management strategy for use of compression US for deep venous thrombosis in symptomatic patients: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors' purpose was to identify the optimal strategy for using compression ultrasonography (US) in patients suspected of having deep venous thrombosis (DVT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors developed a decision-analytic model representing the natural history of DVT and the benefits and risks of anticoagulation therapy. They evaluated six initial imaging strategies: (a) unilateral examination of the common femoral and popliteal veins; (b) unilateral examination of the common femoral, popliteal, and femoral veins; (c) bilateral examination of the common femoral and popliteal veins; (d) bilateral examination of the common femoral, popliteal, and femoral veins; (e) complete unilateral examination of the symptomatic leg (including calf veins); and (f) complete bilateral examination of both legs. RESULTS: For 65-year-old men with unilateral symptoms of DVT, the most effective strategy was bilateral examination of the common femoral and popliteal veins with anticoagulation therapy in patients with proximal DVT and follow-up bilateral examination of the common femoral and popliteal veins in patients without an initial diagnosis of DVT with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $39,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that bilateral examination limited to the common femoral and popliteal veins, with follow-up bilateral examination limited to the common femoral and popliteal veins, was as cost-effective as other well-accepted medical interventions. The results were sensitive to the distribution of clot, diagnostic accuracy of compression US, and probability of bleeding with long-term morbidity.",2000-01-02089,10730161,Acad Radiol,H M Kim,2000,7 / 2,67-76,No,10730161,"H M Kim; K M Kuntz; J J Cronan; Optimal management strategy for use of compression US for deep venous thrombosis in symptomatic patients: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Acad Radiol, 2000-Feb; 7(2):1076-6332; 67-76",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Complete unilateral examination; unilateral popliteal follow-up examination for calf deep vein thrombosis vs. Unilateral common femoral, popliteal examination; no follow-up examination",Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,3373.49,United States,1996,5564.67

1106,"Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) in breast cancer--is it cost-effective?","Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) may expose patients to morbidity, with little gain in outcome. Treatment with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) has been the standard ACT in several countries for decades. In this model, efficacy, tolerability and quality of life data from the English-language literature were incorporated with Norwegian standard ACT practice and cost data in a cost-effectiveness/cost-utility approach. The CMF efficacy was calculated as 2.45 years saved per patient treated. The quality of life was assumed diminished by 0.33 (0-1 scale) for 6 months and the life years gained were valued Q = 0.86. An 85% dose intensity was employed, one British pound ( 1) was calculated as 12 NOK and a 5% discount rate was used. The total cost of adjuvant CMF, including amounts spent on drugs, administration, travelling and production loss, was calculated to 2365- 6253, depending on the method chosen. Money spent on drugs alone constituted 13-34%. The cost per life year saved was measured as 2170- 5737. A cost-utility approach revealed a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of 2973- 7860.

1107,A cost-effectiveness analysis of prescribing strategies in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease,"OBJECTIVE: Patients who have uncomplicated gastroesophageal-reflux disease (GERD) typically present with heartburn and acid regurgitation. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) as first-line empiric therapy for patients with typical symptoms of GERD. METHODS: Decision analysis comparing costs and benefits of empirical treatment with H2RAs and PPIs for patients presenting with typical GERD was employed. The six treatment arms in the model were: 1) Lifestyle therapy, including antacids; 2) H2RA therapy, with endoscopy performed if no response to H2RAs; 3) Step up (H2RA-PPI) Arm: H2RA followed by PPI therapy in the case of symptomatic failure; 4) Step down arm: PPI therapy followed by H2RA if symptomatic response to PPI, and antacid therapy if response to H2RA therapy; 5) PPI-on-demand therapy: 8 wk of treatment for symptomatic recurrence, with no more than three courses per year; and 6) PPI-continuous therapy. Measurements were lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Initial therapy with PPIs followed by on-demand therapy was the most cost-effective approach, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $20,934 per QALY gained for patients with moderate to severe GERD symptoms, and $37,923 for patients with mild GERD symptoms. This therapy was also associated with the greatest gain in discounted QALYs. The PPI-on-demand strategy was more effective and less costly than the H2RA followed by PPI strategy or the other treatment arms. The results were not highly sensitive to cost of therapy, QALY adjustment from GERD symptoms, or the success rate of the lifestyle arm. However, when the success rate of the PPI-on-demand arm was < or =59%, the H2RA-PPI arm was the preferred strategy.

METHODS: Decision analysis comparing costs and benefits of empirical treatment with H2RAs and PPIs for patients presenting with typical GERD was employed. The six treatment arms in the model were: 1) Lifestyle therapy, including antacids; 2) H2RA therapy, with endoscopy performed if no response to H2RAs; 3) Step up (H2RA-PPI) Arm: H2RA followed by PPI therapy in the case of symptomatic failure; 4) Step down arm: PPI therapy followed by H2RA if symptomatic response to PPI, and antacid therapy if response to H2RA therapy; 5) PPI-on-demand therapy: 8 wk of treatment for symptomatic recurrence, with no more than three courses per year; and 6) PPI-continuous therapy. Measurements were lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Initial therapy with PPIs followed by on-demand therapy was the most cost-effective approach, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $20,934 per QALY gained for patients with moderate to severe GERD symptoms, and $37,923 for patients with mild GERD symptoms. This therapy was also associated with the greatest gain in discounted QALYs. The PPI-on-demand strategy was more effective and less costly than the H2RA followed by PPI strategy or the other treatment arms. The results were not highly sensitive to cost of therapy, QALY adjustment from GERD symptoms, or the success rate of the lifestyle arm. However, when the success rate of the PPI-on-demand arm was < or =59%, the H2RA-PPI arm was the preferred strategy. CONCLUSION: For patients with moderate to severe symptoms of GERD, initial treatment with PPIs followed by on-demand therapy is a cost-effective approach.",2000-01-02091,10685741,Am J Gastroenterol,L B Gerson,2000,95 / 2,395-407,No,10685741,"L B Gerson; A S Robbins; A Garber; J Hornberger; G Triadafilopoulos; A cost-effectiveness analysis of prescribing strategies in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease, Am J Gastroenterol, 2000-Feb; 95(2):0002-9270; 395-407",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on demand vs. H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) step up if no symptom relief,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,1999,Not Stated

1117,Cost effectiveness of vaccination strategies in adults without a history of chickenpox,"PURPOSE: Some authorities recommend varicella antibody testing or vaccination for adults without a history of chickenpox, but the cost effectiveness of these interventions is uncertain. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using a Markov decision model, we estimated the cost effectiveness of three strategies for adults with no history of chickenpox: no vaccination, varicella antibody testing followed by vaccination for those without antibody, and vaccinating all. Societal and third-party payer perspectives were taken, with costs and benefits discounted at 3% per year. Assumptions for the baseline analysis were chosen to bias against no vaccination. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis for 20- to 29-year-old patients, testing followed by vaccination compared with no vaccination is cost saving from a societal perspective and costs $6,670 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a third-party payer perspective. When less favorable assumptions are used, results are sensitive to the rates of compliance with vaccination follow-up; testing followed by vaccination costs more than $50,000 per QALY if <75% comply. For patients 30 years of age and older, the incremental cost of testing followed by vaccination is at least $97,100 per QALY compared with no vaccination, with costs greater than $50,000 per QALY unless testing costs less than $7.73, the chickenpox case-fatality rate is >0.067% (baseline 0.025%), or immunity with no chickenpox history is <25% (baseline 71%). In either age group, vaccinating all has an incremental cost of $2 to $16 million per QALY gained compared with testing followed by vaccination. CONCLUSION: Testing followed by vaccination for varicella in US adults aged 20 to 29 years may be cost effective by conventional criteria but is sensitive to rates of compliance with vaccination protocols.

1121,Outcomes and cost-effectiveness of ventilator support and aggressive care for patients with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome,"PURPOSE: Many patients with acute respiratory failure die despite prolonged and costly treatment. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of providing rather than withholding mechanical ventilation and intensive care for patients with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 1,005 patients enrolled in a five-center study of seriously ill patients (the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments [SUPPORT]) with acute respiratory failure (pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and an Acute Physiology Score > or =10) who required ventilator support. We estimated life expectancy based on long-term follow-up of SUPPORT patients. Utilities were estimated using time-tradeoff questions. Costs (in 1998 dollars) were based on hospital fiscal data and Medicare data. RESULTS: Of the 963 patients who received ventilator support, 48% survived for at least 6 months. At 6 months, survivors reported a median of 1 dependence in activities of daily living, and 72% rated their quality of life as good, very good, or excellent. Among the 42 patients in whom ventilator support was withheld, the median survival was 3 days. Among patients whose estimated probability of surviving at least 2 months from the time of ventilator support (""prognostic estimate"") was 70% or more, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved by providing rather than withholding ventilator support and aggressive care was $29,000. For medium-risk patients (prognostic estimate 51% to 70%), the incremental cost-effectiveness was $44,000 per QALY, and for high-risk patients (prognostic estimate < or =50%), it was $110,000 per QALY. When assumptions were varied from 50% to 200% of baseline estimates, the results ranged from $19,000 to $48,000 for low-risk patients, from $29,000 to $76, 000 for medium-risk patients, and from $67,000 to $200,000 for high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator support and intensive care for acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome are relatively cost-effective for patients with >50% probability of surviving 2 months.

1124,HIV transmission and the cost-effectiveness of methadone maintenance,"OBJECTIVES: This study determined the cost-effectiveness of expanding methadone maintenance treatment for heroin addiction, particularly its effect on the HIV epidemic. METHODS: We developed a dynamic epidemic model to study the effects of increased methadone maintenance capacity on health care costs and survival, measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We considered communities with HIV prevalence among injection drug users of 5% and 40%. RESULTS: Additional methadone maintenance capacity costs $8200 per QALY gained in the high-prevalence community and $10,900 per QALY gained in the low-prevalence community. More than half of the benefits are gained by individuals who do not inject drugs. Even if the benefits realized by treated and untreated injection drug users are ignored, methadone maintenance expansion costs between $14,100 and $15,200 per QALY gained. Additional capacity remains cost-effective even if it is twice as expensive and half as effective as current methadone maintenance slots.

1126,The cost-effectiveness of sildenafil,"BACKGROUND: Coverage of sildenafil by health insurance plans is a contentious issue. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sildenafil treatment for erectile dysfunction. DESIGN: A Markov decision model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of sildenafil compared with no drug therapy. DATA SOURCES: Values for the efficacy and safety of sildenafil and quality-of-life utilities were obtained from the published medical literature. Base-case values were chosen to bias against sildenafil use. TARGET POPULATION: Men 60 years of age with erectile dysfunction. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal and third-party payer. INTERVENTION: Sildenafil or no treatment in identical hypothetical cohorts. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost per QALY gained for sildenafil treatment compared with no therapy was $11,290 from the societal perspective and $11,230 from the third-party payer perspective. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: From the societal perspective, the cost per QALY gained associated with sildenafil was less than $50,000 if treatment-related morbidity was less than 0.8% per year, mortality was less than 0.55% per year, treatment was successful in more than 40.2% of patients, or sildenafil cost less than $244 per month. The results were sensitive to variation of erectile dysfunction utilities, but cost per QALY gained was less than $50,000 if successful treatment increased utility values by 0.05 or more on a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).

1127,Watchful waiting with periodic liver biopsy versus immediate empirical therapy for histologically mild chronic hepatitis C. A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Not all patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C progress to cirrhosis. OBJECTIVE: To compare no antiviral treatment, periodic liver biopsy with subsequent antiviral treatment for moderate hepatitis or cirrhosis, and immediate antiviral therapy. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Clinical trial data and published studies. TARGET POPULATION: Hepatitis C virus-infected patients with histologically mild hepatitis. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Immediate combination antiviral treatment or biopsy every 3 years plus combination antiviral therapy for moderate hepatitis or cirrhosis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Over 20 years, biopsy every 3 years with treatment of moderate hepatitis would avoid treatment in 50% of the cohort and would result in an 18% likelihood of cirrhosis compared with 16% for immediate treatment and 27% for no antiviral therapy. Immediate antiviral treatment should increase life expectancy by 1.0 quality-adjusted life-year compared with biopsy management. Over an average lifetime, biopsy management would lead to six liver biopsies costing $6200; immediate antiviral treatment would cost $5100 less than biopsy management because of savings related to biopsy and prevention of future hepatitis C-related morbidity. Immediate therapy was cost-effective compared with biopsy management and had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $7000 compared with no antiviral therapy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: When age, sex, genotype, and estimates of histologic progression or compliance with follow-up are varied, immediate therapy should result in an increase of at least 0. 8 quality-adjusted life-year compared with biopsy management.

1130,Cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation for supraventricular tachycardia,"BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation is an established but expensive treatment option for many forms of supraventricular tachycardia. Most cases of supraventricular tachycardia are not life-threatening; the goal of therapy is therefore to improve the patient's quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation with that of medical management of supraventricular tachycardia. DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: Costs were estimated from a major academic hospital and the literature, and treatment efficacy was estimated from reports from clinical studies at major medical centers. Probabilities of clinical outcomes were estimated from the literature. To account for the effect of radiofrequency ablation on quality of life, assessments by patients who had undergone the procedure were used. TARGET POPULATION: Cohort of symptomatic patients who experienced 4.6 unscheduled visits per year to an emergency department or a physician's office while receiving long-term drug therapy for supraventricular tachycardia. TIME HORIZON: Patient lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Initial radiofrequency ablation, long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and treatment of acute episodes of arrhythmia with antiarrhythmic drugs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, life-years, and marginal cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among patients who have monthly episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, radiofrequency ablation was the most effective and least expensive therapy and therefore dominated the drug therapy options. Radiofrequency ablation improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 3.10 quality-adjusted life-years and reduced lifetime medical expenditures by $27 900 compared with long-term drug therapy. Long-term drug therapy was more effective and had lower costs than episodic drug therapy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The findings were highly robust over substantial variations in assumptions about the efficacy and complication rate of radiofrequency ablation, including analyses in which the complication rate was tripled and efficacy was decreased substantially.

1133,Cost-effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering therapies according to selected patient characteristics,"BACKGROUND: The National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel II) recommends treatment guidelines based on cholesterol level and number of risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how the cost-effectiveness ratios of cholesterol-lowering therapies vary according to different risk factors. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published data. TARGET POPULATION: Women and men 35 to 84 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 4.1 mmol/L or greater (> or =160 mg/dL), divided into 240 risk subgroups according to age, sex, and the presence or absence of four coronary heart disease risk factors (smoking status, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level). TIME HORIZON: 30 years. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Step I diet, statin therapy, and no preventive treatment for primary and secondary prevention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for primary prevention with step I diet ranged from $1900 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained to $500000 per QALY depending on risk subgroup characteristics. Primary prevention with a statin compared with diet therapy was $54000 per QALY to $1400000 per QALY. Secondary prevention with a statin cost less than $50000 per QALY for all risk subgroups.

Primary prevention with a step I diet seems to be cost-effective for most risk subgroups but may not be cost-effective for otherwise healthy young women. Primary prevention with a statin may not be cost-effective for younger men and women with few risk factors, given the option of secondary prevention and of primary prevention in older age ranges. Secondary prevention with a statin seems to be cost-effective for all risk subgroups and is cost-saving in some high-risk subgroups.",2000-01-02098,10819699,Ann Intern Med,L A Prosser,2000,132 / 10,769-79,No,10819699,"L A Prosser; A A Stinnett; P A Goldman; L W Williams; M G Hunink; L Goldman; M C Weinstein; Cost-effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering therapies according to selected patient characteristics, Ann Intern Med, 2000-May-16; 132(10):1539-3704; 769-79",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Secondary prevention with statin therapy vs. Primary prevention with step I diet,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,1997,Not Stated
1136,Cost-effectiveness of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor therapy in older patients with myocardial infarction,"BACKGROUND: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy has proven efficacy in reducing the rate of coronary and cerebrovascular events in patients 75 years of age or younger with a history of myocardial infarction. However, in patients older than 75 years of age, the efficacy and potential cost-effectiveness of statins are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of statin therapy compared with usual care in patients 75 to 84 years of age with previous myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published data from cohort studies. TARGET POPULATION: Patients 75 to 84 years of age with a history of myocardial infarction. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Statin therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of statin therapy compared with usual care in patients 75 to 84 years of age with previous myocardial infarction was $18800 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: On the basis of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there is a 75% chance that statin therapy costs less than $39800 per QALY compared with usual care. If the cost of statin therapy and efficacy of statin therapy at reducing myocardial infarction were set to their most favorable values, statin therapy cost $5400 per QALY; if cost and efficacy were set to their least favorable values, statin therapy cost $97800 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness ratios of statin therapy in older patients with previous myocardial infarction are reasonable under a wide variety of assumptions about drug efficacy, drug cost, and rates of cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Pending results of randomized, controlled trials of secondary prevention in patients in this age group, statin therapy seems to be as cost-effective as many routinely accepted medical interventions in this setting.",2000-01-02099,10819700,Ann Intern Med,D A Ganz,2000,132 / 10,780-7,No,10819700,"D A Ganz; K M Kuntz; G A Jacobson; J Avorn; Cost-effectiveness of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor therapy in older patients with myocardial infarction, Ann Intern Med, 2000-May-16; 132(10):1539-3704; 780-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Statin therapy (3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme) vs. Usual care,Not Stated,84 Years,75 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,18800,United States,1998,29850.59
1137,Cost-utility analysis of second-line hormonal therapy in advanced breast cancer: a comparison of two aromatase inhibitors to megestrol acetate,"Randomized trials comparing the aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole and letrozole, to megestrol acetate (MA) in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer demonstrated that both agents are better tolerated than MA with comparable efficacy. In addition, one trial revealed that tumor response and time to treatment failure were significantly better with letrozole. Since oncologists are faced with a choice between three agents with at least comparable efficacy but different toxicity profiles and cost, a cost-utility analysis was conducted to quantify these differences and to determine if the new agents are more cost-effective than MA. In the absence of a randomized three-arm trial, a decision model was developed to simulate the most common therapeutic outcomes. The clinical data were obtained from an overview analysis of randomized trials. Total hospital resource consumption was collected from 87 patients with advanced disease that had failed second-line hormonal therapy. Utility estimates were obtained from interviewing a random sample of 25 women from the general public and 25 female health care professionals using the Time Trade-Off technique. The model suggested a similar duration of quality-adjusted progression-free survival between drugs (letrozole 150 days, anastrozole 153 days and MA 146 days). Letrozole had an overall cost of Can$2949 per patient which was comparable to MA at Can$2966 per patient. In contrast, anastrozole was slightly more costly than MA at $Can3149 per patient, respectively. The analysis revealed that letrozole has comparable overall costs relative to MA while providing at least equivalent quality-adjusted progression-free survival. These outcomes were largely related to its higher tumor response rate, which translated to a lower proportion of patients requiring chemotherapy.

1139,Cost-effectiveness of new antiplatelet regimens used as secondary prevention of stroke or transient ischemic attack,"BACKGROUND: Compared with aspirin alone, use of the new antiplatelet regimens, including aspirin combined with dipyridamole and clopidogrel bisulfate, has been found to further reduce the risk of stroke and other vascular events in patients who have experienced stroke or transient ischemic attack. However, their cost-effectiveness ratios relative to aspirin alone have not been estimated. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to measure the clinical benefits and the economic consequences of the following strategies to treat high-risk patients aged 65 years or older: (1) aspirin, 325 mg/d; (2) aspirin, 50 mg/d, and dipyridamole, 400 mg/d; and (3) clopidogrel bisulfate, 75 mg/d. Input data were obtained by literature review. Outcomes were expressed as US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: The use of aspirin combined with dipyridamole was more effective and less costly compared with the use of aspirin alone, providing a gain of 0.3 QALY for a 65-year-old patient. This regimen remained cost-effective despite wide sensitivity analyses. Clopidogrel was more effective and more costly compared with aspirin alone, yielding a gain of 0.2 QALY with a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $26,580 per each additional QALY (patient aged 65 years). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the efficacy of clopidogrel and its cost were key factors in determining its cost-effectiveness ratio compared with aspirin, which exceeded $50,000 when its efficacy decreased by half or its cost doubled. CONCLUSION: To prevent stroke in high-risk patients, dipyridamole combined with aspirin was more effective and less costly than aspirin alone, and clopidogrel was cost-effective compared with current standards of medical practice, except in extreme scenarios.",2000-01-02101,11025787,Arch Intern Med,F P Sarasin,2000,160 / 18,2773-8,No,11025787,"F P Sarasin; J M Gaspoz; H Bounameaux; Cost-effectiveness of new antiplatelet regimens used as secondary prevention of stroke or transient ischemic attack, Arch Intern Med, 2000-Oct-09; 160(18):0003-9926; 2773-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Aspirin, 50mg/day, and dipyridamole, 400mg/day vs. Aspirin, 325mg/day",Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-9903.33,United States,1998,-15724.49

1141,The cost of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the medical costs and the number of quality-adjusted life years lost owing to juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP). DESIGN: We examined hospital and physician charges for JORRP surgical procedures in Maryland in 1994 adjusting for inflation and the cost-charge ratio. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on treatment intensity for JORRP were augmented with a review of treatment records for 18 patients with JORRP. Sensitivity analyses were performed. To illustrate the application of our cost estimates, we compare the costs of JORRP to the costs of the surgical procedures that would be necessary to prevent it. RESULTS: We find that the present value at birth of the cost of a single case of JORRP is $201,724 (range, $61,822-$474,334). The annual cost for a single case of JORRP is $57,996 (range, $32,407-$94,114). The annual cost of JORRP in the United States is between $40 million and $123 million depending on the prevalence. Cesarean section (CS) for women with condyloma has been suggested as a potential strategy to prevent JORRP, but its efficacy remains to be determined. Our results suggest that if only 1% of the CSs actually prevented JORRP, this strategy would be a cost-effective means to prevent JORRP. CONCLUSIONS: Studies to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of CS and the effect of both CS and JORRP on families need to precede consideration of a policy of CS for women with clinically evident genital condyloma. Patients should be kept thoroughly informed about the role of CS for the prevention of JORRP and the nature of the remaining uncertainties.",2000-01-02102,10922223,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,D Bishai,2000,126 / 8,935-9,No,10922223,"D Bishai; H Kashima; K Shah; The cost of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 2000-Aug; 126(8):0886-4470; 935-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylatic cesarean sections vs. No prophylatic cesarean sections,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,120000,United States,1997,193503.55
1142,Cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with Wegner's granulomatosis undergoing immunosuppressive therapy,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of 3 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis strategies in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) receiving immunosuppressive therapies: 1) no prophylaxis; 2) trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 160 mg/800 mg 3 times a week, which is discontinued if patients experience an adverse drug reaction (ADR); and 3) TMP/SMX 160 mg/800 mg 3 times a week, which is replaced by monthly aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg) if patients experience an ADR. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to follow a hypothetical cohort of WG patients over their lifetimes starting from the time of initial exposure to the immunosuppressive therapy. The effect of PCP prophylaxis on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, average discounted lifetime cost (ADLC), and incremental cost-effectiveness was estimated based on data obtained from a literature review. Direct medical costs were examined from a societal perspective, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: No prophylaxis resulted in a life expectancy of 13.36 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an ADLC of $4,538. In comparison, prophylaxis with TMP/ SMX alone increased the QALY to 13.54 and was cost saving, with an ADLC of $3,304. The addition of pentamidine in patients who had an ADR to TMP/SMX resulted in 13.61 QALY, with an ADLC of $7,428. Compared with TMP/SMX alone, TMP/SMX followed by pentamidine increased the QALY by 0.07 at an incremental cost of $58,037 per QALY. Both TMP/SMX alone and TMP/SMX followed by pentamidine prophylaxis strategies dominated the no prophylaxis strategy until the incidence of PCP fell below 0.2% and 2.25%, respectively. Institution of pentamidine therapy for patients with a TMP/SMX ADR increased quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with that with TMP/ SMX alone until the incidence of PCP rose above 7.5%. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis using TMP/SMX alone increased life expectancy and reduced cost for patients with WG receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

1145,Should postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis who are starting corticosteroid treatment be screened for osteoporosis? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for preventing corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. METHODS: Simulated cohorts of postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) starting corticosteroid treatment were examined. A Markov decision analysis model was developed to compare different management strategies, including watchful waiting, screen and treat, and empirical treatment. Treatment thresholds for the screen and treat strategy were varied from bone mineral density (BMD) T scores <-1.0 to BMD T scores <-4.0. RESULTS: Compared with a watchful waiting approach, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a strategy of screen and treat with alendronate at a BMD T score of <-1.0 was $92,600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. This result was sensitive to the cost and efficacy of osteoporosis therapy and, importantly, to the treatment threshold. At a treatment threshold of a BMD T score <-2.5, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening and treating was $76,100 per QALY. None of these results differed substantially for women taking estrogen replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a strategy of screening and treating postmenopausal female RA patients with BMD T scores of < -1.0, compared with watchful waiting, was greater than that of other well-accepted medical interventions.

A cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for preventing corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. METHODS: Simulated cohorts of postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) starting corticosteroid treatment were examined. A Markov decision analysis model was developed to compare different management strategies, including watchful waiting, screen and treat, and empirical treatment. Treatment thresholds for the screen and treat strategy were varied from bone mineral density (BMD) T scores <-1.0 to BMD T scores <-4.0. RESULTS: Compared with a watchful waiting approach, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a strategy of screen and treat with alendronate at a BMD T score of <-1.0 was $92,600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. This result was sensitive to the cost and efficacy of osteoporosis therapy and, importantly, to the treatment threshold. At a treatment threshold of a BMD T score <-2.5, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening and treating was $76,100 per QALY. None of these results differed substantially for women taking estrogen replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a strategy of screening and treating postmenopausal female RA patients with BMD T scores of < -1.0, compared with watchful waiting, was greater than that of other well-accepted medical interventions.

1149,Cost utility analysis of sildenafil compared with papaverine-phentolamine injections,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of sildenafil and papaverine-phentolamine injections for treating erectile dysfunction. DESIGN: Cost utility analysis comparing treatment with sildenafil (allowing a switch to injection therapy) and treatment with papaverine-phentolamine (no switch allowed). Costs and effects were estimated from the societal perspective. Using time trade-off, a sample of the general public (n=169) valued health states relating to erectile dysfunction. These values were used to estimated health related quality of life by converting the clinical outcomes of a trial into quality adjusted life years (QALYs). PARTICIPANTS: 169 residents of Rotterdam.

RESULTS: Participants thought that erectile dysfunction limits quality of life considerably: the mean utility gain attributable to sildenafil is 0.11. Overall, treatment with sildenafil gained more QALYs, but the total costs were higher. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for the introduction of sildenafil was pound sterling 3639 in the first year and fell in following years.

1151,To pay or not to pay? A decision and cost-utility analysis of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy for diabetic nephropathy,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy can significantly delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy to end-stage renal failure (ESRF). The main obstacle to successful compliance with this therapy is the cost to the patients. The authors performed a cost-utility analysis from the government's perspective to see whether the province or territory should pay for ACE inhibitors for type I diabetic nephropathy on the assumption that cost is a major barrier to compliance with this important therapy. METHODS: A decision analysis tree was created to demonstrate the progression of type I diabetes with macroproteinuria from the point of prescription of ACE inhibitor therapy through to ESRF management, with a 21-year follow-up. Drug compliance, cost of ESRF treatment, utilities and survival data were taken from Canadian sources and used in the cost-utility analysis. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: Compared with a no-payment strategy, provincial payment of ACE inhibitor therapy was found to be highly cost-effective: it resulted in an increase of 0.147 in the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an annual cost savings of $849 per patient. The sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost-effectiveness depends on compliance, effect of benefit and the cost of drug therapy. Changes in the compliance rate from 67% to 51% could result in a swing in cost-effectiveness from a savings of $899 to an expenditure of more than $1 million per additional QALY. A 50% reduction in the cost of ACE inhibitors would result in a cost savings of $299 per additional QALY with compliance rates as low as 58% in the provincial payment strategy.

1152,Decision analysis of tamoxifen for the prevention of invasive breast cancer,"PURPOSE: The recent Breast Cancer Prevention Trial has shown that tamoxifen may prevent invasive breast cancer. We used a Markov model to estimate the long-term effects of chemoprevention with tamoxifen on survival, quality-adjusted survival, and health care costs. METHODS: We used a hypothetical cohort of women with breast-cancer risk similar to that of participants in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial, and a computer-based decision analysis (Markov model and 500 Monte Carlo simulations) to model the outcomes of interest. Survival calculations were from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) data; preference ratings from a time trade-off questionnaire administered to a group of average-risk women; and cost estimates from the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound and the Health Care Financing Administration. We obtained utility measures for quality-adjustment by administering a time trade-off questionnaire to a group of community-based women. RESULTS: Use of tamoxifen prolonged the average survival of cohort members by 69 days (95% probability interval [PI] 27 to 117) for those who started use at age 35 years; 40 days (95% PI 16 to 67) for those who started use at age 50 years; and 27 days (95% PI 14 to 40) for those who started use at age 60 years. Tamoxifen extended quality-adjusted survival by 38 days (95% PI 0.1 to 82) at age 35, 25 days (95% PI 0 to 50) at age 50, and 22 days (95% PI 5 to 39) days at age 60. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen cost $46,619 (95% PI $27,928 to $98,796) per life year life saved for women who started at age 35; for women over age 50, it cost more than $50,000 per life year saved.

1155,A South African pharmaco-economic analysis of the Acute lnfarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) Study,"OBJECTIVES: Heart failure (HF) is a serious, prevalent health condition in industrialised countries where the incidence has been on the increase. The economic repercussions are costly, and therefore cost-effective medication is important in the overall management of the condition. It has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are clinically effective in the management of HF. Ramipril has been shown to reduce mortality and the probability of hospitalisation in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Internationally, the use of this drug has proved to be cost-effective. The objective of this study was to investigate the economic implications of using ramipril in South Africa for post-MI patients with HF. METHODOLOGY: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing the use of ramipril and placebo in post-MI patients with HF who were receiving standard therapy. The economic impacts included drug acquisition costs and savings on hospitalisation; these were evaluated based on the clinical benefits of using ramipril in terms of life-years gained (LYG). The cost-utility of the use of ramipril was determined to provide an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed on the major economic variables; discounting of future costs and savings was performed at rates of 0%, 5 % and 10 %. RESULTS: The use of ramipril results in an incremental cost/LYG of R16 808 and a total incremental cost per patient per month of R107 over 3.8 years. When the quality of life of the patients is taken into account, the cost-utility analysis shows an incremental cost/QALY of R21 382 for those younger than 65 years of age and R18 029 for those older than 65 years.

1157,Cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation in patients with ventricular tachycardia,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation therapy versus amiodarone for treating ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with structural heart disease. The analysis used a societal perspective for a hypothetical cohort of VT patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, who were experiencing frequent shocks. METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness of ablation relative to amiodarone over 5 years after treatment initiation. Event probabilities were from the Chilli randomized clinical trial (Chilli Cooled Ablation System, Cardiac Pathways Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif), the literature, and a consensus panel. Costs were from 1998 national Medicare reimbursement schedules. Quality-of-life weights (utilities) were estimated using an established preference measurement technique. In a hypothetical cohort of 10 000 patients, 5-year costs were higher for patients undergoing ablation compared with amiodarone therapy ($21 795 versus $19 075). Ablation also produced a greater increase in quality of life (2.78 versus 2.65 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]). This yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of $20 923 per QALY gained for ablation compared with amiodarone. Results were relatively insensitive to assumptions about ablation success and durability. In less severe patients with good ejection fractions who suffer their first VT episode, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $6028 per QALY gained. These cost-effectiveness ratios are within the range generally thought to warrant technology adoption.

1159,Cost-effectiveness of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition with eptifibatide in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes,"BACKGROUND: In the PURSUIT trial, eptifibatide significantly reduced the 30-day incidence of death and myocardial infarction relative to placebo in 9461 patients with an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction). METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a 2-part prospective economic substudy of the 3522 US patients enrolled in PURSUIT: (1) an empirical intention-to-treat comparison of medical costs (hospital plus physician) up to 6 months after hospitalization and (2) a lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis. The base-case cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as the 1996 US dollars required to add 1 life-year with eptifibatide therapy. The 2 treatment arms had equivalent resource consumption and medical costs (exclusive of the cost of the eptifibatide regimen) during the index (enrollment) hospitalization (P=0.78) and up to 6 months afterward (P=0.60). The average wholesale price of the eptifibatide regimen was $1217, but a typical hospital discounted price was $1014. The estimated life expectancy from randomization in the US patients was 15.96 years for eptifibatide and 15.85 years for placebo, an incremental difference of 0.111. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for eptifibatide therapy in US PURSUIT patients was $16 491 per year of life saved. This result was robust through a wide range of sensitivity analyses. The cost-utility ratio for eptifibatide (using time trade-off defined utilities) was $19 693 per added quality-adjusted life-year.

However, its use in active-duty military personnel has not been analyzed. We developed a Markov model to evaluate health and economic outcomes of vaccinating or not vaccinating all members of the active-duty cohort, measuring quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, costs, and marginal cost-effectiveness. Pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination increased each person's life expectancy by 0. 03 days and decreased costs by $9.88 per person. The magnitude of the benefit of immunization is moderately sensitive to the rate of serious side effects caused by the vaccine, the incidence of pneumonia, the length of protection, and the efficacy of the vaccine. Vaccinating all 575,000 active-duty US Navy and Marine Corps members could save $5.7 million during the time the members are alive and on active duty and could provide a total gain of 54 QALYs.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of grid laser therapy for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. The analysis was performed from the perspective of a third-party insurer. Decision analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed by incorporating the data from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, expected longevity data, and patient-based utilities. Various sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of the models. Laser treatment conferred an overall improvement in quality-of-life adjusted years of approximately 3 months over the duration of disease for a hypothetical patient. The unadjusted cost per quality-of-life adjusted year (QALY) was US$3,101. Net present value analysis demonstrated that the cost per QALY could increase to $3,655, assuming a 5% discount rate.

1172,Quality of life and cost effectiveness analysis of therapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer,"PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine the quality of life and cost-effectiveness of therapeutic options for patients with locally recurrent rectal carcinoma, determined from the perspectives of patients and health care providers. METHODS: We reviewed the records of patients (N = 68) with locally recurrent rectal carcinoma evaluated from 1992 through 1995. We constructed a decision-analytic model incorporating outcomes, survival, and costs. Utilities were elicited from convenience samples of health care providers and patients using the standard gamble technique. RESULTS: The median survival for patients undergoing surgical resection (n = 40) was 42 months, compared with 16.8 months for patients undergoing diagnostic or palliative surgery (n = 16) and 18.3 months for patients treated nonoperatively (n = 12; P < 0.005). The mean cost of treatment per patient was $19,283 for the nonoperative group, $45,647 for the diagnostic or palliative surgery group, and $70,878 for the surgical resection group. The diagnostic or palliative surgical strategy was dominated by the nonoperative strategy because the former had greater costs with fewer health benefits. The incremental cost-utility ratio of surgical resection compared with nonoperative management using health care provider utilities was $109,777 per quality-adjusted life year gained; it was reduced to $56,698 using per quality-adjusted life year using mean patient utilities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with recurrent rectal carcinoma view surgery and morbidity to be less severe than health care providers. Diagnostic or palliative surgery is expensive and affects quality-adjusted survival adversely compared with nonoperative therapy.

The diagnostic or palliative surgical strategy was dominated by the nonoperative strategy because the former had greater costs with fewer health benefits. The incremental cost-utility ratio of surgical resection compared with nonoperative management using health care provider utilities was $109,777 per quality-adjusted life year gained; it was reduced to $56,698 using per quality-adjusted life year using mean patient utilities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with recurrent rectal carcinoma view surgery and morbidity to be less severe than health care providers. Diagnostic or palliative surgery is expensive and affects quality-adjusted survival adversely compared with nonoperative therapy.

1174,Cost-effectiveness of intense insulin treatment after acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus; results from the DIGAMI study,"AIMS: The aim of the present analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intense insulin treatment after acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus based on the results of the Diabetes Mellitus Insulin Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) study. In this study 620 patients with diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction were randomized to intense insulin treatment (insulin group) or to serve as controls given standard antidiabetic therapy. Mortality was significantly reduced in the insulin group. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated as the incremental cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gained of intense insulin treatment. The incremental costs were estimated as the difference in health care costs and indirect costs (labour production) during the first year of follow-up plus the future costs of increased survival. The life-years gained were based on the 5-year long-term follow-up experience and an assumed annual 20% mortality risk for all patients thereafter. The health care costs were Euro 975 higher in the insulin group during the first year of follow-up, mainly due to a longer period of initial hospitalization related to the institution of multidose insulin. The estimated discounted gain in life-years of the insulin treatment was 0.94 years without and 0.66 with quality of life adjustment, respectively. The cost per life-year gained by intense insulin treatment was Euro 16 900 and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was Euro 24 100. Thus the estimated cost-effectiveness ratios were relatively low. CONCLUSION: The results of the DIGAMI study indicate that intense insulin treatment after an acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus has an acceptable level of cost-effectiveness.",2000-01-02115,10739728,Eur Heart J,B Almbrand,2000,21 / 9,733-9,No,10739728,"B Almbrand; M Johannesson; B Sjöstrand; K Malmberg; L Rydén; Cost-effectiveness of intense insulin treatment after acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus; results from the DIGAMI study, Eur Heart J, 2000-May; 21(9):0195-668X; 733-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive insulin therapy vs. Standard therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,24100,Euro,1999,39883.1
1175,The cost-effectiveness of triple nucleoside analogue therapy antiretroviral regimens in the treatment of HIV in the United Kingdom,"PURPOSE: Treatment of HIV infection has improved markedly in recent years due to the use of combination antiretroviral therapies. However, the cost of these treatments remains a concern for those who fund health services. This article reports the results of an economic evaluation to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of triple combination nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy compared with dual NA therapy. METHOD: A Markov model was developed to assess the incremental cost effectiveness of triple therapy treatment versus dual therapy treatment. Clinical data was derived from published clinical trials and large observational cohorts whilst cost data was derived from a prospective database that monitors health care resource use in the UK HIV population. RESULTS: The model predicted that triple NA combination treatment extended life expectancy by an additional 1.2 years compared with dual therapy NA treatment with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 8,419 pounds per life-year saved. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was estimated to be between 10,072-16,168 pounds per QALY gained depending on the assumptions. CONCLUSION: The results show triple nucleoside analogue therapy to be a cost effective means of delaying HIV progression and extending life expectancy.

1184,Human T-cell lymphotropic virus testing of blood donors in Norway: a cost-effect model,"BACKGROUND: Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I and II (HTLV-I and II) are human retroviruses that can be transmitted by transfusion of whole blood. An HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and with tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). Antibody tests from 5.5 million European blood donors have shown that the HTLV prevalence is low, ranging from 0 to 0.02%. This paper examines costs and effects associated with the intervention of testing all new blood donors for HTLV. METHODS: A mathematical model was used to calculate the number of cases prevented by the intervention. For a given prevalence of HTLV in the blood donor population, the model calculates the number of recipients infected by transfusion, and the number of partners and offspring that will in turn be infected. The model then calculates the number of subjects with disease due to HTLV-I infection and the number of deaths from disease. From these numbers the measures of cost and effect are calculated. RESULTS: Testing all new blood donors for HTLV is calculated to cost US$ 9.2 million per life saved, or US$ 420,000 per quality adjusted life year gained by the intervention, when the HTLV prevalence among donors is 1 per 100,000. When the prevalence among donors is 10 per 100,000 the intervention will cost US$ 0.9 million per life saved, or US$ 41,000 per quality adjusted life year gained. The same analysis shows that testing blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) saves money when the HIV prevalence among donors is above 0.7 per 100,000. CONCLUSION: For Norway, studies suggest a willingness to pay to save a statistical life of approximately US$ 1.2 million.

1187,Human T-cell lymphotropic virus testing of blood donors in Norway: a cost-effect model,"BACKGROUND: Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I and II (HTLV-I and II) are human retroviruses that can be transmitted by transfusion of whole blood. An HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and with tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). Antibody tests from 5.5 million European blood donors have shown that the HTLV prevalence is low, ranging from 0 to 0.02%. This paper examines costs and effects associated with the intervention of testing all new blood donors for HTLV. METHODS: A mathematical model was used to calculate the number of cases prevented by the intervention. For a given prevalence of HTLV in the blood donor population, the model calculates the number of recipients infected by transfusion, and the number of partners and offspring that will in turn be infected. The model then calculates the number of subjects with disease due to HTLV-I infection and the number of deaths from disease. From these numbers the measures of cost and effect are calculated. RESULTS: Testing all new blood donors for HTLV is calculated to cost US$ 9.2 million per life saved, or US$ 420,000 per quality adjusted life year gained by the intervention, when the HTLV prevalence among donors is 1 per 100,000. When the prevalence among donors is 10 per 100,000 the intervention will cost US$ 0.9 million per life saved, or US$ 41,000 per quality adjusted life year gained. The same analysis shows that testing blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) saves money when the HIV prevalence among donors is above 0.7 per 100,000. CONCLUSION: For Norway, studies suggest a willingness to pay to save a statistical life of approximately US$ 1.2 million. The costs fall under this value when the number of infected persons is > or = 8 per 100,000 donors.

1188,"An economic appraisal of alternative strategies for the delivery of MCH-FP services in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh","The strategy of distributing maternal and child health and family planning (MCH-FP) services at the doorsteps of the clients--through routine visits to the eligible couples by trained fieldworkers--has been instrumental in increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR), reducing fertility and attaining a considerably high immunization coverage of children and women in Bangladesh. The doorstep strategy, however, appeared to be labour-intensive and costly. With the maturity of the programme, priorities of the national MCH-FP programme have shifted to a stage that calls for more cost-effective service-delivery strategies, capable of offering a broader package of reproductive and other essential health services. The main objective of the present study was to examine the cost and effectiveness implications of the alternative strategies of delivering services from fixed sites--field-tested within an ICDDR,B operations research--in comparison to the conventional (existing) doorstep strategy. The key findings of the economic appraisal indicated that, at the end of the operations research intervention, both cost per birth averted and cost per QALY gained were lowest for the option of delivering services from static (fixed-site) clinics: US$13 and US$17 compared with the corresponding values of US$18 and US$42 for the doorstep strategy. Provision of health and family planning services from clinics--complemented with a reduced system of outreach workers to inform and target the hard-to-reach clients--was found to be the most cost-effective service-delivery alternative.",2000-01-02119,11009946,Int J Health Plann Manage,S Routh,2000,15 / 2,115-32,No,11009946,"S Routh; An economic appraisal of alternative strategies for the delivery of MCH-FP services in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, Int J Health Plann Manage, 2000 Apr-Jun; 15(2):0749-6753; 115-32",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,MCH services,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bangladesh,1997,Not Stated

RESULTS: The panels correctly classified 88% of the appropriate and 27% of the inappropriate admissions. If the elective admissions predicted to be inappropriate had been excluded, 9% of the costs would have been saved, and 5% of the gain in quality-adjusted life-years lost.

1193,Economic evaluation of HIV risk reduction intervention in African-American male adolescents,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral HIV risk reduction intervention for African-American male adolescents that has previously been shown to be effective at reducing sexual risk taking. METHODS: Standard techniques of cost-utility analysis were employed. A societal perspective and a 3% discount rate were used in the main analysis. Program costs were ascertained retrospectively. A mathematical model of HIV transmission was used to translate observed changes in sexual behavior into an estimate of the number of HIV infections the intervention averted. Intervention effects were assumed to last for 1 year. For each infection averted, the corresponding savings in future HIV-related medical care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated. The overall net cost per QALY saved (cost-utility ratio) was then calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the main results. RESULTS: The cost-utility ratio was approximately $57,000 U.S. per QALY saved when training costs were included, and $41,000 U.S. per QALY saved when they were excluded. The intervention appeared substantially more cost-effective when the analysis was restricted to the subgroup of participants who reported being sexually active at baseline. Assumptions about the prevalence of HIV infection and the duration of intervention effectiveness also greatly affected the cost-utility ratio.

1195,What is heartburn worth? A cost-utility analysis of management strategies,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the best treatment strategy for the management of patients presenting with symptoms consistent with uncomplicated heartburn. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis of 4 alternatives: empirical proton pump inhibitor, empirical histamine2-receptor antagonist, and diagnostic strategies consisting of either esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or an upper gastrointestinal series before treatment. The time horizon of the model was 1 year. The base case analysis assumed a cohort of otherwise healthy 45-year-old individuals in a primary care practice. MAIN RESULTS: Empirical treatment with a proton pump inhibitor was projected to provide the greatest quality-adjusted survival for the cohort. Empirical treatment with a histamine2 receptor antagonist was projected to be the least costly of the alternatives. The marginal cost-effectiveness of using a proton pump inhibitor over a histamine2-receptor antagonist was approximately $10,400 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the base case analysis and was less than $50,000 per QALY as long as the utility for heartburn was less than 0.95.

1198,Cost of quality management and information provision for screening: colorectal cancer screening,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs of a quality management (QM) system as proposed by the Quality Management for Screening report for a future national colorectal cancer screening programme. METHODS: Estimates of the costs of the QM system, including the associated costs of education and training and information provision, were based on expert opinion, the existing literature, and the experience of the current National Health Service (NHS) breast cancer screening programme (BSP) and the NHS cervical cancer screening programme (CSP). RESULTS: The cost of a QM system to support a national colorectal cancer programme in the UK was estimated as approximately 3.8 million a year. Further annual costs related to QM will include 500000 for education and training and 200000 for information provision. Adding these additional costs to a previously published UK economic evaluation of colorectal cancer screening increases the cost-utility ratio to approximately 6500 per quality adjusted life year gained (over an eight year follow up period). CONCLUSIONS: Any new screening programme, or an existing one, must have QM to ensure that the quality of screening is high and to maintain the right balance between benefit and harm. The significant costs of such a QM system should be included in any economic evaluation of a screening programme.",2000-01-02124,10807144,J Med Screen,G Robert,2000,7 / 1,31-4,No,10807144,"G Robert; J Brown; L Garvican; Cost of quality management and information provision for screening: colorectal cancer screening, J Med Screen, 2000; 7(1):0969-1413; 31-4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Quality management system for a colorectal cancer screening program vs. Colorectal cancer screening program, with no quality management program",Not Stated,74 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,8 Years,6.00,6.00,6627,United Kingdom,1999,16649.01
1199,Cost-effectiveness analysis of therapy for symptomatic carotid occlusion: PET screening before selective extracranial-to-intracranial bypass versus medical treatment,"The St. Louis Carotid Occlusion Study (STLCOS) demonstrated that increased cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) detected by PET scanning predicted stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion. Consequently, a trial of extracranial-to-intracranial (EC/IC) arterial bypass for these patients was proposed. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of using PET in identifying candidates for EC/IC bypass. METHODS: A Markov model was created to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PET screening and treating a cohort of 45 symptomatic patients with carotid occlusion. The primary outcome was incremental cost for PET screening and EC/IC bypass (if OEF was elevated) per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Rates of stroke and death with surgical and medical treatment were obtained from EC/IC Bypass Trial and STLCOS data. Costs were estimated from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all assumed variables, including the PET OEF threshold used to select patients for surgery. RESULTS: In the base case, PET screening of the cohort followed by EC/IC bypass on 36 of the 45 patients yielded 23.2 additional QALYs at a cost of $20,000 per QALY, compared with medical therapy alone. A more specific PET threshold, which identified 18 surgical candidates, gained 22.6 QALYs at less cost than medical therapy alone. The results were sensitive to the perioperative stroke rate and the stroke risk reduction conferred by EC/IC bypass surgery. CONCLUSION: If postoperative stroke rates are similar to stroke rates observed in the EC/IC Bypass Trial, EC/IC bypass will be cost-effective in patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion who have increased OEF. A clinical trial of medical therapy versus PET followed by EC/IC bypass (if OEF is elevated) is warranted.",2000-01-02125,10809195,Cardiovasc J S Afr,C P Derdeyn,2000,41 / 5,800-7,No,10809195,"C P Derdeyn; B F Gage; R L Grubb; W J Powers; Cost-effectiveness analysis of therapy for symptomatic carotid occlusion: PET screening before selective extracranial-to-intracranial bypass versus medical treatment, Cardiovasc J S Afr, 2000-May; 41(5):1680-0745; 800-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,PET screening with selective extracranial-to-intracranial (EC/IC) bypass vs. Medical management,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,19600,United States,1998,31120.83
1200,Cost-effectiveness of surgery for small abdominal aortic aneurysms on the basis of data from the United Kingdom small aneurysm trial,"PURPOSE: Although the United Kingdom small aneurysm trial reported no survival benefit for early operation in patients with small (4. 0-5.5 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the trial lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful gains in life expectancy, particularly for specific subgroups. We used decision analysis to better characterize the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of early surgery. METHODS: We used a Markov model to assess the marginal cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] saved) of early surgery relative to surveillance for small AAAs, using data from the UK Trial. Subgroup analyses were performed by patient age and AAA diameter. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the effect of elective operative mortality on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In our baseline analysis, early operations provided a small survival advantage (0.14 QALYs) at a small incremental cost of $1510. Thus, despite a small survival benefit, early surgery appeared cost-effective ($10, 800/QALY). The small cost differential resulted from the large proportion of patients who underwent surveillance, who eventually underwent AAA repair, and therefore incurred the cost of the surgical procedures. The survival advantage and cost-effectiveness of early operation increased with lower operative mortality, younger age, and larger AAA diameter. CONCLUSION: Despite the negative conclusions of the UK trial, early surgery may be cost-effective for patients with small AAAs, particularly younger patients (<72 years of age) with larger AAAs (> or = 4.5 cm). Because the gains in life expectancy are relatively small, however, clinical decision making should be strongly guided by patient preferences.",2000-01-02126,10664490,J Vasc Surg,M L Schermerhorn,2000,31 / 2,217-26,No,10664490,"M L Schermerhorn; J D Birkmeyer; D A Gould; J L Cronenwett; Cost-effectiveness of surgery for small abdominal aortic aneurysms on the basis of data from the United Kingdom small aneurysm trial, J Vasc Surg, 2000-Feb; 31(2):0741-5214; 217-26",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early surgical repair vs. Watchful waiting,Not Stated,76 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,10800,United States,1997,17415.32
