22501,Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke: A cost-effectiveness and value of implementation analysis,"BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness, value of future research, and value of implementation of mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS: Using UK clinical and cost data from the Pragmatic Ischemic Stroke Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) trial, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy over time horizons of 90-days and lifetime, based on a decision-analytic model, using all existing evidence. We performed a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials to estimate treatment effects. We used sensitivity analysis to address uncertainty. Value of implementation analysis was used to estimate the potential value of additional implementation activities to support routine delivery of mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS: Over the trial period (90 days), compared with best medical care alone, mechanical thrombectomy incurred an incremental cost of pound5207 and 0.025 gain in QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) pound205,279), which would not be considered cost-effective. However, mechanical thrombectomy was shown to be cost-effective over a lifetime horizon, with an ICER of pound3466 per QALY gained. The expected value of perfect information per patient eligible for mechanical thrombectomy in the UK is estimated at pound3178. The expected value of full implementation of mechanical thrombectomy is estimated at pound1.3 billion over five years. CONCLUSION: Mechanical thrombectomy was cost-effective compared with best medical care alone over a patient''s lifetime. On the assumption of 30% implementation being achieved throughout the UK healthcare system, we estimate that the population health benefits obtained from this treatment are greater than the cost of implementation.

22503,Cost-Effectiveness of Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair Versus Medical Therapy in Patients With Heart Failure and Secondary Mitral Regurgitation: Results From the COAPT Trial,"BACKGROUND: The COAPT trial (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients With Functional Mitral Regurgitation) demonstrated that edge-to-edge transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) with the MitraClip resulted in reduced mortality and heart failure hospitalizations and improved quality of life compared with maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure and 3 to 4+ secondary mitral regurgitation. Whether TMVr is cost-effective compared with GDMT in this population is unknown. METHODS: We used data from the COAPT trial to perform a formal patient-level economic analysis of TMVr+GDMT versus GDMT alone for patients with heart failure and 3 to 4+ secondary mitral regurgitation from the perspective of the US healthcare system. Costs for the index TMVr hospitalization were assessed using a combination of resource-based accounting and hospital billing data (when available). Follow-up medical care costs were estimated on the basis of medical resource use collected during the COAPT trial. Health utilities were estimated for all patients at baseline and 1, 6, 12, and 24 months with the Short Form Six-Dimension Health Survey. RESULTS: Initial costs for the TMVr procedure and index hospitalization were $35 755 and $48 198, respectively. Although follow-up costs were significantly lower with TMVr compared with GDMT ($26 654 versus $38 345; P=0.018), cumulative 2-year costs remained higher with TMVr because of the upfront cost of the index procedure ($73 416 versus $38 345; P<0.001). When in-trial survival, health utilities, and costs were modeled over a lifetime horizon, TMVr was projected to increase life expectancy by 1.13 years and quality-adjusted life-years by 0.82 years at a cost of $45 648, yielding a lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40 361 per life-year gained and $55 600 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: For symptomatic patients with heart failure and 3 to 4+ secondary mitral regurgitation, TMVr increases life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with GDMT at an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained that represents acceptable economic value according to current US thresholds.

22504,Cost-Effectiveness of Sacubitril/Valsartan in Germany: An Application of the Efficiency Frontier,"BACKGROUND: To assess the cost-effectiveness of new treatments in Germany, the efficiency frontier (EF) method has been developed. We compared the cost-effectiveness analysis using international standards and the German methodology, using the heart failure drug sacubitril/valsartan as an example. METHODS: A previously developed Markov model was adapted to include 4 treatment options: no treatment, enalapril, candesartan, and sacubitril/valsartan. The internationally used incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, as well as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Additionally, EFs, net monetary benefits (NMBs), and price-acceptability curves were created according to German guidelines. All analyses were performed from the perspective of the German Statutory Health Insurance. RESULTS: The base-case ICER for sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril is euro19 300/quality-adjusted life-year. On the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, sacubitril/valsartan is most likely to be cost-effective, out of all included comparators, from a hypothetical willingness-to-pay threshold of euro18 250/quality-adjusted life-year onward. No EF could be constructed for the base case. Taking the uncertainty of the input parameters into account for the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a NMB of around -euro14 000 was calculated, depending on the outcome considered, with the NMB being zero at a daily price for sacubitril/valsartan ranging from euro1.52 to euro1.67. CONCLUSION: We calculated an ICER for Germany, comparable to previously published cost-effectiveness analyses for Europe, which widely concluded sacubitril/valsartan to be cost-effective.

22510,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Empagliflozin in Japan Based on Results From the Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME Trial,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin in Japan based on the Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. METHODS: The trial has shown a reduction in the risk for cardiovascular (CV) and renal events with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established CV disease. A cost-effectiveness analysis based on the overall population of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial was reported previously by using a lifetime discrete event simulation model. The same modeling frame was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with empagliflozin added to standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC alone in Japan. The time to relevant clinical events and the hazard ratios were derived from an Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. The costs for each event were estimated from a Japanese medical claims database. Direct medical costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the public health care perspective. FINDINGS: Treatment with empagliflozin was estimated to increase life expectancy by 6.2 years and 2.7 QALYs, whereas total cost increased by 1,115,475 yen compared with treatment with SoC alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 415,849 yen/QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, there was no case that was in excess of the reference value of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in the pilot introduction for price revision in Japan (ie, 5 million yen/QALY). IMPLICATIONS: Based on the Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, our results suggest that empagliflozin added to SoC is highly cost-effective compared with SoC alone in Japan.",2019-01-31804,31561882,Clin Ther,Kohei Kaku,2019,41 / 10,2021-2040.e11,Yes,31561882,"Kohei Kaku; Osvaldo P Almeida; Andrew H Ford; Graeme J Hankey; Jonathan Golledge; Bu B Yeap; Leon Flicker; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Empagliflozin in Japan Based on Results From the Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME Trial, Clin Ther, 2019 Oct; 41(10):1879-114X; 2021-2040.e11",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,empagliflozin + standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard of care,Asian,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,2.00,2.00,415849,Japan,2017,3917
22511,"Cervical Interlaminar Epidural Injections in the Treatment of Cervical Disc Herniation, Post Surgery Syndrome, or Discogenic Pain: Cost Utility Analysis from Randomized Trials","BACKGROUND: Neck pain is one of the major conditions attributing to overall disability in the United States. There have been multiple publications assessing clinical and cost effectiveness of multiple modalities of interventions in managing chronic neck pain. Even then, the literature has been considered sparse in relation to cervical interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic neck pain. In contrast, cost utility studies of lumbar interlaminar injections, caudal epidural injections, cervical and lumbar facet joint nerve blocks, percutaneous adhesiolysis demonstrated costs of less than $3,500 for quality-adjusted life year (QALY). OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost utility of cervical interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic neck and/or upper extremity pain secondary to cervical disc herniation, post-surgery syndrome in neck, and axial or discogenic neck pain. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis based on 3 previously published randomized trials of the effectiveness of cervical interlaminar epidural injections assessing their role in disc herniation, cervical post-surgery syndrome, and axial or discogenic pain. SETTING: A contemporary, private, specialty referral interventional pain management center in the United States. METHODS: Cost utility of cervical interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids in managing cervical disc herniation, cervical post-surgery syndrome, and cervical discogenic or axial neck back pain was conducted with data derived from 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included a 2-year follow-up, with inclusion of 356 patients. The primary outcome was significant improvement defined as at least 50% in pain reduction and disability status. Direct payment data from all carriers from 2018 was utilized for the assessment of procedural costs. Overall costs, including drug costs, were determined by multiplication of direct procedural payment data by a factor of 1.67 to accommodate for indirect payments respectively for disc herniation, discogenic pain, and cervical post-surgery syndrome. RESULTS: The results of the 3 RCTs showed direct cost utility for one year of QALY of $2,412.31 for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, $2,081.07 for disc herniation, and $2,309.20 for post surgery syndrome, with an average cost per one year QALY of $2,267.57, with total estimated overall costs with addition of indirect costs of $3,475.38, $4,028.55, $3,856.36, and $3,785.89 respectively. LIMITATIONS: The limitation of this cost utility analysis includes that it is a single center evaluation. Indirect costs were extrapolated.

22512,Cost-Utility and Budget Impact Analysis for Stopping the Inappropriate Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors After Cessation of NSAID or Low-Dose Acetylsalicylic Acid Treatment,"BACKGROUND: In accordance with current guidelines, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are now generally prescribed as a protective co-medication in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (LDASA). However, less attention is paid to the corresponding discontinuation of a PPI after cessation of NSAID or LDASA treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the extent of inappropriate PPI use, as the proportion of patients who started a PPI as a protective co-medication but continued using these drugs after cessation of NSAID and LDASA treatment. We also sought to estimate the potential cost savings and effect gains of discontinuing inappropriate PPI use and the resulting decrease in adverse effects and their detrimental consequences. METHODS: Pharmacy dispensing data were used to map inappropriate PPI use in 2014 for community-dwelling patients. Strategies with or without PPI continuation were compared in the cost-utility analysis for a time horizon of 5 years from a healthcare perspective. Subsequently, incremental costs and effects (quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated with a Markov model. RESULTS: Related to NSAID and LDASA treatment, 11.0% and 5%, respectively, of the PPI users were found to inappropriately continue PPI co-treatment. Discontinuation in 71- to 80-year-old patients suggested cost savings of euro170.46 (95% confidence interval 75-282) at a 0.003 (95% confidence interval 0.001-0.005) quality-adjusted life-year increase. The total budget impact of stopping inappropriate PPI use related to NSAID/LDASA treatment in the Netherlands would amount to almost euro1,050,000 after 1 year. Correspondingly, successful interventions to stop a patient''s inappropriate use would cost up to euro29 and probably would pay for themselves in the following years.

22516,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of CYP2D6*10 Pharmacogenetic Testing to Guide the Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Postmenopausal Women with Estrogen Receptor Positive Early Breast Cancer in China,"BACKGROUND: A CYP2D6 gene polymorphism is related to the effect of tamoxifen treatment in patient with estrogen-receptor positive (ER) positive breast cancer and CYP2D6*10 T/T can lead to a poor prognosis in Asian patients. Although one-off pharmacogenetic testing may optimize adjuvant endocrine therapy, testing prior to tamoxifen initiation incurs additional costs. AIM: We conducted a study to assess the cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic testing to guide the adjuvant endocrine therapy compared with tamoxifen without CYP2D6*10 testing in China. METHODS: A semi-Markov model was developed to evaluate costs and health outcomes represented as quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Input data were obtained from the public literature. The results were expressed as incremental cost per QALY gained. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis explored the impact of uncertainty in the model parameters on results, and probabilistic uncertainty was assessed through a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, in the CYP2D6*10 testing and alternative adjuvant endocrine therapy group, the incremental total cost was US$17,966.95 and the incremental QALY was 3.582. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$5015.693 per QALY gained. Compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$26,508/QALY in China, the CYP2D6*10 testing is the dominant strategy in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer in China, and the increased cost of genetic testing was completely worthwhile. The sensitivity analyses showed that the model we built was quite stable. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic testing was cost effective for postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer.",2019-01-31813,31559573,Clin Drug Investig,XiaoXia Wei,2019,/,,Yes,31559573,"XiaoXia Wei; Matthew S GoodSmith; M Reza Skandari; Elbert S Huang; Rochelle N Naylor; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of CYP2D6*10 Pharmacogenetic Testing to Guide the Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Postmenopausal Women with Estrogen Receptor Positive Early Breast Cancer in China, Clin Drug Investig, 2019 Jun 27; ():1173-2563",QALY,China,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Screening",cyp2d6*10 testing + alternative treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- tamoxifen without genetic testing,Postmenopausal; Estrogen Receptor Positive Early Breast Cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,240 Months,3.00,3.00,5015.69,United States,2017,5295.84
22517,The Impact of Biomarker Screening and Cascade Genetic Testing on the Cost-Effectiveness of MODY Genetic Testing,"OBJECTIVE: In the U.S., genetic testing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is frequently delayed because of difficulty with insurance coverage. Understanding the economic implications of clinical genetic testing is imperative to advance precision medicine for diabetes. The objective of this article is to assess the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing, preceded by biomarker screening and followed by cascade genetic testing of first-degree relatives, for subtypes of MODY in U.S. pediatric patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used simulation models of distinct forms of diabetes to forecast the clinical and economic consequences of a systematic genetic testing strategy compared with usual care over a 30-year time horizon. In the genetic testing arm, patients with MODY received treatment changes (sulfonylureas for HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY associated with a 1.0% reduction in HbA1c; no treatment for GCK-MODY). Study outcomes included costs, life expectancy (LE), and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: The strategy of biomarker screening and genetic testing was cost-saving as it increased average quality of life (+0.0052 QALY) and decreased costs (-$191) per simulated patient relative to the control arm. Adding cascade genetic testing increased quality-of-life benefits (+0.0081 QALY) and lowered costs further (-$735). CONCLUSIONS: A combined strategy of biomarker screening and genetic testing for MODY in the U.S. pediatric diabetes population is cost-saving compared with usual care, and the addition of cascade genetic testing accentuates the strategy''s benefits.

22519,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Adjuvant Neratinib Following Trastuzumab in Early-Stage HER2-Positive Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Disease-free survival (DFS) in early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is significantly greater with the addition of neratinib after adjuvant trastuzumab versus no additional therapy. However, it remains uncertain whether these survival gains represent good value for the money, given the substantial cost of neratinib. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and economic implications of adding neratinib after adjuvant trastuzumab based on results from the phase III ExteNET trial. METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of neratinib for women with early-stage (I-III) HER2-positive breast cancer. Five-year recurrence rates were derived from the ExteNET trial. Mortality and recurrence rates after 5 years were derived from the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial. Outcomes included life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and direct medical expenditures. The analysis was performed from a payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were conducted to evaluate uncertainty. RESULTS: Total cost of neratinib following adjuvant trastuzumab was $317,619 versus $152,812 for adjuvant trastuzumab alone. A gain of 0.4 QALYs (15.7 vs. 15.3) and 0.1 years of projected life expectancy (18.3 vs. 18.2) favored neratinib after trastuzumab versus trastuzumab alone. The neratinib cost per QALY gained was $416,106. At standard willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $200,000 per QALY gained, neratinib has a probability of 2.8%, 16.7%, and 33.9% of cost-effectiveness, respectively. The cost per QALY gained in a scenario analysis only including patients with hormone-receptor positive disease was $275,311. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 5-year data from ExteNET, neratinib following adjuvant trastuzumab is not projected to be cost-effective, even among those patients shown to derive the greatest clinical benefit. Future analyses should reassess the cost-effectiveness associated with neratinib treatment as trial data mature. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

22520,Patient-Level Modeling Approach Using Discrete-Event Simulation: A Cost-Effectiveness Study of Current Treatment Guidelines for Women with Postmenopausal Osteoporosis,"Decision tree and Markov models have been the most commonly used modeling methods in health economic evaluations. Both methods are known for their limitations. Discrete-event simulation (DES), an event-driven model in continuous time at the patient level, is a relatively new method in health economic evaluations that addresses some limitations of the common modeling techniques. Specifically, with the advent of personalized medicine, conventional methods for value assessment that are based on population-level measures might not be appropriate. The best treatment would depend on patient characteristics and clinical profiles. Value assessment of health interventions can vary substantially and may lead to different health decision making due to patient heterogeneity. As such, modeling at the patient level is an appropriate approach for value assessment of health interventions. The DES model has several advantages, such as flexibility, ability to reflect patient heterogeneity, increased precision, and better characterization of modeling uncertainty, that may be preferred to decision tree and Markov models. In addition, with increasing health care spending and drug prices, it is important to quantify value of available treatment options for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The purpose of this Viewpoints article was to describe and demonstrate an application of a DES model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current treatment guidelines for women with PMO. In particular, the DES model indicated that the optimal treatment at the common willingness-to-pay thresholds between $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $150,000 per QALY was denosumab.

Methods: An empiric, repetitive decision tree analysis model was constructed using literature review and expert clinical judgement. This assessed the expected costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of decision alternatives over a 10-year period. The model incorporated interventions including alternate PDE5-Is, intracorporal injections (ICI) with alprostadil or trimix (alprostadil, phentolamine, and papaverine), and inflatable penile prosthesis placement (IPP) and included respective risks of failure, subsequent interventions, and other complications (including priapism risk). Average model QALY estimates obtained from the literature were as follows: ED =0.56, successful alternate PDE5-I =0.70, successful ICI =0.70, and successful IPP =0.78. Cost data were calculated from a high-volume academic center and published manufacturer data. Results: Over the 10-year period, IPP placement was the most cost-effective management option per preserved QALY (QALY =7.82, cost =$22,009/10 years) as compared to ICI alprostadil (QALY =8.51, cost =$62,890/10 years), ICI trimix (QALY =8.47, cost =$48,617/10 years) and alternate PDE5-I (QALY =7.73, $52,883/10 years). Conclusions: Using expert opinion and published utility, cost, and complication data in a decision analysis, we demonstrated that IPP placement is the most cost-effective ED intervention following failed initial PDE5-I over a 10-year period as compared to alternate treatment options.

22530,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Vedolizumab Compared with Other Biologics in Anti-TNF-Naive Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab (VDZ) was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in 2018 for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis (UC). The comparative cost-effectiveness of VDZ compared with other biologics is unknown in Japan. This information could be useful for decision makers at the time of repricing biologics for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe UC. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of VDZ versus other branded biologics for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe UC who were anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naive, from the Japanese public healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed to predict the number of patients who achieved response and remission at the end of the induction phase and sustained it during the maintenance phase, translating this into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. Treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation and surgery, and their impact on QALYs and costs were also modeled. A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of each treatment versus placebo. Rates of adverse events, surgery, surgery complications, and utilities were from the literature. Costs (2018 Japanese yen) were obtained from the Japanese National Health Insurance drug price list and medical fee table and local claims databases. Clinical and economic outcomes were projected over a lifetime and discounted at 2% annually. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, VDZ yielded greater QALYs and cost savings compared with golimumab and was cost-effective compared with adalimumab and infliximab (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios yen4,821,940 and yen4,687,692, respectively). Deterministic and probabilistic analyses supported the robustness of the findings in the base-case analysis, indicating that VDZ was either dominant or cost-effective in most scenarios and replications. The main limitations of this analysis include excluding tofacitinib and infliximab biosimilar as comparators, health-state utility estimates were obtained from population studies in the United Kingdom, and the impact of subsequent (i.e., second-line) biologic treatment was not evaluated.

However, CAZ-AVI''s cost-effectiveness is unknown.Methods: We used a decision analytic model to estimate the health and economic consequences of CAZ-AVI-based therapy compared to colistin-based therapy (COL) for a hypothetical cohort of patients with CRE pneumonia or bacteremia over a 5-year horizon. Model inputs were from published sources and included CRE mortality with COL (41%), CAZ-AVI''s absolute risk reduction in CRE mortality (23%), daily cost of CAZ-AVI ($926), risk of nephrotoxicity with COL (42%) and probability of discharge to long-term care (LTC) following CRE infection (56%). Outcomes included quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER; $/QALY). 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed and ICERs were compared to willingness to pay standards of $100,000/QALY and $150,000/QALY.Results: In the base case, CAZ-AVI had an ICER of $95,000/QALY. At a $100,000/QALY threshold, results were sensitive to a number of variables including: the probability and cost of LTC, quality of life following CRE infection, CAZ-AVI''s absolute risk reduction in mortality, all-cause mortality, daily cost of CAZ-AVI, and healthcare costs after CRE infection. The ICER did not exceed $150,000/QALY after varying all model inputs across a wide range of plausible values. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, CAZ-AVI was the optimal strategy in 59% and 99% of simulations at $100,000/QALY and $150,000/QALY threshold, respectively.Conclusion: CAZ-AVI is a cost-effective treatment for CRE bacteremia and pneumonia based on accepted willingness to pay standards in the US.",2019-01-31836,31548187,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Matthew S Simon,2019,/,,No,31548187,"Matthew S Simon; Kayo Kurotani; Kaori Honjo; Tomoki Nakaya; Ai Ikeda; Tetsuya Mizoue; Norie Sawada; Shoichiro Tsugane; Japan Public Health Center-Based; Cost-effectiveness of ceftazidime-avibactam for treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia and pneumonia, Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2019 Sep 23; ():1098-6596",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,ceftazidime-avibactam vs. colistin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,95000,United States,2017,100306.16
22534,High-Intensity Versus Low-Intensity Surveillance for Patients With Colorectal Adenomas: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Surveillance of patients with colorectal adenomas has limited long-term evidence to support current practice. Objective: To compare the lifetime benefits and costs of high- versus low-intensity surveillance. Design: Microsimulation model. Data Sources: U.S. cancer registry, cost data, and published literature. Target Population: U.S. patients aged 50, 60, or 70 years with low-risk adenomas (LRAs) (1 to 2 small adenomas) or high-risk adenomas (HRAs) (3 to 10 small adenomas or >/=1 large adenoma) removed after screening with colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT). Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: No further screening or surveillance, routine screening after 10 years, low-intensity surveillance (10 years after LRA removal and 5 years after HRA removal), and high-intensity surveillance (5 years after LRA removal and 3 years after HRA removal). Outcome Measures: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and incremental cost-effectiveness. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Without surveillance or screening, lifetime CRC incidence for patients aged 50 years was 10.9% after LRA removal and 17.2% after HRA removal at screening colonoscopy. Subsequent colonoscopic screening, low-intensity surveillance, or high-intensity surveillance decreased incidence by 39%, 46% to 48%, and 55% to 56%, respectively. Incidence of CRC and surveillance benefits were higher for adenomas detected at FIT screening and lower for older patients. High-intensity surveillance cost less than $30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with low-intensity surveillance. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: High-intensity surveillance cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained in most alternative scenarios for adenoma recurrence, CRC incidence, longevity, quality of life, screening ages, surveillance ages, test performance, disutilities, and cost.

Incidence of CRC and surveillance benefits were higher for adenomas detected at FIT screening and lower for older patients. High-intensity surveillance cost less than $30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with low-intensity surveillance. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: High-intensity surveillance cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained in most alternative scenarios for adenoma recurrence, CRC incidence, longevity, quality of life, screening ages, surveillance ages, test performance, disutilities, and cost. Limitation: Few surveillance outcome data exist.

We aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib for sorafenib-resistant HCC from the payer''s perspective of the USA, UK and China. METHODS: We developed Markov models to simulate the patients pre-treated with first-line sorafenib following the CELESTIAL trial. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated for the treatment with cabozantinib or best supportive care. The list price for drugs was acquired from the Red Book, the British National Formulary, West China hospital and reported literature. Adverse events, utilities weights, and transition likelihood between states were sourced from the published randomized phase III trial. A willing-to-pay threshold was set $150 000/QALY in the USA, $70 671/QALY ( pound50 000/QALY) in the UK and $26 481/QALY (3x GDP per capita) in China. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were developed to test the models'' uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base case, treatment with cabozantinib increased effectiveness by 0.13 QALYs, resulting in an ICER vs best supportive care of $833 497/QALY in the USA, $304 177/QALY in the UK and $156 437/QALY in China. The models were most sensitive to assumptions about transitions to progression with both cabozantinib and best supportive care, the utility associated with being progression free.

22549,Early invasive strategy in senior patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: is it cost-effective? - a decision-analytic model and value of information analysis,"BACKGROUND: Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is the most common type of heart attack in the UK and it is becoming increasingly prevalent among older people. An early invasive treatment strategy may be effective and cost-effective for treating NSTEMI but evidence is currently unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the early invasive strategy versus medical management in elderly patients with NSTEMI and to provide guidance for future research in this area. METHODS: A long-term Markov state transition model was developed. Model inputs were systematically derived from a number of sources most appropriate to a UK relevant analysis, such as published studies and national routine data. Costs were estimated from the perspective of National Health Service and Personal Social Services. The model was developed using TreeAge Pro software. Based on a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a value of information analysis was carried out to establish the value of decision uncertainty both overall and for specific input parameters. RESULTS: In 2017 UK pound, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the early invasive strategy was pound46 916 for each additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, with a probability of being cost-effective of 23% at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000/QALY. There was a considerable decision uncertainty with these results. The value of removing all this uncertainty was up to pound1 920 000 annually. Most uncertainty related to clinical effectiveness parameters and the optimal study design to remove this uncertainty would be a randomised controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Based on current evidence, the early invasive strategy is not likely to be cost-effective for elderly patients with NSTEMI. This conclusion should be interpreted with caution mainly due to the absence of NSTEMI-specific data and long-term clinical effectiveness estimates.",2019-01-31852,31542755,BMJ Open,Julija Simpson,2019,9 / 9,e030678,No,31542755,"Julija Simpson; Kongwang Hu; Shuaili Wang; Zikun Wang; Longlong Li; Zhiguo Huang; Weiqiang Yu; Zhongxue Chen; Qing-Fa Wu; Early invasive strategy in senior patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: is it cost-effective? - a decision-analytic model and value of information analysis, BMJ Open , 2019 Sep 27; 9(9):2044-6055; e030678",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",early invasive strategy vs. conservative management by medication only,Undergoing either conservative management or invasive treatment therapy,75 Years,75 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,46916,United Kingdom,2017,63853.85

METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted to compare the relative efficacy of gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. To assess the cost-effectiveness of these treatments, a Markov model was developed from Dutch societal perspective. The model was based on the clinical studies included in the NMA. Incremental costs per life-year (LY) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were estimated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: Total discounted per patient costs for gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib were euro65,889, euro64,035, euro69,418, and euro131,997, and mean QALYs were 1.36, 1.39, 1.52, and 2.01 per patient, respectively. Erlotinib dominated gefitinib. Afatinib versus erlotinib yielded incremental costs of euro27,058/LY and euro41,504/QALY gained.

22553,Telemonitoring of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (TECCU): Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Although electronic health interventions are considered safe and efficient, evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring in inflammatory bowel disease is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the Telemonitorizacion de la Enfermedad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa (Telemonitoring of Crohn''s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis [TECCU]) Web platform (G_TECCU intervention group) for telemonitoring complex inflammatory bowel disease, compared with standard care (G_control) and nurse-assisted telephone care (G_NT intervention group). METHODS: We analyzed cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective by comparing the 3 follow-up methods used in a previous 24-week randomized controlled trial, conducted at a tertiary university hospital in Spain. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who initiated immunosuppressants or biologic agents, or both, to control inflammatory activity were recruited consecutively. Data on the effects on disease activity (using clinical indexes) and quality-adjusted life-years (using the EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire) were collected. We calculated the costs of health care, equipment, and patients'' productivity and social activity impairment. We compared the mean costs per patient, utilities, and bootstrapped differences. RESULTS: We included 63 patients (21 patients per group). TECCU saved euro1005 (US $1100) per additional patient in remission compared with G_control (95% CI euro-13,518 to 3137; US $-14,798 to 3434), with a 79.96% probability of being more effective at lower costs. Compared with G_NT, TECCU saved euro2250 (US $2463) per additional patient in remission (95% CI euro-15,363 to 11,086; US $-16,817 to 12,135), and G_NT saved euro538 (US $589) compared with G_control (95% CI euro-6475 to 5303; US $-7088 to 5805). G_TECCU and G_NT showed an 84% and 67% probability, respectively, of producing a cost saving per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with G_control, considering those simulations that involved negative incremental QALYs as well. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high probability that the TECCU Web platform is more cost-effective than standard and telephone care in the short term. Further research considering larger cohorts and longer time horizons is required.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the Telemonitorizacion de la Enfermedad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa (Telemonitoring of Crohn''s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis [TECCU]) Web platform (G_TECCU intervention group) for telemonitoring complex inflammatory bowel disease, compared with standard care (G_control) and nurse-assisted telephone care (G_NT intervention group). METHODS: We analyzed cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective by comparing the 3 follow-up methods used in a previous 24-week randomized controlled trial, conducted at a tertiary university hospital in Spain. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who initiated immunosuppressants or biologic agents, or both, to control inflammatory activity were recruited consecutively. Data on the effects on disease activity (using clinical indexes) and quality-adjusted life-years (using the EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire) were collected. We calculated the costs of health care, equipment, and patients'' productivity and social activity impairment. We compared the mean costs per patient, utilities, and bootstrapped differences. RESULTS: We included 63 patients (21 patients per group). TECCU saved euro1005 (US $1100) per additional patient in remission compared with G_control (95% CI euro-13,518 to 3137; US $-14,798 to 3434), with a 79.96% probability of being more effective at lower costs. Compared with G_NT, TECCU saved euro2250 (US $2463) per additional patient in remission (95% CI euro-15,363 to 11,086; US $-16,817 to 12,135), and G_NT saved euro538 (US $589) compared with G_control (95% CI euro-6475 to 5303; US $-7088 to 5805). G_TECCU and G_NT showed an 84% and 67% probability, respectively, of producing a cost saving per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with G_control, considering those simulations that involved negative incremental QALYs as well. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high probability that the TECCU Web platform is more cost-effective than standard and telephone care in the short term.

22556,Selective use of Molecular Testing Based on Sonographic Features of Cytologically Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules: A Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Molecular diagnostics can allow some patients with indeterminate thyroid nodule cytopathology to avoid diagnostic hemithyroidectomy; however, the testing is costly. We hypothesized that molecular testing with the intention of preventing unnecessary diagnostic hemithyroidectomy would be cost-effective if this test was applied selectively based on sonographic risk of malignancy. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed depicting a 40-year-old patient with a cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodule. Molecular testing of fine needle aspiration material was compared to a strategy of immediate diagnostic hemithyroidectomy. Data from a single tertiary-referral health system were reviewed to estimate the outcomes of molecular testing of indeterminate nodules stratified by the American Thyroid Association sonographic classification system. Other outcome probabilities and their utilities were derived from literature review. Costs were estimated with Medicare reimbursement data. A $100,000/QALY threshold for cost-effectiveness was applied. Sensitivity analysis was employed to examine uncertainty in the model''s assumptions. RESULTS: Of 123 patients who underwent molecular testing for indeterminate cytology, 12 (9.8%) were classified as high sonographic suspicion, 49 (40%) were intermediate suspicion, and 62 (50%) were low or very low suspicion. Molecular testing was only cost-effective when the pretest probability of a negative test was greater than 31%. The model was most sensitive to the cost of molecular testing and the quality adjustment factor for hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: In hypothetical modeling, molecular testing is only cost-effective for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules with sonographic features that are intermediate or low suspicion for malignancy.

22559,"Evaluating the Cost Effectiveness of a Suicide Prevention Campaign Implemented in Ontario, Canada","BACKGROUND: Although suicide-prevention campaigns have been implemented in numerous countries, Canada has yet to implement a strategy nationally. This is the first study to examine the cost utility of the implementation of a multidimensional suicide-prevention program that combines several interventions over a 50-year time horizon. METHODS: We used Markov modeling to capture the dynamic changes to health status and estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained over a 50-year period for Ontario residents for a suicide-prevention strategy compared to no intervention. The strategy consisted of a package of interventions geared towards preventing suicide including a public health awareness campaign, increased identification of individuals at risk, increased training of primary-care physicians, and increased treatment post-suicide attempt. Four health states were captured by the Markov model: (1) alive and no recent suicide attempt; (2) suicide attempt; (3) death by suicide; (4) death (other than suicide). Analyses were from a societal perspective where all costs, irrespective of payer, were included. We used a probabilistic analysis to test the robustness of the model results to both variation and uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: Over the 50-year period, the suicide-prevention campaign had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $18,853 (values are in Canadian dollars) per QALY gained. In all one-way sensitivity analyses, the ICER remained under $50,000/QALY. In the probabilistic analysis, there was a probability of 94.8% that the campaign was cost effective at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY (95% confidence interval of ICER probabilistic distribution: 2650-62,375). Among the current population, the intervention was predicted to result in the prevention of 4454 suicides after 50 years (1033 by year 10; 2803 by year 25). A healthcare payer perspective sensitivity analysis showed an ICER of $21,096.14/QALY. INTERPRETATION: These findings demonstrate that a suicide-prevention campaign in Ontario is very likely a cost-effective intervention to reduce the incidence of suicide and suggest suicide-prevention campaigns are likely to be cost effective for some other Canadian provinces and potentially other countries.",2019-01-31873,31535350,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Michael Lebenbaum,2019,/,,Yes,31535350,"Michael Lebenbaum; Amarzaya Jadambaa; Hannah J Thomas; James G Scott; Nicholas Graves; David Brain; Rosana Pacella; Evaluating the Cost Effectiveness of a Suicide Prevention Campaign Implemented in Ontario, Canada, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2019 Jun 28; ():1179-1896",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,suicide prevention campaign vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,16 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,18853,Canada,2016,15365.66
22560,The Cost-effectiveness of Initial Immunomodulators or Infliximab Using Modern Optimization Strategies for Crohn's Disease in the Biosimilar Era,"BACKGROUND: Treatment cost, efficacy, and safety are integral considerations when optimizing management of Crohn''s disease (CD). This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of initial immunomodulator and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents for the treatment of CD from a US third-party perspective, incorporating current treatment algorithms, optimization strategies, and reduced costs availed by biosimilars. METHOD: A 1-year Markov model was developed to simulate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of initial azathioprine, infliximab, and combination therapy for moderate to severe CD. Treatment was changed based on tolerability and clinical disease activity at 3-monthly intervals. Efficacy data were based on published literature. RESULTS: Initial azathioprine had the lowest cost and utility ($35,337 and 0.63 QALYs), whereas combination therapy was the costliest yet conferred the highest health benefits ($57,638 and 0.67 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness of infliximab and combination therapy compared with azathioprine were both in excess of $500,000 per QALY gained. Initial azathioprine remained the most cost-effective treatment on sensitivity analysis compared with infliximab and combination therapy, with 90% reductions in anti-TNF therapy costs and a 5-year time horizon, although combination therapy had an acceptable cost-effectiveness when costs were reduced in the extended model. Initial infliximab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab were dominated by combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the biosimilar era, initial azathioprine with escalation to infliximab appeared more cost-effective in the short term compared with infliximab or combination therapy, although initial combination therapy yields acceptable ICERs in the long term with continued reductions in anti-TNF therapy costs and will likely be the preferred treatment strategy in the future.",2019-01-31880,31532479,Inflamm Bowel Dis,Abhinav Vasudevan,2019,/,,No,31532479,"Abhinav Vasudevan; Teresa Tsakok; Nina Wilson; Nick Dand; Floris C Loeff; Karien Bloem; David Baudry; Michael Duckworth; Shan Pan; Angela Pushpa-Rajah; Joseph F Standing; Annick de Vries; Ali Alsharqi; Gabrielle Becher; Ruth Murphy; Shyamal Wahie; Andrew Wright; Christopher E M Griffiths; Nick J Reynolds; Jonathan Barker; Richard B Warren; A David Burden; Theo Rispens; Deborah Stocken; Catherine Smith; British Association of Dermatolo; The Cost-effectiveness of Initial Immunomodulators or Infliximab Using Modern Optimization Strategies for Crohn's Disease in the Biosimilar Era, Inflamm Bowel Dis, 2019 Jun 10; ():1536-4844",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,azathioprine vs. None,"moderately severe CD, weigh 70kg, naïve to immunomodulators and biologic therapy",35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,50009,United States,2018,51543.28

Initial azathioprine remained the most cost-effective treatment on sensitivity analysis compared with infliximab and combination therapy, with 90% reductions in anti-TNF therapy costs and a 5-year time horizon, although combination therapy had an acceptable cost-effectiveness when costs were reduced in the extended model. Initial infliximab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab were dominated by combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the biosimilar era, initial azathioprine with escalation to infliximab appeared more cost-effective in the short term compared with infliximab or combination therapy, although initial combination therapy yields acceptable ICERs in the long term with continued reductions in anti-TNF therapy costs and will likely be the preferred treatment strategy in the future.",2019-01-31880,31532479,Inflamm Bowel Dis,Abhinav Vasudevan,2019,/,,No,31532479,"Abhinav Vasudevan; Teresa Tsakok; Nina Wilson; Nick Dand; Floris C Loeff; Karien Bloem; David Baudry; Michael Duckworth; Shan Pan; Angela Pushpa-Rajah; Joseph F Standing; Annick de Vries; Ali Alsharqi; Gabrielle Becher; Ruth Murphy; Shyamal Wahie; Andrew Wright; Christopher E M Griffiths; Nick J Reynolds; Jonathan Barker; Richard B Warren; A David Burden; Theo Rispens; Deborah Stocken; Catherine Smith; British Association of Dermatolo; The Cost-effectiveness of Initial Immunomodulators or Infliximab Using Modern Optimization Strategies for Crohn's Disease in the Biosimilar Era, Inflamm Bowel Dis, 2019 Jun 10; ():1536-4844",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,infliximab + azathioprrine vs. Azathioprine,"moderately severe CD, weigh 70kg, naïve to immunomodulators and biologic therapy",35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,511384,United States,2018,527073.34
22565,Influence of Diabetes Complications on HbA1c Treatment Goals Among Older U.S. Adults: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Guidelines on the standard care of diabetes recommend that glycemic treatment goals for older adults consider the patient''s complications and life expectancy. In this study, we examined the influence of diabetes complications and associated life expectancies on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of HbA1c treatment goals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to generate nationally representative subgroups of older individuals with diabetes with various health states. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-RTI International diabetes CE model to estimate the long-term consequences of two treatment goals-a stringent control goal (HbA1c <7.5%) and a moderate control goal (HbA1c <8.5%)-on health and cost. Our simulation population represented typical patients, and all individuals in each health subgroup had average characteristics, which did not account for person-level variations. The CE study was conducted from a health system perspective and followed the study samples over a lifetime. We used $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as the incremental CE threshold. RESULTS: A stringent goal was, on average, cost-effective for individuals with no complications ($10,007 per QALY) or only microvascular complications (excluding renal failure; $19,621 per QALY), but it was not cost-effective for individuals with one or more macrovascular complications (all >$82,413 per QALY). Further, a stringent goal was not cost-effective when an individual had less than 7 years of life remaining.

22573,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared to other anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation in the real-world and trial settings,"INTRODUCTION: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world data (RWD) in patients with atrial fibrillation have shown that-compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs)-non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are at least as effective in the prevention of ischaemic stroke, while decreasing the risk of bleeding. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the NOAC apixaban versus other NOACs (dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) and VKA, for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation by including the available data both from RCT and real-world analyses of all NOACs into one integrative previously published model. METHODS: The model was updated to the current Dutch healthcare situation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated using either efficacy/effectiveness and safety data derived from a network meta-analysis (NMA) synthesizing NOAC RCTs or RWD. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify eligible publication to best inform the RWD-based analysis. Additional sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the outcomes. RESULTS: In the NMA-based analysis, apixaban appeared to be cost-effective compared to VKA (euro3,506 per quality adjusted life-year) and dominant (cost-saving and more effective) over dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.

22581,Cost-effectiveness of stent-retriever thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion strokes of the anterior circulation: Analysis from the French societal perspective,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of stent retriever thrombectomy (SRT) added to standard of care (SOC) in large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes, adopting the French societal perspective given the lack of published studies with such perspective. METHODS: We developed an hybrid model (decision tree until one year post-stroke followed by a Markov model from one year onward). The time horizon was 20 years. We calculated transition probabilities across the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) based on a published meta-analysis. The main outcome measure was quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Resources and input costs were derived from a literature search. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost/QALY. We used 1-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to evaluate the model uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base-case, adding SRT to SOC resulted in increased effectiveness of 0.73 QALY while total costs were reduced by 3,874euro (ICER of -5,400euro/QALY). In the scenario analysis adopting the French healthcare system perspective, the ICER was 4,901euro/QALY. Parameters the most influential were the relative risks of SRT over SOC for 90-days mortality and for 90-days mRS 0-2, and the time horizon. PSA showed the 95% confidence interval of the ICER was -21,324 to 4,591euro/QALY, with SRT having 85.5% chance to be dominant and 100% to be cost-effective at a threshold of 50,000euro/QALY.

22582,The value of persistence in treatment with subcutaneous TNF-alpha inhibitors for ankylosing spondylitis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of persistence on cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (SC-TNFis) from healthcare and societal perspectives in a United Kingdom ankylosing spondylitis (AS) population using a recently published Markov cohort model. METHODS: A recently published cost-effectiveness model developed for a National Institute for health and Care Excellence appraisal was extended to fit the current study; in brief, it is a Markov cohort model where treatment responders continue from the trial period with maintenance SC-TNFi treatment, while non-responders transition to conventional care. Costs and effects were modeled for a hypothetical SC-TNFi with average efficacy and price. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total direct and indirect lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The cost-effectiveness of SC-TNFi persistence was estimated by decreasing the annual discontinuation probability in five percentage point increments from 25 to 5% per annum. RESULTS: From a health care perspective, the ICERs for the modeled discontinuation rates compared to the baseline annual discontinuation rate (25%) ranged between GBP 17,277 and GBP 18,161. From a societal perspective, increased discontinuation rates resulted in decreased total costs and higher QALYs; hence, lower discontinuation rates dominated higher discontinuation rates from a societal perspective. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study shows that, all else equal, higher SC-TNFi treatment persistence in AS is cost effective from a health care perspective and dominant from a societal perspective.

22588,The value of persistence in treatment with subcutaneous TNF-alpha inhibitors for ankylosing spondylitis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of persistence on cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (SC-TNFis) from healthcare and societal perspectives in a United Kingdom ankylosing spondylitis (AS) population using a recently published Markov cohort model. METHODS: A recently published cost-effectiveness model developed for a National Institute for health and Care Excellence appraisal was extended to fit the current study; in brief, it is a Markov cohort model where treatment responders continue from the trial period with maintenance SC-TNFi treatment, while non-responders transition to conventional care. Costs and effects were modeled for a hypothetical SC-TNFi with average efficacy and price. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total direct and indirect lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The cost-effectiveness of SC-TNFi persistence was estimated by decreasing the annual discontinuation probability in five percentage point increments from 25 to 5% per annum. RESULTS: From a health care perspective, the ICERs for the modeled discontinuation rates compared to the baseline annual discontinuation rate (25%) ranged between GBP 17,277 and GBP 18,161. From a societal perspective, increased discontinuation rates resulted in decreased total costs and higher QALYs; hence, lower discontinuation rates dominated higher discontinuation rates from a societal perspective.

22590,The cost-effectiveness of requiring universal vs contextual self-injectable epinephrine autoinjector for allergen immunotherapy,"BACKGROUND: Aeroallergen immunotherapy (AIT) is a safe and effective disease-modifying treatment associated with rare therapy-associated fatality. Significant practice variation surrounds universal or contextual prescription of self-injectable epinephrine (SIE) for patients receiving AIT. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the cost-effectiveness of a universal vs contextual SIE requirement for patients receiving AIT. METHODS: An economic evaluation using cohort and microsimulation was performed from both the societal and health care sector perspectives for patients undergoing AIT, assessing a universal requirement to fill SIE prescriptions at the outset of therapy compared with requiring this only after a systemic reaction to immunotherapy (SRIT). RESULTS: A universal SIE requirement for AIT is not cost-effective, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for this strategy estimated at $669,327,730 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In the microsimulation (n = 10,000), the mean (SD) costs of a universal approach exceeded that of a more context-specific strategy where SIE was only prescribed for patients after an initial SRIT ($19,653.36 [$4296.66] vs $16,232.14 [$5204.32]), and given the effects on rates of AIT discontinuation, the universal approach was less effective (mean [SD], 25.555 [2.285] QALYs) compared with a contextualized approach (mean [SD], 25.579 [2.345] QALYs). Universal SIE prescription could be cost-effective if it provided a 1000 times protection against AIT fatality at a value-based cost of $24, and the annual AIT fatality rates unrealistically exceed 2.6 per 10,000 patients.

22592,Certified service dogs - A cost-effectiveness analysis appraisal,"INTRODUCTION: Individuals with functional impairments or chronic diseases are often in need of assistance in their daily lives. For these individuals it is essential to find novel, cost-effective solutions to meet their needs. Service dogs are dogs that are specially trained to assist individuals with functional impairments and may be able to improve these individuals'' quality of life at a reasonable cost, i.e. be cost effective. Cost-effectiveness analyses are used to illustrate the cost of an intervention in relation to its effects and provide important input to decision-makers when setting priorities. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of a certified physical service dog and a diabetes alert dog compared to a regular companion dog. METHOD: Costs, life years and quality-adjusted life years were estimated over a 10-year time horizon using a decision-analytic model built upon evidence from the""service and hearing dog project"". The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per gained quality-adjusted life year. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective. Costs and effects were discounted with 3% per annum and reported in USD. RESULTS: Compared to a regular companion dog, a physical service dog is cost saving [-6,000 USD] and gives the dog owner more quality-adjusted life years [0.28]. The diabetes alert dog is also cost effective in comparison with a regular companion dog [-4,500 USD, 0.06 QALYs]. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that a certified service dog is cost saving in comparison with a regular companion dog for individuals with functional impairments or chronic diseases.

22594,A cost-utility analysis of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment of erectile dysfunction,"INTRODUCTION: Patent expiration for erectile dysfunction (ED) treatments like sildenafil means loss of exclusivity (LOE), and other manufacturers may bring generics to the market. This has resulted in price reductions, which influences the cost-effectiveness. In Norway, this development has led to a discussion on whether reimbursement should be granted. Cost-effectiveness analysis in this treatment area is scarce and more research is demanded. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of three separate phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in ED therapy in a Norwegian setting. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was analyzed using two patient populations: (1) 55-year-old patients diagnosed with ED and with no specific underlying illness, and (2) 55-year-old patients diagnosed with ED and with diabetes as an underlying illness. Using a state-transition Markov model with a 10-year time horizon, a ""no-treatment"" option was compared with three treatment strategies: (1) treatment using 50/100 mg sildenafil; (2) treatment using 10/20 mg tadalafil; (3) treatment using 10 mg vardenafil. A societal perspective was applied. RESULTS: All PDE5 inhibitor treatment strategies were cost-effective compared to a ""no-treatment"" option, with cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year of less than euro15,000. With a willingness-to-pay threshold greater than euro13,500, sildenafil was estimated as the dominant treatment strategy. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated robust results. However, as the expected value of information was considerable, the cost-effectiveness of conducting further research to reduce uncertainty should be considered. Treating a diabetic population was less cost-effective for all PDE5 inhibitors and was associated with greater uncertainty with regard to choosing the optimal strategy.

Using a state-transition Markov model with a 10-year time horizon, a ""no-treatment"" option was compared with three treatment strategies: (1) treatment using 50/100 mg sildenafil; (2) treatment using 10/20 mg tadalafil; (3) treatment using 10 mg vardenafil. A societal perspective was applied. RESULTS: All PDE5 inhibitor treatment strategies were cost-effective compared to a ""no-treatment"" option, with cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year of less than euro15,000. With a willingness-to-pay threshold greater than euro13,500, sildenafil was estimated as the dominant treatment strategy. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated robust results. However, as the expected value of information was considerable, the cost-effectiveness of conducting further research to reduce uncertainty should be considered. Treating a diabetic population was less cost-effective for all PDE5 inhibitors and was associated with greater uncertainty with regard to choosing the optimal strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil treatment of erectile dysfunction was a cost-effective alternative compared to tadalafil and vardenafil, as well as compared to a ""no-treatment"" option. Treating a diabetic population is less cost-effective for all PDE5 inhibitors and was associated with greater uncertainty.",2019-01-31938,31512069,Eur J Health Econ,Svenn Alexander Hansen,2019,/,,Yes,31512069,"Svenn Alexander Hansen; Saeid Safiri; Ali Asghar Kolahi; Damian Hoy; Emma Smith; Deepti Bettampadi; Mohammad Ali Mansournia; Amir Almasi-Hashiani; Ahad Ashrafi-Asgarabad; Maziar Moradi-Lakeh; Mostafa Qorbani; Gary Collins; Anthony D Woolf; Lyn March; Marita Cross; A cost-utility analysis of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, Eur J Health Econ, 2019 Jun 19; ():1618-7598",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,tadalafil vs. Sildenafil,Diabetic,55 Years,55 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,-610000,Euro,2017,-727833.2
22600,Cost-Effectiveness of Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pump Therapy Versus Continuous Insulin Infusion in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes in Turkey,"Background and Aims: Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) combines continuous glucose monitoring with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). SAP is costlier than CSII but provides additional clinical benefits relative to CSII alone. A long-term cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine whether SAP is cost-effective relative to CSII in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Turkey. Methods: Analyses were performed in two different patient cohorts, one with poor glycemic control at baseline (mean glycated hemoglobin 9.0% [75 mmol/mol]) and a second cohort considered to be at increased risk of hypoglycemic events. Clinical input data and direct medical costs were sourced from published literature. The analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective over patient lifetimes and future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In both patient cohorts, SAP was associated with a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy but higher costs relative to CSII (incremental gain of 1.40 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] in patients with poor baseline glycemic control and 1.73 QALYs in patients at increased risk of hypoglycemic events). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for SAP versus CSII were TRY 76,971 (EUR 11,612) per QALY gained for patients with poor baseline glycemic control and TRY 69,534 (EUR 10,490) per QALY gained for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia. Conclusions: SAP is associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes versus CSII, and in Turkey, SAP is likely to represent good value for money compared with CSII in T1D patients with poor glycemic control and/or with frequent severe hypoglycemic events.",2019-01-31941,31509715,Diabetes Technol Ther,Stephane Roze,2019,21 / 12,727-735,No,31509715,"Stephane Roze; Aysegul Erman; William W L Wong; Jordan J Feld; Paul Grootendorst; Murray D Krahn; Cost-Effectiveness of Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pump Therapy Versus Continuous Insulin Infusion in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes in Turkey, Diabetes Technol Ther , 2019 Dec; 21(12):1557-8593; 727-735",QALY,Turkey,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Device, Pharmaceutical",sensor-augmented pump therapy + continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs. continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion,Poor glycemic control,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,76971,Turkey,2016,27454.45
