14301,The prospective evaluation of the TB strain typing service in England: a mixed methods study,"BACKGROUND: In response to rising TB notification rates in England, universal strain typing was introduced in 2010. We evaluated the acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the TB strain typing service (TB-STS). METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation using routine laboratory, clinic and public health data. We estimated the effect of the TB-STS on detection of false positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnoses (2010-2012); contact tracing yield (number of infections or active disease per pulmonary TB case); and diagnostic delay. We developed a deterministic age-structured compartmental model to explore the effectiveness of the TB-STS, which informed a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Semi-structured interviews explored user experience. Strain typing identified 17 additional false positive diagnoses. The TB-STS had no significant effect on contact tracing yield or diagnostic delay. Mathematical modelling suggested increasing the proportion of infections detected would have little value in reducing TB incidence in the white UK-born population. However, in the non-white UK-born and non-UK-born populations, over 20 years, if detection of latent infection increases from 3% to 13% per year, then TB incidence would decrease by 11%; reducing diagnostic delay by one week could lead to 25% reduction in incidence. The current TB-STS was not predicted to be cost-effective over 20 years ( pound95 628/quality-adjusted life-years). Interviews found people had mixed experiences, but identified broader benefits, of the TB-STS. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce costs, improve efficiency and increase effectiveness, we recommend changes to the TB-STS, including discontinuing routine cluster investigations and focusing on reducing diagnostic delay across the TB programme. This evaluation of a complex intervention informs the future of strain typing in the era of rapidly advancing technologies.",2015-01-18278,25882538,Thorax,J Mears,2016,71 / 8,,No,25882538,"J Mears; E Vynnycky; J Lord; M W Borgdorff; T Cohen; D Crisp; J A Innes; M Lilley; H Maguire; T D McHugh; G Woltmann; I Abubakar; P Sonnenberg; The prospective evaluation of the TB strain typing service in England: a mixed methods study, Thorax, 2016 Aug; 71(8):0040-6376",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal tuberculosis strain typing service vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.50,3.50,95628,United Kingdom,2013,166178.78
14302,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the available pneumococcal conjugated vaccines for children under five years in Colombia,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal diseases in children under five years are common and preventable. In Colombia there are two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) that have proved clinical efficacy. The aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 13-valent PCV (PCV13) and 10-valent PCV (PCV10) in terms of prevention of Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases (IPD), radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, and their related mortality, as well as, acute otitis media (AOM) in a cohort of newborns in Colombia. METHODS: We developed an analytical decision tree model with national data including the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in Colombia between 2009 and 2013. A simulation of vaccination of 90% of newborns in Colombia took place with a time horizon of 5 years. The analysis was done from the Colombian health system perspective. Vaccines efficacy parameters were measured as life-years gained (LYG) and avoided morbidity by pneumococcal diseases; they were determined by a systematic review of literature. A health insurance company provided the costs. A probabilistic and a univariate sensitivity analysis for epidemiological, efficacy and cost parameters were done. RESULTS: After 5 years projection, PCV13 would prevent 437 deaths due to pneumococcal infections versus 321 that would be prevented by PCV10, compared to no vaccination. PCV13 would generate 25 396 LYG, and PCV10 would generate 18 708 LYG. Medical costs avoided would be US$ 19 479 395 for PCV13 and US$ 13 703 271 for PCV10. Compared to no vaccination, PCV13 and PCV10 were cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 489.26 and US$ 813.41 per additional LYG, respectively; besides, PCV13 was dominant over PCV10 due to lower costs and better outcomes. CONCLUSION: PCV13 is a cost-saving strategy compared with PCV10, as part of a universal coverage vaccination program in Colombian children under one year. PCV13 is expected to lead to a greater decrement in infant mortality from pneumococcal diseases, and a higher cost saving by preventing more pneumococcal diseases compared with PCV10 in a 5 years projection.",2015-01-18297,25878563,Int J Cardiol,Jaime E Ordonez,2015,13 /,6,No,25878563,"Jaime E Ordonez; John Jairo Orozco; Cost-effectiveness analysis of the available pneumococcal conjugated vaccines for children under five years in Colombia, Int J Cardiol, 2015; 13():1874-1754; 6",QALY,Colombia,Not Stated,Not Stated,13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13) vs. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10),Not Stated,4 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Colombia,2013,Not Stated

14305,Frontline rituximab monotherapy induction versus a watch and wait approach for asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: A watch and wait (WW) strategy is the standard of care for patients with asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma. Recent data have demonstrated an improvement in the time to progression with rituximab induction (RI) with or without rituximab maintenance (RM) in comparison with a WW strategy wait in such patients. It remains unclear whether this is a cost-effective strategy. METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was developed to compare the clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of RI (4 weekly doses) plus RM (12 doses every 2 months), RI (4 weekly doses), and a WW strategy for patients newly diagnosed with low-burden, asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma over a lifetime horizon. Baseline probabilities and utilities were derived from a systematic review of published studies, and they were evaluated on a 6-month cycle. A Canadian public health payer's perspective was adopted, and costs were presented in 2012 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: RI was the cheapest strategy. It was less costly at $59,953 versus $67,489 for the RM arm and $75,895 for the WW arm. It was also associated with a slightly lower quality-adjusted life expectancy at 6.16 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus 6.28 QALYs for the RM strategy but was superior to WW (5.71 QALYs). In sensitivity analyses of key variables, this effectiveness was sensitive to the probability of first and second progression in the RI arm, and this indicated relatively neutral effectiveness between the 2 rituximab arms.

14307,Health and economic outcomes of introducing the new MenB vaccine (Bexsero) into the Italian routine infant immunisation programme,"INTRODUCTION: In January 2013 a novel type of multicomponent protein-based vaccine against group B meningococcal disease was licensed by the European Medicines Agency. With the widespread use of the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines, serogroup B remains now the major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia in young children in Europe. The aim of this study is to investigate the health and the economic outcomes of MenB vaccine introduction into the Italian routine mass vaccination programme. METHODS: The present work is structured in two main parts. Firstly, we assess the epidemiological burden of group B meningococcal disease using official hospitalisation and notification data from two of the most populated Italian regions (Lombardia and Piemonte) during a 6-year study period (2007-2012). Secondly, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the immunisation programme in Italy from the public health payer perspective under base case parameters assumptions and performing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness and the uncertainty of our model results. RESULTS: MenB serotype is responsible for 59% of the 341 cases of Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Lombardia and Piemonte. Incidence rate for MenB infection is estimated to be 0.21/100,000/y resulting at the highest level in children </=4 years of age. Although the new MenB vaccine can potentially prevent about one third of the disease cases in the Italian population, model results show this strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective (ICER value over euro350,000/QALY) with a vaccine that prevents disease only. These results are robust under most of the sensitivity scenarios except when allowing for lower discount rates. DISCUSSION: The introduction of the novel vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule needs to be carefully evaluated. The new MenB vaccine has the potential to reduce the disease burden at the population level. However, from the Italian Health Service perspective, the immunisation programme is unlikely to be cost-effective at the current incidence levels and vaccine price.",2015-01-18306,25874805,PLoS One,Marcello Tirani,2015,10 / 4,e0123383,No,25874805,"Marcello Tirani; Michela Meregaglia; Alessia Melegaro; Health and economic outcomes of introducing the new MenB vaccine (Bexsero) into the Italian routine infant immunisation programme, PLoS One , 2015; 10(4):1932-6203; e0123383",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bexsero vaccinaiton to prevent group b meningococcal disease vs. None,Born into a susceptible unvaccinated state,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,376042,Euro,2013,554864.55

METHODS: Markov model projecting distant recurrence, survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs over a 30-year time horizon. RESULTS: Oncotype DX was projected to increase QALYs by 0.11 (0.07-0.58) and costs with euro1236 (range: -euro142-euro1236) resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro11,236/QALY under the most conservative scenario.

We conducted an economic evaluation from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system based on trial data. METHODS: The primary outcome was an incremental cost utility analysis comparing costs and benefits associated with GDP vs DHAP. Resource utilization data were collected from 519 Canadian patients in the trial. Costs were presented in 2012 Canadian dollars and disaggregated to highlight the major cost drivers of care. Benefit was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on utilities translated from prospectively collected quality-of-life data. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The mean overall costs of treatment per patient in the GDP and DHAP arms were $19 961 (95% confidence interval (CI) = $17 286 to $24 565) and $34 425 (95% CI = $31 901 to $39 520), respectively, with an incremental difference in direct medical costs of $14 464 per patient in favor of GDP (P < .001). The predominant cost driver for both treatment arms was related to hospitalizations. The mean discounted quality-adjusted overall survival with GDP was 0.161 QALYs and 0.152 QALYs for DHAP (difference = 0.01 QALYs, P = .146). In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, GDP was associated with both cost savings and improved quality-adjusted outcomes compared with DHAP in 92.6% of cost-pair simulations. CONCLUSIONS: GDP was associated with both lower costs and similar quality-adjusted outcomes compared with DHAP in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.

14310,Cost-effectiveness of mass screening for untreated atrial fibrillation using intermittent ECG recording,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 2 weeks of intermittent screening for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) in 75/76-year-old individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness analysis of screening in 75-year-old individuals was based on a lifelong decision analytic Markov model. In this model, 1000 hypothetical individuals, who matched the population of the STROKESTOP study, were simulated. The population was analysed for different parameters such as prevalence, AF status, treatment with oral anticoagulation, stroke risk, utility, and costs. In the base-case scenario, screening of 1000 individuals resulted in 263 fewer patient-years with undetected AF. This implies eight fewer strokes, 11 more life-years, and 12 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per 1000 screened individuals. The screening implies an incremental cost of euro50 012, resulting in a cost of euro4313 per gained QALY and euro6583 per avoided stroke.

14311,A cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination of boys for the prevention of oropharyngeal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Many western countries have established female human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs for the prevention of cervical cancer. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) has proven efficacy against additional HPV-related disease in both sexes, but the cost effectiveness of male HPV vaccination remains controversial. To assess the cost effectiveness of male HPV vaccination in Canada with respect to oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), the authors performed a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: After an extensive literature review regarding HPV-related OPC in Canadian males, health care costs and clinical effectiveness estimates were obtained. A Markov model was used to compare the potential costs and effectiveness of HPV4 versus no vaccination among boys aged 12 years. A theoretical cohort based on a Canadian population of 192,940 boys aged 12 years in 2012 was assumed to apply the model. A 3-month cycle length was used with a ""lifetime"" time horizon. The outcome of the analysis was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were conducted on variables, including the vaccine uptake rate and vaccine efficacy. RESULTS: Assuming 99% vaccine efficacy and 70% uptake, HPV4 produced 0.05 more QALYs and saved $145 Canadian dollars (CAD) per individual compared with no vaccine (QALYs and costs were discounted at 5% per year). Assuming 50% vaccine efficacy and 50% uptake, HPV4 produced 0.023 more QALYs and saved $42 CAD. The results indicated that HPV4 in males may potentially save between $8 and $28 million CAD for the theoretical cohort of 192,940 over its lifetime. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this model, HPV vaccination for boys aged 12 years may be a cost-effective strategy for the prevention of OPC in Canada.",2015-01-18322,25867018,Cancer,Donna M Graham,2015,121 / 11,1785-92,No,25867018,"Donna M Graham; Wanrudee Isaranuwatchai; Steven Habbous; Claire de Oliveira; Geoffrey Liu; Lillian L Siu; Jeffrey S Hoch; A cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination of boys for the prevention of oropharyngeal cancer, Cancer, 2015 Jun 1; 121(11):0008-543X; 1785-92",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccination vaccine (HPV4) vs. None,"Vaccine efficacy was 83.8% and that the uptake rate was 50%,",12 Years,12 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-2454.29,Canada,2009,-2606.5
14312,Cost-effectiveness of pretransplant sofosbuvir for preventing recurrent hepatitis C virus infection after liver transplantation,"There are reports of pretransplant sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ribavirin being effective in preventing recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation (LT). The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in the area served by the North Italy Transplant program. We retrospectively assessed the impact of HCV infection on post-LT survival in 2376 consecutive adult patients (MELD </= 25, unknown genotype, period 2004-2009) and the prevalence costs of conventional standard of care (SOC) antiviral therapy (pegylated interferon plus ribavirin) after LT. A Markov model was developed to compare two strategies: 12-24 weeks of SOF+ ribavirin for pre-LT anti-HCV treatment versus on-demand post-LT SOC antiviral therapy. Among the 1794 patients undergoing LT, 860 (48%) were HCV+ and 50% of them were given SOC therapy after LT (mean cost of drugs and adverse effect management = 14 421euro per patient). HCV etiology had a strong impact on post-LT survival (hazard ratio = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.22-2.09, P = 0.0007). After Monte Carlo simulation, pre-LT SOF therapy showed a median survival benefit of 1.5 quality-adjusted life years and an Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 30 663euro/QALY, proving cost-effective in our particular Italian scenario. The costs of SOF therapy, sustained viral response rate 12 weeks after LT, and recipient's age were the main ICER predictors at multivariate analysis.

14313,Cost effectiveness of treating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis by adding Deltyba to background regimens in Germany,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of adding delamanid (Deltyba) to a background regimen (BR) for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Germany. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of treating a cohort of MDR-TB patients, 38-years old on average, with Deltyba plus BR versus a five drug- BR regimen alone was compared in a Markov model over a period of 10 years. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were determined from a societal perspective. Recent data from a German cost calculation on MDR-TB were applied to the 24-month outcome results of patients participating in the placebo-controlled, phase II Otsuka's Trial 204. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3% and subjected to deterministic as well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Based on the current market prices the total discounted cost per patient on BR plus Deltyba was euro142,732 compared to euro150,909 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per patient were 8.47 for Deltyba versus 6.13 for BR alone. Accordingly, the addition of Deltyba proved to be dominant over the BR alone-strategy by simultaneously saving euro8177 and gaining 2.34 QALYs. Deltyba was cost saving in 73% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses compared to BR alone and 100% cost effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of euro10,000. CONCLUSIONS: Under conditions prevalent in Germany, Deltyba added to a five drug BR regimen is likely to be cost-saving compared to BR alone under a wide range of assumptions. Adding delamanid remained cost-effective when costs due to loss of productivity were excluded as the QALYs gained by lower lethality and a higher proportion of successfully treated patients outweighed the delamanid drug costs. These results strongly support the application of Deltyba in treating MDR-TB patients.",2015-01-18331,25862597,Respir Med,Roland Diel,2015,109 / 5,632-41,No,25862597,"Roland Diel; Norbert Hittel; Tom Schaberg; Cost effectiveness of treating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis by adding Deltyba to background regimens in Germany, Respir Med, 2015 May; 109(5):0954-6111; 632-41",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adding delamanid (deltyba) to antibiotic regimen vs. Standard/Usual Care- Background regimen only,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-3494.33,Euro,2013,-5156.02
14314,Tramadol and the risk of fracture in an elderly female population: a cost utility assessment with comparison to transdermal buprenorphine,"INTRODUCTION: Opioid treatment for chronic pain is a known risk factor for falls and/or fractures in elderly patients. The latter cause a significant cost to the National Health Service and the Personal Social Services in the UK. Tramadol has a higher risk of fractures than some other opioid analgesics used to treat moderate-to-severe pain and, in the model described here, we investigate the cost effectiveness of transdermal buprenorphine treatment compared with tramadol in a high-risk population. METHODS: A model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of tramadol compared with transdermal buprenorphine over a 1-year time horizon and a patient population of high-risk patients (female patients age 75 or older). To estimate the total cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of treatment, published odds ratios are used in combination with the published incidence rates of four types of fracture: hip, wrist, humerus and other. RESULTS: The model shows tramadol to be associated with 1,058 more fractures per 100,000 patients per year compared with transdermal buprenorphine, resulting in transdermal buprenorphine being cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than pound7,000 compared with tramadol. Sensitivity analysis found this result to be robust. LIMITATIONS: In the UK data, there is uncertainty regarding the transdermal buprenorphine odds ratios for fractures. Odds ratios published in Danish and Swedish studies show similar point estimates but are associated with less uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Transdermal buprenorphine is cost-effective compared to tramadol at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY.",2015-01-18334,25861916,Eur J Health Econ,Alexander Hirst,2015,/,,Yes,25861916,"Alexander Hirst; Chris Knight; Matt Hirst; Will Dunlop; Ron Akehurst; Tramadol and the risk of fracture in an elderly female population: a cost utility assessment with comparison to transdermal buprenorphine, Eur J Health Econ, 2015 Sep 10; ():1618-7598",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tramadol vs. Transdermal buprenorphine,High fracture risk,Not Stated,75 Years,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,6979,United Kingdom,2014,12577.19
14315,Long-term Cost-effectiveness of Statin Treatment for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of statins for primary prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in the elderly in Singapore. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of statin treatment in those aged 65 years and older without a history of stroke or MI from the perspective of Singapore's healthcare system, using elderly-specific clinical data and local costs from hospital databases. A lifetime horizon was used and all costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, statin treatment prevented an additional four strokes and eight MIs among 1,000 ""healthy"" elderly individuals compared with no treatment. Statin treatment resulted in a QALY gain of 0.26 and additional costs of SGD 11,314 per person, yielding an ICER of SGD 43,925 (USD 33,495) per QALY gained. The results were sensitive to statin effectiveness, particularly statins' effect on all-cause mortality, and cost of statin medication. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability of statin treatment being cost-effective was 72% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of SGD 65,000 (USD 49,546) per QALY gained. Shortening the time horizon from lifetime to 10 years (simulating limited life expectancy) considerably increased the ICER to SGD 291,313 (USD 167,171) per QALY. Female gender and younger age were also associated with higher ICERs owing to a lower baseline risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and higher costs to manage events in these subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in the elderly was cost-effective. However, treatment warrants re-evaluation when the prognosis of the individual is considered less than ten years; other goals may take precedence over CVD prevention.",2015-01-18335,25860556,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,Liang Lin,2015,29 / 2,187-97,No,25860556,"Liang Lin; Monica Teng; Ying Jiao Zhao; Ai Leng Khoo; Raymond Chee Seong Seet; Quek Wei Yong; Tiong Cheng Yeo; Boon Peng Lim; Long-term Cost-effectiveness of Statin Treatment for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly, Cardiovasc Drugs Ther, 2015 Apr; 29(2):0920-3206; 187-97",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Statin treatment vs. None,Not Stated,85 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,43925,Singapore,2013,39012.15
14316,Endovascular strategy or open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: one-year outcomes from the IMPROVE randomized trial,"AIMS: To report the longer term outcomes following either a strategy of endovascular repair first or open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which are necessary for both patient and clinical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS: This pragmatic multicentre (29 UK and 1 Canada) trial randomized 613 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ruptured aneurysm; 316 to an endovascular first strategy (if aortic morphology is suitable, open repair if not) and 297 to open repair. The principal 1-year outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were re-interventions, hospital discharge, health-related quality-of-life (QoL) (EQ-5D), costs, Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness [incremental net benefit (INB)]. At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 41.1% for the endovascular strategy group and 45.1% for the open repair group, odds ratio 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62, 1.17], P = 0.325, with similar re-intervention rates in each group. The endovascular strategy group and open repair groups had average total hospital stays of 17 and 26 days, respectively, P < 0.001. Patients surviving rupture had higher average EQ-5D utility scores in the endovascular strategy vs. open repair groups, mean differences 0.087 (95% CI 0.017, 0.158), 0.068 (95% CI -0.004, 0.140) at 3 and 12 months, respectively. There were indications that QALYs were higher and costs lower for the endovascular first strategy, combining to give an INB of pound3877 (95% CI pound253, pound7408) or euro4356 (95% CI euro284, euro8323). CONCLUSION: An endovascular first strategy for management of ruptured aneurysms does not offer a survival benefit over 1 year but offers patients faster discharge with better QoL and is cost-effective.

14317,Cost-effectiveness of once daily GLP-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide compared to bolus insulin both in combination with basal insulin for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in Norway,"BACKGROUND: Lixisenatide is a potent, selective and short-acting once daily prandial glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist which lowers glycohemoglobin and body weight by clinically significant amounts in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin, with limited risk of hypoglycemia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of lixisenatide versus bolus insulin, both in combination with basal insulin, in patients with type 2 diabetes in Norway. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model, a non-product-specific and validated simulation model, was used to make clinical and cost projections. Transition probabilities, risk adjustments and the progression of complication risk factors were derived from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, supplemented with Norwegian data. Patients were assumed to receive combination treatment with basal insulin, lixisenatide or bolus insulin therapy for 3 years, followed by intensification of a basal-bolus insulin regimen for their remaining lifetime. Simulated healthcare costs, taken from the public payer perspective, were derived from microcosting and diagnosis related groups, discounted at 4% per annum and reported in Norwegian krone (NOK). Productivity costs were also captured based on extractions from the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration. Health state utilities were derived from a systematic literature review. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: Lixisenatide in combination with basal insulin was associated with increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and reduced lifetime healthcare costs compared to bolus insulin in combination with basal insulin in patients with Type 2 diabetes, and can be considered dominant. The net monetary benefit of lixisenatide versus bolus insulin was NOK 39,369 per patient. Results were sensitive to discounting, the application of excess body weight associated disutility and uncertainty surrounding the changes in HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: Lixisenatide may be considered an economically efficient therapy in combination with basal insulin in the Norwegian setting, due to cost savings, weight loss and associated gains in health-related quality of life.",2015-01-18349,25853868,Eur J Public Health,Pernilla Huetson,2015,/,1-13,No,25853868,"Pernilla Huetson; James L Palmer; Andree Levorsen; Marie Fournier; Maeva Germe; Euan McLeod; Cost-effectiveness of once daily GLP-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide compared to bolus insulin both in combination with basal insulin for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in Norway, Eur J Public Health, 2015 Sep 21; ():1464-360X; 1-13",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Not Stated,Once daily glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1) receptor agonist lixisenatide with basal insulin vs. Bolus insulin with basal insulin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"45 Years, 20 years",4.00,4.00,-104075.76,Norway,2012,-20178.45

14324,An economic evaluation of conception strategies for heterosexual serodiscordant couples where the male partner is HIV-positive,"BACKGROUND: To conduct an economic evaluation of the three commonly used interventions that reduce sexual HIV transmission when an HIV-negative female aims to conceive with an HIV-positive male on combination antiretroviral therapy (condomless sex restricted to timed ovulation [CS], sperm washing with intrauterine insemination [SW] and condomless sex restricted to timed ovulation with pre-exposure prophylaxis [CS-PrEP]). As SW and CS-PrEP are only privately available for pregnancy planning for this population in Canada, this study was conducted to inform policy decisions concerning potential public health insurance coverage, as well as to inform fertility counselling in settings with adequate combination antiretroviral therapy access globally. METHODS: We developed a cohort Markov model with a lifetime horizon and used the perspective of Ontario's Ministry of Health (MOH). Input parameters were drawn from literature, the MOH's Schedule of Benefits and a time trade-off questionnaire designed for this study. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness. Costs and benefits were discounted at annual rates of 3%. Costs were reported in Canadian 2013 dollars and an exchange rate of 1 USD to 1.066 CND was applied where necessary. Sensitivity analysis assessed the uncertainty of model parameters. RESULTS: The base case analysis found that CS-PrEP and SW were each more costly and less effective at conception than CS.

14325,An economic evaluation of conception strategies for heterosexual serodiscordant couples where the male partner is HIV-positive,"BACKGROUND: To conduct an economic evaluation of the three commonly used interventions that reduce sexual HIV transmission when an HIV-negative female aims to conceive with an HIV-positive male on combination antiretroviral therapy (condomless sex restricted to timed ovulation [CS], sperm washing with intrauterine insemination [SW] and condomless sex restricted to timed ovulation with pre-exposure prophylaxis [CS-PrEP]). As SW and CS-PrEP are only privately available for pregnancy planning for this population in Canada, this study was conducted to inform policy decisions concerning potential public health insurance coverage, as well as to inform fertility counselling in settings with adequate combination antiretroviral therapy access globally. METHODS: We developed a cohort Markov model with a lifetime horizon and used the perspective of Ontario's Ministry of Health (MOH). Input parameters were drawn from literature, the MOH's Schedule of Benefits and a time trade-off questionnaire designed for this study. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness. Costs and benefits were discounted at annual rates of 3%. Costs were reported in Canadian 2013 dollars and an exchange rate of 1 USD to 1.066 CND was applied where necessary. Sensitivity analysis assessed the uncertainty of model parameters. RESULTS: The base case analysis found that CS-PrEP and SW were each more costly and less effective at conception than CS. The results were robust in the sensitivity analysis and suggest that CS is the dominant conception strategy in this population.

14341,The optimal imaging strategy for patients with stable chest pain: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The optimal imaging strategy for patients with stable chest pain is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of different imaging strategies for patients with stable chest pain. DESIGN: Microsimulation state-transition model. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: 60-year-old patients with a low to intermediate probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: The United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. INTERVENTION: Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, cardiac stress magnetic resonance imaging, stress single-photon emission CT, and stress echocardiography. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The strategy that maximized QALYs and was cost-effective in the United States and the Netherlands began with coronary CT angiography, continued with cardiac stress imaging if angiography found at least 50% stenosis in at least 1 coronary artery, and ended with catheter-based coronary angiography if stress imaging induced ischemia of any severity. For U.K. men, the preferred strategy was optimal medical therapy without catheter-based coronary angiography if coronary CT angiography found only moderate CAD or stress imaging induced only mild ischemia. In these strategies, stress echocardiography was consistently more effective and less expensive than other stress imaging tests. For U.K. women, the optimal strategy was stress echocardiography followed by catheter-based coronary angiography if echocardiography induced mild or moderate ischemia. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to changes in the probability of CAD and assumptions about false-positive results. LIMITATIONS: All cardiac stress imaging tests were assumed to be available. Exercise electrocardiography was included only in a sensitivity analysis. Differences in QALYs among strategies were small.

The cost-effectiveness of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) in this setting remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of the WCD with discharge home, discharge to a skilled nursing facility, or inpatient monitoring for the prevention of SCA after infected ICD removal. METHODS: A decision model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of use of the WCD to several different strategies for patients who undergo ICD removal. One-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainties. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness of the WCD strategy was $20,300 per life-year (LY) or $26,436 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared to discharge home without a WCD. Discharge to a skilled nursing facility and in-hospital monitoring resulted in higher costs and worse clinical outcomes.

Endovascular repair (EV) has been increasingly used with good short-term results. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OPEN, EV, and CONS for the treatment of SAAs. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2013 software (TreeAge Inc, Williamstown, Mass) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatments for SAAs. A hypothetical cohort of 10,000 55-year-old female patients with SAAs was assessed in the reference-case analysis. Perioperative mortality, disease-specific mortality rates, complications, rupture risks, and reinterventions were retrieved from a recent and extensive meta-analysis. Costs were analyzed with the 2014 Medicare database. The willingness to pay was set to $60,000/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Outcomes evaluated were QALYs, costs from the health care perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed and different clinical scenarios evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to include the uncertainty around the variables. A flowchart for clinical decision-making was developed. RESULTS: For a 55-year-old female patient with a SAA, EV has the highest QALYs (11.32; 95% credibility interval [CI], 9.52-13.17), followed by OPEN (10.48; 95% CI, 8.75-12.25) and CONS (10.39; 95% CI, 8.96-11.87). The difference in effect for 55-year-old female patients between EV and OPEN is 0.84 QALY (95% CI, 0.42-1.34), comparable with 10 months in perfect health. EV is more effective and less costly than OPEN and more effective and more expensive compared with CONS, with an ICER of $17,154/QALY. Moreover, OPEN, with an ICER of $223,166/QALY, is not cost-effective compared with CONS. In elderly individuals (age >78 years), the ICER of EV vs CONS is $60,503/QALY and increases further with age, making EV no longer cost-effective. Very elderly patients (age >93 years) have higher QALYs and lower costs when treated with CONS. The EV group has the highest number of expected reinterventions, followed by CONS and OPEN, and the number of expected reinterventions decreases with age.

14377,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Morcellation Hysterectomy for Myomas,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of eliminating morcellation in the surgical treatment of leiomyomas from a societal perspective. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DESIGN CLASSIFICATION: Not applicable. SETTING: A theoretical cohort of women undergoing hysterectomy for myoma disease large enough to require morcellation. PATIENTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: A decision analysis model was constructed using probabilities, costs, and utility data from published sources. A cost-effectiveness analysis analyzing both quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cases of disseminated cancer was performed to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of eliminating morcellation as a tool in the surgical treatment of leiomyomas. Costs and utilities were discounted using standard methodology. The base case included health care system costs and costs incurred by the patient for surgery-related disability. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of various assumptions. MAIN RESULTS: The cost to prevent 1 case of disseminated cancer was $10 540 832. A strategy of nonmorcellation hysterectomy via laparotomy costed more ($30 359.92 vs $20 853.15) and yielded more QALYs (21.284 vs 21.280) relative to morcellation hysterectomy. The ICER for nonmorcellation hysterectomy compared with morcellation hysterectomy was $2 184 172 per QALY. Health care costs (prolonged hospitalizations) and costs to patients of prolonged time away from work were the primary drivers of cost differential between the 2 strategies. Even when the incidence of occult sarcoma in leiomyoma surgery was ranged to twice that reported in the literature (.98%), the ICER for nonmorcellation hysterectomy was $644 393.30. CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating morcellation hysterectomy as a treatment for myomas is not cost-effective under a wide variety of probability and cost assumptions.

14378,Sedative-hypnotic medicines and falls in community-dwelling older adults: a cost-effectiveness (decision-tree) analysis from a US Medicare perspective,"BACKGROUND: Both the 2012 Beers list and the American Geriatric Society 'Choosing Wisely' campaign suggest restraint in the use of sedative-hypnotics for the treatment of insomnia in older people. Sedative hypnotic agents continue to be widely prescribed even though their use in the elderly is associated with an increased risk of falls, fractures, and emergency hospitalizations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with sedative-hypnotics and no treatment for insomnia in the US Medicare population, adjusting for the risk of falls and related consequences. METHODS: A model-based economic evaluation (decision tree) using the US Medicare perspective and a conservative annual temporal framework was conducted. Simulations were performed in a hypothetical cohort of Medicare beneficiaries suffering from insomnia. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the base-case analysis. RESULTS: On an annual basis, CBT showed a dominance (cost: US$19,442; QALYs: 0.594) over sedative hypnotics (cost: US$32,452; QALYs: 0.552) and no treatment (cost: US$33,853; QALYs: 0.517). Assuming a willingness to pay of US$50,000, the net monetary benefit was positive for CBT (US$10,287) and negative for sedative hypnotics (-US$4,851) and no treatment (-US$7,993). CBT had a 95% chance of being the dominant strategy, with results most sensitive to an older adult's baseline risk of falling. CONCLUSION: Failure to consider drug harms such as drug-induced falls and hospitalization represents a growing public health concern, significantly underestimating the cost of sedative-hypnotic therapy and loss in quality of life for the elderly.

14380,Cost-effectiveness analysis of routine surveillance imaging of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in first remission,"PURPOSE: Surveillance imaging of asymptomatic patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in first remission remains controversial. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of follow-up strategies following first-line immunochemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three strategies were compared in 55-year-old patient cohorts: routine clinical follow-up without serial imaging, routine follow-up with biannual computed tomography (CT) scans for 2 years, or routine follow-up with biannual [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) for 2 years. The baseline model favored imaging-based strategies by associating asymptomatic imaging-detected relapses with improved clinical outcomes. Lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each surveillance strategy. RESULTS: Surveillance strategies utilizing 2 years of routine CT or PET/CT scans were associated with minimal survival benefit when compared with clinical follow-up without routine imaging (life-years gained: CT, 0.03 years; PET/CT, 0.04 years). The benefit of imaging-based follow-up remained small after quality-of-life adjustments (CT, 0.020 QALYs; PET/CT, 0.025 QALYs).

14381,Cost-effectiveness analysis of routine surveillance imaging of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in first remission,"PURPOSE: Surveillance imaging of asymptomatic patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in first remission remains controversial. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of follow-up strategies following first-line immunochemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three strategies were compared in 55-year-old patient cohorts: routine clinical follow-up without serial imaging, routine follow-up with biannual computed tomography (CT) scans for 2 years, or routine follow-up with biannual [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) for 2 years. The baseline model favored imaging-based strategies by associating asymptomatic imaging-detected relapses with improved clinical outcomes. Lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each surveillance strategy. RESULTS: Surveillance strategies utilizing 2 years of routine CT or PET/CT scans were associated with minimal survival benefit when compared with clinical follow-up without routine imaging (life-years gained: CT, 0.03 years; PET/CT, 0.04 years). The benefit of imaging-based follow-up remained small after quality-of-life adjustments (CT, 0.020 QALYs; PET/CT, 0.025 QALYs). Costs associated with imaging-based surveillance strategies are considerable; ICERs for imaging strategies compared with clinical follow-up were $164,960/QALY (95% CI, $116,510 to $766,930/QALY) and $168,750/QALY (95% CI, $117,440 to 853,550/QALY) for CT and PET/CT, respectively.

14382,The cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3 infection,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 or 3 can be treated with sofosbuvir without interferon. Because sofosbuvir is costly, its benefits should be compared with the additional resources used. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatments for HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection in the United States. DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation, including deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. DATA SOURCES: Randomized trials, observational cohorts, and national health care spending surveys. TARGET POPULATION: 8 patient types defined by HCV genotype (2 vs. 3), treatment history (naive vs. experienced), and cirrhosis status (noncirrhotic vs. cirrhotic). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Payer. INTERVENTION: Sofosbuvir-based therapies, pegylated interferon-ribavirin, and no therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based treatment was less than $100,000 per QALY in cirrhotic patients (genotype 2 or 3 and treatment-naive or treatment-experienced) and in treatment-experienced noncirrhotic patients but was greater than $200,000 per QALY in treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based therapy for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection was less than $100,000 per QALY when the cost of sofosbuvir was reduced by approximately 40% and 60%, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, cost-effectiveness conclusions were robust to uncertainty in treatment efficacy. LIMITATION: The analysis did not consider possible benefits of preventing HCV transmission. CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir provides good value for money for treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection and those with cirrhosis. At their current cost, sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients exceed willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly cited in the United States.

RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based treatment was less than $100,000 per QALY in cirrhotic patients (genotype 2 or 3 and treatment-naive or treatment-experienced) and in treatment-experienced noncirrhotic patients but was greater than $200,000 per QALY in treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based therapy for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection was less than $100,000 per QALY when the cost of sofosbuvir was reduced by approximately 40% and 60%, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, cost-effectiveness conclusions were robust to uncertainty in treatment efficacy. LIMITATION: The analysis did not consider possible benefits of preventing HCV transmission. CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir provides good value for money for treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection and those with cirrhosis. At their current cost, sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients exceed willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly cited in the United States.

14400,The cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3 infection,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 or 3 can be treated with sofosbuvir without interferon. Because sofosbuvir is costly, its benefits should be compared with the additional resources used. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatments for HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection in the United States. DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation, including deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. DATA SOURCES: Randomized trials, observational cohorts, and national health care spending surveys. TARGET POPULATION: 8 patient types defined by HCV genotype (2 vs. 3), treatment history (naive vs. experienced), and cirrhosis status (noncirrhotic vs. cirrhotic). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Payer. INTERVENTION: Sofosbuvir-based therapies, pegylated interferon-ribavirin, and no therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based treatment was less than $100,000 per QALY in cirrhotic patients (genotype 2 or 3 and treatment-naive or treatment-experienced) and in treatment-experienced noncirrhotic patients but was greater than $200,000 per QALY in treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based therapy for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection was less than $100,000 per QALY when the cost of sofosbuvir was reduced by approximately 40% and 60%, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, cost-effectiveness conclusions were robust to uncertainty in treatment efficacy. LIMITATION: The analysis did not consider possible benefits of preventing HCV transmission. CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir provides good value for money for treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection and those with cirrhosis. At their current cost, sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients exceed willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly cited in the United States.
