17701,Cost-Utility of Using Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid to Predict Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia,"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic research criteria for Alzheimer''s disease support the use of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to improve the accuracy of the prognosis regarding progression to dementia for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding CSF biomarker testing to the standard diagnostic workup to determine the prognosis for patients with MCI. METHODS: In an early technology assessment, a mathematical simulation model was built, using available evidence on added prognostic value as well as expert opinion to estimate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 20,000 virtual MCI patients with (intervention strategy) and without (control strategy) relying on CSF, from a health-care sector perspective and with a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: Adding the CSF test improved the accuracy of prognosis by 11%. This resulted in an average QALY gain of 0.046 and euro 432 additional costs per patient, representing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 9,416. CONCLUSION: The results show the potential of CSF biomarkers in current practice from a health-economics perspective. This result was, however, marked by a high degree of uncertainty, and empirical research is required into the impact of a prognosis on worrying, false-positive/negative prognosis, and stigmatization.",2017-01-24339,29081416,J Alzheimers Dis,Ron L H Handels,2017,60 / 4,1477-1487,No,29081416,"Ron L H Handels; Anders Wimo; Richard Dodel; Milica G Kramberger; Pieter Jelle Visser; Jose Luis Molinuevo; Frans R J Verhey; Bengt Winblad; Cost-Utility of Using Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid to Predict Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia, J Alzheimers Dis, 2017; 60(4):1387-2877; 1477-1487",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) Biomarkers vs. Usual care diagnostic,patients with cerebrospinal fluid(CSF),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,9416,Euro,2015,11410.03
17702,Cost Effectiveness of Exenatide Once Weekly Versus Insulin Glargine and Liraglutide for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Greece,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost effectiveness of exenatide once weekly (ExQW) versus insulin glargine (IG) or liraglutide 1.2 mg (Lira1.2mg) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) therapy in Greece. METHODS: The published and validated Cardiff Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes over a patient''s lifetime. Clinical data were retrieved from a head-to-head clinical trial (DURATION 3) and a published network meta-analysis comparing ExQW with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively. Following a Greek third-party payer perspective, direct medical costs related to drug acquisition, consumables, developed micro- and macrovascular complications, maintenance treatment, as well as treatment-related adverse events were considered. Cost and utility data were extracted from literature and publicly available official sources and assigned to model parameters to calculate total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data. RESULTS: Over a patient''s lifetime, ExQW was associated with 0.458 or 0.039 incremental QALYs compared with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively, at additional costs of euro2061 or euro110, respectively. The ICER for ExQW was euro4499/QALY compared with IG and euro2827/QALY compared with Lira1.2mg. Results were robust across various one-way and scenario analyses. At the defined willingness-to-pay threshold of euro36,000/QALY, probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ExQW had a 100 or 88.2% probability of being cost effective relative to IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively.

17704,Cost-effectiveness of the faecal immunochemical test at a range of positivity thresholds compared with the guaiac faecal occult blood test in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England,"OBJECTIVES: Through the National Health Service (NHS) Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP), men and women in England aged between 60 and 74 years are invited for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening every 2 years using the guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT). The aim of this analysis was to estimate the cost-utility of the faecal immunochemical test for haemoglobin (FIT) compared with gFOBT for a cohort beginning screening aged 60 years at a range of FIT positivity thresholds. DESIGN: We constructed a cohort-based Markov state transition model of CRC disease progression and screening. Screening uptake, detection, adverse event, mortality and cost data were taken from BCSP data and national sources, including a recent large pilot study of FIT screening in the BCSP. RESULTS: Our results suggest that FIT is cost-effective compared with gFOBT at all thresholds, resulting in cost savings and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over a lifetime time horizon. FIT was cost-saving (p<0.001) and resulted in QALY gains of 0.014 (95% CI 0.012 to 0.017) at the base case threshold of 180 microg Hb/g faeces. Greater health gains and cost savings were achieved as the FIT threshold was decreased due to savings in cancer management costs. However, at lower thresholds, FIT was also associated with more colonoscopies (increasing from 32 additional colonoscopies per 1000 people invited for screening for FIT 180 microg Hb/g faeces to 421 additional colonoscopies per 1000 people invited for screening for FIT 20 microg Hb/g faeces over a 40-year time horizon). Parameter uncertainty had limited impact on the conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published economic analysis of FIT screening in England using data directly comparing FIT with gFOBT in the NHS BSCP. These results for a cohort starting screening aged 60 years suggest that FIT is highly cost-effective at all thresholds considered. Further modelling is needed to estimate economic outcomes for screening across all age cohorts simultaneously.",2017-01-24345,29079605,BMJ Open,Jacqueline Murphy,2017,7 / 10,e017186,No,29079605,"Jacqueline Murphy; Stephen Halloran; Alastair Gray; Cost-effectiveness of the faecal immunochemical test at a range of positivity thresholds compared with the guaiac faecal occult blood test in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England, BMJ Open , 2017 Nov 01; 7(10):2044-6055; e017186",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Faecal immunochemical test(FIT) vs. Guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT),Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-1928.57,Euro,2015,-2336.98
17705,Surgical vs Endoscopic Management of T1 Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: A Modeling Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although treatment of T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is shifting from esophagectomy to endoscopic therapy, T1b EACs are considered too high risk to be treated endoscopically. We investigated the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of esophagectomy vs endoscopic therapy for T1a and T1b EACs, and the effects of age and comorbidities, using a decision analytic Markov model. METHODS: We developed a model to simulate a hypothetical cohort of men 75 years old with Charlson comorbidity index scores of 0 and either T1aN0M0 or T1bN0M0 EAC, as a base case. We used the model to compare the effects of esophagectomy vs serial endoscopic therapy. We performed sensitivity analyses based on age at diagnosis of 60-85 years, comorbidity indices of 0-2, and utilities. Post-procedure cancer-specific mortality were derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare database. RESULTS: In the T1a base case, esophagectomy yielded more unadjusted life years than endoscopic therapy (6.97 vs 6.81), but fewer quality-adjusted life years (QALYs, 4.95 for esophagectomy vs 5.22 for endoscopic therapy). In the T1b base case, esophagectomy yielded more unadjusted life years than endoscopic therapy (5.73 vs 5.01) and QALYs (4.07 vs 3.85 for endoscopic therapy), but was not cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $156,981). Sensitivity analyses showed endoscopic therapy optimized QALYs for patients more than 80 years old with a comorbidity index of 1 or 2, or if the ratio of post-esophagectomy to post-endoscopic therapy utilities was below 0.875. CONCLUSION: In a Markov model, we showed that endoscopic therapy of T1a EAC yields more QALYs and is more cost effective than esophagectomy for patients of all ages and comorbidity indices tested.

17707,Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance carotid plaque imaging for primary stroke prevention in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance of the carotid arteries provides important insight into plaque composition and vulnerability in addition to the traditional measure of stenosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MR imaging as a first-line modality to assess carotid disease and guide management for high-risk patients with <50% stenosis. METHODS: Using TreeAge Pro, a cost-effectiveness simulation was conducted comparing two strategies: (a) standard of care first-line carotid duplex ultrasound (DUS) with regular follow-up, vs (b) first-line MR assessment of stenosis and intraplaque haemorrhage (MRIPH) in which patients with IPH received annual DUS surveillance and immediate carotid endarterectomy in case of plaque progression. RESULTS: For patients aged 70 years old, using a first-line MRIPH strategy resulted in a 16.8% relative risk reduction in strokes compared to DUS (0.080 vs 0.097 strokes per patient per lifetime), and an increased quality-adjusted-life years (12.23 vs 12.20) at an increased cost of $897.33 over a patient''s lifetime ($5784.53 vs $4887.20 average total cost per patient per lifetime). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $29,744 per quality-adjusted-life years. MRIPH remained cost-effective below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 for 91.8% of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: MRIPH was found to be a cost-effective first-line tool to identify asymptomatic patients at high risk for stroke requiring annual surveillance and prompt management.

No analysis to date has examined the cost-effectiveness of rTMS used earlier in the course of treatment and over a patients'' lifetime. METHODS: We used lifetime Markov simulation modeling to compare the direct costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of rTMS and medication therapy in patients with newly diagnosed MDD (ages 20-59) who had failed to benefit from one pharmacotherapy trial. Patients'' life expectancies, rates of response and remission, and quality of life outcomes were derived from the literature, and treatment costs were based upon published Medicare reimbursement data. Baseline costs, aggregate per year quality of life assessments (QALYs), Monte Carlo simulation, tornado analysis, assessment of dominance, and one way sensitivity analysis were also performed. The discount rate applied was 3%. RESULTS: Lifetime direct treatment costs, and QALYs identified rTMS as the dominant therapy compared to antidepressant medications (i.e., lower costs with better outcomes) in all age ranges, with costs/improved QALYs ranging from $2,952/0.32 (older patients) to $11,140/0.43 (younger patients). One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to the input variables of cost per rTMS session, monthly prescription drug cost, and the number of rTMS sessions per year.

17723,Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Tuina for Chronic Neck Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Tuina with a No-Intervention Waiting List,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether tuina is more effective and cost-effective in reducing pain compared to no intervention in patients with chronic neck pain. DESIGN: Single-center randomized two-armed controlled trial. SETTING: University outpatient clinic specialized in Integrative Medicine. SUBJECTS: Outpatients with chronic neck pain were randomly allocated to tuina or no intervention. INTERVENTION: Six tuina treatments within 3 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean neck pain intensity during the previous 7 days on a visual analogue scale after 4 weeks (VAS, 0-100 mm, 0 = no pain, 100 = worst imaginable pain). Secondary outcomes included Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPDS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), health-related quality of life (12-item quality-of-life questionnaire [SF-12]), medication intake, and cost-effectiveness after 4 and 12 weeks. Statistical analysis included analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values and a full economic analysis from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Altogether, 92 outpatients were included (46 in both groups, 87% female, mean age 45.4 [standard deviation +/-9.7], and mean VAS 57.7 +/- 11.5). Tuina treatment led to a clinically meaningful reduction in neck pain intensity (group differences, 4 weeks: -22.8 mm [95% confidence interval, -31.7 to -13.8]; p < 0.001 and 12 weeks: -17.9 mm [-27.1 to -8.8], p < 0.001). No serious adverse events were observed. Total costs as well as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) did not differ significantly between the groups. When taking group differences into account independently from their statistical significance, costs per QALY gained (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) would range within a cost-effective area from euro7,566 (for costs euro10.28 per session) to euro39,414 (cost euro35 per session). CONCLUSION: An additional treatment with six tuina sessions over 3 weeks was effective, safe and relatively cost-effective for patients with chronic neck pain.

17734,Exploring the potential cost-effectiveness of precision medicine treatment strategies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"Activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is associated with worse survival after standard rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (RCHOP) chemoimmunotherapy compared to germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype. Preliminary evidence suggests that benefits from novel agents may vary by subtype. Hypothesizing that treatment stratified by DLBCL subtype could be potentially cost-effective, we developed micro-simulation models to compare three first-line treatment strategies: (1) standard RCHOP for all patients (2) subtype testing followed by RCHOP for GCB and novel treatment for ABC DLBCL, and (3) novel treatment for all patients. Based on phase 2 evidence, we used lenalidomide + RCHOP as a surrogate novel treatment. The subtype-based approach showed a favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15,015/quality-adjusted life year compared with RCHOP. Although our exploratory analyses demonstrated a wide range of conditions where subtype-based treatment remained cost-effective, data from phase 3 trials are needed to validate our models'' findings and draw definitive conclusions.",2017-01-24378,29065744,Leuk Lymphoma,Qiushi Chen,2017,/,1-10,No,29065744,"Qiushi Chen; Ashley D Staton; Turgay Ayer; Daniel A Goldstein; Jean L Koff; Christopher R Flowers; Exploring the potential cost-effectiveness of precision medicine treatment strategies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Leuk Lymphoma, 2017 Oct 25; ():1042-8194; 1-10",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Subtype-based treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,and prednisone (RCHOP)",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15015,United States,2016,16191.39
17735,Cost-Effectiveness of IDegLira Versus Insulin Intensification Regimens for the Treatment of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes in the Czech Republic,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the insulin degludec/liraglutide combination (IDegLira) versus basal insulin intensification strategies for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not optimally controlled on basal insulin in the Czech Republic. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using the QuintilesIMS Health CORE Diabetes model, an interactive internet-based model that simulates clinical outcomes and costs for cohorts of patients with diabetes. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Czech Republic public payer. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the sensitivity of the model to plausible variations in key parameters. RESULTS: The use of IDegLira was associated with an improvement in the quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.31 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), at an additional cost of Czech Koruna (CZK) 107,829 over a patient''s lifetime compared with basal-bolus therapy, generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CZK 345,052 per QALY gained. In a scenario analysis, IDegLira was associated with an ICER of CZK 693,763 per QALY gained compared to basal insulin + glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). The ICERs are below the generally accepted willingness-to-pay threshold (CZK 1,100,000/QALY gained at the time of this analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this evaluation suggest that IDegLira is a cost-effective treatment option compared with basal-bolus therapy and basal insulin + GLP-1 RA for patients with T2DM in the Czech Republic whose diabetes is not optimally controlled with basal insulin.

17736,Should we treat acute hepatitis C? A decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"It is not standard practice to treat patients with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, as the incidence of HCV in the United States continues to rise, it may be time to re-evaluate acute HCV management in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). In this study a microsimulation model was developed to analyze the tradeoffs between initiating HCV therapy in the acute versus chronic phase of infection. By simulating the lifetime clinical course of patients with acute HCV infection, we were able to project long-term outcomes such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. We found that treating acute HCV versus deferring treatment until the chronic phase increased QALYs by 0.02 and increased costs by $483 in patients not at risk of transmitting HCV. The resulting incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $19,991 per QALY, demonstrating that treatment of acute HCV was cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. In patients at risk of transmitting HCV, treating acute HCV became cost-saving, increasing QALYs by 0.03 and decreasing costs by $3655. CONCLUSION: Immediate treatment of acute HCV with DAAs can improve clinical outcomes and be highly cost-effective or cost-saving compared with deferring treatment until the chronic phase of infection. If future studies continue to demonstrate effective HCV cure with shorter 6 week treatment duration, then it may be time to revisit current HCV guidelines to incorporate recommendations that account for the clinical and economic benefits of treating acute HCV in the era of DAAs.

By simulating the lifetime clinical course of patients with acute HCV infection, we were able to project long-term outcomes such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. We found that treating acute HCV versus deferring treatment until the chronic phase increased QALYs by 0.02 and increased costs by $483 in patients not at risk of transmitting HCV. The resulting incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $19,991 per QALY, demonstrating that treatment of acute HCV was cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. In patients at risk of transmitting HCV, treating acute HCV became cost-saving, increasing QALYs by 0.03 and decreasing costs by $3655. CONCLUSION: Immediate treatment of acute HCV with DAAs can improve clinical outcomes and be highly cost-effective or cost-saving compared with deferring treatment until the chronic phase of infection. If future studies continue to demonstrate effective HCV cure with shorter 6 week treatment duration, then it may be time to revisit current HCV guidelines to incorporate recommendations that account for the clinical and economic benefits of treating acute HCV in the era of DAAs.

17738,"Cost-effectiveness Analysis Comparing Conventional, Hypofractionated, and Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer","Background: Early-stage breast cancer is among the most prevalent and costly malignancies treated in the American health care system. Adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy represents a substantial portion of breast cancer expenditures. The relative value of novel radiotherapeutic approaches such as intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) compared with conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (CF-WBI) is unknown. Therefore, we used prospectively collected outcomes from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to compare the cost-effectiveness of these approaches. Methods: We constructed a decision-analytic model that followed women who were treated with lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. Recurrence, mortality, complication rates, and utilities (five-year radiation-associated quality of life scores), were extracted from RCTs. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates. Cost-effectiveness from societal and health care sector perspectives was estimated considering two scenarios-the first assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists five years after treatment, and the second assumes that disutility discontinues. Lifetime outcomes were summarized using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the results. Results: HF-WBI dominated CF-WBI (ie, resulted in higher quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and lower cost) in all scenarios. HF-WBI also had a greater likelihood of cost-effectiveness compared with IORT; under a societal perspective that assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists, HF-WBI results in an ICER of $17 024 per QALY compared with IORT with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 80% at the $100 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. If radiation-associated disutility is assumed to discontinue, the ICER is lower ($11 461/QALY), resulting in an even higher (83%) probability of relative cost-effectiveness.

17742,Cost-effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention in men who have sex with men in the UK: a modelling study and health economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: In the UK, HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) has remained high for several years, despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and high rates of virological suppression. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly effective in preventing further infections in MSM, but its cost-effectiveness is uncertain. METHODS: In this modelling study and economic evaluation, we calibrated a dynamic, individual-based stochastic model, the HIV Synthesis Model, to multiple data sources (surveillance data provided by Public Health England and data from a large, nationally representative survey, Natsal-3) on HIV among MSM in the UK. We did a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (sampling 22 key parameters) along with a range of univariate sensitivity analyses to evaluate the introduction of a PrEP programme with sexual event-based use of emtricitabine and tenofovir for MSM who had condomless anal sexual intercourse in the previous 3 months, a negative HIV test at baseline, and a negative HIV test in the preceding year. The main model outcomes were the number of HIV infections, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. FINDINGS: Introduction of such a PrEP programme, with around 4000 MSM initiated on PrEP by the end of the first year and almost 40 000 by the end of the 15th year, would result in a total cost saving ( pound1.0 billion discounted), avert 25% of HIV infections (42% of which would be directly because of PrEP), and lead to a gain of 40 000 discounted QALYs over an 80-year time horizon. This result was particularly sensitive to the time horizon chosen, the cost of antiretroviral drugs (for treatment and PrEP), and the underlying trend in condomless sex. INTERPRETATION: This analysis suggests that the introduction of a PrEP programme for MSM in the UK is cost-effective and possibly cost-saving in the long term. A reduction in the cost of antiretroviral drugs (including the drugs used for PrEP) would substantially shorten the time for cost savings to be realised.

17744,The Cost-Effectiveness of Salpingectomies for Family Planning in the Prevention of Ovarian Cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecologic cancer. Disease prevention may be the only method to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology advised that salpingectomies may be an appropriate and feasible strategy for ovarian cancer risk reduction. This study conducted an economic evaluation from a societal perspective of bilateral salpingectomies versus conventional sterilization techniques in the prevention of ovarian cancer. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a micro-cost analysis comparing laparoscopic tubal coagulation, tubal clips and bilateral salpingectomies at the Michael Garron Hospital, formerly the Toronto East General Hospital, from 2015 to 2016. A Markov model was used in the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses on these surgical procedures in ovarian cancer prevention. Costs were derived for the number ovarian cancer cases observed per sterilization method, cancer treatment, and associated procedural costs over each cancer patient''s lifetime. The number of bilateral salpingectomies required to prevent an additional ovarian cancer case with the recommended treatment was also estimated. RESULTS: Bilateral salpingectomies performed at the Michael Garron Hospital generated savings of $7823 per life-year gained (95% CI $3248-$10 190; incremental cost [DeltaC] -$907, incremental effect [DeltaE] 0.11 life-years gained) compared with tubal clips and savings of $6315 per life-year gained (95% CI -$6360 to $9342; DeltaC -$755, DeltaE 0.11 life-years gained) compared with tubal coagulation. Most importantly, for every 150 bilateral salpingectomies performed, one case of ovarian cancer may be prevented.

RESULTS: Baseline analysis showed that the addition of cetuximab increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.63, an increase of $17,086 relative to FOLFIRI chemotherapy, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $27,145/QALY.

17748,Cost-effectiveness of Testing and Treatment for Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Residents Born Outside the United States With and Without Medical Comorbidities in a Simulation Model,"Importance: Testing for and treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is among the main strategies to achieve TB elimination in the United States. The best approach to testing among non-US born residents, particularly those with comorbid conditions, is uncertain. Objective: To estimate health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of LTBI testing and treatment among non-US born residents with and without medical comorbidities. Design, Setting, and Participants: Decision analytic tree and Markov cohort simulation model among non-US born residents with no comorbidities, with diabetes, with HIV infection, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) using a health care sector perspective with 3% annual discounting. Strategies compared included no testing, tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), confirm positive (initial TST, IGRA only for TST-positive results; both tests positive indicates LTBI), and confirm negative (initial IGRA, then TST for IGRA-negative; any test positive indicates LTBI). All strategies were coupled to treatment with 3 months of self-administered rifapentine and isoniazid. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number needed to test and treat to prevent 1 case of TB reactivation, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted lifetime medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

17764,Updated Cost-effectiveness Assessments of PCSK9 Inhibitors From the Perspectives of the Health System and Private Payers: Insights Derived From the FOURIER Trial,"Importance: Preliminary cost-effectiveness analyses of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) were based on benefits estimated from reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that occurred in PCSK9i trials with variable results. The recent Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial provides better information about the effectiveness of the drug. Objective: To use the trial results to determine the cost-effectiveness of a PCSK9i and statin treatment strategy compared with a statin alone strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants: We derived observed rates of events, outcomes, cost of care, and health insurance from existing literature for a theoretical cohort of patients designed to resemble the FOURIER PCSK9i trial population and created a Markov model during the time horizon of a full lifetime. Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from a health system perspective, and the return on investment from a private payer perspective. For both measures, we assumed an annual PCSK9i drug price of $14300, with a lapse in US patent protection that would reduce the price by 43% in year 12. Costs were reported in 2016 US dollars. Results: This study modeled 1000 hypothetical patients with attributes similar to those of the FOURIER trial cohort. At the current price, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of statin plus PCSK9i therapy was $337729 per quality-adjusted life-year. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that a statin plus PCSK9i strategy had a low probability (<1%) of being cost effective at the commonly accepted societal threshold of $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Furthermore, PCSK9i produced a negative return on investment of 86% for private payers. In our threshold analysis, the price of PCSK9i would need to drop 62%, to $5459 per year, to reach $100000 per quality-adjusted life year. Conclusions and Relevance: At current prices, the addition of PCSK9i to statin therapy is estimated to provide an additional quality-adjusted life year for $337729 .

17765,Cost-effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Iranian High Risk Population,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer among men and the second among women in Iran. First-Degree Relatives (FDRs) of patients with CRC are known to be at higher risk of CRC. The aim of this study was to identify the most cost-effective strategy for CRC screening in Iranian high risk individuals. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of six colonoscopy screening strategies for individuals at increased risk of CRC because of positive history of the disease in at least one first-degree relative in their family. Our strategies included five-yearly or ten-yearly colonoscopy starting from the age of 40 or 50 and colonoscopy once at 50 or 55 years. Data were extracted from the published literature, Globocan 2012 database, and national cancer registry reports. The Markov model contained 11 mutually exclusive health states. Time horizon of model was life time and cycle duration was 1 year. Outcomes included life year gains, Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and costs. The TreeAge Pro software was used for data modeling. RESULTS: All six screening strategies increased the life expectancy and QALY and were costlier than no screening. The incremental cost per QALY gained for CRC screening varied from $489 for one colonoscopy screening per lifetime at 55 years to $3,135 for colonoscopy screening every five years starting at the age of 40, compared with no screening. When strategies were compared with the next best strategy, dominated strategies were removed from analysis, one colonoscopy screening per lifetime at 55 years old; or every ten years starting at the age 40; or every five years starting at age 40 remained with incremental cost effective ratios of $489, $2,505, and $26,080 per QALY gained, respectively.

First-Degree Relatives (FDRs) of patients with CRC are known to be at higher risk of CRC. The aim of this study was to identify the most cost-effective strategy for CRC screening in Iranian high risk individuals. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of six colonoscopy screening strategies for individuals at increased risk of CRC because of positive history of the disease in at least one first-degree relative in their family. Our strategies included five-yearly or ten-yearly colonoscopy starting from the age of 40 or 50 and colonoscopy once at 50 or 55 years.

METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed to compare health benefits (Quality Adjusted Life Years-QALYs) and costs of palivizumab versus a non-prophylaxis strategy over 6 years. A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 preterm infants, 32day 1-35day 0 wGA (4.356 kg average weight) at the beginning of the prophylaxis (15 mg/kg of palivizumab; 3.88 average number of injections per RSV season) was analysed. The model considered the most recent evidence from Spanish observational and epidemiological studies on RSV infection: the FLIP II study provided hospital admission and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates; in-hospital mortality rate was drawn from an epidemiological study from 2004 to 2012; recurrent wheezing rates associated to RSV infection from SPRING study were adjusted by the evidence on the palivizumab effect from clinical trials. Quality of life baseline value, number of hospitalized infants and the presence of recurrent wheezing over time were granted to estimate QALYs. National Health Service and societal perspective (included also recurrent wheezing indirect cost) were analysed. Total costs (euro, 2016) included pharmaceutical and administration costs, hospitalization costs and recurrent wheezing management annual costs.

17781,Double-Row Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Is More Cost-Effective Than Single-Row Repair,"BACKGROUND: The optimal technique for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is controversial, and both single and double-row techniques are commonly used. In the current era of increasing costs, health-care delivery models are focusing on the value of care. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of single-row and double-row reconstructions in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from the perspective of a publicly funded health-care system. Health-care costs, probabilities, and utility values were derived from the published literature. Efficacy data were obtained from a previous randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of single-row (n = 48) or double-row (n = 42) reconstruction among 90 surgical patients. Unit cost data were obtained from a hospital database and the Ontario Schedule of Benefits and Fees. Results are presented as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. All costs are presented in 2015 Canadian dollars. A series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Double-row fixation was more costly ($2,134.41 compared with $1,654.76) but was more effective than the single-row method (4.073 compared with 4.055 QALYs). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be $26,666.75 per QALY gained for double-row relative to single-row fixation. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients with larger rotator cuff tears (>/=3 cm) had a lower ICER, suggesting that double-row fixation may be more cost-effective for larger tears. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained, double-row fixation was found to be more cost-effective than single-row. Furthermore, a double-row reconstruction was found to be more economically attractive for larger rotator cuff tears (>/=3 cm). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis Level IV.

17782,"Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy Compared to Unilateral Mastectomy with Routine Surveillance for Unilateral, Sporadic Breast Cancer","BACKGROUND: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) rates in younger women with unilateral breast cancer have more than doubled. Studies of cost and quality of life of the procedure remain inconclusive. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-tree model in TreeAge Pro 2015 was used to compare long-term costs and quality of life following unilateral mastectomy (UM) with routine surveillance versus CPM for sporadic breast cancer in women aged 45 years. A 10-year risk period for contralateral breast cancer (CBC), reconstruction, wound complications, cost of routine surveillance, and treatment for CBC were used to estimate accrued costs. In addition, a societal perspective was used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) following either treatment for a period of 30 years. Medical costs were obtained from the 2014 Medicare physician fee schedule and event probabilities were taken from recent literature. RESULTS: The mean cost of UM with surveillance was $14,141 and CPM was $20,319. Treatment with CPM resulted in $6178 more in costs but equivalent QALYs (17.93) compared with UM over 30 years of follow-up. Even with worst-case scenario and varying assumptions, CPM is dominated by UM in terms of cost and quality. CONCLUSIONS: From this refined model, UM with routine surveillance costs less and provides an equivalent quality of life. Patients undergoing CPM may eliminate the anxiety of routine surveillance, but they face the burden of higher lifetime medical costs.",2017-01-24427,29039025,Ann Surg Oncol,Robert C Keskey,2017,24 / 13,3903-3910,No,29039025,"Robert C Keskey; A Scott LaJoie; Brad S Sutton; In K Kim; William G Cheadle; Kelly M McMasters; Nicolas Ajkay; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy Compared to Unilateral Mastectomy with Routine Surveillance for Unilateral, Sporadic Breast Cancer, Ann Surg Oncol, 2017 Dec; 24(13):1068-9265; 3903-3910",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy vs. Unilateral Mastectomy,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Female,Full,30 Years,3.00,0.00,Not Stated,United States,2014,Not Stated
17783,Personalized treatment of women with early breast cancer: a risk-group specific cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy accounting for companion prognostic tests OncotypeDX and Adjuvant!Online,"BACKGROUND: Due to high survival rates and the relatively small benefit of adjuvant therapy, the application of personalized medicine (PM) through risk stratification is particularly beneficial in early breast cancer (BC) to avoid unnecessary harms from treatment. The new 21-gene assay (OncotypeDX, ODX) is a promising prognostic score for risk stratification that can be applied in conjunction with Adjuvant!Online (AO) to guide personalized chemotherapy decisions for early BC patients. Our goal was to evaluate risk-group specific cost effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for women with early stage BC in Austria based on AO and ODX risk stratification. METHODS: A previously validated discrete event simulation model was applied to a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women over a lifetime horizon. We simulated twelve risk groups derived from the joint application of ODX and AO and included respective additional costs. The primary outcomes of interest were life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER). The robustness of results and decisions derived were tested in sensitivity analyses. A cross-country comparison of results was performed. RESULTS: Chemotherapy is dominated (i.e., less effective and more costly) for patients with 1) low ODX risk independent of AO classification; and 2) low AO risk and intermediate ODX risk. For patients with an intermediate or high AO risk and an intermediate or high ODX risk, the ICER is below 15,000 EUR/QALY (potentially cost effective depending on the willingness-to-pay). Applying the AO risk classification alone would miss risk groups where chemotherapy is dominated and thus should not be considered. These results are sensitive to changes in the probabilities of distant recurrence but not to changes in the costs of chemotherapy or the ODX test. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our modeling study, chemotherapy is effective and cost effective for Austrian patients with an intermediate or high AO risk and an intermediate or high ODX risk. In other words, low ODX risk suggests chemotherapy should not be considered but low AO risk may benefit from chemotherapy if ODX risk is high.

The robustness of results and decisions derived were tested in sensitivity analyses. A cross-country comparison of results was performed. RESULTS: Chemotherapy is dominated (i.e., less effective and more costly) for patients with 1) low ODX risk independent of AO classification; and 2) low AO risk and intermediate ODX risk. For patients with an intermediate or high AO risk and an intermediate or high ODX risk, the ICER is below 15,000 EUR/QALY (potentially cost effective depending on the willingness-to-pay). Applying the AO risk classification alone would miss risk groups where chemotherapy is dominated and thus should not be considered. These results are sensitive to changes in the probabilities of distant recurrence but not to changes in the costs of chemotherapy or the ODX test. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our modeling study, chemotherapy is effective and cost effective for Austrian patients with an intermediate or high AO risk and an intermediate or high ODX risk. In other words, low ODX risk suggests chemotherapy should not be considered but low AO risk may benefit from chemotherapy if ODX risk is high.

17795,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Ixekizumab vs Etanercept and Their Manufacturer-Recommended Dosing Regimens in Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"INTRODUCTION: Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis; however, their use is limited by costs. Ixekizumab was more effective than etanercept in the UNCOVER trials, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ixekizumab for treating psoriasis. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of these therapies is crucial for medical decision making and our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of various ixekizumab dosing frequencies compared with etanercept. METHODS: We utilized published data from the UNCOVER comparative efficacy trials, including transitional probabilities and treatment response rates, to create a Markov model simulating the clinical course and cost-effectiveness of three treatment algorithms for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over 60-weeks: (1) ixekizumab every 2 weeks for 12 weeks then every 4 weeks, (2) ixekizumab every 4 weeks throughout the treatment period, (3) biweekly etanercept for 12 weeks then once weekly. We utilized a standard willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and Medicaid drug acquisition costs for our calculations. RESULTS: Ixekizumab every 4 weeks was $28,681 (USD) less expensive than biweekly etanercept, and $21,375 less expensive, and 0.006 QALY less effective, than ixekizumab every 2 weeks-- a savings of $28.7 and $21.4 million, respectively, per 1,000 patients. A 95.6% cost reduction to $197.83 per dose is required for ixekizumab every 2 weeks to be more cost-effective than every 4 weeks. Biweekly etanercept requires a 29.5% cost reduction ($743.82 per dose) to be competitive with ixekizumab every 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: This cost-effectiveness model utilizes strong input data but is a limited approximation of real-life scenarios. Treatment with ixekizumab every 2 weeks is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with ixekizumab every 4 weeks at current U.S. market prices. Yet, the U.S. FDA approval and manufacturer''s recommendation are for ixekizumab every 2 weeks.

17797,Improvements in Quality-Adjusted Life Years and Cost-Utility After Pharmacotherapy for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: A Retrospective Study,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a relatively new classification of depressive disorder that is characterized by recurrent depression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 49 previously untreated PMDD patients who visited our psychiatric department between October 2013 and February 2016 and received pharmacotherapy for 3 or 6 subsequent menstrual cycles. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated across individual menstrual cycles using mean EuroQoL-5D values. Direct costs per patient were estimated in order to conduct a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Pharmacotherapy produced a 0.190-point increase in mean EuroQoL-5D score per menstrual cycle after 6 menstrual cycles and an improvement of approximately 0.2 QALYs. Based on direct costs of 156,000 yen per patient, the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy was calculated to be 823,000 yen per QALY. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analysis indicated that escitalopram tended to be superior to sertraline when willingness to pay per QALY was over 4,000,000 yen, whereas sertraline was superior when willingness to pay was below 2,000,000 yen. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy is cost effective for the treatment of PMDD. Moreover, escitalopram is a more cost-effective option than sertraline when willingness to pay is sufficiently high.",2017-01-24437,29032438,Clin Drug Investig,Eiichiro Kamagata,2017,/,,Yes,29032438,"Eiichiro Kamagata; Kazuo Yamada; Improvements in Quality-Adjusted Life Years and Cost-Utility After Pharmacotherapy for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: A Retrospective Study, Clin Drug Investig, 2017 Oct 27; ():1173-2563",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Escitalopram vs. Sertraline,No comorbid mental disorders or medical complications,47 Years,18 Years,Female,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,823000,Japan,2016,8179.9
17798,Allocating provider resources to diagnose and treat restless legs syndrome: a cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder that is frequently misdiagnosed, resulting in delays in proper treatment. The objective of this study was to analyze the cost-utility of training primary care providers (PCP) in early and accurate diagnosis of RLS. METHODS: We used a Markov model to compare two strategies: one where PCPs received training to diagnose RLS (informed care) and one where PCPs did not receive training (standard care). This analysis was conducted from the US societal and health sector perspectives over one-year, five-year, and lifetime (50-year) horizons. Costs were adjusted to 2016 USD, utilities measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and both measures were discounted annually at 3%. Cost, utilities, and probabilities for the model were obtained through a comprehensive review of literature. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to interpret our findings at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to test model uncertainty, in addition to calculating the expected value of perfect information. RESULTS: Providing training to PCPs to correctly diagnose RLS was cost-effective since it cost $2021 more and gained 0.44 QALYs per patient over the course of a lifetime, resulting in an ICER of $4593/QALY. The model was sensitive to the utility for treated and untreated RLS. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that at $100,000/QALY, informed care had a 65.5% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSION: A program to train PCPs to better diagnose RLS appears to be a cost-effective strategy for improving outcomes for RLS patients.",2017-01-24440,29031755,Sleep Med,William V Padula,2017,38 /,44-49,No,29031755,"William V Padula; Charles E Phelps; Dane Moran; Christopher Earley; Allocating provider resources to diagnose and treat restless legs syndrome: a cost-utility analysis, Sleep Med, 2017 Oct; 38():1389-9457; 44-49",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Informed Care - primary care physicians receive diagnosis training (1 year time horizon) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, One-Year, Five-Years",3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2016,Not Stated
