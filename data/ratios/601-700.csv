601,Cost-effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis after occupational exposure to HIV,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the economic efficiency of recent US Public Health Service recommendations for chemoprophylaxis with a combination of antiretroviral drugs following high-risk occupational exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To provide a framework for evaluating the relative effectiveness and costs associated with candidate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens. METHODS: Standard techniques of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were used. The analysis compares the costs and consequences of a hypothetical, voluntary combination-drug PEP program consisting of counseling for all HIV-exposed health care workers, followed by chemoprophylaxis for those who elect it vs an alternative in which PEP is not offered. A societal perspective was adopted and a 5% discount rate was used. Hospital costs of recommended treatment regimens (zidovudine alone or in combination with lamivudine and indinavir) were used, following the dosing schedules recommended by the US Public Health Service. Estimates of lifetime treatment costs for HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were obtained from the literature. Because the effectiveness of combination PEP has not been established, the effectiveness of zidovudine PEP was used in the base-case analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Net PEP program costs, number of HIV infections averted, cost per HIV infection averted, and cost-utility ratio (net cost per discounted quality-adjusted life-year saved) for zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir combination PEP. Lower bounds on the effectiveness required for combination regimens to be considered incrementally cost saving, relative to zidovudine PEP alone, were calculated. Multiple sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed to assess the impact of uncertainty in key parameters. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, the net cost of a combination PEP program for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 HIV-exposed health care workers is about $4.8 million. Nearly 18 HIV infections are prevented. The net cost per averted infection is just less than $400,000, which exceeds estimated lifetime HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome treatment costs. Although combination PEP is not cost saving, the cost-utility ratio (about $37,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in the base case) is within the range conventionally considered cost-effective, provided that chemoprophylaxis is delivered in accordance with Public Health Service guidelines. Small incremental improvements in the effectiveness of PEP are associated with large overall societal savings. CONCLUSIONS: Under most reasonable assumptions, chemoprophylaxis with zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir following moderate- to high-risk occupational exposures is cost-effective for society. If combination PEP is minimally more effective than zidovudine PEP, then the added expense of including lamivudine and indinavir in the drug regimen is clearly justified.",1997-01-01933,9308509,Arch Intern Med,S D Pinkerton,1997,157 / 17,1972-80,No,9308509,"S D Pinkerton; D R Holtgrave; H J Pinkerton; Cost-effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis after occupational exposure to HIV, Arch Intern Med, 1997-Sep-22; 157(17):0003-9926; 1972-80",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Zidovudine, lamivudine, & indinavir combination post-exposure prophylaxis for high infection risk (0.5%) exposures vs. Post-exposure prophylaxis for very high infection risk (1.0%) exposures",Not Stated,34 Years,34 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,12520.27,United States,1996,20652.54

604,Life-long screening of patients with intermediate-thickness cutaneous melanoma for asymptomatic pulmonary recurrences: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Costs and potential benefits of an intensive chest X-ray (CXR) screening program to detect asymptomatic pulmonary metastases in patients with intermediate-thickness, local, cutaneous melanoma were assessed. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was performed using data on recurrence detection from an historic cohort at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and other published studies, estimates of new cases of melanoma in 1996 from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, and estimates of cost and treatment benefits from published articles retrieved through MEDLINE. Net costs were calculated as the added cost of CXR screening to regular follow-up and the costs incurred in the surgical treatment of lung recurrences. Net benefits were calculated as potential savings in nonquality-adjusted life years (NQALY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) resulting from surgical treatment. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as the present value of net costs divided by net benefits, with benefits presented in discounted and undiscounted forms. RESULTS: For the base case, cost of screening per NQALY was $150,000 and was $165,000 for QALY in 1996 dollars using undiscounted health benefits. Screening accounted for approximately 80% of program costs and treatment accounted for 20%. Annual cost-effectiveness ratios were lowest in Years 3-10 of screening. The total cost of a 20-year screening program for patients diagnosed in 1996 was estimated to be between $27-$32 million. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of certain benefits, the model demonstrates that significant cost savings may be possible by decreasing screening frequency in the first 2 years and limiting screening to the first 5-10 years after diagnosis.",1997-01-01934,9305705,Cancer,M M Mooney,1997,80 / 6,1052-64,No,9305705,"M M Mooney; C Mettlin; A M Michalek; N J Petrelli; W G Kraybill; Life-long screening of patients with intermediate-thickness cutaneous melanoma for asymptomatic pulmonary recurrences: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Cancer, 1997-Sep-15; 80(6):0008-543X; 1052-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Life-long chest X-ray screening vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,Not Stated,215000,United States,1996,354648.6

623,Cost-effectiveness of repeat medical procedures: kidney transplantation as an example,"The constraints on medical-care resources can give rise to the question of the cost-effectiveness of permitting repeat medical procedures when some patients may die without undergoing even a first procedure. Using kidney transplantation as an example, this study estimates the cost-effectiveness of patients' having available the option of a repeat medical procedure in the event the first procedure fails. Specifically, the analysis examines the effect on transplant candidates of having the option of kidney retransplantation, if and when retransplantation might be needed. Data sources include the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) Case-Mix Severity Study, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) data, and a MEDLINE search. Outcome measures include life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs of medical care, and marginal cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. By avoiding lifelong dialysis after graft failure, first-transplant candidates gain an average of 47 quality-adjusted days with a retransplantation policy, despite the prolongation of time to first transplant by an average of 30 quality-adjusted days. The lifetime cost of medical care per first-transplant candidate is $1,210 higher with a retransplantation policy compared with the no-retransplantation policy; its societal cost-effectiveness is estimated to be $9,656 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. The retransplantation policy provides the greatest improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy for younger candidates. In the case of kidney transplantation, the cost-effectiveness of a repeat transplant, on average, compares favorably with those of other medical strategies in common practice. As resources become increasingly constrained, this study demonstrates a framework for considering the cost-effectiveness of repeat medical procedures.",1997-01-01936,9343794,Med Decis Making,J C Hornberger,1997,17 / 4,363-72,No,9343794,"J C Hornberger; J H Best; L P Garrison; Cost-effectiveness of repeat medical procedures: kidney transplantation as an example, Med Decis Making, 1997 Oct-Dec; 17(4):0272-989X; 363-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,retransplantation if needed vs. no retransplantation available,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,9656,United States,1995,16398.16
624,Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against pneumococcal bacteremia among elderly people,"CONTEXT: Clinical, epidemiologic, and policy considerations support updating the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for elderly people and targeting the evaluation only to prevention of pneumococcal bacteremia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the implications for medical costs and health effects of vaccination against pneumococcal bacteremia in elderly people. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis of pneumococcal vaccination compared with no vaccination, from a societal perspective. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The elderly population aged 65 years and older in the United States in 3 geographic areas: metropolitan Atlanta, Ga; Franklin County, Ohio; and Monroe County, New York. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental medical costs and health effects, expressed in quality-adjusted life-years per person vaccinated. RESULTS: Vaccination was cost saving, ie, it both reduced medical expenses and improved health, for all age groups and geographic areas analyzed in the base case. For people aged 65 years and older, vaccination saved $8.27 and gained 1.21 quality-adjusted days of life per person vaccinated. Vaccination of the 23 million elderly people unvaccinated in 1993 would have gained about 78000 years of healthy life and saved $194 million. In univariate sensitivity analysis, the results remained cost saving except for doubling vaccination costs, including future medical costs of survivors, and lowering vaccination effectiveness. With assumptions most unfavorable to vaccination, cost per quality-adjusted life-year ranged from $35 822 for ages 65 to 74 years to $598 487 for ages 85 years and older. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, probability intervals were more narrow, with less than 5% probability that the ratio for ages 85 years and older would exceed $100000. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal vaccination saves costs in the prevention of bacteremia alone and is greatly underused among the elderly population, on both health and economic grounds. These results support recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and public and private efforts under way to improve vaccination rates.",1997-01-01937,9343464,JAMA,J E Sisk,1997,278 / 16,1333-9,No,9343464,"J E Sisk; A J Moskowitz; W Whang; J D Lin; D S Fedson; A M McBean; J F Plouffe; M S Cetron; J C Butler; Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against pneumococcal bacteremia among elderly people, JAMA, 1997 Oct 22-29; 278(16):1538-3598; 1333-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccination against pneumococcal bacteremia vs. no vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,1993,Not Stated
625,Cost-effectiveness of 6 and 12 months of interferon-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Interferon-alpha is effective in only a small number of patients with chronic hepatitis C, although prolonged treatment may increase the response rate. There is concern that the expense of interferon-alpha therapy may not be justified by the low response rates and uncertain long-term benefit. OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and economic outcomes after 6 months and 12 months of interferon-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C. DESIGN: A Markov model depicting the natural progression of chronic hepatitis C. On the basis of this model, a simulated trial compared no therapy with 6 and 12 months of interferon-alpha therapy at standard doses (3 million U three times weekly). PATIENTS: Four age-specific cohorts (30, 40, 50, and 60 years of age) with chronic hepatitis C. MEASUREMENTS: Number of deaths from liver disease, total costs, and cumulative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Six and 12 months of interferon-alpha treatment gained 0.25 QALYs at an incremental cost of $1000 and 0.37 QALYs at an incremental cost of $1900, respectively. Thus, although 6 months of interferon-alpha therapy was less efficacious than 12 months of therapy, it was more cost-effective ($4000 per QALY gained compared with $5000 per QALY gained). Nonetheless, in patients younger than 60 years of age, both 6 and 12 months of therapy compared favorably with other established medical interventions, such as screening mammography and cholesterol reduction programs. Important variables affecting the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha treatment included the cost and efficacy of interferon-alpha, the cost of treatment for decompensated cirrhosis, and quality of life in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Thus, although 6 months of interferon-alpha therapy was less efficacious than 12 months of therapy, it was more cost-effective ($4000 per QALY gained compared with $5000 per QALY gained). Nonetheless, in patients younger than 60 years of age, both 6 and 12 months of therapy compared favorably with other established medical interventions, such as screening mammography and cholesterol reduction programs. Important variables affecting the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha treatment included the cost and efficacy of interferon-alpha, the cost of treatment for decompensated cirrhosis, and quality of life in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

641,A cost-effectiveness approach to the Norwegian follow-up programme in colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Today, continued periodic follow-up of patients treated for colorectal cancer (CRC) seems often to be routine because of tradition, rather than its demonstrated value. Recently, the Norwegian Gastrointestinal Cancer Group (NGICG) has recommended a standard surveillance programme in this malignancy. In this protocol patients are suggested followed for four years with CEA monitoring, ultrasound of the liver, chest radiograph and colonoscopy at regular intervals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the cost-effectiveness of this programme was addressed employing Norwegian cost data and data from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Clinical data from the existing English language literature was used in the analysis. RESULTS: The basic cost of the NGICG recommended programme was 1,232 Pounds per patient. Including extended investigation due to suspected relapse in 45% of cases, the figure raised to 1,943 Pounds per patient. The cost per life year saved was indicated to 9,525 Pounds-16,192 Pounds. The corresponding cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was indicated to 11,476 Pounds-19,508 Pounds. CONCLUSION: We conclude the NGICG recommended follow-up programme in CRC cost-effective.

642,Cost effectiveness and quality of life in knee arthroplasty,"Few studies quantitate the cost of a quality well being as produced by arthroplasty surgery. The objective was to use the Quality of Well Being Index to calculate the cost per quality of well year in knee arthroplasty surgery. The difference in Quality of Well Being Index scores before and after the intervention was calculated and multiplied by the patient's life expectancy. The procedure cost was divided by this quantity resulting in the cost of a quality well year. One hundred patients underwent a primary knee arthroplasty. There were 30 males (average age, 62 years old) and 70 females (average age, 64 years old). The calculated costs per a quality well year were $30,695 (standard deviation $90,883) at 3 months, $17,804 (standard deviation $25,888) at 6 months, $11,560 (standard deviation $11,874) at 1 year, and $6656 (standard deviation $3567) at 2 years postsurgery. Health economists consider an intervention costing less than $30,000 per quality of well year a bargain to society. Cost effectiveness of knee arthroplasty surgery compares favorably with other surgical interventions such as coronary artery bypass surgery ($5000 per quality of well year) and extremely favorable with medical treatments such as renal dialysis ($50,000.00 for the quality well year).

643,Lumpectomy or mastectomy? Is breast conserving surgery too expensive?,"In the last decade, breast cancer patients have enjoyed an increase in breast conserving surgery (BCS). At present, modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and BCS offers equal expectations of survival. During the last few years, however, a drop in the frequency of BCS has been reported by several authors. Is this new trend due to economic concerns? To clarify the costs of breast cancer therapy (stage I and II), we review the literature and include a cost-utility and a cost-minimisation analysis comparing MRM and BCS. The treatment cost (per patient) of BCS and MRM in Norway was calculated at $9,564 and $5,596, respectively. Employing a quality of life gain in BCS of 0.03 (0-1 scale) and a 5% discount rate, the cost per QALY in BCS compared to MRM was $20,508. In cost-minimising analysis, BCS and mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery had a cost of $10,748 and $8,538, respectively. This indicates that BCS remains within reasonable cost and should not be displaced by mastectomy on economic grounds.",1997-01-01942,9285112,Breast Cancer Res Treat,J Norum,1997,45 / 1,7-14,No,9285112,"J Norum; J A Olsen; E A Wist; Lumpectomy or mastectomy?

644,Advanced HIV infection treated with zidovudine monotherapy: lifetime values of absolute cost-effectiveness as a pharmacoeconomic reference for future studies evaluating antiretroviral combination treatments. The Osservatorio SIFO sui Farmaci,"OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the cost and the effectiveness of zidovudine monotherapy in patients with advanced HIV infection and to derive preliminary data on the cost-effectiveness of the triple treatment with saquinavir plus zalcitabine plus zidovudine compared with zidovudine alone. DESIGN: We used a combined method of survival analysis utilizing both the quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWIST) method and the Gompertz approach. This combined method was applied to assess the absolute cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios of zidovudine monotherapy and to perform a preliminary incremental cost-effectiveness comparison of saquinavir plus zalcitabine plus zidovudine versus zidovudine alone. The clinical material used in our study was derived from two reports on the treatment of advanced HIV infection. Data of lifetime costs of HIV infection were obtained from published information. RESULTS: In patients with advanced HIV infection treated with zidovudine monotherapy, lifetime survival was 252.1 discounted person-years per 100 patients. Using an average lifetime cost of $93,000 (discounted) per individual, the absolute ratio of cost-effectiveness for zidovudine monotherapy was $36,980 per life-year, while the absolute cost-utility ratio was $47,112 per quality-adjusted life-year. In the comparative analysis of saquinavir plus zalcitabine plus zidovudine versus zidovudine alone, our calculations showed that the administration of the triple treatment can have an ""average"" cost-effectiveness, provided that mean lifetime survival per patient (discounted) is improved to at least 3.68 years (with an average survival gain of at least 14 mo per patient).

645,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in healthcare workers,"OBJECTIVE: To study the cost-effectiveness of vaccination for hepatitis A. SETTING: Hypothetical analysis of students currently enrolled in medical school in the United States. METHOD: A Markov-based model was developed using data from the literature, actual hospital costs, and an annual discount rate of 5%. The incidence rate was based on the lowest annual rate for the US population during the past decade. RESULTS: Over the lifetimes of students currently in medical school, the model estimated that there would be 286 hepatitis A cases with four deaths and 107 lost years of life. With routine vaccination, these numbers would decrease to 17, 0.3, and 6, respectively. The costs per life-year saved and quality adjusted life-year saved were $58,000 and $47,000, respectively. Serologic screening prior to vaccination was less cost-effective than universal vaccination. If the incidence of hepatitis A was underestimated by a factor of 5, the cost per life-year saved would decrease to $5,500. If the incidence of hepatitis was underestimated by a factor of 10, vaccination would result in a net cost savings. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the cost per life-year saved by routine hepatitis A vaccination was similar to many other standard medical modalities. For routine vaccination of medical students to be cost-saving, the incidence rate for hepatitis A must be at least 10 times higher than the rate presently reported for the general population.

646,Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of a single course of interferon-alpha 2b in patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of illness and death in the United States. Interferon-alpha 2b can induce clinical, biochemical, and virologic remission in some patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the long-term cost-effectiveness of this treatment, particularly in patients with histologically mild disease, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha 2b in mild chronic hepatitis C. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of five prospective trials and cost-effectiveness analysis. Projection of the clinical and economic outcomes expected from loss of hepatitis C virus was done by using a Markov simulation. The potential effect of uncertainty in the model assumptions was tested by using sensitivity analyses. DATA SOURCES: Search of the MEDLINE database, opinions of expert panels, hospital cost data, and adjusted physician charges. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohorts with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C. INTERVENTION: The model assumed a single 6-month course of recombinant interferon-alpha 2b. MEASUREMENTS: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and marginal cost-effectiveness ratios from a managed care perspective. RESULTS: In 27% of patients with mild chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon-alpha 2b for 6 months, serum alanine aminotransferase levels permanently returned to normal and viral status remained negative. The model estimated that interferon-alpha 2b treatment in this population should increase life expectancy by 3.1 years if given at 20 years of age, by 1.5 years at 35 years of age, and by 22 days at 70 years of age; discounted marginal cost-effectiveness ratios are $500, $1900, and $62,000 per year of life gained, respectively. Varying the long-term response rates and progression rates for mild and moderate chronic hepatitis to near zero in sensitivity analyses substantially affected the results: Ratios ranged from $31,000 for a 20-year-old patient to $640,000 for a 70-year-old patient. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of estimations in this mathematical model of the natural history of chronic hepatitis C, treating mild chronic hepatitis with interferon-alpha 2b should prolong life expectancy at a reasonable marginal cost per year of life gained, particularly in younger patients.",1997-01-01945,9382363,Ann Intern Med,W G Bennett,1997,127 / 10,855-65,No,9382363,"W G Bennett; Y Inoue; J R Beck; J B Wong; S G Pauker; G L Davis; Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of a single course of interferon-alpha 2b in patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C, Ann Intern Med, 1997-Nov-15; 127(10):1539-3704; 855-65",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon alpha-2b treatment vs. Standard care,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,Not Stated,430,United States,1995,730.24
647,Cost-utility analysis of prophylactic treatment with oral ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus retinitis,"OBJECTIVE: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is a relatively common opportunistic infection in late-stage HIV disease, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic use of oral ganciclovir has recently been shown to decrease the incidence of CMV retinitis but is relatively expensive and may not be very well tolerated by many patients. We performed a decision analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic oral ganciclovir therapy. METHODS: A decision analysis using a Markov approach compared absence of prophylaxis and prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir. Estimates of effectiveness of prophylaxis and costs of illness were obtained from published literature. Drug costs were based on national average wholesale prices. All health care costs were based on 1996 U.S. dollars. Sensitivity analyses were done over ranges of estimates of cost and effectiveness. RESULTS: Using our baseline estimates of cost and effectiveness, use of oral ganciclovir prophylaxis in patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3 would be associated with average lifetime health care costs of $104,746, compared with $90,985 for no prophylaxis. Using oral ganciclovir, the average quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) would be 2.05, and the CMV retinitis-free life-years would be 1.64, compared with 1.87 and 1.27, respectively, for no prophylaxis. The incremental cost-utility of oral ganciclovir is $76,676 per year of life saved and $37,542 per year of additional CMV retinitis-free life. Oral ganciclovir would become more cost-effective relative to no prophylaxis if the probability of CMV retinitis while taking oral ganciclovir declined. Oral ganciclovir would be less cost-effective if the cost of treating CMV retinitis declines, if our estimates of quality of life are low, or if the overall incidence of CMV retinitis declines. CONCLUSIONS: Oral ganciclovir is a less cost-effective approach than several other interventions used for HIV-disease prophylaxis. It would potentially become cost-effective if it is possible to target oral ganciclovir prophylaxis to patients who are most likely to benefit.",1997-01-01946,9377120,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,R D Moore,1997,16 / 1,15-21,No,9377120,"R D Moore; R E Chaisson; Cost-utility analysis of prophylactic treatment with oral ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus retinitis, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol, 1997-Sep-01; 16(1):1077-9450; 15-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic drug therapy for CMV retinitis using oral ganciclovir therapy vs. No prophylaxis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,3.00,Not Stated,76676,United States,1996,126479.24
648,Cost-effectiveness of angiography performed during surgery for ruptured intracranial aneurysms,"PURPOSE: To calculate the incremental cost-utility ratio for routine angiography performed during surgery for ruptured cerebral aneurysms. METHODS: Decision-tree and Markov analyses based on a cohort simulation were used to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio of routine intraoperative angiography versus no angiography. Input data from the literature were estimated for the following variables: frequency of unexpected aneurysmal rests and branch artery occlusions; annual rate of rehemorrhage of partially clipped aneurysms; prevalence of clinically relevant infarction resulting from branch artery occlusion; efficacy of clip repositioning; morbidity associated with intraoperative angiography; morbidity and mortality associated with aneurysmal rehemorrhage; sensitivity of intraoperative angiography for aneurysmal rests; and costs of intraoperative angiography, added duration of surgery, ischemic cerebral infarction, aneurysmal rehemorrhage, and rehabilitation. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant input variables. A societal perspective was used, and cost-utility ratios less than $50000/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained were considered acceptable. RESULTS: Baseline input variables resulted in an acceptable cost-utility ratio for routine intraoperative angiography ($19000/QALY). The input variables with greatest influence on the cost-utility ratio were frequency of branch artery occlusions, angiographic morbidity, and cost of angiography. However, the cost-utility ratio remained acceptable even over wide ranges of these input variables. Frequency of unexpected partially clipped aneurysms, efficacy of clip repositioning, and costs of stroke, rehemorrhage, and rehabilitation had relatively little impact on the analysis. CONCLUSION: Routine intraoperative angiography is cost-effective if performed in a manner consistent with low morbidity in a patient cohort harboring at least some unexpected branch artery occlusions that, if uncorrected, would result in clinically relevant cerebral infarctions.",1997-01-01947,9296186,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,D F Kallmes,1997,18 / 8,1453-62,No,9296186,"D F Kallmes; M H Kallmes; Cost-effectiveness of angiography performed during surgery for ruptured intracranial aneurysms, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, 1997-Sep; 18(8):0195-6108; 1453-62",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,angiography vs. no angiography,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,19000,United States,1996,31341.04
649,A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of radiosurgery vs. resection for single-brain metastases,"PURPOSE: The median survival of well-selected patients with single-brain metastases treated with whole-brain irradiation and resection or radiosurgery is comparable, although a randomized trial of these two modalities has not been performed. In this era of cost containment, it is imperative that health-care professionals make fiscally prudent decisions. The present environment necessitates a critical appraisal of apparently equi-efficacious therapeutic modalities, and it is within this context that we present a comparison of the actual costs of resection and radiosurgery for brain metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Survival and quality of life outcome data for radiation alone or with surgery were obtained from two randomized trials, and radiosurgical results were obtained from a multiinstitutional analysis that specifically evaluated patients meeting surgical criteria. Only linear accelerator radiosurgery data were considered. Cost analysis was performed from a societal view point, and the following parameters were evaluated: actual cost, cost ratios, cost effectiveness, incremental cost effectiveness, cost utility, incremental cost utility, and national cost burden. The computerized billing records for all patients undergoing resection or radiosurgery for single-brain metastases from January 1989 to July 1994 were reviewed. A total of 46 resections and 135 radiosurgery procedures were performed. During the same time period, 454 patients underwent whole-brain radiation alone. An analysis of the entire bill was performed for each procedure, and each itemized cost was assigned a proportionate figure. The relative cost ratios of resection and radiosurgery were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Cost effectiveness of each modality, defined as the cost per year of median survival, was evaluated. Incremental cost effectiveness, defined as the additional cost per year of incremental gain in median survival, compared to the next least expensive modality, was also determined. To calculate the societal or national impact of these practices, the proportion of patients potentially eligible for aggressive management was estimated and the financial impact was determined using various utilization ratios for radiosurgery and surgery. RESULTS: Both resection and radiosurgery yielded superior survival and functional independence, compared to whole brain radiotherapy alone, with minor differences in outcome between the two modalities; resection resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in cost, compared to radiosurgery. The latter modality yielded superior cost outcomes on all measures, even when a sensitivity analysis of up to 50% was performed. A reversal estimate indicated that in order for surgery to yield equal cost effectiveness, its cost would have to decrease by 48% or median survival would have to improve by 108%. The average cost per week of survival was $310 for radiotherapy, $524 for resection plus radiation, and $270 for radiosurgery plus radiation.

652,The cost-effectiveness of routine postoperative radiotherapy after sector resection and axillary dissection for breast cancer stage I. Results from a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness of routine postoperative radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery has not been prospectively evaluated earlier. In times of rationing of medical resources, valid assessments of cost-effectiveness are important for rational allocation of resources. PURPOSE: Cost and cost-effectiveness of routine postoperative radiotherapy was calculated in a prospective randomized trial comparing sector resection plus axillary dissection with (XRT group) or without (non-XRT group) postoperative radiotherapy in breast cancer stage I. Three hundred eighty-one patients were included. After a median follow-up of five years 43 local recurrences, six of them in the XRT-group occurred (P < 0.0001). No difference in regional and distant recurrence (P = 0.23) or survival (P = 0.44) was observed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Direct medical costs as well as indirect costs in terms of production lost during the treatment period and travel expenses were estimated from data in the medical records and the national insurance registry of each patient. Average costs of different treatment activities and measures were estimated for the XRT-group and the non-XRT group respectively. From these estimates differences in costs and effectiveness between the groups were calculated and marginal cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. For the construction of QALYs each life-year was quality-adjusted by a utility value depending on which health state the patient was considered to perceive. RESULTS: Taking into account the cost of primary treatment, the cost of follow-up, the cost of treatment of a local recurrence, travel expenses and indirect costs (production lost) excluding costs for treatment of regional and distant recurrence the cost per avoided local recurrence at five years was SEK 337,727 ($44,438, Pounds 27,018). Adjustment for quality of life showed a cost for every gained QALY to be SEK approximately 1.6 million, ($210,526, Pounds 128,000), range SEK 0.2-3.9 million ($26,315-513,158, Pounds 16,000-312,000). CONCLUSION: The cost of routine postoperative radiotherapy after sector resection and axillary dissection in breast cancer stage I per avoided local recurrence and gained QALY is high. The cost per gained QALY show great variation depending on utility value, which in this study was derived from external observers and not from the patients themselves.

A decision analytic Markov model was used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of four clinical management strategies: 1) expectant management, 2) PRL screening, 3) an endocrine screening panel (PRL, insulin-like growth factor I, and 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test), and 4) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The model incorporated the natural history of incidental microadenomas, test characteristics, pharmacological and surgical treatment outcomes, patient's quality of life, discounting, and the costs of hormone testing, bromocriptine, MRIs, hospitalization for surgery, and physician services. PRL screening, endocrine screening panel, and MRI follow-up all provided slightly greater quality-adjusted survival than expectant management, but the costs increased disproportionately more than the benefits. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year for PRL screening is $1,428, and that for the endocrine screening panel is $69,495.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for MAC prophylaxis in patients whose treatment regimen includes protease inhibitors. DESIGN: Decision analysis with Markov modelling of the natural history of advanced HIV disease. Five strategies were evaluated: no prophylaxis, azithromycin, rifabutin, clarithromycin and a combination of azithromycin plus rifabutin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival, quality of life, quality-adjusted survival, health care costs and marginal cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Compared with no prophylaxis, rifabutin increased life expectancy from 78 to 80 months, increased quality-adjusted life expectancy from 50 to 52 quality-adjusted months and increased health care costs from $233000 to $239800. Ignoring time discounting and quality of life, the cost-effectiveness of rifabutin relative to no prophylaxis was $44300 per life year. Adjusting for time discounting and quality of life, the cost-effectiveness of rifabutin relative to no prophylaxis was $41500 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In comparison with rifabutin, azithromycin was associated with increased survival, increased costs and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $54300 per QALY. In sensitivity analyses, prophylaxis remained economically attractive unless the lifetime chance of being diagnosed with MAC was less than 20%, the rate of CD4 count decline was less than 10 x 10(6) cells/l per year, or the CD4 count was greater than 50 x 10(6) cells/l. CONCLUSION: MAC prophylaxis increases quality-adjusted survival at a reasonable cost, even in patients using protease inhibitors. When not contraindicated, starting azithromycin or rifabutin when the patient's CD4 count is between 50 and 75 x 10(6) cells/l is the most cost-effective strategy.

663,Cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis following sexual exposure to HIV,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness, relative to other health-related interventions in the U.S., of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following potential HIV exposure through sexual contact with a partner who may or may not be infected, and to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of dual- and triple-combination PEP. METHODS: Standard techniques of cost-utility analysis were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of PEP with a four-week regimen of zidovudine and lamivudine, or zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. Due to a lack of empirical data on the effectiveness of PEP with combination drug regimens, the analysis assumed that combination PEP was no more effective than PEP with zidovudine alone. The main outcome variable is the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved by the program. RESULTS: Providing PEP to a cohort of 10,000 patients who report receptive anal intercourse with a partner of unknown HIV status (who is assumed to be infected with probability equal to 0.18) would prevent about 20 infections, at an average net cost of about US$ 70,000 per infection averted. The cost-utility ratio, US$ 6316 per QALY saved, indicates that PEP is highly cost-effective in this instance. Moreover, triple-combination PEP would need to be about 9% more effective than dual-combination PEP for the addition of indinavir to the regimen to be considered cost-effective. Prophylaxis following receptive vaginal exposure is cost-effective only when it is nearly certain that the partner is infected; PEP for insertive anal and vaginal intercourse does not appear to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: From a purely economic standpoint, PEP should be restricted to partners of infected persons (e.g., serodiscordant couples), to patients reporting unprotected receptive anal intercourse (including condom breakage), and possibly to cases where there is a substantial likelihood that the partner is infected.

Prophylaxis following receptive vaginal exposure is cost-effective only when it is nearly certain that the partner is infected; PEP for insertive anal and vaginal intercourse does not appear to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: From a purely economic standpoint, PEP should be restricted to partners of infected persons (e.g., serodiscordant couples), to patients reporting unprotected receptive anal intercourse (including condom breakage), and possibly to cases where there is a substantial likelihood that the partner is infected.

666,Cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis following sexual exposure to HIV,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness, relative to other health-related interventions in the U.S., of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following potential HIV exposure through sexual contact with a partner who may or may not be infected, and to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of dual- and triple-combination PEP. METHODS: Standard techniques of cost-utility analysis were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of PEP with a four-week regimen of zidovudine and lamivudine, or zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. Due to a lack of empirical data on the effectiveness of PEP with combination drug regimens, the analysis assumed that combination PEP was no more effective than PEP with zidovudine alone. The main outcome variable is the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved by the program. RESULTS: Providing PEP to a cohort of 10,000 patients who report receptive anal intercourse with a partner of unknown HIV status (who is assumed to be infected with probability equal to 0.18) would prevent about 20 infections, at an average net cost of about US$ 70,000 per infection averted. The cost-utility ratio, US$ 6316 per QALY saved, indicates that PEP is highly cost-effective in this instance. Moreover, triple-combination PEP would need to be about 9% more effective than dual-combination PEP for the addition of indinavir to the regimen to be considered cost-effective.

667,Guglielmi detachable coil embolization for unruptured aneurysms in nonsurgical candidates: a cost-effectiveness exploration,"PURPOSE: We calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio for Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization versus no therapy for unruptured intracranial aneurysms considered inappropriate for surgical clipping procedures. METHODS: Decision tree and Markov analyses that employ cohort simulation were applied to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio of GDC embolization versus no therapy for unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Clinical values required as input data were estimated from the literature for the following variables: relative frequencies of complete aneurysmal occlusion, partial aneurysmal occlusion, and attempted coiling (no coils detached); morbidity and mortality of GDC embolization; frequency, morbidity, and mortality of spontaneous aneurysmal rupture in untreated and GDC-embolized aneurysms; annual rate of recanalization of GDC-embolized aneurysms; quality of life when knowingly living with untreated or GDG-embolized aneurysms and of living with fixed neurologic deficit; costs of GDC embolization, spontaneous aneurysmal rupture, stroke, and rehabilitation; and discount rate. Cost-utility ratios below $50000 per quality-adjusted life year saved were considered acceptable. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant input variables. RESULTS: Baseline input values resulted in acceptable cost-utility ratios for GDC embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. These ratios remained within acceptable limits across wide ranges of various input parameters. Cost-effectiveness was markedly affected by the natural course of unruptured, untreated aneurysms; rates of spontaneous rupture greater than 2% per year resulted in favorable cost-utility ratios that were relatively unaffected by variation in GDC efficacy, while rates of rupture less than 1% per year resulted in unfavorable ratios that were highly dependent on GDC efficacy. Many of the GDC efficacy indexes, such as rate of failed coiling, early recanalization, and progressive aneurysmal thrombosis, have mild effects on the cost-utility ratios. GDC complication rate as well as life expectancy had moderate effects on the analysis. The influence of late aneurysmal recanalization was mild unless high rates of rupture for partially coiled aneurysms were applied. Suboptimal clip placement resulting from the presence of GDC coils within a ruptured aneurysm had no demonstrable consequence on cost-utility ratios.

669,Routine treatment of insulin-dependent diabetic patients with ACE inhibitors to prevent renal failure: an economic evaluation,"The objective of this study was to determine how effective angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs) must be in preventing diabetic nephropathy to warrant routine administration to insulin-dependent diabetic patients. A Markov model was used to compare three strategies designed to prevent the development of end-stage renal disease in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Strategy I, screening for microalbuminuria and treatment of incipient nephropathy as currently recommended, was compared with strategy II, a protocol in which patients were routinely administered an ACE inhibitor 5 years after diagnosis of diabetes, and strategy III, in which patients at high risk for nephropathy were routinely treated and low-risk patients followed a protocol in which patients were treated with an ACE inhibitor if they developed hypertension and/or macroproteinuria. The model predicted that strategy II would produce as many quality-adjusted life-years as strategy I at nearly the same cost if routine drug therapy reduced the rate of development of microalbuminuria by 26% in all patients. Strategy III produced as many quality-adjusted life-years at less cost than strategy I if a high-risk cohort could be identified with a rate of developing microalbuminuria at four times the rate of low-risk patients and if drug therapy reduced the rate of developing microalbuminuria in this high-risk group by 20%.

671,Treatment strategies for insulin-dependent diabetics with ESRD: a cost-effectiveness decision analysis model,"Clinical decision analysis has become an important tool for evaluating specific clinical scenarios and exploring public health policy issues. A decision analysis model that incorporates patient preferences regarding various outcomes, as well as cost, may be particularly informative in patients with type I diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Such a model that includes pancreas transplantation as a treatment choice has not been performed and is presented in this study. The decision tree consisted of a choice between four possible treatment strategies: dialysis, kidney-alone transplant from a cadaver (KA-CAD) or living donor (KA-LD), and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant. The analysis was based on a 5-year model, and the measures of outcome used in the model were cost and cost adjusted for quality of life. The measure of preference for quality of life was obtained using the ""Standard Reference Gamble"" method in 17 SPK transplant recipients who underwent transplantation between January, 1992 and June, 1996 at our center. The measures for various outcome states (mean +/- 1 SD) were dialysis-free/insulin-free = 1, dialysis-free/insulin-dependent = 0.6 (0.4 to 0.8), dialysis-dependent/insulin-free = 0.5 (0.36 to 0.64), dialysis-dependent/insulin-dependent = 0.4 (0.21 to 0.59), and death = 0. The expected 5-year costs for each of the treatment strategies in the model were dialysis, $216,068; KA-CAD transplant, $214,678; KA-LD transplant, $210,872; and SPK transplant, $241,207. The expected cost per quality-adjusted year for each of the treatment strategies in the model were dialysis, $317,746; KA-CAD transplant, $156,042; KA-LD transplant, $123,923; and SPK transplant, $102,422. SPK transplantation remained the optimal strategy after varying survival probabilities, costs, and utilities over plausible ranges by means of one-way sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, according to the 5-year cost-utility model presented in this study, SPK transplantation is the most cost-effective treatment strategy for a patient with type I diabetes and ESRD.

Over a 5-year period, patients on olanzapine had an additional 6.8 months in a disability-free health state based on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores and more than 2 additional months in a disability-free health state based on quality-adjusted life years, and they experienced 13% fewer relapses compared with patients on haloperidol. The estimated 5-year medical cost associated with olanzapine therapy was $1,539 less than that for haloperidol therapy. Compared with risperidone therapy, olanzapine therapy cost $1,875 less over a 5-year period. Patients on olanzapine had approximately 1.6 weeks more time in a disability-free health state (based on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores) and 2% fewer relapses compared with patients on risperidone.

678,The cost-effectiveness of treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine compared with zidovudine alone: a comparison of Markov model and trial data estimates,"In this paper, we present a Markov model for estimating the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with lamivudine (LMV) and zidovudine (ZDV) compared with ZDV alone. We also compare the predictions of the Markov model for the impact of combination therapy on trial period costs with the actual impact of combination therapy on selected trial period costs estimated from data collected during the clinical trials. In the Markov model, disease stages were defined by CD4 cell count. Based on clinical trial data for patients with CD4 counts higher than 100 cells/mm3, the model assumed that the CD4 cell count level could be maintained above the level at the initiation of therapy for 6.5 months with monotherapy and for 18 months with combination therapy. After this period, transition rates for natural disease progression were used. Incremental lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years gained with LMV/ZDV compared with ZDV alone were estimated for cohorts of patients initiating antiretroviral therapy at four different CD4 cell count stages. Cost per life year gained varied from $10,000 to $18,000, and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained varied from $14,000 to $27,000. In both cases, the combination therapy was more cost-effective when started earlier in disease progression. These estimates were not sensitive to changes in key parameter values. In addition, the model was used to estimate the impact of combination therapy on healthcare costs during the trial period; these estimated costs were compared with data on the cost of resource use collected during the clinical trial for hospital stays, unscheduled visits, medications, and outpatient procedures.

682,Chondrocyte implantation in the repair of chondral lesions of the knee: economics and quality of life,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has proven clinically effective in restoring hyaline-like cartilage to isolated chondral defects of the knee. This study prospectively examined the efficacy of treatment and quality of life in 44 patients undergoing ACI for full-thickness cartilage lesions and calculated the average cost per additional quality-adjusted life year. The 12-month results of ACI treatment showed improvement in patient function as measured by both the Knee Society score (114.02 to 140.67, or a 23% mean improvement, P < .001) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (35.30 to 23.82, or a 33% mean improvement, P < .05). Quality of life, as measured by the Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary, was dramatically enhanced from 33.32 prior to biopsy to 41.48 (P < .05) 12 months after implantation. Improvement on all three scales was maintained during the period from 12 to 24 months after surgery. The estimated cost per additional quality-adjusted life year was $6791. This cost-effectiveness ratio was minimally sensitive to reasonable changes in effectiveness, patient age, or procedure cost. The procedure remained cost effective even when assumptions were less favorable than those in the base case.

683,Short-course prophylaxis against tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons. A decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Isoniazid prophylaxis for 12 months effectively prevents tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons and may decrease the incidence of other HIV-related disease and mortality. Recent clinical trials have found that some short-course regimens also effectively prevent tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of isoniazid prophylaxis and short-course prophylaxis regimens. DESIGN: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: Hypothetical patients who are HIV-infected and have CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3 or less and positive results on tuberculin skin tests. INTERVENTIONS: Isoniazid prophylaxis lasting 12 months and six short-course prophylaxis regimens of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide alone or in combination. MEASUREMENTS: 5-year survival rate, life expectancy, lifetime incidence of tuberculosis, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. RESULTS: Compared with no prophylaxis, the 12-month isoniazid regimen increased 5-year survival rates by 9% and life expectancy by 8.7 months, decreased incidence of tuberculosis by 27%, and saved 4 medical care dollars for every 1 spent on prophylaxis. Regimens of isoniazid for 6 months, isoniazid and rifampin for 3 months, and rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 months had similar results: 6.2- to 8.6-month increases in life expectancy, 19% to 26% reductions in incidence of tuberculosis, and 1 to 7 medical care dollars saved for every 1 spent on prophylaxis.

A decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Isoniazid prophylaxis for 12 months effectively prevents tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons and may decrease the incidence of other HIV-related disease and mortality. Recent clinical trials have found that some short-course regimens also effectively prevent tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of isoniazid prophylaxis and short-course prophylaxis regimens. DESIGN: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: Hypothetical patients who are HIV-infected and have CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3 or less and positive results on tuberculin skin tests. INTERVENTIONS: Isoniazid prophylaxis lasting 12 months and six short-course prophylaxis regimens of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide alone or in combination. MEASUREMENTS: 5-year survival rate, life expectancy, lifetime incidence of tuberculosis, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. RESULTS: Compared with no prophylaxis, the 12-month isoniazid regimen increased 5-year survival rates by 9% and life expectancy by 8.7 months, decreased incidence of tuberculosis by 27%, and saved 4 medical care dollars for every 1 spent on prophylaxis. Regimens of isoniazid for 6 months, isoniazid and rifampin for 3 months, and rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 months had similar results: 6.2- to 8.6-month increases in life expectancy, 19% to 26% reductions in incidence of tuberculosis, and 1 to 7 medical care dollars saved for every 1 spent on prophylaxis. A 3-month regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide resulted in fewer clinical benefits and was the only regimen tested that did not save medical care dollars. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis decreases the incidence of tuberculosis and increases life expectancy for HIV-infected patients. Some regimens save medical care dollars, and some short-course regimens have clinical and economic benefits similar to those of the 12-month isoniazid regimen.

690,Cost-effectiveness of coronary artery bypass surgery in octogenarians,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine whether coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is effective and cost-effective relative to medical management of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the elderly. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The aging of the U.S population and the improvements in surgical techniques have resulted in increasing numbers of elderly patients who undergo this surgery. The three randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that established the efficacy of CABG surgery completed patient enrollment from 19 to 24 years ago excluded patients older than 65 years. Although information regarding outcomes of CABG in this population is mainly available in case series, a major lacuna exists with respect to information on quality of life and cost effectiveness of surgery as compared with medical management. METHODS: The authors retrospectively formed surgical and medically managed cohorts of octogenarians with significant multivessel CAD. More than 600 medical records of patients older than 80 years who underwent angiography at our institution were reviewed to identify 48 patients who were considered reasonable surgical candidates but had not undergone surgery. This cohort was compared with 176 patients who underwent surgery. RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life year saved was $10,424. At 3 years, survival in the surgical group was 80% as compared with 64% in the entire medical cohort and 50% in a smaller subset of the medical cohort. Quality of life in patients who underwent surgery was measurably better than that of the medical cohort with utility index scores, as measured by the EuroQoL, (a seven-item quality of life questionnaire) of 0.84, 0.61, and 0.74, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Performing CABG surgery in octogenarians is highly cost-effective. The quality of life of the elderly who elect to undergo CABG surgery is greater than that of their cohorts and equal to that of an average 55-year-old person in the general population.",1998-01-01966,9742913,Ann Surg,J A Sollano,1998,228 / 3,297-306,No,9742913,"J A Sollano; E A Rose; D L Williams; B Thornton; E Quint; M Apfelbaum; H Wasserman; G A Cannavale; C R Smith; K Reemtsma; R J Greene; Cost-effectiveness of coronary artery bypass surgery in octogenarians, Ann Surg, 1998-Sep; 228(3):0003-4932; 297-306",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Coronary artery bypass graft surgery vs. Medical management,Not Stated,80 Years,80 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,10424,United States,1996,17194.68
691,Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of using methotrexate vs Goeckerman therapy for psoriasis. A pilot study,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the net benefit and cost-effectiveness of methotrexate use and Goeckerman therapy for psoriasis. DESIGN: Net benefit and cost-effectiveness depend on the costs, efficacy, and utilities of therapy. Utilities are quantitative measures of patient preferences. We obtained costs by using resource-based accounting techniques. Efficacy was estimated from literature reports. We surveyed patients with psoriasis, dermatologists, and healthy subjects using utility assessment methods. All assumptions were examined in a sensitivity analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For net benefit, if benefits out-weighed the costs, it was deemed worth providing. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, the ratio of costs-to-effectiveness of less than $35,000 was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: Using utilities from healthy nonexperts, the costs of both therapies exceeded the benefits in mild and moderate psoriasis. In severe psoriasis, only methotrexate demonstrates a net benefit. Both therapies were cost-effective compared with no therapy. Liquid methotrexate should be chosen over the tablet form since it was cheaper and had the same outcome. Goeckerman was cost-effective against liquid methotrexate in severe, but not mild or moderate psoriasis. There was a trend for therapies to be more cost-effective when using patient utilities and less with dermatologist utilities. The results were highly sensitive to efficacy and utilities.

700,Cost-effectiveness of treatments for major depression in primary care practice,"BACKGROUND: This study augments a randomized controlled trial to analyze the cost-effectiveness of 2 standardized treatments for major depression relative to each other and to the ""usual care"" provided by primary care physicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in which primary care patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for current major depression were assigned to pharmacotherapy (where nortriptyline hydrochloride was given) or interpersonal psychotherapy provided in a standardized framework or a primary physician's usual care. Two outcome measures, depression-free days and quality-adjusted days, were developed using information on depressive symptoms over time. The costs of care were calculated. Cost-effectiveness ratios comparing the incremental outcomes with the incremental costs for the different treatments were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In terms of both economic costs and quality-of-life outcomes, patients assigned to the pharmacotherapy group did slightly better than those assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy. Both standardized therapies provided better outcomes than primary physician's usual care, but each consumed more resources. No meaningful cost-offsets were found. The incremental direct cost per additional depression-free day for pharmacotherapy relative to usual care ranges from $12.66 to $16.87 which translates to direct cost per quality-adjusted year gained from $11270 to $19510. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized treatments for depression lead to better outcomes than usual care but also lead to higher costs. However, the estimates of the cost per quality-of-life year gained for standardized pharmacotherapy are comparable with those found for other treatments provided in routine practice.",1998-01-01968,9672056,Arch Gen Psychiatry,J R Lave,1998,55 / 7,645-51,No,9672056,"J R Lave; R G Frank; H C Schulberg; M S Kamlet; Cost-effectiveness of treatments for major depression in primary care practice, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 1998-Jul; 55(7):0003-990X; 645-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nortriptylene vs. Primary physician usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,13200,United States,1995,22416.7
