33701,Clinical and economic impact of universal varicella vaccination in Norway: A modeling study.,"BACKGROUND: Norway has not implemented universal varicella vaccination, despite the considerable clinical and economic burden of varicella disease. METHODS: An existing dynamic transmission model of varicella infection was calibrated to age-specific seroprevalence rates in Norway. Six two-dose vaccination strategies were considered, consisting of combinations of two formulations each of a monovalent varicella vaccine (Varivax® or Varilrix®) and a quadrivalent vaccine against measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (ProQuad® or PriorixTetra®), with the first dose given with a monovalent vaccine at age 15 months, and the second dose with either a monovalent or quadrivalent vaccine at either 18 months, 7 or 11 years. Costs were considered from the perspectives of both the health care system and society. Quality-adjusted life-years saved and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios relative to no vaccination were calculated. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of vaccine efficacy, price, the costs of a lost workday and of inpatient and outpatient care, vaccination coverage, and discount rate. RESULTS: In the absence of varicella vaccination, the annual incidence of natural varicella is estimated to be 1,359 per 100,000 population, and the cumulative numbers of varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over 50 years are projected to be 1.81 million, 10,161, and 61, respectively. Universal varicella vaccination is projected to reduce the natural varicella incidence rate to 48-59 per 100,000 population, depending on the vaccination strategy, and to reduce varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by 75-85%, 67-79%, and 75-79%, respectively. All strategies were cost-saving, with the most cost-saving as two doses of Varivax® at 15 months and 7 years (payer perspective) and two doses of Varivax® at 15 months and 18 months (societal perspective). CONCLUSIONS: All modeled two-dose varicella vaccination strategies are projected to lead to substantial reductions in varicella disease and to be cost saving compared to no vaccination in Norway.",2021-01-42637,34237090,PLoS One,Manjiri Pawaskar,2021,16 / 7,e0254080,No,34237090,"Manjiri Pawaskar; Colleen Burgess; Mathew Pillsbury; Wisløff, Torbjørn; Elmira Flem; Clinical and economic impact of universal varicella vaccination in Norway: A modeling study., PLoS One, 2021; 16(7):; e0254080",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Immunization,two dose of varivax vs. no immunization,Not Stated,Not Stated,15 Months,"Male, Female",Full,"50 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,88804.69,Norway,2020,9861.49

33707,Cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus community weight management to treat obesity-related idiopathic intracranial hypertension: evidence from a single-payer healthcare system.,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is associated with significant morbidity, predominantly affecting women of childbearing age living with obesity. Weight loss has demonstrated successful disease-modifying effects; however, the long-term cost-effectiveness of weight loss interventions for the treatment of IIH has not yet been established. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of weight-loss treatments for IIH. SETTING: Single-payer healthcare system (National Health Service, England). METHODS: A Markov model was developed comparing bariatric surgery with a community weight management intervention over 5-, 10-, and 20-year time horizons. Transition probabilities, utilities, and resource use were informed by the IIH Weight Trial (IIH:WT), alongside the published literature. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to characterize uncertainty within the model. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, over a 20-year time horizon, bariatric surgery was ""dominant,"" led to cost savings of £49,500, and generated an additional 1.16 quality-adjusted life years in comparison to the community weight management intervention. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a probability of 98% that bariatric surgery is the dominant option in terms of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: This economic modeling study has shown that when compared to community weight management, bariatric surgery is a highly cost-effective treatment option for IIH in women living with obesity. The model shows that surgery leads to long-term cost savings and health benefits, but that these do not occur until after 5 years post surgery, and then gradually increase over time.",2021-01-42616,33952427,Surg Obes Relat Dis,Laura Elliot,2021,17 / 7,1310-1316,No,33952427,"Laura Elliot; Emma Frew; Susan Mollan; James Mitchell; Andreas Yiangou; Zerin Alimajstorovic; Ryan Ottridge; Ben Wakerley; Mark Thaller; Olivia Grech; Rishi Singhal; Abd Tahrani; Mark Harrison; Alexandra Sinclair; Magda Aguiar; Cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus community weight management to treat obesity-related idiopathic intracranial hypertension: evidence from a single-payer healthcare system., Surg Obes Relat Dis, 2021 Jul; 17(7):; 1310-1316",QALY,United Kingdom,Obesity and other hyperalimentation,Surgical,bariatric surgery (5 year time horizon) vs. community weight management,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"5 Years, 20 Years",3.50,3.50,-39000,United Kingdom,2018,-56236.12

33710,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Atezolizumab Versus Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment for Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer With Different PD-L1 Expression Status.,"BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab could significantly improve clinical outcomes and was associated with less toxicity compared with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of PD-L1-selected patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the economic outcomes remain unclear yet in China. This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC with different PD-L1 expression status from the Chinese health sector perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was conducted to evaluate the economic outcomes for the first-line treatment of EGFR and ALK wild-type metastatic NSCLC with atezolizumab and chemotherapy in high PD-L1 expression, high or intermediate PD-L1 expression and any PD-L1 expression populations, respectively. The efficacy and safety data were obtained from the IMpower110 trial. Cost and utility values were gathered from the local charges and published literatures. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated. A scenario analysis for a patient assistance program (PAP) was conducted. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: Atezolizumab yielded additional 0.91 QALYs, 0.57 QALYs, 0.42 QALYs in comparison with chemotherapy, and the ICERs were $123,778.60/QALY, $142,827.19/QALY, $168,902.66/QALY in the high PD-L1 expression, high or intermediate PD-L1 expression, and any PD-L1 expression populations, respectively. When PAP was available, the ICERs were $52,414.63/QALY, $52,329.73/QALY, $61,189.66/QALY in the three categories of PD-L1 expression status populations, respectively. The ICERs were exceed the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $30,828/QALY (three times of per capita gross domestic product of China in 2019) in China. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested that the cost of atezolizumab played a vital role in the model outcomes, and the probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed atezolizumab was unlikely to be cost-effective at the WTP threshold regardless of PD-L1 expression status and whether the PAP was available or not.

33716,Cost-Effectiveness of Juluca for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection Treatment in Virologically Suppressed Adults in Taiwan.,"Objectives: Although the efficacy of traditional 3-drug regimens for the treatment of HIV is well established, tolerability and toxicity concerns remain. New 2-drug regimens such as Juluca (dolutegravir [DTG]/rilpivirine [RPV]) offer noninferior efficacy versus 3-drug regimens (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies), while reducing cumulative drug exposure and potentially long-term toxicities and drug-drug interactions. Here, we assess the cost-effectiveness of DTG/RPV for the treatment of HIV-1 for virologically suppressed adults in Taiwan. Methods: A hybrid decision tree and Markov cohort state transition model was used to evaluate the expected economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with DTG/RPV and comparators.

33720,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) for the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Residual Invasive HER2+ Early Breast Cancer in the United States.,"OBJECTIVE: Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was recently approved for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) early breast cancer (eBC) with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based treatment. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to compare T-DM1 versus trastuzumab in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort-based model tracked clinical and economic outcomes over a lifetime horizon from a US payer perspective. The model included 6 health states: invasive disease-free, nonmetastatic (locoregional) recurrence, remission, first-line and second-line metastatic BC and death. Model state transitions were based on statistical extrapolation of the head-to-head KATHERINE study and published sources. Dosing and treatment duration reflected prescribing information and trials. Costs (2019 US dollars) associated with pharmaceutical treatment (wholesale acquisition costs), health state specific care, adverse events, and end-of-life care were included. Health state utilities were obtained from KATHERINE and published literature. RESULTS: T-DM1 dominated trastuzumab, yielding lower lifetime costs (-$40,271), and higher life-years (2.980) and quality-adjusted life-years (2.336). Results were driven by patients receiving T-DM1 spending less time in more costly downstream health states, as these patients are less likely to experience a recurrence overall, despite having a higher likelihood of metastatic disease (distant recurrence) in the subset of patients who experience recurrence. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated robust results, with 96.7% of 5000 stochastic simulations producing dominance for T-DM1. The most influential variables were related to treatment costs, off treatment utilities, and health state costs. Additional scenario analyses tested a range of model inputs and assumptions, and produced consistent results. CONCLUSION: Relative to trastuzumab, T-DM1 treatment for patients with HER2+ eBC who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based treatment is likely to reduce the overall financial burden of cancer, while simultaneously improving patient outcomes.",2021-01-42661,34151896,Am J Clin Oncol,Jesse Sussell,2021,44 / 7,340-349,No,34151896,"Jesse Sussell; Gurleen Singh Jhuti; Vincent Antao; Oscar Herrera-Restrepo; Elizabeth Wehler; Bilir, S Pinar; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) for the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Residual Invasive HER2+ Early Breast Cancer in the United States., Am J Clin Oncol, 2021 Jul 1; 44(7):; 340-349",QALY,United States of America,"Malignant neoplasms, breast and female genital organs","Pharmaceutical, Surgical",ado-trastuzumab emtansine vs. Trastuzumab,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-22560.78,United States,2019,-23912.1
33721,Potential Cost-Effectiveness of Risk-Based Pancreatic Cancer Screening in Patients With New-Onset Diabetes.,"Background: There are no established methods for pancreatic cancer (PAC) screening, but the NCI and the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) are investigating risk-based screening strategies in patients with new-onset diabetes (NOD), a group with elevated PAC risk. Preliminary estimates of the cost-effectiveness of these strategies can provide insights about potential value and inform supplemental data collection. Using data from the Enriching New-Onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer (END-PAC) risk model validation study, we assessed the potential value of CT screening for PAC in those determined to be at elevated risk, as is being done in a planned PanCAN Early Detection Initiative trial. Methods: We created an integrated decision tree and Markov state-transition model to assess the cost-effectiveness of PAC screening in patients aged ≥50 years with NOD using CT imaging versus no screening. PAC prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity were derived from the END-PAC validation study. PAC stage distribution in the no-screening strategy and PAC survival were derived from the SEER program. Background mortality for patients with diabetes, screening and cancer care expenditure, and health state utilities were derived from the literature. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and costs were tracked over a lifetime horizon and discounted at 3% per year. Results are presented in 2020 US dollars, and we took a limited US healthcare perspective. Results: In the base case, screening resulted in 0.0055 more LYs, 0.0045 more QALYs, and $293 in additional expenditures for a cost per QALY gained of $65,076. In probabilistic analyses, screening resulted in a cost per QALY gained of <$50,000 and <$100,000 in 34% and 99% of simulations, respectively. In the threshold analysis, >25% of screen-detected PAC cases needed to be resectable for the cost per QALY gained with screening to be <$100,000.

33722,The cost-utility of early use of high-flow nasal cannula in bronchiolitis.,"BACKGROUND: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen is a non-invasive ventilation system that was introduced as an alternative to CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), with a marked increase in its use in pediatric care settings. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of early use of HFNC compared to oxygen by nasal cannula in an infant with bronchiolitis in the emergency setting. METHODS: A decision tree model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HFNC compared with oxygen by nasal cannula (control strategy) in an infant with bronchiolitis in the emergency setting. Cost data were obtained from a retrospective study on bronchiolitis from tertiary centers in Rionegro, Colombia, while utilities were collected from the literature. RESULTS: The QALYs per patient calculated in the base-case model were 0.9141 (95% CI 0.913-0.915) in the HFNC and 0.9105 (95% CI 0.910-0.911) in control group. The cost per patient was US$368 (95% CI US$ 323-411) in HFNC and US$441 (95% CI US$ 384-498) per patient in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC was cost-effective HFNC compared to oxygen by nasal cannula in an infant with bronchiolitis in the emergency setting. The use of this technology in emergency settings will allow a more efficient use of resources, especially in low-resource countries with high prevalence of bronchiolitis .",2021-01-42667,34709481,Health Econ Rev,"Buendía, Jefferson Antonio",2021,11 / 1,41,No,34709481,"Buendía, Jefferson Antonio; Ranniery Acuña-Cordero; Carlos Rodriguez-Martinez; The cost-utility of early use of high-flow nasal cannula in bronchiolitis., Health Econ Rev, 2021 Oct 28; 11(1):; 41",QALY,Colombia,Other acute lower respiratory infections,Medical Procedure,high-flow nasal cannula oxygen vs. nasal cannula oxygen,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Male, Female",Full,"1 Week, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,-2013333.33,United States,2019,-2133925.27
33723,Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: Implementation Cost-Effectiveness Study.,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a chronic condition; its prevalence is expected to grow with the aging trend of high-income countries. Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy has proven efficacy in treating major depressive disorder. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a community internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention (Super@, the Spanish program for the MasterMind project) for treating major depressive disorder. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of the Super@ program was assessed with the Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing tool, using a 3-state Markov model. Data from the cost and effectiveness of the intervention were prospectively collected from the implementation of the program by a health care provider in Badalona, Spain; the corresponding data for usual care were gathered from the literature. The health states, transition probabilities, and utilities were computed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. RESULTS: The analysis was performed using data from 229 participants using the Super@ program. Results showed that the intervention was more costly than usual care; the discounted (3%) and nondiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were €29,367 and €26,484 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively (approximately US $35,299 and $31,833, respectively). The intervention was cost-effective based on the €30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold typically applied in Spain (equivalent to approximately $36,060). According to the deterministic sensitivity analyses, the potential reduction of costs associated with intervention scale-up would reduce the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention, although it remained more costly than usual care. A discount in the incremental effects up to 5% exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000. CONCLUSIONS: The Super@ program, an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for treating major depressive disorder, cost more than treatment as usual. Nevertheless, its implementation in Spain would be cost-effective from health care and societal perspectives, given the willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 compared with treatment as usual.",2021-01-42670,33973857,J Med Internet Res,Jordi Piera-Jiménez,2021,23 / 5,e27410,No,33973857,"Jordi Piera-Jiménez; Anne Etzelmueller; Spyros Kolovos; Frans Folkvord; Francisco Lupianez-Villanueva; Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: Implementation Cost-Effectiveness Study., J Med Internet Res, 2021 May 11; 23(5):; e27410",QALY,Spain,Mood [affective] disorders,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (super@ program) vs. usual care,had a certain level of technological literacy and internet connection,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,29366.92,Euro,2019,34865.02

Nutrition policies, such as the Nutrition Facts added-sugar labeling, may reduce obesity-associated cancer rates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Nutrition Facts added-sugar labeling and obesity-associated cancer rates in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A probabilistic cohort state-transition model was used to conduct an economic evaluation of added-sugar labeling and 13 obesity-associated cancers among 235 million adults aged 20 years or older by age, sex, and race/ethnicity over a median follow-up of 34.4 years. Policy associations were considered in 2 scenarios: with consumer behaviors and with additional industry reformulation. The model integrated nationally representative population demographics, diet, and cancer statistics; associations of policy intervention with diet, diet change and body mass index, and body mass index with cancer risk; and policy and health-related costs from established sources. Data were analyzed from January 8, 2019, to May 6, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Net costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were estimated from societal and health care perspectives. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses incorporated uncertainty in input parameters and generated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). RESULTS: Based on consumer behaviors, the policy was associated with a reduction of 30 000 (95% UI, 21 600-39 300) new cancer cases and 17 100 (95% UI, 12 400-22 700) cancer deaths, a gain of 116 000 (95% UI, 83 800-153 000) quality-adjusted life-years, and a saving of $1600 million (95% UI, $1190 million-$2030 million) in medical costs associated with cancer care among US adults over a lifetime. The policy was associated with a savings of $704 million (95% UI, $44.5 million-$1450 million) from the societal perspective and $1590 million (95% UI, $1180 million-$2020 million) from the health care perspective. Additional industry reformulation to reduce added-sugar amounts in packaged foods and beverages would double the impact.

RESULTS: Based on consumer behaviors, the policy was associated with a reduction of 30 000 (95% UI, 21 600-39 300) new cancer cases and 17 100 (95% UI, 12 400-22 700) cancer deaths, a gain of 116 000 (95% UI, 83 800-153 000) quality-adjusted life-years, and a saving of $1600 million (95% UI, $1190 million-$2030 million) in medical costs associated with cancer care among US adults over a lifetime. The policy was associated with a savings of $704 million (95% UI, $44.5 million-$1450 million) from the societal perspective and $1590 million (95% UI, $1180 million-$2020 million) from the health care perspective. Additional industry reformulation to reduce added-sugar amounts in packaged foods and beverages would double the impact. Greater health gains and cost savings were expected among young adults, women, and non-Hispanic Black individuals than other population subgroups.

33732,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Nutrition Facts Added-Sugar Labeling and Obesity-Associated Cancer Rates in the US.,"IMPORTANCE: Obesity-associated cancer burdens are increasing in the US. Nutrition policies, such as the Nutrition Facts added-sugar labeling, may reduce obesity-associated cancer rates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Nutrition Facts added-sugar labeling and obesity-associated cancer rates in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A probabilistic cohort state-transition model was used to conduct an economic evaluation of added-sugar labeling and 13 obesity-associated cancers among 235 million adults aged 20 years or older by age, sex, and race/ethnicity over a median follow-up of 34.4 years. Policy associations were considered in 2 scenarios: with consumer behaviors and with additional industry reformulation. The model integrated nationally representative population demographics, diet, and cancer statistics; associations of policy intervention with diet, diet change and body mass index, and body mass index with cancer risk; and policy and health-related costs from established sources. Data were analyzed from January 8, 2019, to May 6, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Net costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were estimated from societal and health care perspectives. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses incorporated uncertainty in input parameters and generated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).

33733,"Cost-effectiveness and feasibility of conditional economic incentives and motivational interviewing to improve HIV health outcomes of adolescents living with HIV in Anambra State, Nigeria.","BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, there is increasing mortality and morbidity of adolescents due to poor linkage, retention in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is a result of limited adolescent-centred service delivery interventions. This cost-effectiveness and feasibility study were piggybacked on a cluster-randomized trial that assessed the impact of an adolescent-centred service delivery intervention. The service delivery intervention examined the impact of an incentive scheme consisting of conditional economic incentives and motivational interviewing on the health outcomes of adolescents living with HIV in Nigeria. METHOD: A cost-effectiveness analysis from the healthcare provider's perspective was performed to assess the cost per additional patient achieving undetected viral load through the proposed intervention. The cost-effectiveness of the incentive scheme over routine care was estimated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost/patient who achieved an undetectable viral load. We performed a univariate sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of key parameters on the ICER. An in-depth interview was conducted on the healthcare personnel in the intervention arm to explore the feasibility of implementing the service delivery intervention in HIV treatment hospitals in Nigeria. RESULT: The ICER of the Incentive Scheme intervention compared to routine care was US$1419 per additional patient with undetectable viral load. Going by the cost-effectiveness threshold of US$1137 per quality-adjusted life-years suggested by Woods et al., 2016, the intervention was not cost-effective. The sensitivity test showed that the intervention will be cost-effective if the frequency of CD4 count and viral load tests are reduced from quarterly to triannually. Healthcare professionals reported that patients' acceptance of the intervention was very high. CONCLUSION: The conditional economic incentives and motivational interviewing was not cost-effective, but can become cost-effective if the frequency of HIV quality of life indicator tests are performed 1-3 times per annum. Patients' acceptance of the intervention was very high. However, healthcare professionals believed that sustaining the intervention may be difficult unless factors such as government commitment and healthcare provider diligence are duly addressed.

33734,Economic Evaluation of Rituximab + Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin vs. Rituximab for the Treatment of Second-Line Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura in China.,"Objective: This study aimed to compare the economic evaluation of recombinant human thrombopoietin+rituximab (rhTPO + RTX) vs. RTX as second-line treatment for adult patients with immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura in China. Methods: The Markov model was used in our research. The response rate and relapse rate data were derived from two clinical trials and one retrospective study. Cost and utility values were derived from published literature, a third-party database, and healthcare documents. In addition, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to observe the stability of the model and data source. Results: In the Markov model, compared with RTX, rhTPO+RTX yielded an additional 0.04 QALYs, with an incremental cost of 2,802 USD. The ICER was 69,097 USD/QALY. According to the results from the one-way sensitivity analysis, complete response of rhTPO+RTX, utility of complete response and response of RTX were the main drivers in the model. The results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was a 100% probability that rhTPO+RTX was not cost-effective vs. RTX alone at a threshold of $10,805/QALY and an 84% probability at a threshold of $32,415/QALY.

33741,The impact of opportunistic salpingectomy on ovarian cancer mortality and healthcare costs: a call for universal insurance coverage.,"BACKGROUND: Opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy or as an alternative to bilateral tubal ligation may reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer, because it has been demonstrated that most serous ovarian cancers begin in the fallopian tubes. However, salpingectomy at the time of sterilization is not always financially covered by third-party payers, and this represents a barrier to adoption. Routine salpingectomy has become more common but is not always practiced at the time of hysterectomy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact of opportunistic salpingectomy as an alternative tubal ligation and routine salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy on ovarian cancer mortality and overall cost. STUDY DESIGN: An 8-state Markov state transition model was constructed, including hysterectomy, tubal ligation, and ovarian cancer. Transition probabilities were informed by previously reported population data and include age-adjusted rates of elective sterilization and hysterectomy. This model was used to predict ovarian cancer incidence and the cost effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy. Testing of this model suggested that it accurately predicted overall life expectancy and closely predicted the rate of hysterectomy in the population. The model may underestimate the rate of tubal sterilization, making it conservative with respect to the benefits of salpingectomy. RESULTS: The recursive Markov model was run from ages 20 to 85 years in 1-year intervals with a half step correction and included age-adjusted rates of tubal ligation, hysterectomy (with and without oophorectomy), and ovarian cancer. The model predicts that opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of tubal ligation will reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 8.13%. Opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy will reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 6.34% for a combined decrease of 14.5%. Both strategies are cost effective when considering only the cost of the opportunistic salpingectomy. The excess cost of opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of tubal ligation was $433.91 with an incremental cost-effective ratio of $6401 per life-year and $5469 per quality-adjusted life year gained when adjusting for ovarian cancer with a utility of 0.64. The incremental cost-effective ratio for opportunistic salpingectomy during hysterectomy at a cost of $124.70 was $2006 per life-year and $1667 per quality-adjusted life year. When considering the impact of ovarian cancer prevention with respect to the cost of ovarian cancer treatment, opportunistic salpingectomy may produce a substantial healthcare savings. Utilizing a 3% discount rate, it is estimated that the total savings for universal salpingectomy could be as high as $445 million annually in the United States. A sensitivity analysis around the benefit of opportunistic salpingectomy suggests that this procedure will be cost effective even if salpingectomy provides only a modest reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: It is estimated that universal opportunistic salpingectomy may prevent 1854 deaths per year from ovarian cancer and may reduce healthcare costs.

33743,Primary Bankart Repair Versus Arthroscopic Anatomic Glenoid Reconstruction in Patients with Subcritical Bone Loss: A Cost-Utility Analysis.,"Anterior shoulder instability and its treatment is a quickly evolving field of interest in orthopaedics, both for patients and for health-care systems. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction (AAGR) compared with Bankart repair in the treatment of anterior shoulder instability in patients with subcritical glenoid bone loss. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from the perspective of Canada's publicly funded health-care system. A decision-tree model was created to simulate the progression of patients undergoing either a primary Bankart repair or AAGR. Recently published data were used to determine the recurrence rate and level of glenoid bone loss for the AAGR procedure; the recurrence rate was 1.4% in a cohort with a mean glenoid bone loss of 25.3%. A literature review on the primary Bankart procedure in patients with at least subcritical levels of glenoid bone loss yielded a recurrence rate of 22.9% in patients with a mean glenoid bone loss of 17.5%. AAGR served as the revision surgery for both primary procedures. Health utility scores for anterior shoulder instability were obtained from published literature. Total procedure costs, including costs of operating-room consumables, anesthesia, diagnostic imaging, and rehabilitation, were sourced from a hospital database. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations was performed, and results were used to create a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. RESULTS: The AAGR procedure was less costly and led to an improvement in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) when compared with the arthroscopic Bankart repair in the treatment of patients with anterior shoulder instability with subcritical glenoid bone loss (AAGR, cost = $16,682.77 [Canadian dollars] and QALYs = 5.76; Bankart, cost = $16,720.29 and QALYs = 5.46), suggesting that the AAGR is dominant, i.e., lower costs with higher QALYs. Applying a commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained, the probability that the primary AAGR was more cost-effective was 85.8%. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that, from the perspective of a publicly funded health-care system, AAGR was the economical treatment option when compared with Bankart repair in anterior shoulder instability with subcritical glenoid bone loss.

33744,Universal admission screening: a potential game-changer in hospitals with high prevalence of MRSA.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the perception that meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is now under control in high-income countries, global prevalence remains high, even increasing in some regions. Universal admission screening and decolonization has been instituted in some hospitals to attempt control but the practice remains controversial. METHODS: In 2014, Mater Dei Hospital in Malta introduced a universal admission screening policy, utilizing a novel, centralized and customized approach to achieve high compliance and low cost. Admissions are screened nasally by designated staff using chromogenic media, irrespective of risk factors. Carriers are decolonized without concurrent isolation or contact precautions. In this study, longitudinal, quasi-experimental evaluation was undertaken using time series analysis to analyse the impact of the intervention on the proportion of MRSA among clinical S. aureus isolates (%MRSA) and incidence per 1000 bed-days. A cost-utility analysis was also attempted to identify approximate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: A transfer function model approach concluded that the intervention had a significant effect on both %MRSA and incidence. Six years following its introduction, the screening programme had led to an overall 43% long-term reduction in %MRSA from pre-screening levels [R(2)=0.687; Bayesian information criterion (BIC)=4.063], translating to a decrease in incidence of approximately 0.56 cases/1000 bed-days (R(2)=0.633, BIC=-3.063). No correlation was identified with consumption of antibiotics or alcohol hand rub. The annual cost-benefit of the programme was calculated at €1058 per QALY gain per year. CONCLUSION: The universal admission screening and decolonization intervention was successful and cost-effective in this high-endemicity setting.

33745,Exploring the Appropriate Price of Semaglutide for Type 2 Diabetes Patients Based on Cost-Utility Analysis in China.,"Introduction: Semaglutide is the first and only oral version of a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This research was designed to explore the appropriate price of once-weekly (OW) semaglutide for T2D patients in China based on cost-utility analysis. Methods: The baseline patient cohorts of OW semaglutide and once-daily (OD) empagliflozin were sourced from a patient-level meta-analysis integrating the SUSTAIN 2, SUSTAIN 3, SUSTAIN 8 and PIONEER 2 trials. The long-term health and economic outcomes were simulated using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcome Model 2 from the Chinese healthcare provider's perspective. The appropriate price of semaglutide was explored by binary search. One-way sensitivity analysis (one-way SA), probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis were applied to solve the uncertainty. Results: Under the assumption that the annual cost of semaglutide is equal to that of OD empagliflozin, OW semaglutide was superior to OD empagliflozin due to its higher quality adjusted life years and lower total costs. After binary search, the incremental cost-utility ratio of OW semaglutide vs. OD empagliflozin was approximately equal to 3λ with an annual cost of semaglutide of $1,007.18 and approximately equal to λ with an annual cost of semaglutide of $708.11. Subsequently, the incremental cost-utility ratio of OW semaglutide vs. OD empagliflozin was approximately 3λ and λ, with annual costs of semaglutide of $877.43 and $667.04, respectively, adjusted by one-way SA. Ultimately, the cost-utility results with annual costs of semaglutide of $877.43 and $667.04 were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. Conclusion: In conclusion, the annual cost of semaglutide appears to be appropriate between $667.04 and $877.43 for T2D patients in China.",2021-01-42109,34177604,Front Pharmacol,Shanshan Hu,2021,12 /,701446,No,34177604,"Shanshan Hu; Xiaorong Su; Xun Deng; Yong Wang; Exploring the Appropriate Price of Semaglutide for Type 2 Diabetes Patients Based on Cost-Utility Analysis in China., Front Pharmacol, 2021; 12():; 701446",QALY,China,Diabetes mellitus,Pharmaceutical,semaglutide vs. empagliflozin,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"40 Years, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,-24.6,United States,2019,-26.07
33746,Cost-Effectiveness of iGlarLixi Versus iDegLira in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Inadequately Controlled by GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Oral Antihyperglycemic Therapy.,"INTRODUCTION: The fixed-ratio combinations (FRCs) of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and basal insulin, insulin glargine 100 U/mL plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi), and insulin degludec plus liraglutide (iDegLira), have demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on GLP-1 RAs. However, a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis between these FRCs from a UK Health Service perspective has not been conducted. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model was used to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes in patients with T2DM receiving iGlarLixi (based on the LixiLan-G trial) versus iDegLira (based on relative treatment effects from an indirect treatment comparison using data from DUAL III). Utilities, medical costs, and costs of diabetes-related complications were derived from literature. Model outputs included costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated with a local willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Extensive scenario, one-way sensitivity, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model. RESULTS: iGlarLixi was less costly (iGlarLixi, £30,011; iDegLira, £40,742), owing to lower acquisition costs, and similar in terms of QALYs gained (iGlarLixi, 8.437; iDegLira, 8.422). Extensive scenario and sensitivity analyses supported the base case findings. CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control despite GLP-1 RAs, use of iGlarLixi was associated with substantial cost savings and comparable utility outcomes. iGlarLixi can be considered as cost-effective versus iDegLira from the UK Health Service perspective.",2021-01-42108,34714524,Diabetes Ther,Rory McCrimmon,2021,12 / 12,3231-3241,No,34714524,"Rory McCrimmon; Mark Lamotte; Mafalda Ramos; Alsaleh, Abdul Jabbar Omar; Elisabeth Souhami; Elisheva Lew; Cost-Effectiveness of iGlarLixi Versus iDegLira in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Inadequately Controlled by GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Oral Antihyperglycemic Therapy., Diabetes Ther, 2021 Dec; 12(12):; 3231-3241",QALY,United Kingdom,Diabetes mellitus,Pharmaceutical,iGlarLixi (insulin glargine plus lixisenatide) vs. iDegLira (insulin degludec plus liraglutide),Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,-715400,United Kingdom,2019,-968234.54
33747,Cost-Effectiveness of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab With and Without Chemotherapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: First-line treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (N+I) or nivolumab plus ipilimumab with two cycles of chemotherapy (N+I+chemotherapy) improve overall survival and progression-free survival for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet researchers have not concomitantly compared the cost-effectiveness of N+I and N+I+chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using outcomes data from the CheckMate 227 and CheckMate 9LA phase 3 randomized trials, we developed a Markov model with lifetime horizon to compare the costs and effectiveness of N+I and N+I+chemotherapy versus chemotherapy from the U.S. health care sector perspective.

33753,A randomized controlled trial of the X-Stop interspinous distractor device versus laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis with 2-year quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness outcomes,"OBJECTIVE: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common and debilitating condition that is increasing in prevalence in the world population. Surgical decompression is often standard treatment when conservative measures have failed. Interspinous distractor devices (IDDs) have been proposed as a safe alternative; however, the associated cost and early reports of high failure rates have brought their use into question. The primary objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness and long-term quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes after treatment of LSS with the X-Stop IDD compared with surgical decompression by laminectomy. METHODS: A multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial of 47 patients with LSS was conducted; 21 patients underwent insertion of the X-Stop device and 26 underwent laminectomy. The primary outcomes were monetary cost and QOL measured using the EQ-5D questionnaire administered at 6-, 12-, and 24-month time points. RESULTS: The mean monetary cost for the laminectomy group was £2712 ($3316 [USD]), and the mean cost for the X-Stop group was £5148 ($6295): £1799 ($2199) procedural cost plus £3349 mean device cost (£2605 additional cost per device). Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the authors found that the mean quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain for the laminectomy group was 0.92 and that for the X-Stop group was 0.81. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -£22,145 (-$27,078). The revision rate for the X-Stop group was 19%. Five patients crossed over to the laminectomy arm after being in the X-Stop group. CONCLUSIONS: Laminectomy was more cost-effective than the X-Stop for the treatment of LSS, primarily due to device cost. The X-Stop device led to an improvement in QOL, but it was less than that in the laminectomy group. The use of the X-Stop IDD should be reserved for cases in which a less-invasive procedure is required. There is no justification for its regular use as an alternative to decompressive surgery.Clinical trial registration no.: ISRCTN88702314 (www.isrctn.com).",2021-01-35042,33530059,J Neurosurg Spine,Anouk Borg,2021,/,1-9,No,33530059,"Anouk Borg; Ciaran Scott Hill; Besnik Nurboja; Giles Critchley; David Choi; A randomized controlled trial of the X-Stop interspinous distractor device versus laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis with 2-year quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness outcomes, J Neurosurg Spine, 2021 Feb 2; ():1547-5654; 1-9",QALY,United Kingdom,Dorsopathies,"Medical Device, Surgical",x-stop interspinous process decompression system vs. decompressive lumbar laminectomy,"Claudication leg pain w/ or w/o back pain of greater than 6 mos’ duration, Completed ≥6 mos of conservative treatment w/o obtaining adequate symptomatic relief, Degenerative changes at 1 or 2 adjacent levels btwn L1 & S1 confirmed by MRI causing canal reduction of > two-thirds of the spinal canal caliber",86 Years,47 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"2 Years, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,-22145,United Kingdom,2010,-42483.07
33754,Cost-effectiveness of obinutuzumab versus rituximab biosimilars for previously untreated follicular lymphoma,"BACKGROUND: In the randomized phase 3 GALLIUM trial, first-line treatment with obinutuzumab (GA101; G) plus chemotherapy (G + chemo) resulted in superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared with rituximab plus chemotherapy (R + chemo) for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). G + chemo was found to be cost-effective when compared with R + chemo (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] of approximately $2,300 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Two rituximab biosimilars, rituximab-abbs (Ra) and rituximab-pvvr (Rp), have been approved by the FDA for use in this setting. However, the cost-effectiveness of G + chemo versus Ra + chemo and Rp + chemo has not yet been estimated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of G + chemo versus Ra + chemo and Rp + chemo in the first-line treatment of FL. METHODS: We adapted an existing Markov model that compared G + chemo with R + chemo, using investigator-assessed PFS and postprogression survival data from the GALLIUM trial to model overall survival. All patients in the study received induction chemoimmunotherapy with either G + chemo or R + chemo, with responders then receiving obinutuzumab or rituximab maintenance therapy for 2 years or until disease progression. We assumed that the efficacy and safety of the rituximab biosimilars plus chemotherapy were the same as the R + chemo arm of the GALLIUM study. Drug utilization and treatment duration were also derived from GALLIUM. Health care costs were based on Medicare reimbursements, and drug costs were average sale prices for intravenous therapies or wholesale acquisition costs for oral therapies used after progression. Utility estimates were based on the GALLIUM trial data and published literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the key drivers of the model and uncertainty in the results. Results: Treatment with G + chemo led to an increase of 0.93 QALYs relative to rituximab biosimilars plus chemotherapy (95% credible range [CR] = 0.36-1.46). The total cost of G + chemo was $191,317, whereas the total costs of Ra + chemo and Rp + chemo were $164,340 (?14.1%) and $169,755 (?11.3%), respectively, with G + chemo resulting in incremental costs of $26,978 (95% CR = $19,781-$33,119) and $21,562 (95% CR = $14,473-$28,389), respectively. The incremental total drug and administration costs were $32,678 (?25.4%) and $27,263 (?21.2%) for G + chemo versus Ra + chemo and G + chemo versus Rp + chemo, respectively. There were cost savings of $7,050 (?-12.4%) related to disease progression for G + chemo ($56,727) compared with Ra + chemo and Rp + chemo ($63,777). ICERs were $28,879 and $23,082 per QALY gained for G + chemo versus Ra + chemo and Rp + chemo, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, G + chemo was cost-effective at the $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY thresholds versus both Ra + chemo (88% and 98% probabilities of cost-effectiveness, respectively) and Rp + chemo (93% and 98%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: G + chemo is projected to be cost-effective versus rituximab biosimilars plus chemotherapy in the United States as first-line treatment for FL, driven by increased QALYs for G + chemo and cost savings from delayed disease progression.

33756,Cost-Effectiveness of Canagliflozin Added to Standard of Care for Treating Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in England: Estimates Using the CREDEM-DKD Model,"INTRODUCTION: On the basis of reductions in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression and major adverse cardiovascular events observed in the landmark CREDENCE trial, canagliflozin 100 mg received an extension to its EU marketing authorisation in July 2020 to include the treatment of DKD in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) making it the first pharmacological therapy to receive regulatory authorisation for treatment of DKD since the RENAAL and IDNT trials in nearly 20 years. Efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources requires evaluation not only of clinical safety and efficacy but also economic consequences. The study aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of canagliflozin when added to current standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone from the perspective of the NHS in England. METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed using patient-level data from CREDENCE, including risk equations for the key clinical outcomes of start of dialysis, hospitalisation for heart failure, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality. DKD progression was modelled using estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio evolution equations. Risk for kidney transplant was sourced from UK-specific sources given the near absence of events in CREDENCE. Patient characteristics and treatment effects were sourced from CREDENCE. Unit costs (£2019) and disutility weights were sourced from the literature and discounted at 3.5% annually. The time horizon was 10 years in the base case, and sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: Canagliflozin was associated with sizable gains in life-years and quality-adjusted life-year (QALYs) over 10 years, with gains increasing with simulation duration. Cost offsets associated with reductions in cardiovascular and renal complications were sufficient to achieve overall net cost savings. The findings were generally confirmed in the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Model results suggest that adding canagliflozin 100 mg to SoC can improve patient outcomes while reducing overall net costs from the NHS perspective in England.

33757,Cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis in Greece,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other treatment options currently available for the management of adult patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, who have had an inadequate response, loss of response, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or a biologic agent, in Greece. METHODS: A Markov model was adapted for projecting lifetime costs and outcomes, for a cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis from a Greek payer perspective. Patients entered the model in the active ulcerative colitis state and transitioned to a remission or response state or they underwent colectomy. Following an initial 8-week induction treatment period, patients received maintenance therapy until loss of response. Nonresponders could switch to up to two subsequent biologic lines. Clinical efficacy, adverse event rates and utilities derived from OCTAVE trials and a network-meta-analysis (NMA), while adverse event-related disutilities were obtained from the literature. Information on treatment pathways and resource use was provided by an advisory board due to a lack of local data. Unit costs derived from official national sources (€, 2018). RESULTS: Over a life-time horizon, treating moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis with tofacitinib resulted in additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lower total costs compared to vedolizumab (0.018; €6408), infliximab (biosimilar) (0.009; €3031), golimumab (0.042; €1988) and infliximab (originator) (0.009; €6724).

33765,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a supported employment intervention for people with mood and anxiety disorders in Denmark - the IPS-MA intervention,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of a modified Individual Placement and Support intervention for people with mood and anxiety disorders (IPS-MA). METHODS: Costs were assessed from a societal perspective. Health care costs were derived from registers and combined with data on use of IPS-MA services, municipal social care, and labour market services. EQ-5D was used to compute QALY. Missing data were imputed in a sensitivity analysis. We also computed the cost per gain in hours worked. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were computed and bootstrapped to obtain confidence intervals for QALY and gain in hours worked. RESULTS: We found no difference in overall costs between groups. A significant saving was found in use of labour market services in the IPS-MA group. But the IPS-MA group had significantly lower wage earnings compared to the control group. The intervention group had a higher, though statistically in-significant, increase in QALYs than the control group. The ICER did not show statistically significant results, but there was a tendency, that IPS-MA could have a positive effect on health-related quality of life without any additional costs. However, participants in the IPS-MA group had a significantly lower gain in hours worked compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant saving in use of labour market services, IPS-MA was not cost-effective. Participants in the IPS-MA group worked significantly fewer hours and earned significantly less than participants in the control group at 1-year follow-up.",2021-01-35009,33559510,Nord J Psychiatry,Lone Hellström,2021,/,1-8,No,33559510,"Lone Hellström; Marie Kruse; Thomas Nordahl Christensen; Rasmus Trap Wolf; Lene Falgaard Eplov; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a supported employment intervention for people with mood and anxiety disorders in Denmark - the IPS-MA intervention, Nord J Psychiatry, 2021 Feb 9; ():1502-4725; 1-8",QALY,Denmark,"Mood [affective] disorders, Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders","Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",individual placement and support program vs. services as usual helping people with mental illness with employment,"no contact with mental health services for past 3 years, employed or enrolled in education past 3 years, motivated to return to work/education but not in within 3 months, no somatic comorbidity causing inability to work, no substance abuse as primary challenge",60 Years,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"1 Year, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,67434.78,Euro,2016,84247.35

However, the relative cost-effectiveness remains controversial. METHODS: Cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective comparing EEA vs transcranial approaches for OGM was used in this study. Surgical treatment was modeled using decision analysis, and a Markov model was adopted over a 20-year horizon. Parameters were obtained from literature review. Costs were expressed in 2017 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: In the base case, EEA was cost-effective compared with transcranial surgery with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $33?523 ($30?475 USD)/QALY. There was a 55% likelihood that EEA was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $50?000/QALY. EEA remained cost-effective at a cerebrospinal fluid leak rate below 60%, gross total resection rate above 25%, and base cost less than $66?174 ($60?158 USD).

We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under ""mitigation"" to modelled events under ""no mitigation"" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at £20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses. RESULTS: The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, £33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and £1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at £20,000/QALY.

33772,A Prospective Economic Evaluation of Rapid Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND: During the Randomized Assessment of Rapid Endovascular Treatment (EVT) of Ischemic Stroke (ESCAPE) trial, patient-level micro-costing data were collected. We report a cost-effectiveness analysis of EVT, using ESCAPE trial data and Markov simulation, from a universal, single-payer system using a societal perspective over a patient''s lifetime. METHODS: Primary data collection alongside the ESCAPE trial provided a 3-month trial-specific, non-model, based cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). A Markov model utilizing ongoing lifetime costs and life expectancy from the literature was built to simulate the cost per QALY adopting a lifetime horizon. Health states were defined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. Uncertainty was explored using scenario analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The 3-month trial-based analysis resulted in a cost per QALY of $201,243 of EVT compared to the best standard of care. In the model-based analysis, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon, EVT dominated the standard of care; EVT was both more effective and less costly than the standard of care (-$91). When the time horizon was shortened to 1 year, EVT remains cost savings compared to standard of care (~$15,376 per QALY gained with EVT). However, if the estimate of clinical effectiveness is 4% less than that demonstrated in ESCAPE, EVT is no longer cost savings compared to standard of care. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the adoption of EVT as a treatment option for acute ischemic stroke, as the increase in costs associated with caring for EVT patients was recouped within the first year of stroke, and continued to provide cost savings over a patient''s lifetime.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT01778335.",2021-01-34980,33431075,Can J Neurol Sci,Laura K Sevick,2021,/,1-8,No,33431075,"Laura K Sevick; Andrew M Demchuk; Ashfaq Shuaib; Eric E Smith; Jeremy L Rempel; Kenneth Butcher; Bijoy K Menon; Thomas Jeerakathil; Noreen Kamal; John Thornton; David Williams; Alexandre Y Poppe; Daniel Roy; Mayank Goyal; Michael D Hill; Fiona Clement; ESCAPE Trialists; A Prospective Economic Evaluation of Rapid Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke, Can J Neurol Sci, 2021 Jan 12; ():0317-1671; 1-8",QALY,Canada,Cerebrovascular diseases,Pharmaceutical,rapid endovascular therapy vs. standard of care (intravenous alteplase),disabling ischemic stroke,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,-91,Canada,2016,-77.65
33773,Cost-effectiveness analysis of text messaging to support health advice for smoking cessation,"BACKGROUND: Smoking in one of the most serious public health problems. It is well known that it constitutes a major risk factor for chronic diseases and the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Due to high prevalence of smokers, new cost-effective strategies seeking to increase smoking cessation rates are needed. METHODS: We performed a Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two treatments: health advice provided by general practitioners and nurses in primary care, and health advice reinforced by sending motivational text messages to smokers'' mobile phones. A Markov model was used in which smokers transitioned between three mutually exclusive health states (smoker, former smoker and dead) after 6-month cycles. We calculated the cost-effectiveness ratio associated with the sending of motivational messages. Health care and society perspectives (separately) was adopted. Costs taken into account were direct health care costs and direct health care cost and costs for lost productivity, respectively. Additionally, deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed modifying the probability of smoking cessation with each option. RESULTS: Sending of text messages as a tool to support health advice was found to be cost-effective as it was associated with increases in costs of €7.4 and €1,327 per QALY gained (ICUR) for men and women respectively from a healthcare perspective, significantly far from the published cost-effectiveness threshold.

33777,Comparison of cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy in patients for primary prevention in Latin America: an analysis using the Improve SCA study,"OBJECTIVE: The mortality benefit of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention (PP) of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) has been well-established, but ICD therapy remains globally underutilized. The results of the Improve SCA study showed a 49% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality among ICD patients with 1.5 primary prevention (1.5PP) characteristics (patients with one or more risk factors, p?<?0.0001). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ICD compared to no ICD therapy among patients with 1.5PP characteristics in three Latin American countries and analyzed the factors involved in cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We used a published Markov model that compares costs and outcomes of ICD to no ICD therapy from local payers'' perspective and included country-specific and disease-specific inputs from the Improve SCA study and current literature. We used WHO-recommended willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds to assess cost-effectiveness and compared model outcomes between countries. RESULTS: Incremental costs per QALY (quality-adjusted life year) saved by ICD compared to no ICD therapy are Colombian Pesos COP$46,729,026 in Colombia, Mexican Pesos MXN$246,016 in Mexico, and Uruguayan Pesos UYU$1,213,614 in Uruguay in the base case scenario; all three figures are between 1-3-times GDP per capita for each country. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirm the base case scenario results. Non-cardiac accumulated deaths are lower in Mexico, resulting in a comparatively increased cost-effective ICD therapy. LIMITATIONS: The Improve SCA study was not randomized, so clinical results could be biased; however, measures were taken to reduce this bias. Costs and benefits were modelled beyond the timeline of direct observation in the Improve SCA study.

33780,Cost-utility analysis of stereotactic body radiotherapy plus cetuximab in previously irradiated recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plus cetuximab for patients with previously irradiated recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. METHODS: We constructed a Markov health-state transition model to simulate costs and clinical outcomes of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Model parameters were derived from the published literature and the National Health Insurance Administration reimbursement price list. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the net monetary benefit were calculated from a health payer perspective. The impact of uncertainty was modeled with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case, SBRT plus cetuximab compared to SBRT alone resulted in an ICER of NT$ 840,455 per QALY gained. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the utility of progression-free state for patients treated with SBRT plus cetuximab or SBRT alone and the cost of progression-free survival for SBRT+Cet were the most sensitive parameters in the model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of NT$ 2,252,340 per QALY was 100% for SBRT plus cetuximab but 0% for SBRT alone.

Therefore, we aim to assess incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for one-time universal screening followed by treatment of people infected with HCV as compared with a no screening policy in Punjab, India. STUDY DESIGN: Decision tree integrated with Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression. A societal perspective and a 3% annual discount rate were considered to assess incremental cost per QALY gained. In addition, budgetary impact was also assessed with a payer''s perspective and time horizon of 5 years. STUDY SETTING: Screening services were assumed to be delivered as a facility-based intervention where active screening for HCV cases would be performed at 22 district hospitals in the state of Punjab, which will act as integrated testing as well as treatment sites for HCV. INTERVENTION: Two intervention scenarios were compared with no universal screening and treatment (routine care). Scenario I-screening with ELISA followed by confirmatory HCV-RNA quantification and treatment. Scenario II-screening with rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kit followed by confirmatory HCV-RNA quantification and treatment. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime costs; life years and QALY gained; and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each of the above-mentioned intervention scenario as compared with the routine care. RESULTS: Screening with ELISA and RDT, respectively, results in a gain of 0.028 (0.008 to 0.06) and 0.027 (0.008 to 0.061) QALY per person with costs decreased by -1810 Indian rupees (-3376 to -867) and -1812 Indian rupees (-3468 to -850) when compared with no screening.

CONCLUSION: One-time universal screening followed by HCV treatment is a dominant strategy as compared with no screening. However, budget impact of screening of all =18-year-old people seems unsustainable.

Thus, in view of findings from both cost-effectiveness and budget impact, we recommend beginning with screening the age cohort with RDT around mean age of disease presentation, that is, 40-45 years, instead of all =18-year-old people.",2021-01-34994,33589457,BMJ Open,Yashika Chugh,2021,11 / 2,e042280,No,33589457,"Yashika Chugh; Madhumita Premkumar; Gagandeep Singh Grover; Radha K Dhiman; Yot Teerawattananon; Shankar Prinja; Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of facility-based screening and treatment of hepatitis C in Punjab state of India, BMJ Open , 2021 Feb 5; 11(2):2044-6055; e042280",QALY,India,Viral hepatitis,Diagnostic,enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening for hepatitis C vs. rapid diagnostic test screening for hepatitis C virus,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-9872.22,India,2021,-133.53
