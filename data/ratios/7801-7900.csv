7801,Economic evaluation of monitoring virologic responses to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings,"OBJECTIVE: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) management for HIV-infected children is critical in many resource-constrained countries. We investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different frequencies of monitoring plasma viral load among HIV-positive children initiating ART in a resource-limited setting. DESIGN/METHODS: A stochastic agent-based simulation model was built and directly informed by a cohort of 304 HIV-infected children starting ART in Thailand between 2001 and 2009. The model simulated the expected costs and clinical outcomes over time according to different viral load monitoring frequencies and initiation of second-line therapies where appropriate. RESULTS: The optimal frequency of viral load monitoring was found to be annual, after a single screening at 6 months. Associated costs of viral load monitoring and appropriate ART would approximately triple current treatment costs. Compared with current conditions, a single screening during the first year of ART led to a 58.4% reduction in the total person-years of virological failure with annual monitoring leading to a 76.6% reduction. The incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained from the optimal monitoring frequency was estimated as US$68,084 when including costs of ART and US$7224 without ART costs. The estimated cost attributed to preventing one year of virological failure was US$3,393 with ART costs and US$359 without ART costs. CONCLUSIONS: Even infrequent viral load monitoring is likely to provide substantial clinical benefit to HIV-infected children on ART. Viral load monitoring can be considered cost-effective in many resource-limited settings.

7806,Cost and cost-effectiveness of cardiac surgery in elderly patients,"OBJECTIVE: Cost-effectiveness of heart surgery for elderly patients is still poorly defined. We evaluated outcome, quality of life (QoL), cost, and cost-effectiveness of octogenarians undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: One thousand six hundred forty octogenarians undergoing various cardiac surgical procedures were prospectively studied between January 1998 and January 2009 and compared with similar patients aged 70 to 79 years. Several questionnaires were used to assess QoL. Six hundred age- and sex- matched healthy octogenarians and three hundred forty patients older than 80 years with medically treated valvular or coronary artery disease were healthy and unoperated control groups, respectively. In-hospital costs were obtained from the hospital's financial accounting department and cost-effectiveness was estimated and expressed as cost/QoL-adjusted life year (QALY) and cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Significant improvements occurred in elderly patients in Role Physical (P < .001), Bodily Pain (P < .001), General Health (P = .004), Social Functioning (P < .001), and Role Emotional (P < .001), whereas Physical Functioning, Vitality, and Mental Health did not change (difference not signficant). Total direct costs were $5293 higher in the octogenarian group. Cost-effectiveness was $1391/QALY for elderly surgical patients, $516/QALY for younger cardiac surgical patients (P < .001 vs elderly), $897/QALY for untreated control group, and $641/QALY for healthy control group (P < .001 vs elderly surgical patients). The cost-effectiveness ratio for octogenarians was $94,426. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that cardiac surgery in elderly patients remains controversial from a cost-effectiveness standpoint, making econometric analysis an important component for any future evaluation of novel cardiovascular therapies. Our findings need to be confirmed by additional multicenter studies.",2011-01-07326,21492881,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,Sandro Gelsomino,2011,/,,No,21492881,"Sandro Gelsomino; Roberto Lorusso; Ugolino Livi; Gianluca Masullo; Fabiana Luc?; Jos Maessen; Gian Franco Gensini; Cost and cost-effectiveness of cardiac surgery in elderly patients, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 2011-Apr-12; ():0022-5223",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Operative elderly group; patients' age: >80 years (Octogenarians) vs. Operative younger patient gourp; patient's age: 70 years<age<80 years (Septuagenarians),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,94426,United States,2009,113912.69
7807,Cost-effectiveness of adjunctive eptifibatide in patients undergoing coronary stenting in Germany,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of adding eptifibatide to the standard treatment for selected high-risk patients undergoing coronary stenting in Germany. Furthermore, to investigate the impact of several extrapolation methods on the results. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to reflect the clinical events in this specific patient population, including target vessel revascularization, myocardial infarction, and death. To extrapolate clinical data beyond 1 year, a linear, an exponential, and a Weibull survival curves were estimated. Patient characteristics and transition probabilities were derived from a high-risk subgroup of the ESPRIT trial; patient-level utility data came from a published Dutch study. Costs were calculated from a hospital and from a third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: For both perspectives, the additional treatment with eptifibatide is the considered dominant alternative. The incremental net benefit of its use exceeds <euro>10,000 for both perspectives. Results proved stable in probabilistic sensitivity analysis as well as under the different extrapolation scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Eptifibatide is likely to be dominant strategy with 77.7 and 96.7% of the simulations leading to QALYs gained and generating cost savings from both the hospital and the third-party payer perspective. Eptifibatide offsets its additional treatment costs by avoiding costly repeat procedures and leads to positive QALY gains by preventing cardiovascular events lending themselves to transient or permanent lower quality of life.

7809,Cost-effectiveness of Adding Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Rheumatoid Arthritis Management,"Background: Early, aggressive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improves outcomes but confers increased risk. Risk stratification to target aggressive treatment of high-risk individuals with early RA is considered important to optimize outcomes while minimizing clinical and monetary costs. Some advocate the addition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to standard RA risk stratification with clinical markers for patients early in the disease course. Our objective was to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding MRI to standard risk stratification in early RA. Methods: Using a decision analysis model of standard risk stratification with or without MRI, followed by escalated standard treatment protocols based on treatment response, we estimated 1-year and lifetime quality-adjusted life-years, RA-related costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (with MRI vs without MRI) for RA patients with fewer than 12 months of disease and no baseline radiographic erosions. Inputs were derived from the published literature. We assumed a societal perspective with 3.0% discounting. Results: One-year and lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for adding MRI to standard testing were $204,103 and $167,783 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, model results were insensitive to plausible ranges for every variable except MRI specificity, which published data suggest is below the threshold for MRI cost-effectiveness. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, most simulations produced lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in excess of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, a commonly cited threshold. Conclusion: Under plausible clinical conditions, adding MRI is not cost-effective compared with standard risk stratification in early-RA patients.",2011-01-07338,21482840,Arch Intern Med,Lisa G Suter,2011,171 / 7,657-67,No,21482840,"Lisa G Suter; Liana Fraenkel; R Scott Braithwaite; Cost-effectiveness of Adding Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Rheumatoid Arthritis Management, Arch Intern Med, 2011-Apr-11; 171(7):0003-9926; 657-67",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Addition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to standard RA risk stratification vs. Standard RA risk stratification,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,167783,United States,2009,202408.38

Objectives To assess the cumulative costs and consequences of double embryo transfer (DET) or elective single embryo transfer (eSET) in women commencing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment aged 32, 36 and 39 years. Design Microsimulation model. Setting Three assisted reproduction centres in Scotland. Sample A total of 6153 women undergoing treatment at one of three Scottish IVF clinics, between January 1997 and June 2007. Methods A microsimulation model, populated using data inputs derived from a large clinical data set and published literature, was developed to compare the costs and consequences of using eSET or DET over multiple treatment cycles. Main outcome measures Disability-free live births; twin pregnancy rate; women's quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); health service costs. Results Not only did DET produce a higher cumulative live birth rate compared with eSET for women of all three ages, but also a higher twin pregnancy rate.

7813,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Palivizumab as RSV-Prophylaxis in Preterm Infants in Sweden,"Aim To investigate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab vs. no prophylaxis for RSV infection in preterm infants in Sweden. Methods A probabilistic Markov model was populated using a nationwide register linkage and data from the literature. Cost-effectiveness was investigated from a societal perspective over a lifetime for infants born at <29 weeks of gestation. Palivizumab was modelled using assumptions for its direct effect on RSV-hospitalization risk, and an indirect effect (via decreased RSV-hospitalization) on subsequent asthma and mortality during the epidemic. Costs and effects were discounted by 3%. Results In the base case, prophylaxis resulted in an additional 0.102 QALYs at a cost of 20,000SEK relative to no prophylaxis (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] 195,000SEK/QALY). The probability of prophylaxis being cost-effective was 99% at a willingness-to-pay of 500,000SEK/QALY. Assumptions about a causal association between RSV infection and subsequent asthma had a moderate impact, while exclusion of the indirect prophylaxis effect on mortality increased the ICER to 492,000SEK/QALY. When excluding both of these, prophylaxis was not cost-effective. Conclusion: Based on a willingness-to-pay of 500,000SEK/QALY, palivizumab was found to be cost-effective compared to no prophylaxis for infants born at <29 weeks if severe RSV infection was assumed to increase subsequent asthma or mortality risk.",2011-01-07346,21477089,Acta Paediatr,Kristian Neovius,2011,/,,No,21477089,"Kristian Neovius; Katharina Buesch; Kristina Sandstr?m; Martin Neovius; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Palivizumab as RSV-Prophylaxis in Preterm Infants in Sweden, Acta Paediatr, 2011-Apr-07; ():0803-5253",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pavlicizumab vs. No prophylaxis,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,195420,Sweden,2009,30998.5
7814,Cost-effectiveness of highly purified omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ethyl esters in the treatment of chronic heart failure: results of Markov modelling in a UK setting,"AIMS: A recent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial has reported reductions in mortality and hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) who were prescribed highly purified omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ethyl esters (n-3 PUFA). This study aimed at evaluating the cost and benefits associated with their use in the treatment of CHF in a UK setting. METHODS AND RESULTS: Results from a recent clinical trial were used to develop a Markov model to project clinical outcomes while capturing relevant costs and patient quality of life. The model captured outcomes over a lifetime horizon from a UK National Health Service perspective, with direct costs accounted in 2009 GBP (£) and discounted at 3.5% together with clinical benefits. Results are presented in terms of life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, direct costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. In addition to standard therapy, n-3 PUFA vs. placebo increased lifetime direct costs by £993 (˜€1150), with additional quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.079 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and mean lifetime costs of £12 636 (˜€14 600) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested a 60% likelihood of n-3 PUFA being regarded as cost-effective versus placebo at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30 000 (˜€34 600) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: By currently accepted standards of value for money in the UK; the addition of n-3 PUFA to optimal medical therapy for patients with heart failure is likely to be cost-effective.",2011-01-07349,21474462,Eur J Heart Fail,Martin R Cowie,2011,/,,No,21474462,"Martin R Cowie; Sandrine Cure; Florence Bianic; Alistair McGuire; Gordon Goodall; Luigi Tavazzi; Cost-effectiveness of highly purified omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ethyl esters in the treatment of chronic heart failure: results of Markov modelling in a UK setting, Eur J Heart Fail, 2011-Apr-06; ():1388-9842",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Highly purified omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ethyl esters (n-3 PUFA) supplement vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,12636,United Kingdom,2009,22071.76

7819,Prescribing high-dose lipid-lowering therapy early to avoid subsequent cardiovascular events: is this a cost-effective strategy?,"Background: While evidence shows high-dose statins reduce cardiovascular events compared with moderate doses in individuals with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), many primary care trusts (PCT) advocate the use of generic simvastatin 40 mg/day for these patients. Methods and results: Data from 28 RCTs were synthesized using a mixed treatment comparison model. A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatments taking into account adherence and the likely reduction in cost for atorvastatin when the patent expires. There is a clear dose-response: rosuvastatin 40 mg/day produces the greatest reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (56%) followed by atorvastatin 80 mg/day (52%), and simvastatin 40 mg/day (37%). Using a threshold of £20,000 per QALY, if adherence levels in general practice are similar to those observed in RCTs, all three higher dose statins would be considered cost-effective compared to simvastatin 40 mg/day. Using the net benefits of the treatments, rosuvastatin 40 mg/day is estimated to be the most cost-effective alternative.

7821,Economic Evaluation of Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin for Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Canada for Patients With Established Cardiovascular Disease: Results From the CHARISMA Trial,"Background: The Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial found a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events when clopidogrel was added to aspirin in a prespecified subgroup of patients with established cardiovascular disease. However, the economic implications of such a strategy for the Canadian health care system are unknown. Methods: For each patient in the CHARISMA trial with established cardiovascular disease, costs were estimated by multiplying resource utilization by unit costs derived from populations of Canadian patients in 2008 dollars. Changes in life expectancy due to nonfatal events were estimated with parametric regression models based on the Saskatchewan Health database. Results: For patients with established cardiovascular disease, a strategy of clopidogrel plus aspirin for median duration of 28 months was associated with a 12.5% relative reduction in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with aspirin alone (6.9% vs 7.9%, P =.048). Mean cost per patient was CAD$1,488 higher for clopidogrel plus aspirin, and life expectancy increased by 0.057 years. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adding clopidogrel was CAD$25,969 per life-year gained or CAD$21,549 per quality-adjusted life-year. These results were sensitive to the cost of clopidogrel but relatively insensitive to plausible variations in discount rate, costs other than clopidogrel, and the prognostic impact of nonfatal events. Conclusion: Among the subgroup of patients with established cardiovascular disease in the CHARISMA trial, adding clopidogrel to aspirin increases life expectancy at a cost generally considered acceptable in Canada.",2011-01-07367,21459271,Can J Cardiol,Jersey Chen,2011,27 / 2,222-31,No,21459271,"Jersey Chen; Chunxue Shi; Elizabeth M Mahoney; Elizabeth Schneider Dunn; St?phane Rinfret; J Jaime Caro; Judith O'Brien; Wissam El-Hadi; Deepak L Bhatt; Eric J Topol; David J Cohen; Economic Evaluation of Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin for Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Canada for Patients With Established Cardiovascular Disease: Results From the CHARISMA Trial, Can J Cardiol, 2011 Mar-Apr; 27(2):0828-282X; 222-31",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clopidogrel plus aspirin vs. Aspirin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,21549,Canada,2008,24457.11
7822,Cost-effectiveness of different human papillomavirus vaccines in Singapore,"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are widely available and there have been studies exploring their potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness. However, few studies have compared the cost-effectiveness among the 2 main vaccines available - a bivalent vaccine against HPV 16/18, and a quadrivalent vaccine against 6/11/16/18. We explore the cost-effectiveness of these two HPV vaccines in tropical Singapore. Methods: We developed a Markov state-transition model to represent the natural history of cervical cancer to predict HPV infection, cancer incidence, mortality, and costs. Cytologic screening and treatment of different outcomes of HPV infection were incorporated. Vaccination was provided to a cohort of 12-year old females in Singapore, followed up until death. Based on available vaccines on the market, the bivalent vaccine had increased effectiveness against a wider range of HPV types, while the quadrivalent vaccine had effectiveness against genital warts. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) compared vaccination to no-vaccination, and between the two vaccines. Sensitivity analyses explored differences in vaccine effectiveness and uptake, and other key input parameters. Results: For the no vaccination scenario, 229 cervical cancer cases occurred over the cohort's lifetime. The total discounted cost per individual due to HPV infection was SGD$275 with 28.54 discounted life-years. With 100% vaccine coverage, the quadrivalent vaccine reduced cancers by 176, and had an ICER of SGD$12,866 per life-year saved. For the bivalent vaccine, 197 cancers were prevented with an ICER of $12,827 per life-year saved. Comparing the bivalent to the quadrivalent vaccine, the ICER was $12,488 per life-year saved.

Participants: Hypothetical populations of men and women aged 45 to 75 years without a history of vascular disease at different levels of risk for vascular disease (myocardial infarction and stroke) over 10 years. Interventions: Low dose statin treatment daily versus no treatment for 10 years. Main outcome measures: Number of fatal and nonfatal vascular events prevented, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over 10 years. Results: Over a 10-year period, statin treatment cost €35 000 (£30 000, $49 000) per QALY gained for men aged 55 years with a 10-year vascular risk of 10%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio improved as risk for vascular disease increased. The cost per QALY ranged from approximately €5000 to €125 000 when the 10-year vascular risk for men aged 55 years was varied from 25% to 5%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio slightly decreased with age after the level of vascular risk was specified. Results were sensitive to the costs of statin treatment, statin effectiveness, non-adherence, disutility of taking medication daily, and the time horizon of the model. Conclusions: In daily practice, statin treatment seemed not to be cost-effective for primary prevention in populations at low risk of vascular disease, despite low costs of generic drug pills.

7833,Asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease: is pharmacological prevention of cardiovascular risk cost-effective?,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with an increased risk of early death in cardiovascular (CV) disease. The majority of PAD subjects are asymptomatic with a prevalence of 11 per cent among the elderly. Long-term drug prevention aiming to minimize disease progression and CV events in these subjects is probably beneficial, but expensive. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological risk reduction in subclinical PAD. Long-term costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated by employing a decision-analytic model for ACE-inhibitor, statin, aspirin and non-aspirin anti-platelet therapy. Rates of CV events without treatment were derived from epidemiological studies and event rate reduction were retrieved from clinical trials. Costs and health-related quality of life estimates were obtained from published sources. All four drugs reduced CV events. Using ACE-inhibition resulted in a heart rate (HR) of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.55-0.79), statins 0.74 (0.70-0.79), and clopidogrel 0.72 (0.43-1.00). Aspirin had a HR of 0.87 and the 95% CI passed included one (0.72-1.03). ACE-inhibition was associated with the largest reduction in events leading to the highest gain in QALYs (7.95). Furthermore, ACE-inhibitors were associated with the lowest mean cost €40.556. In conclusion, while all drugs reduced CV events, ACE-inhibition was the most cost-effective.

7841,Cost-Effectiveness Model of Endoscopic Biopsy for Eosinophilic Esophagitis in Patients With Refractory GERD,"OBJECTIVES:The population prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is ~7% in adults. Current American Gastroenterology Association guidelines recommend endoscopic biopsy (Bx) in patients with symptoms of dysphagia. We conducted a cost-effectiveness model to determine if endoscopic Bx is cost effective in patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) without dysphagia.METHODS:We designed a 5-year Markov model to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years for a cohort of 35-year-old patients with GERD refractory to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. We compared upper endoscopy (EGD) with and without Bx for EoE. We modeled that patients with EoE who did not undergo initial biopsy would wait 5 years until the diagnosis would be established via a second endoscopy with biopsy.RESULTS:In patients with refractory GERD without dysphagia, endoscopic Bx for EoE was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $51,420 per quality of life year (QALY). The upper endoscopy with biopsy arm cost $12,490 per patient and was associated with 4.080 QALYs, compared with EGD without Bx arm that cost $12,280 and was associated with 4.076 QALYs. The ICER was <$50,000 per QALY when the prevalence of EoE exceeded 8%, or the time of missed diagnosis was 6 years or greater. The biopsy arm was also cost effective if the QALY associated with symptomatic GERD was =0.93, cost of 3-month course of PPI therapy =$770 cost of fluticasone <$650, probability of EoE resolved on PPI =25%, symptom resolution on fluticasone =70%, cost endoscopy with biopsy =$520, or the cost of endoscopy without biopsy exceeded $300.CONCLUSIONS:Upper endoscopy with Bx for EoE appears to be a cost-effective approach in patients when the prevalence of EoE is 8% or greater.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 29 March 2011; doi:10.1038/ajg.2011.94.",2011-01-07376,21448144,Am J Gastroenterol,Stephen M Miller,2011,/,,No,21448144,"Stephen M Miller; Jay L Goldstein; Lauren B Gerson; Cost-Effectiveness Model of Endoscopic Biopsy for Eosinophilic Esophagitis in Patients With Refractory GERD, Am J Gastroenterol, 2011-Mar-29; ():0002-9270",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Upper endoscopy (EGD) with biopsy for eosinophilic esophagitis vs. Upper endoscopy (EGD),Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,51420,United States,2009,62031.55

7846,Cost-effectiveness analysis of nephron sparing options for the management of small renal masses,"Purpose: A recent increase in the detection of contrast enhancing renal masses 4 cm or smaller suspicious for malignancy has led to the widespread use of nephron sparing options. Limited data exist to help clinicians decide which of these competing nephron sparing therapies is most appropriate. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the relative clinical and economic merits of commonly available nephron sparing strategies for small renal masses. Materials and methods: We developed a decision analytic Markov model estimating the costs and health outcomes of treating a healthy 65-year-old patient with an asymptomatic unilateral small renal mass using competing nephron sparing options of immediate intervention (ie open and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy as well as laparoscopic and percutaneous ablation), active surveillance with possible delayed intervention and nonsurgical management with observation. Benefits were measured in quality adjusted life-years. We used a societal perspective, lifetime horizon and willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per quality adjusted life-year gained. Model results were assessed with sensitivity analyses. Results: In the base case scenario the least costly option was observation and the optimal option was immediate laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,645 per quality adjusted life-year gained compared to surveillance with possible delayed percutaneous ablation. Results were sensitive to age at diagnosis, health status and tumor size. Conclusions: Immediate laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is the preferred nephron sparing option for healthy patients younger than 74 years old with a small renal mass. Surveillance with possible delayed percutaneous ablation is a cost-effective alternative for patients with advanced age or significant comorbidities. Observation maximizes quality adjusted life-years in patients who are poor surgical candidates or with limited life expectancy (less than 3 years).",2011-01-07408,21419445,J Urol,Steven L Chang,2011,185 / 5,1591-7,No,21419445,"Steven L Chang; Lauren E Cipriano; Lauren C Harshman; Alan M Garber; Benjamin I Chung; Cost-effectiveness analysis of nephron sparing options for the management of small renal masses, J Urol, 2011-May; 185(5):0022-5347; 1591-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Immediate laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) vs. Observation,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,36645,United States,2008,44050.15
7847,Cost-effectiveness of acupuncture care as an adjunct to exercise-based physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee,"Background: The delivery of acupuncture alongside mainstream interventions and the cost-effectiveness of ""alternative"" treatments remain areas of controversy. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of adding acupuncture to a course of advice and exercise delivered by UK National Health Service (NHS) physical therapists to people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Design: A cost-utility analysis was performed alongside a randomized controlled trial. Methods: A total of 352 adults (aged 50 years or older) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 interventions. The primary analysis focused on participants receiving advice and exercise (AE) or advice and exercise plus true acupuncture (AE+TA). A secondary analysis considered participants receiving advice and exercise plus nonpenetrating acupuncture (AE+NPA). The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), measured by the EQ-5D, and UK NHS costs. Results: were expressed as the incremental cost per QALY gained over 12 months. Sensitivity analyses included a broader cost perspective to incorporate private out-of-pocket costs. Results NHS costs were higher for AE+TA (£314 [British pounds sterling]) than for AE alone (£229), and the difference in mean QALYs favored AE+TA (mean difference=0.022). The base-case cost per QALY gained was £3,889; this value was associated with a 77% probability that AE+TA would be more cost-effective than AE at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Cost-utility data for AE+NPA provided cost-effectiveness estimates similar to those for AE+TA. Limitations: As with all trial-based economic evaluations, caution should be exercised when generalizing results beyond the study perspectives. Conclusions: A package of AE+TA delivered by NHS physical therapists provided a cost-effective use of health care resources despite an associated increase in costs. However, the economic benefits could not be attributed to the penetrating nature of conventional acupuncture; therefore, further research regarding the mechanisms of acupuncture is needed. An analysis of alternative cost perspectives suggested that the results are generalizable to other health care settings.",2011-01-07409,21415230,Phys Ther,David G T Whitehurst,2011,91 / 5,630-41,No,21415230,"David G T Whitehurst; Stirling Bryan; Elaine M Hay; Elaine Thomas; Julie Young; Nadine E Foster; Cost-effectiveness of acupuncture care as an adjunct to exercise-based physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee, Phys Ther, 2011-May; 91(5):1538-6724; 630-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Advice, exercise and true acupuncture (AE and TA) vs. Advice and exercise only",Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,3889,United Kingdom,2004,9766.77
7848,Cost-effectiveness of a 3-month intervention with oral nutritional supplements in disease-related malnutrition: a randomised controlled pilot study,"Background/Objectives:Nutritional intervention with oral nutritional supplements (ONS) has been shown to increase quality of life in malnourished patients. We investigated whether post-hospital supplementation with ONS is cost-effective according to international benchmarks in malnourished patients.Subjects/Methods:In total, 114 malnourished patients (50.6±16.1 years, 57 female) with benign gastrointestinal disease were included and randomised to receive either ONS for 3 months and dietary counselling at discharge (intervention, n=60) or only dietary counselling at discharge (control group, n=54). Nutritional status was assessed with Subjective Global Assessment. Intervention patients documented daily intake of ONS; quality of life was assessed with Short-Form (SF)-36 Health Survey and SF-36 values were transformed into health-status utilities. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated by adopting the area under the curve method. We used two different pricing scenarios for ONS (minimum price: \[euro]2.30 and maximum: \[euro]2.93/tetrapack). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of supplementation with ONS was calculated for both price scenarios. All analyses were corrected for age and gender.Results:Intervention patients consumed 2.4±0.8 ONS per day.

7849,Cost-effectiveness of a 3-month intervention with oral nutritional supplements in disease-related malnutrition: a randomised controlled pilot study,"Background/Objectives:Nutritional intervention with oral nutritional supplements (ONS) has been shown to increase quality of life in malnourished patients. We investigated whether post-hospital supplementation with ONS is cost-effective according to international benchmarks in malnourished patients.Subjects/Methods:In total, 114 malnourished patients (50.6±16.1 years, 57 female) with benign gastrointestinal disease were included and randomised to receive either ONS for 3 months and dietary counselling at discharge (intervention, n=60) or only dietary counselling at discharge (control group, n=54). Nutritional status was assessed with Subjective Global Assessment. Intervention patients documented daily intake of ONS; quality of life was assessed with Short-Form (SF)-36 Health Survey and SF-36 values were transformed into health-status utilities. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated by adopting the area under the curve method. We used two different pricing scenarios for ONS (minimum price: \[euro]2.30 and maximum: \[euro]2.93/tetrapack). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of supplementation with ONS was calculated for both price scenarios. All analyses were corrected for age and gender.Results:Intervention patients consumed 2.4±0.8 ONS per day. Intervention and control patients did not differ in their health status utilities at baseline (0.594±0.017 vs 0.619±0.018), but after 3 months, the health status utilities were significantly higher in intervention patients than in control patients (0.731±0.015 vs 0.671±0.016, P=0.028).

7850,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of a national program to eliminate disparities in influenza vaccination rates among elderly minority groups,"Influenza is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States, particularly among the elderly. Yet, there remain large disparities in influenza vaccination rates across elderly Caucasian (70%), African-American (50%) and Hispanic (55%) populations, with substantial mortality consequences. In this study, we built a decision-analysis model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical national vaccination program designed to eliminate these disparities in influenza vaccination rates. Taking a societal perspective, we developed a Markov model with a one-year cycle length and lifetime time horizon. In the base case, we conservatively assumed that the cost of promoting the vaccination program was $10 per targeted elder per year and that by year 10, the vaccination rate of the elderly African-American and Hispanic populations would equal the vaccination rate of the elderly Caucasian population (70%). The cost-effectiveness of the vaccination program compared to no vaccination program was $48,617 per QALY saved. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY saved, the likelihood of the vaccination program being cost-effective was 38% and 92%, respectively.

7852,Cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention of breast cancer using tamoxifen in a postmenopausal US population,"BACKGROUND: Previous cost-effectiveness analyses of tamoxifen therapy account for breast cancer risk reduction during active treatment but not for its persistent protective effect after active treatment. METHODS: A detailed, continuous time, mathematical model of breast cancer and healthcare processes was used to simulate a postmenopausal population aged <55 years in a virtual trial comparing tamoxifen treatment with no treatment for lifetime follow-up. Unlike previous work, the current model of tamoxifen therapy is based on a meta-analysis of 4 randomized, placebo-controlled chemoprevention trials with breast cancer risk reduction continuing for 10 years after treatment termination. Cancer incidence and survival data were derived from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results statistics. Noncancer disease incidences, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) utility weights, and costs were derived from the literature. RESULTS: Tamoxifen treatment (vs no treatment) saved 29 QALYs in a population of 1000 postmenopausal women aged <55 years with an additional cost of $333,000 over the population's lifetime (average cost-effectiveness ratio, $11,530 per QALY). Tamoxifen therapy, compared with no treatment, was cost saving when higher risk populations were targeted (5-year risk =1.66%). The cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to parameters that characterized menopausal symptoms and adverse side effects of tamoxifen. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that tamoxifen chemoprophylaxis for postmenopausal women aged <55 years is a cost-effective health policy that reduces breast cancer incidence and improves life expectancy. Focusing on a postmenopausal population aged <55 years minimized the threat of adverse events associated with tamoxifen.

7853,An economic evaluation of short-acting opioids for treatment of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer,"Objective: Breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) represents a considerable economic burden. A decision-analysis model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intranasal fentanyl spray (INFS) compared with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) and fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) for the treatment of BTCP. Methods: The model was parameterized for Sweden to estimate the costs and benefits associated with treatments. Expected reductions in pain intensity (PI; measured on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10) per BTCP episodes were translated into resource use and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Relative analgesic efficacy of interventions was derived from a mixed treatment comparison of six randomized controlled trials. The relationship between PI and utility was obtained from a time-trade off study in the general population. Resource use and unit cost data were obtained from the literature and validated by Swedish clinical experts. The base case scenario assumed three BTCP episodes/day, a background PI of 2, and a time horizon of 180 days. Prices of INFS and OTFC were assumed to be equal with FBT ∼14% less. Uncertainty in the source data was incorporated by probabilistic sensitivity analyses and different scenario analyses. Results: With INFS, 55% of BTCP (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 46-68%) was avoided, which is greater than expected with OTFC (29%; UI 22-38%) or FBT (31%; UI 25-39%). INFS was dominating OTFC (resulting in 0.046 QALY gain and saving 174 Euros with a time horizon of 180 days) and cost-effective versus FBT (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 12203 Euros/QALY). Despite uncertainty in the source data, there is a >99% probability that INFS is the most cost-effective intervention.

7855,Cost-utility of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication versus proton pump inhibitors for chronic and controlled gastroesophageal reflux disease: a 3-year prospective randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation,"Background: Very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) medical management for patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Larger RCTs have been relatively short in duration, and have reported mixed results regarding symptom control and effect on quality of life (QOL). Economic evaluations have reported conflicting results. Objectives: To determine the incremental cost-utility of LNF versus PPI for treating patients with chronic and controlled GERD over 3 years from the societal perspective. Methods: Economic evaluation was conducted alongside a RCT that enrolled 104 patients from October 2000 to September 2004. Primary study outcome was GERD symptoms (secondary outcomes included QOL and cost-utility). Resource utilization and QOL data collected at regular follow-up intervals determined incremental cost/QALY gained. Stochastic uncertainty was assessed using bootstrapping and methodologic assumptions were assessed using sensitivity analysis. Results: No statistically significant differences in GERD symptom scores, but LNF did result in fewer heartburn days and improved QOL. Costs were higher for LNF patients by $3205/patient over 3 years but QOL was also higher as measured by either QOL instrument. Based on total costs, incremental cost-utility of LNF was $29,404/QALY gained using the Health Utility Index 3. Cost-utility results were sensitive to the utility instrument used ($29,404/QALY for Health Utility Index 3, $31,117/QALY for the Short Form 6D, and $76,310/QALY for EuroQol 5D) and if current lower prices for PPIs were used in the analysis. Conclusions: Results varied depending on resource use/costs included in the analysis, the QOL instrument used, and the cost of PPIs; however, LNF was generally found to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with symptomatic controlled GERD requiring long-term management.",2011-01-07423,21402295,Value Health,Ron Goeree,2011,14 / 2,263-73,Yes,21402295,"Ron Goeree; Rob Hopkins; John K Marshall; David Armstrong; Wendy J Ungar; Charles Goldsmith; Christopher Allen; Mehran Anvari; Cost-utility of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication versus proton pump inhibitors for chronic and controlled gastroesophageal reflux disease: a 3-year prospective randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation, Value Health, 2011 Mar-Apr; 14(2):1098-3015; 263-73",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lapraroscopic nissen fundoplication + medication therapy as needed vs. Proton pump inhibitor medicaltion therapy,Not Stated,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,5.00,5.00,29404,Canada,2009,31227.58

Methods: A 10-year Markov analytic model was developed to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and incontinence episode avoided associated with SNM therapy compared with botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) or continued optimized medical treatment (OMT). Results: At 10 years, the cumulative costs of SNM, BoNT-A, and OMT were €29,166, €29,458, and €29,370, respectively, whereas the QALYs for SNM, BoNT-A, and OMT are 6.89, 6.38, and 5.12, respectively. Consequently, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for SNM demonstrate that although the initial costs for SNM are higher than those for the other treatments, decreasing follow-up costs coupled with consistently greater effectiveness in the long term make SNM the economically dominant option at 10 years. Sensitivity analyses suggest that 99.7% and 99.9% (for SNM vs. BoNT-A and OMT, respectively) of the 1000 Monte Carlo iterations fall within the €30,000 cost-effectiveness threshold, considered to be acceptable in Spain. The 10-year incremental cost per incontinence episode avoided for SNM also makes this therapy the dominant option compared to BoNT-A or OMT. Additionally, the estimated budget impact of the gradually increased referral for SNM for the management of OAB patients in Spain is small.

7863,Cost-effectiveness of telemetry for hospitalized patients with low-risk chest pain,"Background: The majority of chest pain admissions originate in the emergency department (ED). Despite a low incidence of cardiac events, limited telemetry availability, and its questionable benefit, these patients are routinely admitted to a monitored setting. Objectives: The objectives were to analyze the cost-effectiveness of admission to telemetry versus admission to an unmonitored hospital bed in low-risk chest pain patients and explore when the use of telemetry may be cost-effective. Methods: The authors constructed a decision analytic model to evaluate the scenario of an ED admission of an otherwise healthy 55-year-old patient with low-risk chest pain defined as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) probability of 2%. Costs were estimated from 2009 Medicare data for hospital reimbursement and physician services, as well as published data on disability costs. Published studies were used to estimate the risk of ACS, cardiac arrest, time to defibrillation, survival, long-term disability, and quality of life. Results: In the base case, telemetry was more effective (0.0044 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) but more costly ($299.67) than a floor bed, resulting in a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (mCER) of $67,484.55 per QALY. In comprehensive sensitivity analyses, the mCER crossed below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY when the following scenarios were met: the probability of ACS exceeds 3%, the probability of cardiac arrest is greater than 0.4%, the probability of shockable dysrhythmia is above 83%, the probability of delay in telemetry bed availability is below 52%, and the opportunity cost of delay to telemetry bed placement is below $119. Conclusions: Telemetry may be a ""cost-effective"" use of health care resources for chest pain patients when patients have a probability of ACS above 3% or for patients with a minimal delay and cost associated with obtaining a monitored bed. Further research is needed to better stratify low-risk chest pain patients to the appropriate inpatient setting and to understand the frequency and costs associated with delays in obtaining monitored beds.",2011-01-07426,21401791,Acad Emerg Med,Michael J Ward,2011,18 / 3,279-86,No,21401791,"Michael J Ward; Mark H Eckman; Daniel P Schauer; Ali S Raja; Sean Collins; Cost-effectiveness of telemetry for hospitalized patients with low-risk chest pain, Acad Emerg Med, 2011-Mar; 18(3):1069-6563; 279-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Telemetry bed for monitoring vs. Unmonitored floor bed,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,67484.55,United States,2009,81411.34
7864,Cost-effectiveness of adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine in adult hemodialysis patients,"Background: Currently more than 340,000 individuals are receiving long-term hemodialysis (HD) therapy for end-stage renal disease and therefore are particularly vulnerable to influenza, prone to more severe influenza outcomes, and less likely to achieve seroprotection from standard influenza vaccines. Influenza vaccine adjuvants, chemical or biologic compounds added to a vaccine to boost the elicited immunologic response, may help overcome this problem. Study design: Economic stochastic decision analytic simulation model. Setting & participants: US adult HD population. Model, perspective, & timeframe: The model simulated the decision to use either an adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccine, assumed the societal perspective, and represented a single influenza season, or 1 year. Intervention: Adjuvanted influenza vaccine at different adjuvant costs and efficacies. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of varying influenza clinical attack rate, influenza hospitalization rate, and influenza-related mortality. Outcomes: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adjuvanted influenza vaccine (vs nonadjuvanted) with effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years. Results: Adjuvanted influenza vaccine would be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year) at a $1 adjuvant cost (on top of the standard vaccine cost) when adjuvant efficacy (in overcoming the difference between influenza vaccine response in HD patients and healthy adults) ≥60% and economically dominant (provides both cost savings and health benefits) when the $1 adjuvant's efficacy is 100%. A $2 adjuvant would be cost-effective if adjuvant efficacy was 100%. Limitations: All models are simplifications of real life and cannot capture all possible factors and outcomes.

7865,Economic evaluation of Chagas disease screening of pregnant Latin American women and of their infants in a non endemic area,"Migration is a channel through which Chagas disease is imported, and vertical transmission is a channel through which the disease is spread in non-endemic countries. This study presents the economic evaluation of Chagas disease screening in pregnant women from Latin America and in their newborns in a non endemic area such as Spain. The economic impact of Chagas disease screening is tested through two decision models, one for the newborn and one for the mother, against the alternative hypothesis of no screening for either the newborn or the mother. Results show that the option ""no test"" is dominated by the option ""test"". The cost effectiveness ratio in the ""newborn model"" was 22€/QALYs gained in the case of screening and 125€/QALYs gained in the case of no screening. The cost effectiveness ratio in the ""mother model"" was 96€/QALYs gained in the case of screening and 1675€/QALYs gained in the case of no screening. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis highlighted the reduction of uncertainty in the screening option. Threshold analysis assessed that even with a drop in Chagas prevalence from 3.4% to 0.9%, a drop in the probability of vertical transmission from 7.3% to 2.24% and with an increase of screening costs up to €37.5, ""test"" option would still be preferred to ""no test"".

7867,Is Total Ankle Arthroplasty A Cost-effective Alternative to Ankle Fusion?,"BACKGROUND: Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) implantation is increasing, as the potential for pain relief and restoration of function and risks are compared with those for ankle fusion. A previous analysis with a simple decision tree suggested TAA was cost-effective compared with ankle fusion. However, reevaluation is warranted with the availability of newer, more costly implants and longer-term patient followup data. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Considering all direct medical costs regardless of the payer, we determined if TAA remains a cost-effective alternative to ankle fusion when updated evidence is considered. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we evaluated expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for a 60-year-old hypothetical cohort with end-stage ankle arthritis treated with either TAA or ankle fusion. Costs were estimated from 2007 diagnosis-related group (DRG) and current procedural terminology (CPT) codes for each procedure. Rates were extracted from the literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a measure of added cost divided by QALY gained for TAA relative to ankle fusion, was estimated. To identify factors affecting the value of TAA, sensitivity analyses were performed on all variables. RESULTS: TAA costs $20,200 more than ankle fusion and resulted in 1.7 additional QALY, with an ICER of $11,800/QALY gained. Few variables in the sensitivity analyses resulted in TAA no longer being cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Despite more costly implants and longer followup, TAA remains a cost-effective alternative to ankle fusion in a 60-year-old cohort with end-stage ankle arthritis.

7868,An economic evaluation of a laboratory monitoring program for Renin-Angiotensin system agents,"Background: The efficiency of patient safety interventions is not well studied, especially laboratory monitoring for drug therapy. More than one-third of preventable adverse drug events are associated with inadequate monitoring. Current knowledge of decreasing adverse drug events through expanded monitoring programs is lacking. Design: The authors focused on a laboratory monitoring program (above usual practice) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) agents to prevent adverse events of hyperkalemia and acute renal failure. They used a probabilistic decision model to estimate cost savings and cost effectiveness (at $30,000 and $10,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)). Costs included the monitoring program, and offsets from reduced care in 3 populations (overall, chronic kidney disease [CKD], and diabetes). Main results: Adverse events were most common in those with CKD. Intervening on all new users or the subset with diabetes was almost never expected to be cost saving (probability <1%). But a monitoring program restricted to patients with CKD was expected to be cost saving (probability = 95%). A strategy that intervened on all patients, or those with diabetes, was never cost effective, (probability <1%). But intervening on patients with CKD was estimated to be cost effective (at either cost-effectiveness threshold) at least 95% of the time in the base case.

Methods: Within-trial prospective economic evaluation from (i) health and social care and (ii) societal perspectives. Three hundred and forty-four adults with Type 1 diabetes for at least 2 years and persistent, suboptimal glycaemic control were recruited to a three-arm multi-centre randomized controlled trial in London and Manchester, UK. They were randomized to (i) usual care plus four sessions of motivational enhancement therapy (ii) usual care plus four sessions of motivational enhancement therapy and eight sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy or (iii) usual care alone. Outcomes were (i) costs, (ii) Quality-Adjusted Life Year gains measured by the EuroQol 5-dimensional health state index and the 36-item Short Form and (iii) diabetes control measured by change in HbA(1c) level at 1 year. Results: Both intervention groups had significantly higher mean health and social care costs (+ £535 for motivational enhancement therapy and + £790 for combined motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioural therapy), but not societal costs compared with the usual-care group. There were no differences in Quality Adjusted Life Years. There was a significantly greater HbA(1c) improvement in the combined motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioural therapy group (+ 0.45%; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = £1756), but the not in the motivational enhancement therapy group.

7873,Effectiveness and cost effectiveness of expanding harm reduction and antiretroviral therapy in a mixed HIV epidemic: a modeling analysis for Ukraine,"Background: Injection drug use (IDU) and heterosexual virus transmission both contribute to the growing mixed HIV epidemics in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In Ukraine-chosen in this study as a representative country-IDU-related risk behaviors cause half of new infections, but few injection drug users (IDUs) receive methadone substitution therapy. Only 10% of eligible individuals receive antiretroviral therapy (ART). The appropriate resource allocation between these programs has not been studied. We estimated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies for expanding methadone substitution therapy programs and ART in mixed HIV epidemics, using Ukraine as a case study. Methods and findings: We developed a dynamic compartmental model of the HIV epidemic in a population of non-IDUs, IDUs using opiates, and IDUs on methadone substitution therapy, stratified by HIV status, and populated it with data from the Ukraine. We considered interventions expanding methadone substitution therapy, increasing access to ART, or both. We measured health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), HIV prevalence, infections averted, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Without incremental interventions, HIV prevalence reached 67.2% (IDUs) and 0.88% (non-IDUs) after 20 years. Offering methadone substitution therapy to 25% of IDUs reduced prevalence most effectively (to 53.1% IDUs, 0.80% non-IDUs), and was most cost-effective, averting 4,700 infections and adding 76,000 QALYs compared with no intervention at US$530/QALY gained. Expanding both ART (80% coverage of those eligible for ART according to WHO criteria) and methadone substitution therapy (25% coverage) was the next most cost-effective strategy, adding 105,000 QALYs at US$1,120/QALY gained versus the methadone substitution therapy-only strategy and averting 8,300 infections versus no intervention. Expanding only ART (80% coverage) added 38,000 QALYs at US$2,240/QALY gained versus the methadone substitution therapy-only strategy, and averted 4,080 infections versus no intervention. Offering ART to 80% of non-IDUs eligible for treatment by WHO criteria, but only 10% of IDUs, averted only 1,800 infections versus no intervention and was not cost effective. Conclusions: Methadone substitution therapy is a highly cost-effective option for the growing mixed HIV epidemic in Ukraine. A strategy that expands both methadone substitution therapy and ART to high levels is the most effective intervention, and is very cost effective by WHO criteria. When expanding ART, access to methadone substitution therapy provides additional benefit in infections averted. Our findings are potentially relevant to other settings with mixed HIV epidemics.

7876,The cost-effectiveness of community-based screening for oral cancer in high-risk males in the United States: A Markov decision analysis approach,"Objective: The 2004 US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines do not recommend routinely screening adults for oral cancer given no proven mortality reduction. A large cluster-randomized controlled screening trial in Kerala, India, in 2005, however, reported a significant reduction in mortality for screened male tobacco and/or alcohol users. In the United States, office-based screening efforts targeting males of high risk (regular use of tobacco and/or alcohol) have been unsuccessful due to poor attendance. Given the newfound screening mortality benefit to this high-risk subpopulation, we sought to ascertain the cost-effectiveness threshold of a yearly, community outreach screening program for males more than 40 years regularly using tobacco and/or alcohol. Study design: Markov decision analysis model; societal perspective. Methods: A literature search was performed to determine event probabilities, health utilities, and cost parameters to serve as model inputs. Screen versus No-Screen strategies were modeled using assumptions and published data. The primary outcome was the difference in costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the two cohorts, representing the potential budget for a screening program. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed for several key parameters. Results: The No-Screen arm was dominated with an incremental cost of $258 and an incremental effectiveness of -0.0414 QALYs. Using the $75,000/QALY metric, the maximum allowable budget for a screening program equals $3,363 ($258 + $3,105) per screened person over a 40-year time course. Conclusion: Given the significant health benefits and financial savings via early detection in the screened cohort, a community-based screening program targeting high-risk males is likely to be cost-effective.",2011-01-07445,21384383,Laryngoscope,Raj C Dedhia,2011,121 / 5,952-60,No,21384383,"Raj C Dedhia; Kenneth J Smith; Jonas T Johnson; Mark Roberts; The cost-effectiveness of community-based screening for oral cancer in high-risk males in the United States: A Markov decision analysis approach, Laryngoscope, 2011-May; 121(5):0023-852X; 952-60",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Yearly community-based oral cancer screening vs. None,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-6239.13,United States,2009,-7526.7
7877,Incremental cost-effectiveness of combined therapy vs medication only for youth with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant depression: treatment of SSRI-resistant depression in adolescents trial findings,"Context: Many youth with depression do not respond to initial treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and this is associated with higher costs. More effective treatment for these youth may be cost-effective. Objective: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness over 24 weeks of combined cognitive behavior therapy plus switch to a different antidepressant medication vs medication switch only in adolescents who continued to have depression despite adequate initial treatment with an SSRI. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Six US academic and community clinics. Patients: Three hundred thirty-four patients aged 12 to 18 years with SSRI-resistant depression. Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned to (1) switch to a different medication only or (2) switch to a different medication plus cognitive behavior therapy. Main outcome measures: Clinical outcomes were depression-free days (DFDs), depression-improvement days (DIDs), and quality-adjusted life-years based on DFDs (DFD-QALYs). Costs of intervention, nonprotocol services, and families were included. Results: Combined treatment achieved 8.3 additional DFDs (P = .03), 0.020 more DFD-QALYs (P = .03), and 11.0 more DIDs (P = .04). Combined therapy cost $1633 more (P = .01). Cost per DFD was $188 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = $188; 95% confidence interval [CI], -$22 to $1613), $142 per DID (ICER = $142; 95% CI, -$14 to $2529), and $78,948 per DFD-QALY (ICER = $78,948; 95% CI, -$9261 to $677,448). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analyses suggest a 61% probability that combined treatment is more cost-effective at a willingness to pay $100,000 per QALY. Combined treatment had a higher net benefit for subgroups of youth without a history of abuse, with lower levels of hopelessness, and with comorbid conditions. Conclusions: For youth with SSRI-resistant depression, combined treatment decreases the number of days with depression and is more costly. Depending on a decision maker's willingness to pay, combined therapy may be cost-effective, particularly for some subgroups.",2011-01-07446,21383263,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Frances L Lynch,2011,68 / 3,253-62,No,21383263,"Frances L Lynch; John F Dickerson; Greg Clarke; Benedetto Vitiello; Giovanna Porta; Karen D Wagner; Graham Emslie; Joan Rosenbaum Asarnow; Martin B Keller; Boris Birmaher; Neal D Ryan; Betsy Kennard; Taryn Mayes; Lynn DeBar; James T McCracken; Michael Strober; Robert L Suddath; Anthony Spirito; Matthew Onorato; Jamie Zelazny; Satish Iyengar; David Brent; Incremental cost-effectiveness of combined therapy vs medication only for youth with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant depression: treatment of SSRI-resistant depression in adolescents trial findings, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 2011-Mar; 68(3):0003-990X; 253-62",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cognitive behavior therapy plus medication switch to a different antidepressant vs. Medication switch to a different antidepressant,Not Stated,18 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,78948,United States,2009,95240.5
7878,Cost-effectiveness of treatment with etanercept for psoriasis in Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness, from a Swedish societal perspective, of intermittent use of etanercept (Enbrel) with interruptions of use after 24 weeks compared to continuous use of adalimumab (Humira) as well as non-systemic standard of care in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. METHODS: A Markov decision-tree model was constructed from clinical trials results. Patients starting etanercept, adalimumab, or non-systemic therapy moved through the model's 10-years horizon. Model input parameters included clinical response rates. Outcome measures included direct and indirect costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The incremental total (direct and indirect) costs per QALY were 1,559,939 kr (<euro>165,354) for adalimumab 40 mg every other week, compared with intermittent once-weekly Enbrel 50 mg, and 93,629 kr (<euro>9,925) for once-weekly intermittent etanercept 50 mg compared with non-systemic standard of care. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis showed that, with a 470,000 kr (<euro>50,000) per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, once-weekly etanercept 50 mg, used intermittently, is a cost-effective treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis compared with adalimumab and non-systemic standard of care.",2011-01-07449,21380772,Eur J Health Econ,Christopher Knight,2011,/,,Yes,21380772,"Christopher Knight; Josephine Mauskopf; Mats Ekelund; Amitabh Singh; Shiyi Yang; Robert Boggs; Cost-effectiveness of treatment with etanercept for psoriasis in Sweden, Eur J Health Econ, 2011-Mar-06; ():1618-7598",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Once weekly intermittent etanercept 50 mg (Enbrel) vs. Non systemic therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,93629,Sweden,2009,14851.9

7881,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a new 8% capsaicin patch compared to existing therapies for postherpetic neuralgia,"Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of a new 8% capsaicin patch, compared to the current treatments for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), topical lidocaine patches, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregabalin. Methods: A 1-year Markov model was constructed for PHN with monthly cycles, including dose titration and management of adverse events. The perspective of the analysis was from a payer perspective, managed-care organization. Clinical trials were used to determine the proportion of patients achieving at least a 30% improvement in PHN pain, the efficacy parameter. The outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); second-order probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The effectiveness results indicated that 8% capsaicin patch and topical lidocaine patch were significantly more effective than the oral PHN products. TCAs were least costly and significantly less costly than duloxetine, pregabalin, topical lidocaine patch, 8% capsaicin patch, but not gabapentin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the 8% capsaicin patch overlapped with the topical lidocaine patch and was within the accepted threshold of cost per QALY gained compared to TCAs, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregablin. The frequency of the 8% capsaicin patch retreatment assumption significantly impacts its cost-effectiveness results. There are several limitations to this analysis. Since no head-to-head studies were identified, this model used inputs from multiple clinical trials. Also, a last observation carried forward process was assumed to have continued for the duration of the model. Additionally, the trials with duloxetine may have over-predicted its efficacy in PHN. Although a 30% improvement in pain is often an endpoint in clinical trials, some patients may require greater or less improvement in pain to be considered a clinical success. Conclusions: The effectiveness results demonstrated that 8% capsaicin and topical lidocaine patches had significantly higher effectiveness rates than the oral agents used to treat PHN.

7884,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a new 8% capsaicin patch compared to existing therapies for postherpetic neuralgia,"Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of a new 8% capsaicin patch, compared to the current treatments for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), topical lidocaine patches, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregabalin. Methods: A 1-year Markov model was constructed for PHN with monthly cycles, including dose titration and management of adverse events. The perspective of the analysis was from a payer perspective, managed-care organization. Clinical trials were used to determine the proportion of patients achieving at least a 30% improvement in PHN pain, the efficacy parameter. The outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); second-order probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The effectiveness results indicated that 8% capsaicin patch and topical lidocaine patch were significantly more effective than the oral PHN products. TCAs were least costly and significantly less costly than duloxetine, pregabalin, topical lidocaine patch, 8% capsaicin patch, but not gabapentin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the 8% capsaicin patch overlapped with the topical lidocaine patch and was within the accepted threshold of cost per QALY gained compared to TCAs, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregablin. The frequency of the 8% capsaicin patch retreatment assumption significantly impacts its cost-effectiveness results. There are several limitations to this analysis. Since no head-to-head studies were identified, this model used inputs from multiple clinical trials. Also, a last observation carried forward process was assumed to have continued for the duration of the model. Additionally, the trials with duloxetine may have over-predicted its efficacy in PHN. Although a 30% improvement in pain is often an endpoint in clinical trials, some patients may require greater or less improvement in pain to be considered a clinical success.

7886,Treatment strategies aiming at remission in early rheumatoid arthritis patients: starting with methotrexate monotherapy is cost-effective,"Objective. To perform a modelling study on the cost-effectiveness of three outcome-directed strategies in early RA patients: Strategy 1: starting MTX monotherapy, followed by the addition of LEF, followed by MTX with addition of anti-TNF; Strategy 2: start with MTX and LEF combination followed by MTX with anti-TNF; and Strategy 3: immediate start with MTX and anti-TNF. Methods. A validated Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three strategies. Effectiveness of the strategies was determined using daily practice data from two cohorts and used as input parameter in the model. Patients treated according to the strategies were matched for baseline 28-joint DAS (DAS-28). Using Monte Carlo simulation, expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained for a 5-year time horizon were calculated following both a health-care and a societal perspective. Results. The percentage of patients in remission and number of QALYs were comparable between the three strategies. Starting with a combination (MTX plus LEF or anti-TNF) was more costly than starting with MTX alone. This resulted in an unfavourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for starting on anti-TNF vs initially MTX: health-care perspective of €138?028 and from a societal perspective of €136?150 per QALY gained over 5 years. Conclusion. In this modelling study, starting with MTX or anti-TNF has comparable effectiveness. However, initial anti-TNF was far more expensive than starting with MTX monotherapy.

7890,Improving the quality of pressure ulcer care with prevention: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background: In October 2008, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discontinued reimbursement for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs), thus placing stress on hospitals to prevent incidence of this costly condition. Objective: To evaluate whether prevention methods are cost-effective compared with standard care in the management of HAPUs. Research design and subjects: A semi-Markov model simulated the admission of patients to an acute care hospital from the time of admission through 1 year using the societal perspective. The model simulated health states that could potentially lead to an HAPU through either the practice of ""prevention"" or ""standard care."" Univariate sensitivity analyses, threshold analyses, and Bayesian multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations were conducted. Measures: Cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained for the prevention of HAPUs. Results: Prevention was cost saving and resulted in greater expected effectiveness compared with the standard care approach per hospitalization. The expected cost of prevention was $7276.35, and the expected effectiveness was 11.241 QALYs. The expected cost for standard care was $10,053.95, and the expected effectiveness was 9.342 QALYs. The multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that prevention resulted in cost savings in 99.99% of the simulations. The threshold cost of prevention was $821.53 per day per person, whereas the cost of prevention was estimated to be $54.66 per day per person. Conclusion: This study suggests that it is more cost effective to pay for prevention of HAPUs compared with standard care. Continuous preventive care of HAPUs in acutely ill patients could potentially reduce incidence and prevalence, as well as lead to lower expenditures.",2011-01-07459,21368685,Med Care,William V Padula,2011,49 / 4,385-92,No,21368685,"William V Padula; Manish K Mishra; Mary Beth F Makic; Patrick W Sullivan; Improving the quality of pressure ulcer care with prevention: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Med Care, 2011-Apr; 49(4):0025-7079; 385-92",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prevention strategy for hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,3.00,3.00,-1462.66,United States,2009,-1764.51
7891,Treatment strategies for pelvic organ prolapse: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"introduction and hypothesis: To compare the relative cost effectiveness of treatment decision alternatives for post-hysterectomy pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Methods: A Markov decision analysis model was used to assess and compare the relative cost effectiveness of expectant management, use of a pessary, and surgery for obtaining months of quality-adjusted life over 1 year. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether the results depended on specific estimates of patient utilities for pessary use, probabilities for complications and other events, and estimated costs. Results: Only two treatment alternatives were found to be efficient choices: initial pessary use and vaginal reconstructive surgery (VRS). Pessary use (including patients that eventually transitioned to surgery) achieved 10.4 quality-adjusted months, at a cost of $10,000 per patient, while VRS obtained 11.4 quality-adjusted months, at $15,000 per patient. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that these baseline results depended on several key estimates in the model. Conclusions: This analysis indicates that pessary use and VRS are the most cost-effective treatment alternatives for treating post-hysterectomy vaginal prolapse.

7892,Costs and cost-effectiveness of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy for patients at increased surgical risk: results from the SAPPHIRE trial,"Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of carotid stenting vs. carotid endarterectomy using data from the SAPPHIRE trial. Background: Carotid stenting with embolic protection has been introduced as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for prevention of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events among patients at increased surgical risk. Methods: Between August 2000 and July 2002, 310 patients with an accepted indication for carotid endarterectomy but at high risk of complications were randomized to and subsequently underwent either carotid stenting (n = 159) or endarterectomy (n = 151). Clinical outcomes, resource use, costs, and quality of life were assessed prospectively for all patients over a 1-year period. Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and health care costs beyond the follow-up period were estimated for patients alive at 1 year, based on observed clinical events during the first year of follow-up. Results: Although initial procedural costs were significantly higher for stenting than for endarterectomy (mean difference: $4,081/patient; 95% CI, $3,849-$4,355), mean post-procedure length of stay was shorter for stenting (1.9 vs. 2.9 days; P < 0.001) with significant associated cost offsets. As a result, initial hospital costs were just $559/patient higher with stenting (95% CI, $3,470 less to $2,289 more). Neither follow-up costs after discharge nor total 1-year costs differed significantly. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for stenting compared with endarterectomy was $6,555 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, with over 98 percent of bootstrap estimates < $50,000/QALY gained. Conclusions: Although carotid stenting with embolic protection is more costly than carotid endarterectomy, by commonly accepted standards, stenting is an economically attractive alternative to endarterectomy for patients at high surgical risk.",2011-01-07463,21351220,Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,Elizabeth M Mahoney,2011,77 / 4,463-72,No,21351220,"Elizabeth M Mahoney; Dan Greenberg; Tara A Lavelle; Amy Natarajan; Ronna Berezin; K Jack Ishak; Jamie J Caro; Jay S Yadav; William A Gray; Mark H Wholey; David J Cohen; Costs and cost-effectiveness of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy for patients at increased surgical risk: results from the SAPPHIRE trial, Catheter Cardiovasc Interv, 2011-Mar-01; 77(4):1522-726X; 463-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carotid stenting vs. Carotid endarterectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,6555,United States,2002,9430.27
7893,"Cost-effectiveness of insulin glargine versus NPH insulin for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, modeling the interaction between hypoglycemia and glycemic control in Switzerland","Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term and long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with insulin glargine or NPH insulin in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with oral anti-diabetic drugs in Switzerland, modeling the interaction between hypoglycemia and glycemic control (HbA1c). Methods: A validated discrete event simulation model for T2DM was used to predict incidence of short-term complications (symptomatic, nocturnal and severe hypoglycemic events) and long-term complications (microvascular and macrovascular events), life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct medical costs in patients treated with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. The model was populated with published Swiss patient characteristics with T2DM. Baseline risks of hypoglycemic events, utility decrements of diabetes-related long-term complications and the hypoglycemia fear score were derived from the literature. Relative risk reductions of hypoglycemia adjusted for HbA1c using insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin were based on a published negative binomial meta-regression analysis. Costs of severe hypoglycemia, micro- and macrovascular events were analyzed from literature whenever possible otherwise guideline-projected resource-use estimations were valued with Swiss official prices or tariffs in 2006 CHF. Simulations were run with 1,000 patients per cohort over a time horizon of 40 years. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were presented as cost per QALY and per life year gained (LYG). Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Wide-range one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Insulin glargine was associated with an improvement in quality of life (0.098 QALYs per patient) and additional life expectancy (0.05 life years gained per patient) compared to NPH insulin. Incremental costs of CHF 2,578 resulted in an ICER of CHF 26,271 per QALY and CHF 51,100 per LYG. The cost per QALY was most sensitive to changes in costs, utility decrements and relative risk reductions of hypoglycemia. Conclusions: This study evaluated, for the first time, the cost effectiveness of insulin glargine versus NPH insulin for the treatment of T2DM considering the interaction between glycemic control and hypoglycemia in Switzerland. The base case and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that insulin glargine proved to be cost-effective with respect to accepted willingness to pay thresholds and therefore represents good value for money.",2011-01-07469,21329624,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,M Br?ndle,2011,49 / 3,217-30,No,21329624,"M Br?ndle; M Azoulay; R-A Greiner; Cost-effectiveness of insulin glargine versus NPH insulin for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, modeling the interaction between hypoglycemia and glycemic control in Switzerland, Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2011-Mar; 49(3):0946-1965; 217-30",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin glargine vs. NPH (neutral protamine hagedorn) insulin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.50,3.50,26271,Switzerland,2006,26931.21
7894,Cost effectiveness of screening immigrants for hepatitis B,"Background: The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection among the immigrants of North America ranges from 2 to 15%, among whom 40% develop advanced liver disease. Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen is not recommended for immigrants. Aims: The objective of this study is to estimate the health and economic effects of screening strategies for CHB among immigrants. Methods: We used the Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of three screening strategies: (i) 'No screening'; (ii) 'Screen and Treat' and (iii) 'Screen, Treat and Vaccinate' for 20-65 years old individuals who were born abroad but are currently living in Canada. Model data were obtained from the published literature. We measured predicted hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related deaths, costs (2008 Canadian Dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: Our results show that screening all immigrants will prevent 59 HBV-related deaths per 10 000 persons screened over the lifetime of the cohort. Screening was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.024 QALYs) and cost ($1665) per person with an ICER of $69 209/QALY gained compared with 'No screening'. The 'Screen, Treat and Vaccinate' costs an additional $81, generates an additional 0.000022 QALYs per person, with an ICER of $3 648 123/QALY compared with the 'Screen and Treat'. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the 'Screen and Treat' is likely to be moderately cost-effective. Conclusion: We show that a selective hepatitis B screening programme targeted at all immigrants in Canada is likely to be moderately cost-effective.

Screening was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.024 QALYs) and cost ($1665) per person with an ICER of $69 209/QALY gained compared with 'No screening'. The 'Screen, Treat and Vaccinate' costs an additional $81, generates an additional 0.000022 QALYs per person, with an ICER of $3 648 123/QALY compared with the 'Screen and Treat'. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the 'Screen and Treat' is likely to be moderately cost-effective. Conclusion: We show that a selective hepatitis B screening programme targeted at all immigrants in Canada is likely to be moderately cost-effective.

7896,Cost effectiveness of screening immigrants for hepatitis B,"Background: The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection among the immigrants of North America ranges from 2 to 15%, among whom 40% develop advanced liver disease. Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen is not recommended for immigrants. Aims: The objective of this study is to estimate the health and economic effects of screening strategies for CHB among immigrants. Methods: We used the Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of three screening strategies: (i) 'No screening'; (ii) 'Screen and Treat' and (iii) 'Screen, Treat and Vaccinate' for 20-65 years old individuals who were born abroad but are currently living in Canada.

7898,Comparative Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of the Implantable Miniature Telescope,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the preference-based comparative effectiveness (human value gain) and the cost-utility (cost-effectiveness) of a telescope prosthesis (implantable miniature telescope) for the treatment of end-stage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: A value-based medicine, second-eye model, cost-utility analysis was performed to quantify the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapy with the telescope prosthesis. PARTICIPANTS: Published, evidence-based data from the IMT002 Study Group clinical trial. Ophthalmic utilities were obtained from a validated cohort of >1000 patients with ocular diseases. METHODS: Comparative effectiveness data were converted from visual acuity to utility (value-based) format. The incremental costs (Medicare) of therapy versus no therapy were integrated with the value gain conferred by the telescope prosthesis to assess its average cost-utility. The incremental value gains and incremental costs of therapy referent to (1) a fellow eye cohort and (2) a fellow eye cohort of those who underwent intra-study cataract surgery were integrated in incremental cost-utility analyses. All value outcomes and costs were discounted at a 3% annual rate, as per the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparative effectiveness was quantified using the (1) quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain and (2) percent human value gain (improvement in quality of life). The QALY gain was integrated with incremental costs into the cost-utility ratio ($/QALY, or US dollars expended per QALY gained). RESULTS: The mean, discounted QALY gain associated with use of the telescope prosthesis over 12 years was 0.7577. When the QALY loss of 0.0004 attributable to the adverse events was factored into the model, the final QALY gain was 0.7573. This resulted in a 12.5% quality of life gain for the average patient during the 12 years of the model. The average cost-utility versus no therapy for use of the telescope prosthesis was $14389/QALY. The incremental cost-utility referent to control fellow eyes was $14063/QALY, whereas the incremental cost-utility referent to fellow eyes that underwent intra-study cataract surgery was $11805/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with the telescope prosthesis considerably improves quality of life and at the same time is cost-effective by conventional standards.
