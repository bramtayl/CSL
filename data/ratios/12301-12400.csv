12301,Cost effectiveness of endosonography versus surgical staging in potentially resectable lung cancer: a health economics analysis of the ASTER trial from a European perspective,"In the ASTER study, mediastinal staging was more accurate for patients randomised to combined endobronchial and endoscopic ultrasound, followed by surgical staging if endoscopy was negative, versus surgical staging alone. Here, we report survival, quality of life and cost effectiveness up to 6 months, for the UK, The Netherlands and Belgium, separately. Survival in the two arms of the study was similar. In all three countries, the endosonography strategy had slightly higher quality-adjusted life years over 6 months, and was cheaper. Therefore, based on clinical accuracy and cost effectiveness, we conclude that mediastinal staging should commence with endosonography.",2014-01-14412,24064440,Thorax,Robert C Rintoul,2014,69 / 7,679-81,No,24064440,"Robert C Rintoul; Matthew J Glover; Christopher Jackson; Victoria Hughes; Kurt G Tournoy; Christophe Dooms; Jouke T Annema; Linda D Sharples; Cost effectiveness of endosonography versus surgical staging in potentially resectable lung cancer: a health economics analysis of the ASTER trial from a European perspective, Thorax, ; 69(7):0040-6376; 679-81",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combined endoscopic and endobronchial ultrasound followed by surgical staging (if no nodal metastases were found at endosonography vs. Surgical staging alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-18666.67,Euro,2011,-29887.69
12302,Recurrent urinary tract infections among women: comparative effectiveness of 5 prevention and management strategies using a Markov chain Monte Carlo model,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem among women. However, comparative effectiveness strategies for managing recurrent UTIs are lacking. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of management of women experiencing >/=3 UTIs per year. We then developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo model of recurrent UTI for each management strategy with >/=2 adequate trials published. We simulated a cohort that experienced 3 UTIs/year and a secondary cohort that experienced 8 UTIs/year. Model outcomes were treatment efficacy, patient and payer cost, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Five strategies had >/=2 clinical trials published: (1) daily antibiotic (nitrofurantoin) prophylaxis; (2) daily estrogen prophylaxis; (3) daily cranberry prophylaxis; (4) acupuncture prophylaxis; and (5) symptomatic self-treatment. In the 3 UTIs/year model, nitrofurantoin prophylaxis was most effective, reducing the UTI rate to 0.4 UTIs/year, and the most expensive to the payer ($821/year). All other strategies resulted in payer cost savings but were less efficacious. Symptomatic self-treatment was the only strategy that resulted in patient cost savings, and was the most favorable strategy in term of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. CONCLUSIONS: Daily antibiotic use is the most effective strategy for recurrent UTI prevention compared to daily cranberry pills, daily estrogen therapy, and acupuncture.

12311,Cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance for non-dysplastic Barrett''s esophagus (BE) is contentious and its cost effectiveness unclear. OBJECTIVE: To perform an economic analysis of endoscopic surveillance strategies. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis by using a simulation Markov model to synthesize evidence from large epidemiologic studies and clinical data for surveillance, based on international guidelines, applied in a coordinator-managed surveillance program. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital, South Australia. PATIENTS: A total of 2040 patient-years of follow-up. INTERVENTION: (1) No surveillance, (2) 2-yearly endoscopic surveillance of patients with non-dysplastic BE and 6-monthly surveillance of patients with low-grade dysplasia, (3) a hypothetical strategy of biomarker-modified surveillance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: U.S. cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ratios. RESULTS: Compared with no surveillance, surveillance produced an estimated incremental cost per QALY ratio of $60,858. This was reduced to $38,307 when surveillance practice was modified by a hypothetical biomarker-based strategy. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the likelihood that surveillance alone was cost-effective compared with no surveillance was 16.0% and 60.6% if a hypothetical biomarker-based strategy was added to surveillance, at an acceptability threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: Treatment options for BE that overlap those for symptomatic GERD were omitted. CONCLUSION: By using best available estimates of the malignant potential of BE, endoscopic surveillance of patients with non-dysplastic BE is unlikely to be cost-effective for the majority of patients and depends heavily on progression rates between dysplasia grades.

12314,Cost-effectiveness of osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis in Singapore,"PURPOSE: To determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis (OOKP) relative to no treatment among patients with end-stage corneal and ocular surface diseases in Singapore. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: From a health system perspective, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of OOKP treatment relative to no treatment over a 30-year horizon, based on data from a cohort of 23 patients who underwent OOKP surgery between 2004 and 2009 at Singapore National Eye Centre. Preoperative and postoperative vision-related quality-of-life values were estimated from patients'' visual outcomes and were used to calculate the gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from OOKP treatment. Unsubsidized costs for surgery, consultations, examinations, medications, follow-up visits, and treatments for complications were retrieved from patients'' bills to estimate the total costs associated with OOKP treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Over a 30-year period, OOKP treatment, compared with no treatment, improved QALYs by 3.991 among patients with end-stage corneal and ocular surface diseases at an additional cost of S$67 840 (US$55 150), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of S$17 000/QALY (US$13 820/QALY).

By combining the behavioral intervention principles used in specialist services with the high reach rates of public health interventions, personal tailored self-help cessation intervention provides a potential economical method for improving reach and effectiveness. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis is performed alongside a randomized controlled trial to compare the computer-tailored self-help intervention with a generic self-help intervention in smoking cessation. A Markov model was developed to extrapolate lifetime cost-effectiveness by combining trial data with estimates from the literature. FINDINGS: In the short term, smokers in the intervention group gained 0.0006 (95% CI = -0.0024 to 0.0036) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) more than those in the control group at an increased cost of about pound9 per person (95% CI = pound5- pound12). This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound14,432/QALY. Precision of the ICER estimates was assessed by 5,000 bootstrapping replications. The probability that the intervention was cost effective was 54% (58%) at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20,000( pound30,000) per QALY. The Markov model showed that simulating lifetime outcomes improved the cost-effectiveness ratio ( pound9,700/QALY) in favor of the tailored intervention. The intervention would have a 55%-57% chance of being more cost effective than nontailored intervention at the willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000-30,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The computer-tailored intervention appears slightly more likely to be cost effective than the generic self-help intervention in smoking cessation, in both the short term and the long term, but caution is required given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the estimates.",2014-01-14447,24084467,Nicotine Tob Res,Qi Wu,2014,16 / 3,270-8,No,24084467,"Qi Wu; Steve Parrott; Christine Godfrey; Hazel Gilbert; Irwin Nazareth; Baptiste Leurent; Stephen Sutton; Richard Morris; Cost-effectiveness of computer-tailored smoking cessation advice in primary care: a randomized trial (ESCAPE), Nicotine Tob Res, ; 16(3):1462-2203; 270-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Computer-tailored self-help intervention in smoking cessation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Generic self-help intervetion in smoking cessation,smokers,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"6 Months, Lifetime",3.50,3.50,14432,United Kingdom,2009,25208.9
12316,Is it worthwhile to conduct a randomized controlled trial of glaucoma screening in the United Kingdom?,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of conducting a glaucoma screening randomized controlled trial in the UK. METHODS: Decision model based economic evaluation and value of information analysis. Model derived from a previous health technology assessment. Model updated in terms of structure and parameter estimates with data from surveys, interviews with members of the public and health care providers and routine sources. RESULTS: On average, across a range of ages of initiating screening (40-60 years), glaucoma prevalence (1-5%), screening uptake (30-100%), and the performance of current case finding, screening was not cost-effective at a pound30,000 threshold per quality adjusted life year (QALY) from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). The societal value of removing all uncertainty around glaucoma screening is pound107 million at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. For informing policy decisions on glaucoma screening, reducing uncertainty surrounding the NHS and personal social care cost of sight impairment ( pound74 million) was of most value, followed by reducing uncertainty in test performance ( pound14 million) and uptake of either screening or current eye care ( pound8 million each). CONCLUSIONS: A glaucoma screening trial in the UK is unlikely to be the best use of research resources.

12320,Cost and quality-adjusted life year differences in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis using once-daily 4 g or twice-daily 2g mesalazine dosing,"BACKGROUND: Improved compliance in active ulcerative colitis (UC) is likely to improve healthcare efficiency by reducing time spent in active mild to moderate UC state. To establish whether once daily (OD) mesalazine offers economic advantages over twice daily (BD) dosing in active UC, we evaluated the outcomes and costs of a recently published randomized study. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model with four week Markov cycles was developed to reflect current treatment practices in the Netherlands with OD and BD mesalazine for active UC. The health service perspective of the Netherlands was reflected in the model and considered a 32week time horizon with 4 weekly Markov cycles. Outcomes evaluated in the model were time spent in active and remission UC and the corresponding health-related quality of life associated with different clinical states. This was then used to derive quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) at each treatment stage. RESULTS: A greater proportion of subjects on 4 g OD achieved remission at weeks 4 and 8 compared with 2g BD. After 32 weeks the average costs per patient with active UC were euro3097 and euro3548 for those treated with OD and BD mesalazine respectively, with an average saving of euro451 per patient treated with OD mesalazine. The average costs per QALY for OD and BD mesalazine were euro5433 and euro6324 for OD and BD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results from a single randomized study, OD dosing resulted in a shorter time spent in active UC which resulted in lower healthcare costs.",2014-01-14462,24094599,J Crohns Colitis,Mark P Connolly,2014,8 / 5,357-62,No,24094599,"Mark P Connolly; Johan P Kuyvenhoven; Maarten J Postma; Sandy K Nielsen; Cost and quality-adjusted life year differences in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis using once-daily 4 g or twice-daily 2g mesalazine dosing, J Crohns Colitis , ; 8(5):1876-4479; 357-62",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mesalazine vs. Mesalazine 2g twice daily in combination with 1g mesalazine enema,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,32 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-45100,Euro,2012,-65372.82
12321,The cost-effectiveness of depression treatment for co-occurring disorders: a clinical trial,"The authors aimed to determine the economic value of providing on-site group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression to clients receiving residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Using a quasi-experimental design and an intention-to-treat analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratio of the intervention were estimated relative to usual care residential treatment. The average cost of a treatment episode was $908, compared to $180 for usual care. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was $131 for each point improvement of the BDI-II and $49 for each additional depression-free day. The incremental cost-utility ratio ranged from $9,249 to $17,834 for each additional quality adjusted life year. Although the intervention costs substantially more than usual care, the cost effectiveness and cost-utility ratios compare favorably to other depression interventions.

METHODS: Patients just starting adjuvant therapy (n = 168) at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, were consecutively included and randomized into three groups: psychosocial support from a specially trained nurse (INS), from a psychologist (IPS), or SC. Psychological effects and healthcare utilization were monitored during a 2-year period. The hospital billing system provided cost estimates. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using health-related quality of life data from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C-30) translated into the Euro Quality of Life- 5-Dimensional classification. On the basis of the medical cost offset, a cost-utility analysis was performed. RESULTS: Health care utilization was mainly related to the breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The intervention costs amounted to about euro500 or 3% of the total costs. Total health care costs, including interventions cost, were lower in the INS (euro18,670) and IPS (euro20,419) groups than in the SC group (euro25,800).

12327,Cost-effectiveness of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery versus phacoemulsification cataract surgery,"PURPOSE: To perform a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (LCS) and conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS) DESIGN: Retrospective CEA using computer-based econometric modeling. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of patients undergoing cataract surgery in the better eye based on a review of the current literature and our direct experience using LCS. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness decision tree model was constructed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of LCS compared with PCS. Complication rates of cataract surgery were obtained from a review of the current literature to complete the cohort of patients and outcomes. This data was incorporated with time trade-off utility values converted from visual acuity outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvements in best-corrected visual acuity obtained from the literature were used to calculate the increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in a hypothetical cohort between 6 months and 1 year after cataract surgery. This was combined with approximate costs in a cost-utility analysis model to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Based on the simulated complication rates of PCS and LCS and assuming resultant visual acuity outcome improvement of 5% in uncomplicated cases of LCS, the cost-effectiveness (dollars spent per QALY) gained from LCS was not cost-effective at $92 862 Australian Dollars. The total QALY gain for LCS over PCS was 0.06 units. Multivariate sensitivity analyses revealed that LCS would need to significantly improve visual outcomes and complications rates over PCS, along with a reduction in cost to patient, to improve cost effectiveness. Modeling a best-case scenario of LCS with excellent visual outcomes (100%), a significant reduction in complications (0%) and a significantly reduced cost to patient (of $300) resulted in an ICER of $20 000. CONCLUSIONS: Laser cataract surgery, irrespective of potential improvements in visual acuity outcomes and complication rates, is not cost effective at its current cost to patient when compared with cost-effectiveness benchmarks and other medical interventions, including PCS. A significant reduction in the cost to patient (via reduced consumable/click cost) would increase the likelihood of LCS being considered cost effective.",2014-01-14505,24120324,Ophthalmology,Robin G Abell,2014,121 / 1,10-6,No,24120324,"Robin G Abell; Brendan J Vote; Cost-effectiveness of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery versus phacoemulsification cataract surgery, Ophthalmology, ; 121(1):0161-6420; 10-6",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laser Cataract Surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Phacoemulsification Cataract surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,92862,Australia,2012,108433.06
12328,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant lapatinib for early-stage breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: It has been shown in the NeoALTTO trial that a neoadjuvant regimen containing paclitaxel, lapatinib and trastuzumab is superior to regimens which include only one of the HER2 antagonists with paclitaxel. In light of these results, we modelled the potential cost-effectiveness of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model with three different health states: disease free, relapse, and death. We assumed an 18-week course of lapatinib was added to the TCH arm of the BCIRG 006 trial. Since no efficacy data are available for combining adjuvant lapatinib with trastuzumab, we ran the model assuming five different hypothetical hazard ratios for disease free survival when lapatinib is added to TCH (TCH was used as the control group). The hazard ratios were 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5. Outcomes are given in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Both costs and QALYs were discounted at the 4% rate. We calculated the cost per QALY from the perspective of the Irish health care system. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity were performed and confidence intervals were bootstrapped. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the five hazard ratios are euro53 089/QALY, euro27 893/QALY, euro18 463/QALY, euro13 527/QALY and euro10 490/QALY, respectively. Using the euro45 000/QALY threshold, an adjuvant lapatinib regimen is cost-effective at the 0.8 hazard ratio. Adjuvant lapatinib becomes cost-effective at the 0.879 hazard ratio where the ICER is euro44 825/QALY. CONCLUSION: In the Irish setting, an adjuvant lapatinib regimen would be considered cost-effective for patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer for four of the five hypothesised hazard ratios. Data from both adjuvant and neoadjuvant trials suggest that the hazard ratio required to achieve cost-effectiveness for adjuvant lapatinib is both possible and plausible.",2014-01-14512,24125103,Acta Oncol,David Candon,2014,53 / 2,201-8,No,24125103,"David Candon; Joan Healy; John Crown; Modelling the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant lapatinib for early-stage breast cancer, Acta Oncol, ; 53(2):0284-186X; 201-8",QALY,Ireland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjuvant Lapatinib vs. Standard/Usual Care- Trastuzumab,HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,27892.76,Euro,2012,40430.78
12329,Novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin therapy at various levels of anticoagulation control in atrial fibrillation--a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The decision as to whether to use more expensive novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or invest resources for quality improvement of warfarin therapy requires input from both clinical and economic analyses. OBJECTIVE: Cost-effectiveness of NOACs compared to warfarin therapy at various levels of patient-time in therapeutic range (TTR) in patients with atrial fibrillation was examined, from the healthcare provider''s perspective. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: A Markov model was used to compare life-long economic and treatment outcomes of warfarin and NOACs in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old atrial fibrillation patients with CHADS2 scores of 2 or above. Model inputs were derived from clinical trials published in the literature. MAIN MEASURES: The outcome measure was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (ICER). KEY RESULTS: Using United States Dollar (USD) 50,000 as the threshold of willingness-to-pay per QALY, NOACs therapy was cost-effective when TTR of warfarin therapy was 60 % or below, or monthly cost of warfarin management increased by two-fold or more to achieve 70 % TTR. Warfarin therapy was cost-effective when TTR of warfarin was 70 % with up to a 1.5-fold increment in monthly cost of care, or when TTR reached 75 % with monthly cost of warfarin care increased up to three-fold. At TTR 60 %, 70 % and 75 %, NOACs was cost-effective when monthly drug cost was < USD 200, < USD 122-185 and < USD 85-145, respectively. 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations showed NOACs to be cost-effective 83.6 %, 50.7 % and 32.7 % of the time at TTR of 60 %, 70 % and 75 %, respectively.

Recently, new oral anticoagulants (NOAs) directly inhibiting thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) demonstrated their non-inferiority with respect to warfarin in reducing the thromboembolic risk. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of NOAs in an Italian setting. METHODS: A Markov decision model including ten health states and death was developed, and a 3-month Markov cycle and lifetime horizon were adopted. Transition probabilities and quality of life were estimated from three randomized trials and from additional reports in the literature. Analysis was performed in the context of the Italian National Health System. First- and second-order sensitivity analyses were made to test the robustness of the results.

12351,"Apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban versus warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a cost-effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) increases the risk of systemic thromboembolic events; therefore, anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists is widely prescribed. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (NOAs) directly inhibiting thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) demonstrated their non-inferiority with respect to warfarin in reducing the thromboembolic risk. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of NOAs in an Italian setting. METHODS: A Markov decision model including ten health states and death was developed, and a 3-month Markov cycle and lifetime horizon were adopted. Transition probabilities and quality of life were estimated from three randomized trials and from additional reports in the literature. Analysis was performed in the context of the Italian National Health System. First- and second-order sensitivity analyses were made to test the robustness of the results. The mean European cost of dabigatran (<euro>2.58/day) was assigned to each NOA. RESULTS: The incremental cost-utility ratio was below <euro>25,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for each NOA and each CHADS2 level, but differences among drugs were found. This result was sensitive to the time in (warfarin) therapeutic range and time horizon.

As ticagrelor and prasugrel are typically considered first-line agents for acute coronary syndrome in Europe, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of universal compared to PRA-driven selection of these agents. A Markov model was used to calculate five-year costs (2013 pound/euro), quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for one-year of universal ticagrelor or prasugrel (given to all) compared to each agents'' corresponding PRA-driven strategy (ticagrelor/prasugrel in those with high platelet reactivity [HPR, >208 on the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay], others given generic clopidogrel). We assumed patients had their index event at 65-70 years of age and had a 42.7% incidence of HPR 24-48 hours post-revascularisation.

12364,Clinical and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy for health anxiety in medical patients: a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Health anxiety has been treated by therapists expert in cognitive behaviour therapy with some specific benefit in some patients referred to psychological services. Those in hospital care have been less often investigated. Following a pilot trial suggesting efficacy we carried out a randomised study in hospital medical clinics. METHODS: We undertook a multicentre, randomised trial on health anxious patients attending cardiac, endocrine, gastroenterological, neurological, and respiratory medicine clinics in secondary care. We included those aged 16-75 years, who satisfied the criteria for excessive health anxiety, and were resident in the area covered by the hospital, were not under investigation for new pathology or too medically unwell to take part. We used a computer-generated random scheme to allocate eligible medical patients to an active treatment group of five-to-ten sessions of adapted cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-HA group) delivered by hospital-based therapists or to standard care in the clinics. The primary outcome was change in health anxiety symptoms measured by the Health Anxiety Inventory at 1 year and the main secondary hypothesis was equivalence of total health and social care costs over 2 years, with an equivalence margin of pound150. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered with controlled-trials.com, ISRCTN14565822. FINDINGS: Of 28,991 patients screened, 444 were randomly assigned to receive either adapted cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-HA group, 219 participants) or standard care (standard care group, 225), with 205 participants in the CBT-HA group and 212 in the standard care group included in the analyses of the primary endpoints. At 1 year, improvement in health anxiety in the patients in the CBT-HA group was 2.98 points greater than in those in the standard care group (95% CI 1.64-4.33, p<0.0001), and twice as many patients receiving cognitive behaviour therapy achieved normal levels of health anxiety compared with those in the control group (13.9% vs 7.3%; odds ratio 2.15, 95% CI 1.09-4.23, p=0.0273). Similar differences were observed at 6 months and 2 years, and there were concomitant reductions in generalised anxiety and, to a lesser extent, depression. Of nine deaths, six were in the control group; all were due to pre-existing illness. Social functioning or health-related quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. Equivalence in total 2-year costs was not achieved, but the difference was not significant (adjusted mean difference pound156, 95% CI -1446 to 1758, p=0.848). INTERPRETATION: This form of adapted cognitive behaviour therapy for health anxiety led to sustained symptomatic benefit over 2 years, with no significant effect on total costs. It deserves wider application in medical care.

12365,REFINE (REducing Falls in In-patieNt Elderly) using bed and bedside chair pressure sensors linked to radio-pagers in acute hospital care: a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: falls in hospitals are a major problem and contribute to substantial healthcare burden. Advances in sensor technology afford innovative approaches to reducing falls in acute hospital care. However, whether these are clinically effective and cost effective in the UK setting has not been evaluated. METHODS: pragmatic, parallel-arm, individual randomised controlled trial of bed and bedside chair pressure sensors using radio-pagers (intervention group) compared with standard care (control group) in elderly patients admitted to acute, general medical wards, in a large UK teaching hospital. Primary outcome measure number of in-patient bedside falls per 1,000 bed days. RESULTS: 1,839 participants were randomised (918 to the intervention group and 921 to the control group). There were 85 bedside falls (65 fallers) in the intervention group, falls rate 8.71 per 1,000 bed days compared with 83 bedside falls (64 fallers) in the control group, falls rate 9.84 per 1,000 bed days (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-1.22; P = 0.51). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to time to first bedside fall (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.95; 95% CI: 0.67-1.34; P= 0.12). The mean cost per patient in the intervention group was pound7199 compared with pound6400 in the control group, mean difference in QALYs per patient, 0.0001 (95% CI: -0.0006-0.0004, P= 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: bed and bedside chair pressure sensors as a single intervention strategy do not reduce in-patient bedside falls, time to first bedside fall and are not cost-effective in elderly patients in acute, general medical wards in the UK.

METHODS: This was a pre- and post-intervention study in ten private hospitals (1,650 beds) in Brazil (from May 2010 to January 2012), enrolling 2,120 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. The program used a multifaceted approach: screening strategies, multidisciplinary educational sessions, case management, and continuous performance assessment. The network administration and an external consultant provided performance feedback and benchmarking within the network. The primary outcome was compliance with the resuscitation bundle. The secondary outcomes were hospital mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The proportion of patients who received all the required items for the resuscitation bundle improved from 13% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8-18%] at baseline to 62% (95% CI 54-69%) in the last trimester (p < 0.001). Hospital mortality decreased from 55% (95% CI 48-62%) to 26% (95% CI 19-32%, p < 0.001). Full compliance with the resuscitation bundle was associated with lower risk of hospital mortality (propensity weighted corrected risk ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.56-0.94, p = 0.02).

12370,Cost-effectiveness of total disc replacement versus multidisciplinary rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain: a Norwegian multicenter RCT,"STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial with 2-year follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of total disc replacement (TDR) versus multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MDR) in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The existing studies on CLBP report cost-effectiveness of fusion surgery versus disc replacement and fusion versus rehabilitation. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of TDR versus MDR. METHODS: Between April 2004 and May 2007, 173 patients with CLBP (>1 yr) were randomized to TDR (n = 86) or MDR (n = 87). Treatment effects (Euro Qol 5D [EQ-5D] and Short Form 6D [SF-6D]) and relevant direct and indirect costs at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment were assessed. Gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) after 2 years was estimated. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The mean QALYs gained (standard deviation) using EQ-5D was 1.29 (0.53) in the TDR group and 0.95 (0.52) in the MDR group, a significant difference of 0.34 (95% confidence interval 0.18-0.50). The mean total cost per patient in the TDR group was &OV0556;87,622 (58,351) compared with &OV0556;74,116 (58,237) in the MDR group, which was not significantly different (95% confidence interval: -4041 to 31,755). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the TDR procedure varied from &OV0556;39,748 using EQ-5D (TDR cost-effective) to &OV0556;128,328 using SF-6D (TDR not cost-effective). The dropout rate was 20% (15% TDR group, 24% MDR group). Five patients moved from the MDR to the TDR group, whereas 9 patients randomized to TDR declined surgery. Using per-protocol analysis instead of intention-to-treat analysis indicated that TDR was not cost-effective, irrespective of the use of EQ-5D or SF-6D. CONCLUSION: In this study, TDR was cost-effective compared with MDR after 2 years when using EQ-5D for assessing QALYs gained and a willingness to pay of &OV0556;74,600 (kr500,000/QALY). TDR was not cost-effective when SF-6D was used; therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution. Longer follow-up is needed to accurately assess the cost-effectiveness of TDR.

12371,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist for the treatment of venous thromboembolism,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is commonly treated with a low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) to prevent recurrence. Administration of enoxaparin + VKA is hampered by complexities of laboratory monitoring and frequent dose adjustments. Rivaroxaban, an orally administered anticoagulant, has been compared with enoxaparin + VKA in the EINSTEIN trials. The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin + VKA as anticoagulation treatment for acute, symptomatic, objectively-confirmed DVT or PE. METHODS: A Markov model was built to evaluate the costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with rivaroxaban compared to enoxaparin + VKA in adult patients treated for acute DVT or PE. All patients entered the model in the ''on-treatment'' state upon commencement of oral rivaroxaban or enoxaparin + VKA for 3, 6, or 12 months. Transition probabilities were obtained from the EINSTEIN trials during treatment and published literature after treatment. A 3-month cycle length, US payer perspective ($2012), 5-year time horizon and a 3% annual discount rate were used. RESULTS: Treatment with rivaroxaban cost $2,448 per-patient less and was associated with 0.0058 more QALYs compared with enoxaparin + VKA, making it a dominant economic strategy. Upon one-way sensitivity analysis, the model''s results were sensitive to the reduction in index VTE hospitalization length-of-stay associated with rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin + VKA. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed rivaroxaban to be cost-effective compared with enoxaparin + VKA approximately 76% of the time. LIMITATIONS: The model did not account for the benefits associated with an oral and minimally invasive administration of rivaroxaban. ''Real-world'' applicability is limited because data from the EINSTEIN trials were used in the model. Also, resource utilization and costs were based on the US healthcare system.

12372,"The cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in combination with best medical therapy, versus best medical therapy alone, in advanced Parkinson's disease","Parkinson''s disease (PD) is a complex progressive movement disorder leading to motor and non-motor symptoms that become increasingly debilitating as the disease advances, considerably reducing quality of life. Advanced treatment options include deep brain stimulation (DBS). While clinical effectiveness of DBS has been demonstrated in a number of randomised controlled trials (RCT), evidence on cost-effectiveness is limited. The cost-effectiveness of DBS combined with BMT, versus BMT alone, was evaluated from a UK payer perspective. Individual patient-level data on the effect of DBS on PD symptom progression from a large 6-month RCT were used to develop a Markov model representing clinical progression and capture treatment effect and costs. A 5-year time horizon was used, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and uncertainty assessed in deterministic sensitivity analyses. Total discounted costs in the DBS and BMT groups over 5 years were pound68,970 and pound48,243, respectively, with QALYs of 2.21 and 1.21, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound20,678 per QALY gained. Utility weights in each health state and costs of on-going medication appear to be the key drivers of uncertainty in the model.

The sustained virological response (SVR) rates, i.e., undetectable HCV RNA levels 24 weeks after the end of treatment, is what differentiate treatments. This analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of TVR combined with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) alfa-2a plus ribavirin (RBV), with Peg-IFN and RBV (PR) alone or with boceprevir (B, BOC) plus Peg-IFN alfa-2b and RBV, in naive patients. METHODS: A Markov cohort model of chronic HCV disease progression reflected the pathway of naive patients initiating anti-HCV therapy. SVR rates were derived from a mixed-treatment comparison including results from Phase II and III trials of TVR and BOC, and trials comparing both PR regimens. SVR has significant impact on survival, quality-of-life, and costs.

Utilizing DAC published data, the objective of this study is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of antiplatelet interventions aimed at preventing loss of primary AVG patency in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis, using a decision analysis tree model with a 12-month time horizon and a third party payer perspective. Interventions included DASA with and without concurrent aspirin, aspirin alone, and no prophylaxis. The modeled population was defined as adult (>/= 18 years of age) end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who had undergone placement of a new AVG in the United States. The outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefit. Probabilities were based upon published studies performed by the DAC Study Group while costs of medications and procedures were drawn from public sources. Utilities of health states were derived from published reports and the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) instrument. RESULTS: Aspirin alone is the most cost effective strategy for AVG pharmacologic prophylaxis, as compared to no prophylaxis or DASA with or without concurrent aspirin. The results are robust on multiple scenario analyses using both deterministic and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Accounting for both costs and QALY, using aspirin alone to prevent AVG thrombosis can potentially reduce healthcare costs by $24,679,412 per year compared to no aspirin use, at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/ QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin monotherapy compared favorably to other strategies based on cost per QALY. Our findings support the use of aspirin prophylaxis in HD patients with a new AVG who do not have a contraindication to aspirin.",2014-01-14576,24161074,Clin Nephrol,Robert Nee,2014,81 / 1,38-51,No,24161074,"Robert Nee; Austin L Parker; Dustin J Little; Christina M Yuan; Jonathan Himmelfarb; Stephen R Lowe; Kevin C Abbott; Cost-effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy to prolong primary patency of hemodialysis graft, Clin Nephrol, ; 81(1):0301-0430; 38-51",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Extended-release dipyridamole plus Aggrenox vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,558674,United States,2012,629768.1
12382,Pharmacogenetic-guided selection of warfarin versus novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical and economic outcomes of two anticoagulation therapy strategies, (i) pharmacogenetic-guided selection (PG-AC) of warfarin versus novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), and (ii) usual anticoagulation care (usual AC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), from the perspective of US healthcare payers. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate long-term outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients with newly diagnosed AF: (i) all usual AC patients received warfarin therapy, and (ii) all PG-AC patients were genotyped. Patients with normal warfarin sensitivity genotypes would receive warfarin. Patients with high or low warfarin sensitivity genotypes would receive NOAC. Model inputs were derived from clinical trials published in the literature. The outcome measure was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (ICER). RESULTS: PG-AC gained higher QALYs with higher cost (9.912 QALYs and USD94 396) when compared with usual AC (9.721 QALYs and USD93 853) in base-case analysis. The ICER of PG-AC was 2843 USD/QALY. The ICER of PG-AC would exceed 50 000 USD/QALY if the monthly cost of NOAC was more than USD285 or the risk of stroke with NOAC versus warfarin was more than 0.93. In 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations, PG-AC was cost-effective 96.4% of the time and usual AC was cost-effective 3.6% of the time. PG-AC was more costly than usual AC with a mean cost difference of USD1927 (95% confidence interval 1.877-1.977, P<0.001), and gained higher QALYs by 0.209 (95% confidence interval 0.208-0.210, P<0.001).

Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the nonavalent is required for timely policy-decisions. We compared the potential cost-effectiveness of the nonavalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. We used a multi-type individual-based transmission-dynamic model of HPV infection and diseases, 70-year time-horizon, 3% discount rate and healthcare payer perspective. We calibrated the model to Canadian sexual behavior and epidemiologic data, and estimated Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) lost and costs ($CAN 2010) from the literature.

12385,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cochlear dose reduction by proton beam therapy for medulloblastoma in childhood,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy with cochlear dose reduction compared with conventional X-ray radiotherapy for medulloblastoma in childhood. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to describe health states of 6-year-old children with medulloblastoma after treatment with proton or X-ray radiotherapy. The risks of hearing loss were calculated on cochlear dose for each treatment. Three types of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of EQ-5D, HUI3 and SF-6D were used for estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for proton beam therapy compared with X-ray radiotherapy was calculated for each HRQOL. Sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in these parameters. RESULTS: The ICER for EQ-5D, HUI3 and SF-6D were $21 716/QALY, $11 773/QALY, and $20 150/QALY, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses found that the results were sensitive to discount rate, the risk of hearing loss after proton therapy, and costs of proton irradiation.

Studies have reported that mesh prophylaxis reduces PSH, but there are no cost-effectiveness data. Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of mesh prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis to prevent PSH in patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy for rectal cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Using a cohort Markov model, we modeled the costs and effectiveness of mesh prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis at the index operation in a cohort of 60-year-old patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer during a time horizon of 5 years.

12390,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of finding cases of hepatitis C infection in UK migrant populations and the value of further research,"Hepatitis C (HCV) infection can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer and death in the absence of treatment. Many people living in the UK but born overseas are believed to be infected with HCV although many are unlikely to know they are infected. The aim of this study is to assess the potential for a case-finding approach to be cost-effective and to estimate the value of further research. An economic evaluation and value of information analysis was undertaken by developing a model of HCV disease progression and by populating it with evidence from the published literature. They were performed from a UK National Health Services cost perspective, and outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The comparator intervention was defined as the background rate of testing (i.e. no intervention). The base case results generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of about pound23,200 per additional QALY. However, the ICER was shown to be particularly sensitive to HCV seroprevalence, the intervention effect / cost and the probability of treatment uptake. The value of information analysis suggested that approximately pound4 million should be spent on further research. This evaluation demonstrates that testing UK migrants for HCV could be cost-effective.

However, limited evidence exists for its cost-effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to capecitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, using data from the prospective economic evaluation conducted alongside the MAX trial. METHODS: Individual patient level data on resource use and progression free survival were prospectively collected in the phase III MAX trial. Resource use data were collected for the period between randomisation and disease progression, and unit costs were assigned from the perspective of the Australian health care funder. Effectiveness was measured in quality adjusted progression free survival years, with utility scores obtained from both the community valued EQ-5D questionnaire and the patient valued UBQ-C questionnaire. Progression free survival was used as a secondary effectiveness measure. RESULTS: The addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine monotherapy cost approximately $192,156 (95% confidence interval [CI], $135,619 to $326,894) per quality adjusted progression free survival year gained when using publicly listed pharmaceutical prices and utility values from the EQ-5D questionnaire. This decreased to $149,455 (95% CI, $100,356 to $245,910) when values from the UBQ-C questionnaire were applied. The incremental cost per progression free survival year was $145,059 (95% CI, $106,703 to $233,225).

12393,Cost-effectiveness analysis of varicella vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis in Hong Kong,"OBJECTIVES: The varicella vaccine is an effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for chickenpox. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of PEP using varicella vaccine for pediatric patients from the perspective of the public healthcare provider in Hong Kong. METHODS: A decision tree was designed to compare cost and clinical outcomes of PEP with varicella vaccine versus no PEP in pediatric patients (aged 1-18 y) susceptible to chickenpox with household exposure. Two tiers of outcome were simulated: (1) total direct medical cost per subject exposed, and (2) the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss associated with chickenpox per subject exposed. Model inputs were retrieved from local epidemiology and the medical literature. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all parameters to test the robustness of model results. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed PEP with varicella vaccine to be less costly (expected cost USD 320 vs USD 731) with lower QALY loss (0.00423 QALY vs 0.01122 QALY) when compared to no PEP. The sensitivity analysis showed that PEP with varicella vaccine was less costly if PEP effectiveness was > 6.2% or the chickenpox infection rate without PEP was > 8.6%. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, PEP with vaccine was cost-effective over 99% of the time, with a mean cost saving of USD 611 per patient (95% confidence interval USD 602-620; p < 0.001) and lower mean QALY loss of 0.00809 QALY (95% confidence interval 0.00802-0.00816 QALY; p < 0.001).

12394,Denosumab: a cost-effective alternative for older men with osteoporosis from a Swedish payer perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of denosumab versus other treatments in men with osteoporosis who are >/=75years old from a payer perspective in Sweden. METHODS: A lifetime cohort Markov model was developed with seven health states: well, hip fracture, vertebral fracture, other osteoporotic fracture, post-hip fracture, post-vertebral fracture, and dead. During each cycle, patients could have a fracture, remain healthy, remain in a post-fracture state or die. Background fracture risks, mortality rates, persistence rates, utilities, medical and drug costs were derived using published sources. Estimates of fracture efficacy were drawn from available studies in post-menopausal osteoporotic (PMO) women as BMD improvements have been shown to be similar across male osteoporosis (MOP) and PMO populations, and a recent clinical trial suggested that the fracture risk reduction from bisphosphonate therapy in men is similar to that seen in women in comparable studies. Lifetime expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for denosumab, generic alendronate, generic risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronate, strontium ranelate and teriparatide. On average, patients in the model were 78years old, with bone mineral density T-score at the femoral neck of -2.12. Prevalent vertebral fractures were present in 23% of patients. In the base-case, the model assumed that patients would experience treatment-related effects up to 2years after discontinuation. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Total lifetime costs for denosumab, alendronate, strontium ranelate, zoledronate, risedronate, ibandronate and teriparatide were euro31,004, euro33,731, euro34,788, euro34,796, euro34,826, euro35,983 and euro37,461, respectively. Total QALYs were 5.23, 5.15, 5.15, 5.17, 5.13, 5.12 and 5.22, respectively. Compared to other treatments, denosumab had the lowest costs and highest QALYs. In the one-way sensitivity analyses, when compared to alendronate (next least expensive strategy), the ICER for denosumab was most sensitive to the relative risk of hip fracture on denosumab. The probability of denosumab being cost-effective compared to the other treatments at a threshold of euro66,000/QALY was 96.1%.

12400,Economic evaluation of frequent home nocturnal hemodialysis based on a randomized controlled trial,"Provider and patient enthusiasm for frequent home nocturnal hemodialysis (FHNHD) has been renewed; however, the cost-effectiveness of this technique is unknown. We performed a cost-utility analysis of FHNHD compared with conventional hemodialysis (CvHD; 4 hours three times per week) from a health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon using patient information from the Alberta NHD randomized controlled trial. Costs, including training costs, were obtained using microcosting and administrative data (CAN$2012). We determined the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Robustness was assessed using scenario, sensitivity, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Compared with CvHD (61% in-center, 14% satellite, and 25% home dialysis), FHNHD led to incremental cost savings (-$6700) and an additional 0.38 QALYs. In sensitivity analyses, when the annual probability of technique failure with FHNHD increased from 7.6% (reference case) to >/=19%, FHNHD became unattractive (>$75,000/QALY). The cost/QALY gained became $13,000 if average training time for FHNHD increased from 3.7 to 6 weeks. In scenarios with alternate comparator modalities, FHNHD remained dominant compared with in-center CvHD; cost/QALYs gained were $18,500, $198,000, and $423,000 compared with satellite CvHD, home CvHD, and peritoneal dialysis, respectively. In summary, FHNHD is attractive compared with in-center CvHD in this cohort. However, the attractiveness of FHNHD varies by technique failure rate, training time, and dialysis modalities from which patients are drawn, and these variables should be considered when establishing FHNHD programs.",2014-01-14683,24231665,J Am Soc Nephrol,Scott Klarenbach,2014,25 / 3,587-94,No,24231665,"Scott Klarenbach; Marcello Tonelli; Robert Pauly; Michael Walsh; Bruce Culleton; Helen So; Brenda Hemmelgarn; Braden Manns; Economic evaluation of frequent home nocturnal hemodialysis based on a randomized controlled trial, J Am Soc Nephrol, ; 25(3):1046-6673; 587-94",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Frequent home nocturnal hemodialysis vs. conventional hemodialysis (CvHD), whereby dialysis occurs for four hours, three times per week intermittently in an in-center dialysis unit",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-17364.58,Canada,2012,-19578.82
