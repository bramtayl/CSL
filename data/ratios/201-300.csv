201,Optimal management strategies for HIV-infected patients who present with cough or dyspnea: a cost-effective analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and costs of alternative management strategies for patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who present with pulmonary symptoms. DESIGN: Decision analysis comparing initial testing (arterial blood gas analysis, induced sputum analysis, or bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage) with empiric antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or erythromycin). Subsequent steps in management are detailed based on the results of initial management. Patients were stratified by initial CD4 lymphocyte count (less than 200/mm3, 200-500/mm3, or greater than 500/mm3) and results of chest radiography. SETTING: Hypothetical. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The estimated levels of effectiveness among strategies were relatively similar, but costs varied markedly. If potentially reasonable strategies are defined as those that have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), the recommended strategies would be: for patients at highest risk for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), with a probability of PCP above 30% (CD4 less than 200/mm3 and abnormal chest radiograph or prior history of PCP), begin with induced sputum analysis ($34,174/QALY); for intermediate-risk patients, with a probability of PCP between 6% and 30% (CD4 less than 200/mm3, regardless of chest radiograph; or CD4 200-500/mm3, regardless of chest radiograph findings), begin with arterial blood gas analysis ($4,593 to $8,310/QALY); for low-risk patients, with a probability of PCP below 6% (CD4 greater than 500/mm3, regardless of chest radiograph findings), begin with one week of erythromycin, followed by induced sputum examination if symptoms persist ($675 to $3,306/QALY). For highest-risk patients, if empiric trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was considered entirely to be outpatient therapy, it was preferred management if the probability of PCP was above 38%.

Acceptance of such a broad recommendation has been controversial due to the relatively good prognosis of these women and the lack of evidence of an improvement from chemotherapy in overall survival. We studied the question with a decision analytic model, which simulates a clinical trial of a large number of women over several decades, to calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy and the cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy in 45-year-old and 60-year-old women. The model considered a variety of scenarios about the long-term benefits of chemotherapy. The initial analysis found a lifetime benefit of 4 to 5 quality months (range, 2 to 14 months) at a cost of $15,400 to $18,800 per quality year (range, $5,100 to $56,800). If a risk-stratification protocol could identify a low-risk group, then benefit drops to about 1 quality month at a cost of $65,000 to $90,000 per year.

208,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of autologous bone marrow transplantation in metastatic breast cancer. Estimates using decision analysis while awaiting clinical trial results,"OBJECTIVE--To assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of standard chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in metastatic breast cancer. DESIGN--Decision analysis model using a Markov process. SETTING--Response and recurrence rates from the published literature for standard therapy and from case series of ABMT. Costs were based on local charges and on adjusted Medicare data. PATIENTS--Hypothetical cohorts of women with metastatic breast cancer who had no bone marrow involvement and no comorbid illness. INTERVENTION--The standard chemotherapy cohort received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil. The ABMT cohort was treated with intense induction chemotherapy, then additional high-dose chemotherapy following a remission, with ABMT support. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anticipated survival, incremental cost per year of life, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted year of life gained using a 5-year time horizon. Rigorous sensitivity analyses were done, including assessing a benefit ""tail"" of normal life expectancy for those free of disease after 5 years. RESULTS--ABMT was the preferred approach under almost all assumptions, but the size of the benefit varied greatly. ABMT had a survival benefit of 6.0 months at 5 years at an incremental cost of $115,800 per year of life saved. If patients who were free of disease after 5 years had normal survival, the benefit was 18.1 months at an incremental cost of $28,600 per year. The benefit of ABMT was primarily dependent on whether the recurrence risk was constant or decreases after a finite period of time. CONCLUSION--Using reasonable assumptions, ABMT provided a substantial benefit but at a cost that may be untenable.

210,Cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis--a randomized study of intravenous rt-PA in suspected myocardial infarction,"The aim of this randomized placebo-controlled study is to ascertain the costs of intravenous thrombolytic therapy (rt-PA) in the first year after suspected myocardial infarction and to measure the treatment effect on quality of life. The main findings are that the direct costs (including all health care expenditure), on average were 9880 SEK higher in the rt-PA group (N = 153) than in the placebo group (N = 160). At the same time the indirect costs were 4200 SEK lower in the rt-PA group. The total cost of the first year after suspected myocardial infarction were on average 5680 SEK higher in the rt-PA group. The treatment gain in mean life expectancy calculated with a yearly mortality rate of 6% from the end of follow up was 1.25 years. Quality of life was measured using the Nottingham Health Profile and was classified according to NYHAs functional classification. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) results show that the rt-PA patients had a slightly higher (worse) score in all dimensions after one month with the exception of sleep. After 12 months the differences no longer exist and the rt-PA patients had even lower (better) scores in the sleep and energy dimensions. The calculated cost-effectiveness ratio varies from 3090 to 5970 SEK per life year saved and the calculated cost-utility ratio varies from 3260 SEK to 6310 SEK per QALY gained.

212,Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus open cholecystectomy,"To assess the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus open cholecystectomy from the payer's perspective, we estimated the probabilities of potential outcomes of each procedure, associated quality-of-life effects, and related direct medical charges and incorporated these estimates into a computerized simulation model. The model projects that laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be more effective than open surgery in terms of total mortality and quality-adjusted survival, for both sexes and all ages. Projected 5-year cumulative charges are lower for laparoscopic cholecystectomy than for open cholecystectomy ($5,354 versus $5,525 for 45-year-old women; $6,036 versus $6,830 for 45-year-old men), and the differences increase substantially with increasing age.

213,The cost-effectiveness of preoperative autologous blood donation for total hip and knee replacement,"Although the frequency of preoperative autologous blood donation is increasing dramatically, the economic implications of its use remain largely unexplored. Decision analysis was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of autologous blood donation for hip and knee replacement. Cost-effectiveness, expressed as cost per quality-adjusted year of life saved, was based on observed red cell use in 629 patients undergoing surgery at two tertiary-care centers. Autologous blood donation for bilateral and revision joint replacement cost $40,000 per quality-adjusted year of life saved at Center 1 and $241,000 at Center 2. Autologous blood donation for primary unilateral hip replacement cost $373,000 per quality-adjusted year of life saved at Center 1 and $740,000 at Center 2. Autologous blood donation was least cost-effective for primary unilateral knee replacement ($1,147,000/quality-adjusted year of life saved at Center 1 and $1,467,000/year at Center 2). Differences between autologous blood collections and transfusion requirements explained variations among procedures in the cost-effectiveness of autologous blood donation.

A cost-effectiveness analysis examining total and active life-expectancy outcomes,"PURPOSE: This study determines the survival benefit and cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly women with breast cancer. In addition, the analysis measures the impact of substituting active life expectancy for survival in the clinical decision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two cohorts of women with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, stage I breast cancer from age 60 to 80 years were monitored using a Markov process. One group received standard chemotherapy following primary therapy, and the other had no postoperative treatment. Data were derived from recently published clinical trials and a major meta-analysis. Outcome included the average survival, active life-expectancy, and incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year (cost/QALY). RESULTS: Adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs survival in older women, but to a lesser extent compared with younger women. The average gain in quality-adjusted months was 1.8 months in a 75-year-old cohort at a cost/QALY of $4,400. These small benefits were not substantially altered when univariate changes were made in toxicity, recurrence risk, or effectiveness of chemotherapy. When active life expectancy replaced survival as an end point, the benefit for 75-year-old women decreased to 2 weeks at a cost of more than $96,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: There is a small survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients. The cost of this benefit is high, but within the range of commonly reimbursed procedures until a point between 75 and 80 years old.

224,Effect of laboratory variation in the prothrombin-time ratio on the results of oral anticoagulant therapy,"BACKGROUND. Patients receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy may be subject to unnecessary risks of bleeding or thromboembolism because of variability in the commercial thromboplastins used to determine prothrombin time and consequent uncertainty about the actual intensity of anticoagulation. METHODS. We explored the effect of this uncertainty on the benefits and risks of anticoagulation in patients with prosthetic heart valves, using models of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications as a function of the intensity of anticoagulation, with quality-adjusted life expectancy and average variable costs used to describe outcomes. RESULTS. Anticoagulation provides a striking benefit for patients whose treatment is conducted within the recommended range of the international normalized ratio (INR)--i.e., 2.5 to 3.5--but if uncertainty about the laboratory results causes the intensity of anticoagulation to fall outside this range, the gain becomes smaller. Uncertainty about the true intensity of anticoagulation may reduce the potential gain in life expectancy, adjusted for quality of life, by more than half and may increase the ratio of costs to effectiveness to almost five times the optimal value. Variability in the intensity of anticoagulation is even greater if older recommendations advocating a higher level of anticoagulation are followed. CONCLUSIONS. Uncertainty about the sensitivities of the commercially available thromboplastins used in the United States can have important clinical and economic effects. This problem could be eliminated if clinical laboratories uniformly reported the intensity of anticoagulation as the INR, by adjusting prothrombin-time ratios for variability in thromboplastins.",1993-01-01782,8135917,N Engl J Med,M H Eckman,1993,329 / 10,696-702,No,8135917,"M H Eckman; H J Levine; S G Pauker; Effect of laboratory variation in the prothrombin-time ratio on the results of oral anticoagulant therapy, N Engl J Med, 1993-Sep-02; 329(10):1533-4406; 696-702",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Anticoagulation therapy with target International Normalized Ratio of 2.5-3.5 vs. no anticoagulation therapy,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,650,United States,1992,1199.05

226,Assessing the cost effectiveness of adjuvant therapies in early breast cancer using a decision analysis model,"BACKGROUND: We have developed a decision analysis model that uses the results of available randomized controlled trials to model the natural history of early breast cancer and assess the potential clinical and financial effects of using adjuvant therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The original model was used to assess the impact of chemotherapy in hypothetical groups of 45-year-old and 60-year-old node-negative, estrogen receptor-negative women. Using the 1992 Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group report, we have expanded and revised the model to assess: 1) the role of tamoxifen alone, chemotherapy alone, or combined therapy in pre-menopausal women, and 2) chemotherapy in elderly women with node-negative, estrogen receptor-negative cancer. RESULTS: For pre-menopausal women, we found that chemotherapy increases quality adjusted life expectancy and survival by a substantial amount at a cost less than most accepted medical interventions. Combined therapy is beneficial and cost-effective in estrogen receptor-positive cancer. For the elderly, chemotherapy prolongs survival but to a lesser extent compared to younger women. The cost of this benefit is high but within the range of commonly reimbursed procedures for women under age 75 without other co-existing conditions. CONCLUSIONS: For most patients some form of adjuvant therapy is beneficial and cost-effective. The model builds upon the data derived from collaborative efforts assessing the effectiveness of adjuvant therapies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The original model was used to assess the impact of chemotherapy in hypothetical groups of 45-year-old and 60-year-old node-negative, estrogen receptor-negative women. Using the 1992 Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group report, we have expanded and revised the model to assess: 1) the role of tamoxifen alone, chemotherapy alone, or combined therapy in pre-menopausal women, and 2) chemotherapy in elderly women with node-negative, estrogen receptor-negative cancer. RESULTS: For pre-menopausal women, we found that chemotherapy increases quality adjusted life expectancy and survival by a substantial amount at a cost less than most accepted medical interventions. Combined therapy is beneficial and cost-effective in estrogen receptor-positive cancer. For the elderly, chemotherapy prolongs survival but to a lesser extent compared to younger women. The cost of this benefit is high but within the range of commonly reimbursed procedures for women under age 75 without other co-existing conditions. CONCLUSIONS: For most patients some form of adjuvant therapy is beneficial and cost-effective. The model builds upon the data derived from collaborative efforts assessing the effectiveness of adjuvant therapies.

228,Cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation compared with other strategies in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,"BACKGROUND. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome fall into four risk groups: those with (1) prior cardiac arrest, (2) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (PSVT/AF) with hemodynamic compromise, (3) PSVT/AF without hemodynamic compromise, and (4) no symptoms. METHODS AND RESULTS. For each group, we developed a cost-effectiveness analysis examining five clinical management strategies: (1) observation, (2) observation until a cardiac arrest dictates the need for therapy, (3) initial drug therapy guided by noninvasive monitoring, (4) initial radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and (5) initial surgical ablation. We used a Markov simulation model to estimate life expectancy and costs for patients whose ages are between 20 and 60 years. The model includes the risks of cardiac arrest, PSVT/AF, drug side effects, procedure-related complications and mortality, the efficacy of drugs and RFA, and costs. Based on literature and expert opinion, we assumed that the annual risks of cardiac arrest are 0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.5%, respectively, in patients who are asymptomatic, who had PSVT/AF without hemodynamic compromise, or who had PSVT/AF with hemodynamic compromise. We also assumed that RFA has an overall efficacy of 92% in preventing cardiac arrest and arrhythmias. Our model predicts that RFA should yield a life expectancy greater than or equal to other strategies. In cardiac arrest survivors and patients who have had PSVT/AF with hemodynamic compromise, our model suggests that RFA should both prolong survival and save resources. For patients with PSVT/AF without hemodynamic compromise, the marginal cost-effectiveness of attempted RFA (followed by conservative treatment if the RFA fails) ranges from $6600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for 20-year-old patients to $19,000 per QALY gained for 60-year-old patients. For asymptomatic patients, RFA costs from $174,000 per QALY gained for 20-year-old patients to $540,000 per QALY gained for 60-year-old patients. CONCLUSIONS.

233,Cost-effectiveness of screening and cryotherapy for threshold retinopathy of prematurity,"BACKGROUND. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the leading cause of blindness among premature infants. A recent National Eye Institute-sponsored prospective, multicenter trial investigating the use of cryotherapy for treatment of ROP demonstrates a significant reduction in blindness and low vision for patients with sight-threatening (stage 3+) ROP. METHOD. A microsimulation model is presented to determine the cost-effectiveness of cryotherapy for ROP. Simulations are performed for three subpopulations of premature infants with birth weights 500 through 749 g, 750 through 999 g, and 1000 through 1249 g, and for three screening strategies--weekly, biweekly, and monthly. RESULTS. Appropriately timed screening for and treatment of ROP is predicted to result in a gain of 3899 to 4648 quality-adjusted-life-years and a net governmental budgetary savings of $38.3 to $64.9 million for each annual US birth cohort of 28,321 premature infants (500 through 1249 g). The cost per quality-adjusted-life-year gained is $2488 to $6045, depending on different screening strategies. CONCLUSIONS.

239,The cost of improving the outcome for infants of birthweight 500-999 g in Victoria. The Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group,"The aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of neonatal intensive care for extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants born in the state of Victoria. Two distinct eras (1979-80 and 1985-87) were compared. Follow-up data at 2 years of age were available for all 89 survivors from the 351 live births in 1979-80, and for 211 of 212 survivors from the 560 live births in 1985-87. The overall cost-effectiveness for ELBW infants during 1985-87 compared with 1979-80 was $104,990 ($A 1987) per additional survivor, or $5390 ($A 1987) per additional life year gained. Cost-effectiveness improved with increasing birthweight. If the quality of life of the survivors was considered, the economic outlook was more favourable. The cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was $5090 ($A 1987), approximately one-tenth of that obtained from the only previous full economic evaluation of neonatal intensive care.

240,Economic evaluation of cardiac rehabilitation soon after acute myocardial infarction,"Although there are extensive clinical evaluations of cardiac rehabilitation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), no full economic evaluation is available. Patients with AMI and mild to moderate anxiety or depression, or both, while still in hospital were randomized to either an 8-week rehabilitation intervention (n = 99) or usual care (n = 102). Comprehensive costs and health-related quality of life, measured with the time trade-off preference score, were obtained in a 12-month trial, and together with survival data derived from published meta-analyses, cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of early cardiac rehabilitation were estimated. The best estimate of the incremental net direct 12-month costs for patients randomized to rehabilitation was $480 (United States, 1991)/patient. During 1-year follow-up, rehabilitation patients had fewer ""other rehabilitation visits"" (p < 0.0001) and gained 0.052 quality-adjusted life-year more than did the group with usual care. The cost-utility ratio was $9,200/quality-adjusted life-year gained with cardiac rehabilitation during the year of follow-up. This economic evaluation of cardiac rehabilitation does not consider the important distinctions between affordability and worth of alternative health-care services.

241,"Cesarean delivery for women presenting with genital herpes lesions. Efficacy, risks, and costs","OBJECTIVE--To assess the effect of cesarean delivery on neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality and their associated costs for two populations of women presenting with genital herpes lesions at delivery: those with and those without a history of genital herpes. DATA SOURCES--MEDLINE (search for herpes simplex virus and neonatal, cesarean, and mortality) and recognized experts. DATA EXTRACTION--The quality of the overall data used for baseline values was graded using a predetermined scale. RESULTS--The practice of cesarean delivery for women with a history of genital herpes lesions that recur at delivery results in more than 1580 excess cesarean deliveries performed for every poor neonatal outcome prevented, a cost per neonatal herpes case averted of $2.5 million and a cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of $203,000. For these women, lowering the efficacy of cesarean delivery or the herpes simplex virus vertical transmission rate could result in maternal deaths outnumbering neonatal deaths prevented. In contrast, cesarean delivery for women with no history of genital herpes simplex virus who have lesions at delivery has low maternal costs per neonatal benefit and saves money. CONCLUSIONS--Women who present with their first clinical episode of genital herpes at delivery should have a cesarean section performed.

243,Management and prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with cancer-related hypercoagulable states: a risky business,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal strategy for managing and preventing thromboembolic events in malignancy-associated hypercoagulable states. DESIGN: A Markov-based decision and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. The authors explicitly considered consequences of embolic and bleeding events, filter complications, and cancer-related excess mortality. Data were drawn from the current literature. The main outcome measure for each strategy was the quality-adjusted life expectancy and the total average variable costs. SUBJECTS: Patients with advanced malignancies prone to develop thromboembolic events, patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and patients who have survived a first episode of pulmonary embolism (PE). INTERVENTIONS: The authors considered three different interventions: 1) OBSERVATION, in which neither anticoagulant therapy nor filter placement is pursued, 2) ANTICOAGULATION, in which long-term anticoagulant therapy is started immediately, and 3) VENA CAVAL FILTER. MAIN RESULTS: Vena caval filter was the preferred strategy for every malignancy studied, yielding an 11% gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy, compared with observation, for patients with acute DVT, and an 18% gain for patients having survived a PE. Anticoagulant therapy yielded gains of 9% and 16%, respectively. Compared with anticoagulant therapy, filter was less costly due to the avoidance of additional expenses incurred by bleeding events. Prophylactic therapy was the least effective of the three strategies examined. CONCLUSIONS: Vena caval filter placement and long-term anticoagulation therapy yield similar outcomes in the setting of cancer-related hypercoagulable states.

247,A cost-utility approach to the use of 5-fluorouracil and levamisole as adjuvant chemotherapy for Dukes' C colonic carcinoma,"OBJECTIVE: To perform an economic evaluation of the joint use of 5-fluorouracil and levamisole as adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with fully resected Dukes' Stage C carcinoma of the colon, compared with resection and no chemotherapy. The evaluation was prompted by a study (N Engl J Med 1990; 322: 352-358) which recommended a new treatment standard for colon cancer: a 52-week course of fluorouracil, with levamisole every second week, as adjuvant chemotherapy. This recommendation raised several concerns, particularly about the quality of life of patients undergoing such a long course of chemotherapy and the costs to the health care system. METHODS: The cost of the surgery plus chemotherapy was estimated and compared with the cost of surgery alone. Descriptions of quality of life were developed from interviews with patients and health professionals, and the time trade off technique was then used to derive utility weights from a small sample (16) which were used to adjust length of life to reflect quality, in terms of a ""quality adjusted life year"" (QALY). RESULTS: Chemotherapy increases the total cost of treating a patient with colon cancer by $7000, from $6000 to $13,000. Incorporating quality of life reduced the extra benefit gained from the chemotherapy from 2.4 life years to 0.4 QALYs. Thus the result is a cost of $17,500 to achieve an extra QALY from this particular treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis are only tentative, as the quality of life descriptions were not measured over time but from a cross-sectional survey of patients, and the valuations of health states were derived from a small sample. However, we believe them to be indicative, and conclude that it is perhaps more appropriate for the use of chemotherapy to be an option rather than standard treatment until further research on these aspects is complete.",1993-01-01791,8474372,Med J Aust,R D Smith,1993,158 / 5,319-22,No,8474372,"R D Smith; J Hall; H Gurney; P R Harnett; A cost-utility approach to the use of 5-fluorouracil and levamisole as adjuvant chemotherapy for Dukes' C colonic carcinoma, Med J Aust, 1993-Mar-01; 158(5):0025-729X; 319-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy vs. Surgery alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,Not Stated,17500,Australia,1990,27053.37
248,The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of adjuvant therapy of early breast cancer in premenopausal women,"PURPOSE AND METHODS: We used decision analysis to model the natural history of breast cancer in hypothetical cohorts of 45-year-old women receiving tamoxifen, chemotherapy, or combined therapy. We used recurrence and efficacy data from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), utility values from focus groups, and costs from clinic charges and Medicare data. RESULTS: Tamoxifen alone provides minimal benefit in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-; 0.2 to 0.4 months) and modest benefit in receptor-positive (ER+; 3.5 to 5.2 months) cancer. Chemotherapy adds substantial benefit independent of receptor status (4.9 to 10.7 quality-adjusted months). In ER+ cancer, combined therapy adds an additional benefit (1.2 to 2.1 months) compared with chemotherapy alone. The incremental costs (United States dollars) necessary to add an additional year of life to the average woman ranged from $4,300 to $11,400 for tamoxifen alone for ER+ cancer, $4,900 to $11,400 for chemotherapy alone, and $14,800 to $33,100 for combined therapy. CONCLUSION: In premenopausal early-stage breast cancer, chemotherapy adds substantial clinical benefit at a modest cost. Tamoxifen alone adds meaningful benefit only in ER+ cancer.

260,Age thresholds for prophylactic replacement of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave heart valves. A clinical and economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND. Björk-Shiley convexo-concave heart valves have an increased risk of mechanical failure. One might consider prophylactic rereplacement as a preventive measure to avert the disastrous consequences of these failures. We investigated the effect that prophylactic rereplacement has on survival of individual patients and on the medical costs. METHODS AND RESULTS. Quantitative estimates for the surgical risks of prophylactic replacement of Björk-Shiley valves, long-term survival, and the risk of outlet strut fracture were derived insofar as possible from a detailed analysis of a follow-up study conducted in The Netherlands, including 2303 patients with a mean follow-up of 6.6 years. On the basis of these estimates, we calculated life expectancy with and without prophylactic replacement. For the various valve types, age thresholds were determined below which rereplacement prolongs (discounted quality-adjusted) life expectancy. We also calculated the cost per year of life gained as a function of age. The age thresholds below which prophylactic rereplacement increases life expectancy (expressed in simple future years of life) for male patients without comorbidity, if the surgical mortality after rereplacement is equivalent to that of primary replacement, are 27, 48, 51, and 65 years for small and large 60 degrees and for small and large 70 degrees mitral valves, respectively. For aortic valves, these age thresholds lie somewhat higher: 39, 52, 56, and 76 years, respectively. Repeat analyses indicated that for women, all age thresholds lie about 1 or 2 years higher. These age thresholds decrease considerably if the surgical mortality after rereplacement is considered to be higher after prophylactic rereplacement than after primary replacement or if comorbidity is present. The costs per discounted and quality-adjusted year of life gained depend on type and position of the Björk-Shiley convexo-concave heart valve and rise steeply as the patient's age approaches the threshold for rereplacement. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the Dutch follow-up study allow guidance for prophylactic replacement of the Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valve on an individual basis. Rereplacement compares favorably with expectant management in some patient subgroups with both 60 degrees and 70 degrees valves. Age thresholds may serve as a first step in identifying patients in whom rereplacement might be beneficial.",1993-01-01793,8319328,Circulation,J H van der Meulen,1993,88 / 1,156-64,No,8319328,"J H van der Meulen; E W Steyerberg; Y van der Graaf; L A van Herwerden; C J Verbaan; J J Defauw; J D Habbema; Age thresholds for prophylactic replacement of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave heart valves.

261,Transurethral prostatectomy versus transurethral dilatation of the prostatic urethra for benign prostatic hyperplasia: a cost-utility analysis,"Transurethral prostatectomy is the treatment currently preferred for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A new procedure, transurethral dilatation of the prostatic urethra, has lower costs and mortality and complication rates but may be less effective. These two strategies were evaluated by using cost-utility analysis, a form of cost-effectiveness analysis in which the benefit is defined in terms of individual preferences. Under the model assumptions, the cost of transurethral dilatation is less than the cost of transurethral prostatectomy for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia ($7084 versus $8647) and slightly more effective: 11.787 quality adjusted life years versus 11.766. Thus, transurethral prostatectomy is said to be dominated.

263,Safety and cost-effectiveness of solvent-detergent-treated plasma. In search of a zero-risk blood supply,"OBJECTIVE--To determine the public health and economic implications of solvent-detergent-treated frozen plasma (SD FP). While this processing technique nearly eliminates the risk of transmitting lipid-enveloped viruses (hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus), it has associated costs and, because it requires pooling many plasma units, may increase risks of nonenveloped virus transmission. DESIGN--A previously published Markov decision analysis model was modified to assess transfusion-related outcomes in hypothetical cohorts of plasma recipients. In-hospital mortality and other characteristics were determined in 61 patients receiving plasma transfusions at a medium-sized tertiary care center to provide data for the model. Other parameters were obtained from the medical literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Expected SD FP costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness, assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. RESULTS--Compared with untreated plasma, a unit of SD FP produces a net benefit of 35 minutes in quality-adjusted life expectancy at a cost of about $19. Extrapolated to the 2.2 million plasma units transfused annually in the United States, SD FP would save 147 quality-adjusted life-years at a cost of $42.5 million. The marginal cost-effectiveness, $289,300 per quality-adjusted life-year saved in the baseline analysis, was most sensitive to estimates of SD treatment cost and the clinical setting of plasma use. In sensitivity analysis, the net benefit of SD FP was negated by the existence of even a minute risk of nonenveloped virus infection. CONCLUSIONS--From a public health perspective, the relatively high costs and small benefits of reducing enveloped virus infection risks with SD FP (and the additional risks of noneveloped virus transmission) do not appear to justify widespread implementation of this new technology.",1994-01-01796,7933351,JAMA,J P AuBuchon,1994,272 / 15,1210-4,No,7933351,"J P AuBuchon; J D Birkmeyer; Safety and cost-effectiveness of solvent-detergent-treated plasma.

264,An economic analysis of strategies for the use of contrast media for diagnostic cardiac catheterization,"A decision tree model was used to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of low- as opposed to high-osmolality contrast media for cardiac angiography. Analyses were done from the viewpoints of a third-party payer and society using data from a randomized trial and the literature. Assuming low-osmolality media reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, the incremental cost per QALY gained with these media is $17,264 in high-risk or $47,874 in low-risk patients for a third-party payer. From a societal viewpoint, the corresponding costs are $649 and $35,509. These estimates are sensitive to the cost and volume of the contrast medium employed and to the estimate of reduction in severe adverse events with low-osmolality media. The authors conclude that, in the context of restricted budgets, limiting the use of low-osmolality media to high-risk patients is justifiable, as the incremental cost per QALY in high-risk patients may be reasonable and it is not certain that low-osmolality media prevent severe or fatal events.

266,Cost-effectiveness of preoperative autologous donation in coronary artery bypass grafting,"Concern about the safety of the allogeneic blood supply has made preoperative autologous blood donation (PAD) routine before major noncardiac operations. However, the costs and benefits of PAD in elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are not well established. We used decision analysis to (1) calculate the cost-effectiveness of PAD in CABG, expressed as cost per year of life saved, and (2) compare the health benefits of reducing allogeneic transfusions with the potential risks of autologous blood donation by patients with coronary artery disease. A prospective study of 18 institutions provided data on transfusion practice and blood product costs in CABG. On average, PAD in CABG costs $508,000 to $909,000 per quality-adjusted year of life saved, depending on the number of units donated. Preoperative autologous blood donation is more cost-effective (as low as $518,000 per year of life saved) when targeted to younger patients undergoing CABG at centers with high transfusion rates. The cost-effectiveness of PAD is strongly dependent on estimates of posttransfusion hepatitis incidence, but less so on plausible estimates of the current risk of human immunodeficiency virus transmission. Although the actual risk of PAD is uncertain, even a small fatality risk (> 1 per 101,000 donations) associated with blood donation by patients awaiting CABG negates all life expectancy benefits of PAD. At current costs, PAD by patients awaiting CABG is not cost-effective, producing small health benefits at high societal cost.

270,Adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer: economics returns to research and cost-effectiveness of treatment,"BACKGROUND: In 1989, the National Cancer Institute issued a clinical announcement advising physicians of the benefits of combined levamisole and fluorouracil as an adjuvant treatment for patients with stage III colon cancer. PURPOSE: We have estimated the cost-effectiveness of the combined treatment and estimated the social return on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research investment that led to this innovative cancer treatment. METHODS: A computer simulation model, CAN*TROL, was used to estimate costs and benefits for a population cross-section receiving the adjuvant treatment. A method similar to ""Q-TWiST"" was used to assess the impact of quality-of-life adjustments. RESULTS: For a typical base-line case, the calculated cost-effectiveness is a very favorable $2094 per year of life saved. Using a variety of less favorable assumptions, cost-effectiveness is still less than $5000 per year of life saved, again a favorable value. Quality-of-life adjustments have a negligible effect on the cost-effectiveness outcome. The net present value of the return to the NIH research investment is estimated to be $1.66 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Under a wide range of reasonable assumptions, adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer appears to be a very cost-effective procedure.

273,Evaluating the potential cost-effectiveness of stenting as a treatment for symptomatic single-vessel coronary disease. Use of a decision-analytic model,"BACKGROUND: Coronary stenting appears to provide more predictable immediate results and lower rates of restenosis than conventional balloon angioplasty for selected lesion types, but its hospital costs are significantly higher. This study was designed to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of Palmaz-Schatz coronary stenting relative to conventional balloon angioplasty for the treatment of patients with symptomatic, single-vessel coronary disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a decision-analytic model to predict quality-adjusted life expectancy and lifetime treatment costs for patients with symptomatic, single-vessel coronary disease treated by either Palmaz-Schatz stenting (PSS) or conventional angioplasty (PTCA). Estimates of the probabilities of overall procedural success (PTCA, 97%; PSS, 98%), abrupt closure requiring emergency bypass surgery (PTCA, 1.0%; PSS, 0.6%), and angiographic restenosis (PTCA, 37%; PSS, 20%) were derived from review of the literature published as of September 1993. Procedural costs were based on the true economic (ie, variable) costs of each procedure at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. On the basis of these data, coronary stenting was estimated to result in a higher quality-adjusted life expectancy than conventional angioplasty but to incur additional costs as well. Compared with conventional angioplasty, stenting had an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $23,600 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Although the cost-effectiveness ratio for stenting changed with variations in assumptions about the relative costs and restenosis rates, it remained less than $40,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained--and thus was similar to many other accepted medical treatments--unless the stent angiographic restenosis rate was > 23%, the angioplasty restenosis rate was < 34%, or the cost of stenting (including vascular complications) exceeded that of conventional angioplasty by more than $3000. The alternative strategy of secondary stenting (initial angioplasty followed by stenting only for symptomatic restenosis) was estimated to be both less effective and less cost-effective than primary stenting over a wide range of plausible assumptions and thus does not appear to be cost-effective when primary stenting is also an option. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-analytic modeling can be used to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of new coronary interventions. Our analysis suggests that despite its higher cost, elective coronary stenting may be a reasonably cost-effective treatment for selected patients with single-vessel coronary disease. Primary stenting is unlikely to be cost-effective for lesions with a low probability of restenosis (eg, < 30%) or for patients for whom the cost of stenting is expected to be much higher than usual (eg, because of a high risk of vascular complications). Given the sensitivity of the cost-effectiveness ratios to even modest variations in the relative restenosis rates and cost estimates, future studies will be necessary to determine more precisely the cost-effectiveness of coronary stenting for specific patient and lesion subsets.",1994-01-01801,8149551,Circulation,D J Cohen,1994,89 / 4,1859-74,No,8149551,"D J Cohen; J A Breall; K K Ho; R E Kuntz; L Goldman; D S Baim; M C Weinstein; Evaluating the potential cost-effectiveness of stenting as a treatment for symptomatic single-vessel coronary disease.

To determine the cost-utility of low-dose misoprostol prophylaxis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS. Prospectively collected, population-based data on 57 RA patients' preferences (obtained using the category scaling and time trade-off techniques), charge data from a consecutive, population-based cohort of 36 RA patients with NSAID-related gastric ulcer, and literature-derived probability estimates were incorporated into a decision analysis model. RESULTS. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that, on average, prophylaxis resulted in modest additional costs and no additional quality-of-life benefits. At best, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was $9,333. At worst, prophylaxis reduced quality of life.

277,Cost-effectiveness analysis of hormone replacement therapy and lifestyle intervention for hip fracture,"We compared the cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent osteoporosis using a decision analytic model for a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 healthy perimenopausal women. The interventions were: oestrogen from age 50 for life, oestrogen from age 50 for 15 years, oestrogen from age 65 years for life, and a lifestyle regime of calcium supplements and exercise. The four interventions were compared with the case of no intervention by examining the effects on medical and nursing home costs, life years gained, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs per QALY gained. Lifetime oestrogen therapy from age 65 years achieved the lowest cost per life year gained and the lowest cost per QALY gained. The lifestyle intervention was the most expensive intervention by all measures but was sensitive to the cost of exercise and to the effects of exercise on cardiovascular mortality. Conventionally, oestrogen therapy begins at the menopause to avoid the rapid decline in bone mass that occurs with normally decreasing oestrogen levels.

283,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of autologous blood predeposit in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy procedures,"OBJECTIVES. To assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of preoperative autologous blood donation (PAD) in radical prostatectomy procedures. METHODS. A retrospective 3-year review was performed of transfusion outcomes in radical prostatectomy procedures. Cost, benefits, and cost-effectiveness were established using a previously published Markov decision analysis model. RESULTS. Three hundred eighty-four (97%) of 394 patients predonated 3.5 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SD) autologous blood units. Of these, 2.1 +/- 1.2 units (60%) were retransfused. Forty-two (11%) of 394 patients also received allogeneic blood. Autologous blood donors received only 0.2 +/- 0.6 allogeneic blood units, compared with 1.4 +/- 1.4 (p < 0.05) units transfused to patients who did not predonate. The net costs of PAD ranged from $83 to $303 per procedure. The life-expectancy benefit of PAD ranged from 0.05 to 0.07 days. The overall cost-effectiveness of PAD was estimated to be $1,813,000 per quality adjusted life-year saved. However, PAD was significantly more cost-effective for 2 unit donations ($531,000 per quality adjusted life-year saved). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that autologous blood donation is an effective blood conservation strategy in elective radical prostatectomy. However, the cost-effectiveness of this practice compares unfavorably with that reported for other medical interventions.

284,The burden of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease in Australia and an economic appraisal of the vaccine PRP-OMP,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence and sequelae of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease (Hib) in the Australian population, and to evaluate the costs and outcomes of a vaccination program using the vaccine PRP-OMP at two, four and 12 months. DESIGN: The evaluation was based on a decision analytic model developed by Merck Sharp and Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd, to predict the number of children who would contract Hib, and suffer mild or severe sequelae or die as a result. The state of health of a cohort of children was modelled each month over a five-year period. A survey of medical records and interviews with parents of children who contracted meningitis in Western Australia from 1984-1990 was undertaken to provide data on the extent and costs of sequelae. RESULTS: The incidence of Hib among non-Aboriginal Australians under five years of age was estimated as 53 per 100,000, and 460 per 100,000 among Aborigines. In a single year at least 630 children may contract Hib, up to 19 may die, and a further 46 may have neurological damage, this being severe in up to 18 children. The number of deaths could be reduced by 17 per year and a further 25 cases of severe and 16 cases of mild disability could be averted. At a price of $20 per dose, and a 5% discount rate, the expected cost per year of life extended by a vaccination program is $3148. When adjusted for the increased number of years without neurological impairment, the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) is $1965.

286,Cost utility of maintenance treatment of recurrent depression with sertraline versus episodic treatment with dothiepin,"The objective of this study was to model, for patients at risk of recurrent depression, the cost-utility of maintenance therapy with sertraline compared with treatment of acute episodes with dothiepin ('episodic treatment'). Using clinical decision analysis techniques, a Markov state-transition model was constructed to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of the 2 therapeutic strategies. The model follows 2 cohorts of 35-year-old women at high risk for recurrent depression over their lifetimes. Model construction and relevant data (probabilities) for performing the analysis were based on existing clinical knowledge. Two physician panels were used to obtain estimates of recurrence probabilities not available in the literature, health utilities, and resource consumption. Costs were obtained from published sources. The baseline analysis showed that it costs 2172 British pounds sterling ($US3692, 1991 currency) to save an additional QALY with sertraline maintenance treatment. Sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental cost-utility ratio ranged from 557 British pounds sterling to 5260 British pounds sterling per QALY. Overall, the resulting ratios are considered to be well within the range of cost-utility ratios that support the adoption and appropriate utilisation of a technology.

287,The cost-effectiveness of early surgery versus watchful waiting in the management of small abdominal aortic aneurysms,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of two clinical strategies for managing 4 to 5 cm diameter abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs): early surgery (repair 4 cm AAA when diagnosed) versus watchful waiting (monitor AAA with ultrasound size measurements every 6 months and repair if the diameter reaches 5 cm). METHODS: We used a Markov decision tree to compute the expected survival in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy, based on literature-derived estimates for the probabilities of different outcomes in this model. We determined hospital costs for patients undergoing elective and emergency AAA repair at our center. With standard methods of cost accounting, we then calculated the additional cost per year of life saved by early surgery compared with watchful waiting (cost-effectiveness ratio, dollars/QALY). RESULTS: Mean hospital costs for elective and emergency AAA repair were $24,020 and $43,208, respectively (1992 dollars). For our base-case analysis (60-year-old men with 4 cm diameter AAAs, with 5% elective operative mortality rate and 3.3% annual rupture rate), early surgery improved survival by 0.34 QALYs compared with watchful waiting, at an incremental cost of $17,404/QALY. Increased elective surgical mortality rate, decreased AAA rupture risk, and increased patient age all reduced the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. Future increases in elective operative risk, noncompliance with ultrasound follow-up and increased threshold size for elective AAA repair during watchful waiting all improved the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. Future increases in elective operative risk, noncompliance with ultrasound follow-up and increased threshold size for elective AAA repair during watchful waiting all improved the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of early surgery for 4 cm diameter AAAs in carefully selected patients compares favorably with that of other commonly accepted preventive interventions such as hypertension screening and treatment. With an upper limit of $40,000/QALY as an ""acceptable"" cost-effectiveness ratio, early surgery appears to be justified for patients 70 years old or younger, if the AAA rupture risk is 3%/year or more and the elective operative mortality rate is 5% or less.

288,Should hepatitis C-infected kidneys be transplanted in the United States?,"Over the past several years, the issue of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in renal transplantation has generated considerable interest. With the availability of a test for HCV, some but not all physicians have advocated that all HCV-infected kidneys be discarded. An economic appraisal was carried out to examine 3 theoretical policies of organ allocation for HCV-infected kidneys: (a) discard all infected kidneys, (b) transplant infected kidneys into infected donors only, or (c) transplant regardless of HCV status. Using probabilities, costs, and patient outcomes from the literature/best estimate, a cost-utility analysis was performed. Patients free of infection transplanted with an infected organ were assigned higher treatment costs and poorer outcomes compared with all other combinations. Assuming a potential to transplant 8100 kidneys per year, option A was predicted to produce the fewest total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incur the highest costs (largely due to patients left on dialysis). Option B was projected to produce the most QALYs, whereas option C incurred the lowest costs (no need to screen for HCV). The incremental cost utility of option B over C was $13,954 (present value 1990)/QALY. This economic appraisal suggests that transplanting HCV-infected kidneys into infected recipients is superior to a discard policy from both a cost and patient outcome perspective.

290,Screening for prostate cancer. A decision analytic view,"OBJECTIVE--To determine the clinical and economic effects of screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), and digital rectal examination (DRE). DESIGN--Decision analytic cost-utility analysis comparing four screening strategies with a strategy of not screening. We assumed that the cancer detection rate and stage distribution were predicted by each combination of tests and that localized cancer was treated with radical prostatectomy. For each strategy, we calculated life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and cost-utility ratios for unselected and high-prevalence populations. DATA--Probabilities and rates for clinical events were gathered from published data. We assessed utilities by the time-trade-off method using urologists, radiation oncologists, and internists as subjects. The Clinical Cost Manager at the New England Medical Center provided cost data. RESULTS--In unselected men between the ages of 50 and 70 years, screening with PSA or TRUS prolonged unadjusted life expectancy but diminished QALE. Screening with DRE alone yielded no reduction in mortality at any age. All programs increased costs. Results were sensitive only to assumptions about the efficacy of treatment. In high-prevalence populations, screening produced a similar pattern: gains in unadjusted life expectancy, losses in QALE, and increased costs. CONCLUSIONS--Our analysis does not support using PSA, TRUS, or DRE to screen asymptomatic men for prostatic cancer. Screening may result in poorer health outcomes and will increase costs dramatically.

DATA--Probabilities and rates for clinical events were gathered from published data. We assessed utilities by the time-trade-off method using urologists, radiation oncologists, and internists as subjects. The Clinical Cost Manager at the New England Medical Center provided cost data. RESULTS--In unselected men between the ages of 50 and 70 years, screening with PSA or TRUS prolonged unadjusted life expectancy but diminished QALE. Screening with DRE alone yielded no reduction in mortality at any age. All programs increased costs. Results were sensitive only to assumptions about the efficacy of treatment. In high-prevalence populations, screening produced a similar pattern: gains in unadjusted life expectancy, losses in QALE, and increased costs. CONCLUSIONS--Our analysis does not support using PSA, TRUS, or DRE to screen asymptomatic men for prostatic cancer. Screening may result in poorer health outcomes and will increase costs dramatically. Assessment of comorbidity, risk attitude, and valuation of sexual function may identify individuals who will benefit from screening, but selecting high-prevalence populations will not improve the benefit of screening.",1994-01-01809,7521400,JAMA,M D Krahn,1994,272 / 10,773-80,No,7521400,"M D Krahn; J E Mahoney; M H Eckman; J Trachtenberg; S G Pauker; A S Detsky; Screening for prostate cancer.

294,Chemonucleolysis versus surgical discectomy for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation. A cost and quality-of-life evaluation,"The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the cost and effects on quality of life [using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] of 2 treatments for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation: chemonucleolysis and surgical discectomy. The design involved a combination of decision analysis and Rosser index, with assessment of probabilities from long term clinical series. Utility was based on patients' subjective assessment using a simplified self-administered Health Measurement Questionnaire (HMQ). 146 patients from 7 hospitals were enrolled, 2 to 3 months after chemonucleolysis or surgery. The end-points used were cost and QALYs for each intervention, every year for years 1 to 7. At the time of analysis (1990), the total cost of surgical discectomy was FF15,400, compared with FF8000 for chemonucleolysis. After 1 year, and including the costs of reoperation for failure and relapse and long term medical costs for the non-reoperated unsatisfactory results, discectomy costs were almost 40% higher than those of chemonucleolysis. Ratios remain unchanged after 7 years. QALY results reveal an additional benefit of 52 days of good health associated with chemonucleolysis.",1994-01-01810,10155273,Pharmacoeconomics,R Launois,1994,6 / 5,453-63,Yes,10155273,"R Launois; B Henry; J R Marty; M Gersberg; C Lassale; M Benoist; J M Goehrs; Chemonucleolysis versus surgical discectomy for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation.

295,Costs of elective total hip arthroplasty during the first year. Cemented versus noncemented,"The cost-effectiveness of the Mallory Head (Biomet, Warsaw, IN) cemented versus noncemented total hip arthroplasty was determined as part of a randomized trial. Costs were assessed during the first postoperative year. In-hospital resource use was determined using a chart review of 60 randomly selected patients. Costs were determined using a fully allocated costing model. Outpatient resource use was determined using patient diaries, and appropriate costs were allocated for outpatient visits, admissions to hospital, and patient-borne costs. There was no difference in costs between the cemented and noncemented prostheses. The average cost of the initial hospitalization was $9,990 (1988 Canadian dollars), and outpatient costs during the first year were $1,137 (total cost during the first year was $11,127). The cost per quality adjusted life year was $27,139 during the first year and $8,031 during the first 3 years.",1994-01-01811,7807104,J Arthroplasty,A Laupacis,1994,9 / 5,481-7,No,7807104,"A Laupacis; R Bourne; C Rorabeck; D Feeny; C Wong; P Tugwell; K Leslie; R Bullas; Costs of elective total hip arthroplasty during the first year.

296,Cost-effectiveness of screening for microalbuminuria using immunochemical dipstick tests or laboratory assays in diabetic patients,"To analyse the cost-effectiveness ratio of screening for microalbuminuria in diabetic patients using either dipstick tests or laboratory assays, 506 diabetic patients were screened for microalbuminuria using both a traditional laboratory assay (strategy I) or a laboratory assay only in the case of a positive dipstick result (strategy II). Dipstick pre-screening was considered positive if at least one of the tests performed by the two different operators showed an albumin excretion rate > 20 micrograms min-1. It was performed using a new dipstick, Micral-Test, designed to distinguish low albumin concentrations. Biological assay was the reference method. Costs were related to laboratory assays (strategy I) or to dipstick tests and laboratory assays for positive results (strategy II). The loss of effectiveness was related to false negative results of strategy II. The double dipstick pre-screening showed a sensitivity of 90.8% and a specificity of 80.1%. Its predictive value was 97% for a negative result and 55.6% for a positive result. False positive results were associated with elevated urinary volumes. Compared with strategy I, strategy II showed a sensitivity of 90.8%, a specificity of 100%, and predictive values of 100% and 97.5%, respectively, for positive and negative results. In a fictitious cohort of 10,000 patients, strategy II yielded a gain of 16,750 pounds on the first year, which decreased to 5345 pounds after 30 years. The loss in effectiveness was estimated at 2.38 quality adjusted life years of a diabetic patient (QALYd) initially, and decreased to 0.91 QALYd after 30 years, the annual cost-effectiveness ratio being close to 6600 pounds QALYd-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994-01-01812,8088106,Diabet Med,J P Le Floch,1994,11 / 4,349-56,No,8088106,"J P Le Floch; M A Charles; C Philippon; L Perlemuter; Cost-effectiveness of screening for microalbuminuria using immunochemical dipstick tests or laboratory assays in diabetic patients, Diabet Med, 1994-May; 11(4):0742-3071; 349-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Double dipstick pre-screening of urine sample with immunoturbidimetry assay for positive results only vs. Traditional screening for microalbuminuria using laboratory assay,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,Not Stated,6600,United Kingdom,1993,17750.68
297,An economic analysis of alternatives for childhood immunisation against Haemophilus influenzae type b disease,"Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses of immunisation strategies against invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in Australia were based on a hypothetical birth cohort of 250,000 non-Aboriginal Australian children. The model predicted that, without immunisation, 625 cases of invasive Hib disease would occur in under-five-year-olds, with direct costs of $10.2 million. Universal public sector vaccination beginning before six months of age (6MVAC) prevented 80 per cent of cases; vaccination at 12 months (12MVAC) 62 per cent and at 18 months (18MVAC) 46 per cent. At a vaccine cost of $15 per dose, 18MVAC gave the lowest cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over a wide range of model assumptions, with 6MVAC the 'best' alternative. The best estimate ($ per QALY) for 6MVAC was $6930 (three doses), for 12MVAC $9136 (two doses) and for 18MVAC $1231 (one dose). The cost per QALY of single dose catch-up immunisation of older children was estimated at $8630 at two years, $27,000 at three years and $117,000 at four years if done at a scheduled visit; these values were increased if an additional medical visit was included. The threshold cost per vaccine dose at which an immunisation program became cost-saving was estimated for 6MVAC, 12MVAC and 18MVAC as $11, $10 and $14.
