15009,Home testing and counselling to reduce HIV incidence in a generalised epidemic setting: a mathematical modelling analysis,"BACKGROUND: Home HIV testing and counselling (HTC) achieves high levels of HIV testing and linkage to care. Periodic home HTC, particularly targeted to those with high HIV viral load, might facilitate expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage. We used a mathematical model to assess the effect of periodic home HTC programmes on HIV incidence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS: We developed a dynamic HIV transmission model with parameters, primary cost data, and measures of viral suppression collected from a prospective study of home HTC in KwaZulu-Natal. In our model, we assumed home HTC took place every 5 years with ART initiation for people with CD4 counts of 350 cells per muL or less. For individuals with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per muL, we compared increasing ART coverage for those with 350-500 cells per muL with initiating treatment for those who have viral loads of more than 10 000 copies per mL. FINDINGS: Maintaining the presently observed level of 36% viral suppression in HIV-positive people, HIV incidence decreases by 33.8% over 10 years. Home HTC every 5 years with linkage to care with ART initiation at CD4 counts of 350 cells per muL or less reduces HIV incidence by 40.6% over 10 years. Expansion of ART to people with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per muL who also have a viral load of 10 000 copies per mL or more decreases HIV incidence by 51.6%, and this was the most cost-effective strategy for prevention of HIV infections at US$2960 per infection averted. Expansion of ART eligibility CD4 counts of 350-500 cells per muL is cost-effective at $900 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Following health economic guidelines, expansion of ART use to individuals who have viral loads of more than 10 000 copies per mL among those with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per muL was cost-effective to reduce HIV-related morbidity. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that province-wide home HTC every 5 years can be a cost-effective strategy to increase ART coverage and reduce HIV burden. Expanded ART initiation criteria that includes individuals with high viral load will improve the effectiveness of home HTC in linking individuals to ART who are at high risk of transmitting HIV, thereby preventing morbidity and onward transmission.

15018,Early Treatment in HCV: Is it a Cost-Utility Option from the Italian Perspective?,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In Italy, the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency (AIFA) criteria used F3-F4 fibrosis stages as the threshold to prioritise the treatment with interferon (IFN)-free regimens, while in genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (G1 CHC) patients with fibrosis of liver stage 2, an approach with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-based triple therapy with simeprevir was suggested. The key clinical question is whether, in an era of financial constraints, the application of a universal IFN-free strategy in naive G1 CHC patients is feasible within a short time horizon. The aim of this study is to perform an economic analysis to estimate the cost-utility of the early innovative therapy in Italy for managing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. METHODS: The incremental cost-utility analysis was carried out to quantify the benefits of the early treatment approach in HCV subjects. A Markov simulation model including direct and indirect costs and health outcomes was developed from an Italian National Healthcare Service and societal perspective. A total of 5000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two distinct scenarios: standard of care (SoC) which includes 14,000 genotype 1 patients in Italy treated with innovative interferon-free regimens in the fibrosis of liver stages 3 and 4 (F3-F4) versus early-treatment scenario (ETS) where 2000 patients were additionally treated with simeprevir plus PEG-IFN and ribavirin in the fibrosis stage 2 (F2) (based on Italian Medicines Agency AIFA reimbursement criteria). A systematic literature review was carried out to identify epidemiological and economic data, which were subsequently used to inform the model. Furthermore, a one-way probabilistic sensitivity was performed to measure the relationship between the main parameters of the model and the cost-utility results. RESULTS: The model shows that, in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, ETS appeared to be the most cost-utility option compared with both perspective societal (ICER = EUR11,396) and NHS (ICER = EUR14,733) over a time period of 10 years. The cost-utility of ETS is more sustainable as it extends the time period analysis [ICER = EUR 6778 per QALY to 20 years and EUR4474 per QALY to 30 years]. From the societal perspective, the ETS represents the dominant option at a time horizon of 30 years. If we consider the sub-group population of treated patients [16,000 patients of which 2000 not treated in the SoC, the ETS scenario was dominant after only 5 years and the cost-utility at 2 years of simulation. The one-way sensitivity analysis on the main variables confirmed the robustness of the model for the early-treatment approach. CONCLUSION: Our model represents a tool for policy makers and health-care professionals, and provided information on the cost-utility of the early-treatment approach in HCV-infected patients in Italy. Starting innovative treatment regimens earlier keeps HCV-infected patients in better health and reduces the incidence of HCV-related events; generating a gain both in terms of health of the patients and correct resource allocation.",2016-01-19360,27234943,Clin Drug Investig,Andrea Marcellusi,2016,36 / 8,,Yes,27234943,"Andrea Marcellusi; Raffaella Viti; Francesco Damele; Calogero Camma; Gloria Taliani; Francesco Saverio Mennini; Early Treatment in HCV: Is it a Cost-Utility Option from the Italian Perspective?, Clin Drug Investig, 2016 Aug; 36(8):1173-2563",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early-treatment strategy for ?brosis stage 2 (F2) with peginterferon alfa (PEG-IFN) based triple therapies (TT) using second generation protease inhibitors (PI) (Simeprevir) vs. restrictive-treatment strategy for ?brosis stages 3 or 4 (F3-F4) with interferon-free regimen,"treatment-naïve, genotype 1",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,4474,Euro,2015,5421.46
15019,Cost-effectiveness analysis of different systolic blood pressure targets for people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack: Economic analysis of the PAST-BP study,"BACKGROUND: The PAST-BP trial found that using a lower systolic blood pressure target (<130 mmHg or lower versus <140 mmHg) in a primary care population with prevalent cerebrovascular disease was associated with a small additional reduction in blood pressure (2.9 mmHg). OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost effectiveness of an intensive systolic blood pressure target (<130 mmHg or lower) compared with a standard target (<140 mmHg) in people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack on general practice stroke/transient ischaemic attack registers in England. METHODS: A Markov model with a one-year time cycle and a 30-year time horizon was used to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year of an intensive target versus a standard target. Individual patient level data were used from the PAST-BP trial with regard to change in blood pressure and numbers of primary care consultations over a 12-month period. Published sources were used to estimate life expectancy and risks of cardiovascular events and their associated costs and utilities. RESULTS: In the base-case results, aiming for an intensive blood pressure target was dominant, with the incremental lifetime costs being pound169 lower per patient than for the standard blood pressure target with a 0.08 quality-adjusted life year gain. This was robust to sensitivity analyses, unless intensive blood pressure lowering reduced quality of life by 2% or more.

15020,Cost-effectiveness of adding carfilzomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed multiple myeloma from a US perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic value of carfilzomib (Kyprolis), this study developed the Kyprolis Global Economic Model (K-GEM), which examined from a United States (US) payer perspective the cost-effectiveness of carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) versus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) in relapsed multiple myeloma (RMM; 1-3 prior therapies) based on results from the phase III ASPIRE trial that directly compared these regimens. METHODS: A partitioned survival model that included three health states of progression-free (on or off treatment), post-progression, and death was developed. Using ASPIRE data, the effect of treatment regimens as administered in the trial was assessed for progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Treatment effects were estimated with parametric regression models adjusting for baseline patient characteristics and applied over a lifetime horizon. US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (1984-2014) registry data were matched to ASPIRE patients to extrapolate OS beyond the trial. Estimated survival was adjusted to account for utilities across health states. The K-GEM considered the total direct costs (pharmacy/medical) of care for patients treated with KRd and Rd. RESULTS: KRd was estimated to be more effective compared to Rd, providing 1.99 life year and 1.67 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains over the modeled horizon. KRd-treated patients incurred $179,393 in total additional costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $107,520 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: Extrapolated survival functions present the greatest uncertainty in the modeled results. Utilities were derived from a combination of sources and assumed to reflect how US patients value their health state. CONCLUSIONS: The K-GEM showed KRd is cost-effective, with an ICER of $107,520 per QALY gained against Rd for the treatment of patients with RMM (1-3 prior therapies) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000.

15021,Cost-Effectiveness of Dapagliflozin as Add-On to Metformin for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Greece,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive disease that has been spread worldwide over the past three decades and associated with increased morbidity and mortality resulting in considerable socioeconomic implications for national healthcare systems. Effective management of disease is highly needed ensuring patients receive the best possible care within the available budget. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, compared with a sulfonylurea (SU) or a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), when added to metformin, in T2DM patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone in Greece. METHODS: The published and validated Cardiff diabetes model, a lifetime micro-simulation model, was adapted to a Greek healthcare setting to determine the incidence of micro- and macro-vascular complications and diabetes-specific and all-cause mortality. Clinical, cost, and utility data were retrieved from literature and assigned to model parameters to calculate total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer in Greece. Uncertainty surrounding important model parameters was explored with univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: Over a patient''s lifetime, dapagliflozin was associated with 0.48 and 0.04 incremental QALYs compared with SU and DPP-4i, respectively, at additional costs of euro5142 and euro756, respectively. The corresponding ICERs were euro10,623 and euro17,695 per QALY gained versus the treatment with SU and DPP-4i, respectively. Results were robust across various univariate and scenario analyses. At the defined willingness-to-pay threshold of euro34,000 per QALY gained, PSA estimated that treatment with dapagliflozin had a 100 % and 79.7 % probability of being cost-effective relative to the SU and DPP-4i treatments.

15023,Lobectomy is a more Cost-Effective Option than Total Thyroidectomy for 1 to 4 cm Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma that do not Possess Clinically Recognizable High-Risk Features,"BACKGROUND: Although lobectomy is a viable alternative to total thyroidectomy (TT) in low-risk 1 to 4 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), lobectomy is associated with higher locoregional recurrence risk and need for completion TT upon discovery of a previously unrecognized histologic high-risk feature (HRF). The present study evaluated long-term cost-effectiveness between lobectomy and TT. METHODS: Our base case was a hypothetical female cohort aged 40 years with a low-risk 2.5 cm PTC. A Markov decision tree model was constructed to compare cost-effectiveness between lobectomy and TT after 25 years. Patients with an unrecognized HRF (including aggressive histology, microscopic extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, positive resection margin, nodal metastasis >5 mm, and multifocality) underwent completion TT after lobectomy. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were estimated from the literature. The threshold for cost-effectiveness was set at US$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity and threshold analyses were used to examine model uncertainty. RESULTS: After 25 years, each patient who underwent lobectomy instead of TT cost an extra US$772.08 but gained an additional 0.300 QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$2577.65/QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, the lobectomy arm began to become cost-effective only after 3 years. Despite varying the reported prevalence of clinically unrecognized HRFs, complication from surgical procedures, annualized recurrence rates, unit cost of surgical procedure or complication, and utility score, lobectomy remained more cost-effective than TT. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher locoregional recurrence risk and having almost half of the patients undergoing completion TT after lobectomy upon discovery of a previously unrecognized HRF, initial lobectomy was a more cost-effective long-term option than initial TT for 1 to 4 cm PTCs without clinically recognized HRFs.",2016-01-19390,27221359,Ann Surg Oncol,Brian Hung-Hin Lang,2016,23 / 11,,No,27221359,"Brian Hung-Hin Lang; Carlos K H Wong; Lobectomy is a more Cost-Effective Option than Total Thyroidectomy for 1 to 4 cm Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma that do not Possess Clinically Recognizable High-Risk Features, Ann Surg Oncol, 2016 Oct; 23(11):1068-9265",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lobectomy vs. Total Thyroidectomy (TT),no family history of nonmedullary thyroid cancer and neck irradiation,40 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,2577.65,United States,2016,2779.6
15024,Cost Utility of Omalizumab Compared with Standard of Care for the Treatment of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria,"BACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) negatively impacts patient quality of life and productivity and is associated with considerable indirect costs to society. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost utility of add-on omalizumab treatment compared with standard of care (SOC) in moderate or severe CSU patients with inadequate response to SOC, from the UK societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed, consisting of health states based on Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days (UAS7) and additional states for relapse, spontaneous remission and death. Model cycle length was 4 weeks, and total model time horizon was 20 years in the base case. The model considered early discontinuation of non-responders (response: UAS7 </=6) and retreatment upon relapse (relapse: UAS7 >/=16) for responders. Clinical and cost inputs were derived from omalizumab trials and published sources, and cost utility was expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Scenario analyses included no early discontinuation of non-responders and an altered definition of response (UAS7 <16). RESULTS: With a deterministic ICER of pound3183 in the base case, omalizumab was associated with increased costs and benefits relative to SOC. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis supported this result. Productivity inputs were key model drivers, and individual scenarios without early discontinuation of non-responders and adjusted response definitions had little impact on results. ICERs were generally robust to changes in key model parameters and inputs. CONCLUSIONS: In this, the first economic evaluation of omalizumab in CSU from a UK societal perspective, omalizumab consistently represented a treatment option with societal benefit for CSU in the UK across a range of scenarios.",2016-01-19405,27209583,Pharmacoeconomics,Jonathan Graham,2016,34 / 8,,Yes,27209583,"Jonathan Graham; Doreen McBride; Donald Stull; Anna Halliday; Stamatia Theodora Alexopoulos; Maria-Magdalena Balp; Matthew Griffiths; Ion Agirrezabal; Torsten Zuberbier; Alan Brennan; Cost Utility of Omalizumab Compared with Standard of Care for the Treatment of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria, Pharmacoeconomics, 2016 Aug; 34(8):1179-2027",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Add-on omalizumab following poor response to first-line treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- updosed H1 antihistamines, H2 antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists following failed response to first line treatment with H1 antihistimines",moderate or severe disease with inadequate response to standard of care,43 Years,43 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.50,3.50,3183,United Kingdom,2014,5736.24

METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was performed to compare the cost-effectiveness of SBRT and sorafenib for unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients transitioned between three health states: stable disease, progression disease and death. We calculated the data on cost from the perspective of our National Health Insurance Bureau. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the impact of several variables. RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for sorafenib compared to SBRT was NT$3,788,238 per quality-adjusted life year gained (cost/QALY), which was higher than the willingness to pay threshold of Taiwan according to WHO''s guideline. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the utility of progression disease for the sorafenib treatment, utility of progression free survival for SBRT, utility of progression free survival for sorafenib, utility of PFS to progression disease for SBRT and transition probability of progression disease to dead for SBRT were the most sensitive parameters in all cost scenarios. The Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay threshold of NT$ 2,213,145 per QALY was 100 % and 0 % chance for SBRT and sorafenib. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that SBRT for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold as defined by WHO guideline in Taiwan.",2016-01-19421,27193904,Radiat Oncol,Henry W C Leung,2016,11 /,69,No,27193904,"Henry W C Leung; Chung-Feng Liu; Agnes L F Chan; Cost-effectiveness of sorafenib versus SBRT for unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Radiat Oncol, 2016; 11():1748-717X; 69",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous sorafenib (400mg) twice daily for 6 week cycles vs. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment over 2 weeks,"Patients with inoperable, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)",Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,3788238,Taiwan,2015,130384.72
15032,The Economic Impact of Acetabular Labral Tears: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis Comparing Hip Arthroscopic Surgery and Structured Rehabilitation Alone in Patients Without Osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroscopic surgery has emerged as a successful procedure to manage acetabular labral tears and concurrent hip injuries, which if left untreated, may contribute to hip osteoarthritis (OA). Therefore, it is essential to analyze the economic impact of this treatment option. PURPOSE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of hip arthroscopic surgery versus structured rehabilitation alone for acetabular labral tears, to examine the effects of age on cost-effectiveness, and to estimate the rate of symptomatic OA and total hip arthroplasty (THA) in both treatment arms over a lifetime horizon. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of hip arthroscopic surgery compared with structured rehabilitation for symptomatic labral tears was performed using a Markov decision model constructed over a lifetime horizon. It was assumed that patients did not have OA. Direct costs (in 2014 United States dollars), utilities of health states (in quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained), and probabilities of transitioning between health states were estimated from a comprehensive literature review. Costs were estimated using national averages of Medicare reimbursements, adjusted for all payers in the United States from a societal perspective. Utilities were estimated from the Harris Hip Score. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of uncertainty on the model outcomes. RESULTS: For a cohort representative of patients undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery at our facility, arthroscopic surgery was more costly (additional $2653) but generated more utility (additional 3.94 QALYs) compared with rehabilitation over a lifetime. The mean ICER was $754/QALY, well below the conventional willingness to pay of $50,000/QALY. Arthroscopic surgery was cost-effective for 94.5% of patients. Although arthroscopic surgery decreased in cost-effectiveness with increasing age, arthroscopic surgery remained more cost-effective than rehabilitation for patients in the second to seventh decades of life. The lifetime incidence of symptomatic hip OA was over twice as high for patients treated with rehabilitation compared with arthroscopic surgery. The preferred treatment was sensitive to the utility after successful hip arthroscopic surgery, although the utility at which arthroscopic surgery becomes less cost-effective than rehabilitation is far below our best estimate. For older patients, the lifetime cost of arthroscopic surgery was greater, while the lifetime utility of arthroscopic surgery was less, approaching that of the rehabilitation arm. CONCLUSION: Hip arthroscopic surgery is more cost-effective and results in a considerably lower incidence of symptomatic OA than structured rehabilitation alone in treating symptomatic labral tears of patients in the second to seventh decades of life without pre-existing OA.",2016-01-19426,27190068,Am J Sports Med,Parth Lodhia,2016,44 / 7,,No,27190068,"Parth Lodhia; Chengcheng Gui; Sivashankar Chandrasekaran; Carlos Suarez-Ahedo; Douglas R Dirschl; Benjamin G Domb; The Economic Impact of Acetabular Labral Tears: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis Comparing Hip Arthroscopic Surgery and Structured Rehabilitation Alone in Patients Without Osteoarthritis, Am J Sports Med, 2016 Jul; 44(7):1552-3365",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Arthroscopic surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Structured rehabilitation,no osteoarthritis,69 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,673.42,United States,2014,736.22
15033,Cost-Effectiveness of Pertussis Vaccination During Pregnancy in the United States,"Vaccination against pertussis has reduced the disease burden dramatically, but the most severe cases and almost all fatalities occur in infants too young to be vaccinated. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that targeted vaccination of mothers during pregnancy can reduce pertussis incidence in their infants. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antepartum maternal vaccination in the United States, we created an age-stratified transmission model, incorporating empirical data on US contact patterns and explicitly modeling parent-infant exposure. Antepartum maternal vaccination incurs costs of $114,000 (95% prediction interval: 82,000, 183,000) per quality-adjusted life-year, in comparison with the strategy of no adult vaccination, and is cost-effective in the United States according to World Health Organization criteria. By contrast, vaccinating a second parent is not cost-effective, and vaccination of either parent postpartum is strongly dominated by antepartum maternal vaccination. Nonetheless, postpartum vaccination of mothers who were not vaccinated antepartum improves upon the current recommendation of untargeted adult vaccination. Additionally, the temporary direct protection of the infant due to maternal antibody transfer has efficacy for infants comparable to that conferred to toddlers by the full primary vaccination series.

15038,Cost-effectiveness analysis of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in Spain,"Influenza has a major impact on healthcare systems and society, but can be prevented using vaccination. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that influenza vaccines should include at least two virus A and one virus B lineage (trivalent vaccine; TIV). A new quadrivalent vaccine (QIV), which includes an additional B virus strain, received regulatory approval and is now recommended by several countries. The present study estimates the cost-effectiveness of replacing TIVs with QIV for risk groups and elderly population in Spain. A static, lifetime, multi-cohort Markov model with a one-year cycle time was adapted to assess the costs and health outcomes associated with a switch from TIV to QIV. The model followed a cohort vaccinated each year according to health authority recommendations, for the duration of their lives. National epidemiological data allowed the determination of whether the B strain included in TIVs matched the circulating one. Societal perspective was considered, costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Compared to TIVs, QIV reduced more influenza cases and influenza-related complications and deaths during periods of B-mismatch strains in the TIV. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 8,748euro/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). One-way sensitivity analysis showed mismatch with the B lineage included in the TIV was the main driver for ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows ICER below 30,000euro/QALY in 96% of simulations.

We have investigated the cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan versus no active treatment (NAT) in adult patients within the licensed indication who have either failed to respond to fluid restriction or for whom the use of fluid restriction is not suitable, from the societal perspective in Sweden. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis, considering a ''general SIADH'' population and two subpopulations of patients (small-cell lung cancer [SCLC] and pneumonia) to broadly represent the complex clinical pathway of SIADH, was performed. A discrete event simulation was developed to model the progression of individuals through inpatient admissions over a 30-day time horizon (180 days for the SCLC cohort). Clinical data were derived from tolvaptan trials and observational data sources. All costs are given in Swedish kronor (SEK). RESULTS: In the ''general SIADH'' population, tolvaptan was associated with reduced costs (SEK 5,779 per patient [euro624]) and increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (0.0019) compared with NAT and was therefore the dominant treatment strategy. Tolvaptan was also associated with reduced costs and increased QALYs in the SCLC and pneumonia subpopulations.

METHODS: An Excel spreadsheet Markov model tracking progression through stages of liver disease was developed. Costs and patient utilities for liver disease stages were taken from published studies. Rates of disease progression were based on studies of untreated HCV infection and long-term follow-up of those achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) after drug treatment. Impact of OMB/PTV/r + DSV +/- RBV and other drug regimens on progression was estimated through SVR rates from clinical trials. Analyses were performed for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Impact of alternative scenarios and input parameter uncertainty on the results were tested. RESULTS: For genotype 1 treatment-naive HCV patients, for OMB/PTV/r + DSV +/- RBV, PegIFN + ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV), sofosbuvir + PegIFN/RBV, telaprevir + PegIFN/RBV, boceprevir + PegIFN/RBV, lifetime risk of decompensated liver disease was 5.6%, 18.9%, 7.4%, 11.7%, and 14.9%; hepatocellular carcinoma was 5.4%, 9.2%, 5.7%, 7.0%, and 7.4%; and death from liver disease was 8.7%, 22.2%, 10.4%, 14.8%, and 17.6%, respectively. Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of OMB/PTV/r + DSV +/- RBV for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients indicated that it dominated all other regimens except PegIFN/RBV.

15070,A cost-utility analysis of prolonged-release tacrolimus relative to immediate-release tacrolimus and ciclosporin in liver transplant recipients in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) represent the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy after liver transplantation. A recent network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the relative efficacy of CNIs ciclosporin, prolonged-release (PR) tacrolimus, and immediate-release (IR) tacrolimus in adult liver transplant recipients based on randomized and large observational trials published since 2000. Based on the NMA findings, the present study evaluated the cost-utility of PR tacrolimus relative to ciclosporin or IR tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients in the UK. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of immunosuppressive regimens in liver transplant recipients, capturing costs associated with immunosuppression, retransplantation, acute rejection (AR), and cytomegalovirus infection. Mortality, graft loss, and AR odds ratios were derived from the NMA. Costs were taken from the British National Formulary and the NHS National Tariff and expressed in 2016 pounds sterling. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: Over 25 years, PR tacrolimus resulted in increased life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) relative to IR tacrolimus and ciclosporin. Relative to ciclosporin, QALE increased by 1.17 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with PR tacrolimus while costs increased by GBP pound4645, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound3962 per QALY gained. Relative to IR tacrolimus, QALE increased by 0.78 QALYs and costs by pound1474, resulting in an ICER of pound1889 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed the analysis to be most sensitive to dosing assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a UK-specific analysis of the projected cost-utility of PR tacrolimus relative to IR tacrolimus and ciclosporin, PR tacrolimus was cost-effective, improving life expectancy and QALE relative to both IR tacrolimus and ciclosporin, yielding ICERs below pound20 000 per QALY gained.

15075,Cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women using data from three recent influenza seasons in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a decision-analytic model following a cohort of 5.2 million pregnant women and their infants aged <6 months to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women against seasonal influenza during pregnancy from a societal perspective. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and cost-effectiveness ratios. Data sources included surveillance data, epidemiological studies, and published vaccine cost data. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total costs (direct and indirect), effects (QALY gains, averted case numbers), and incremental cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women (cost per QALY gained). RESULTS: Using a recent benchmark of 52.2% vaccination coverage among pregnant women, we studied a hypothetical cohort of 2,753,015 vaccinated pregnant women. With an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 73% among pregnant women and 63% among infants <6 months, QALY gains for each season were 305 (2010-2011), 123 (2011-2012), and 610 (2012-2013). Compared with no vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy was cost-saving when using data from the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. The cost-effectiveness ratio was greater than $100,000/QALY with the 2011-2012 influenza season data, when CDC reported a low attack rate compared to other recent seasons.

15077,Cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women using data from three recent influenza seasons in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a decision-analytic model following a cohort of 5.2 million pregnant women and their infants aged <6 months to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women against seasonal influenza during pregnancy from a societal perspective. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and cost-effectiveness ratios. Data sources included surveillance data, epidemiological studies, and published vaccine cost data. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total costs (direct and indirect), effects (QALY gains, averted case numbers), and incremental cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women (cost per QALY gained). RESULTS: Using a recent benchmark of 52.2% vaccination coverage among pregnant women, we studied a hypothetical cohort of 2,753,015 vaccinated pregnant women. With an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 73% among pregnant women and 63% among infants <6 months, QALY gains for each season were 305 (2010-2011), 123 (2011-2012), and 610 (2012-2013). Compared with no vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy was cost-saving when using data from the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. The cost-effectiveness ratio was greater than $100,000/QALY with the 2011-2012 influenza season data, when CDC reported a low attack rate compared to other recent seasons.

DESIGN: Systematic literature search to pool target lesion revascularisations (TLR). Model-based per-patient cost impact and quasi-cost-effectiveness projection over 24 months based on pooled TLRs and current reimbursement. SETTING: The UK''s National Health Service (NHS). PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting with symptomatic femoropopliteal disease eligible for endovascular treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline-recommended treatment with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) and bailout bare metal stenting (BMS) versus primary BMS placement, or drug-coated balloon (DCB), or drug-eluting stent (DES) treatment. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-month per-patient cost impact to NHS (primary outcome). SECONDARY OUTCOMES: pooled 24-month TLR rates; numbers needed to treat (NNTs); cost per TLR avoided and estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: N=28 studies were identified, reporting on 5167 femoropopliteal lesions. Over 24 months, DCB, DES and BMS reduced TLRs of de novo lesions from 36.2% to 17.6%, 19.4% and 26.9%, respectively, at an increased cost of pound43, pound44 and pound112. NNTs to avoid 1 TLR in 24 months were 5.4, 6.0 and 10.8, resulting in cost per TLR avoided of pound231, pound264 and pound1204.

15081,Societal and Economic Effect of Meniscus Scaffold Procedures for Irreparable Meniscus Injuries,"BACKGROUND: Meniscus scaffolds are currently evaluated clinically for their efficacy in preventing the development of osteoarthritis as well as for their efficacy in treating patients with chronic symptoms. Procedural costs, therapeutic consequences, clinical efficacy, and future events should all be considered to maximize the monetary value of this intervention. PURPOSE: To examine the socioeconomic effect of treating patients with irreparable medial meniscus injuries with a meniscus scaffold. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Two Markov simulation models for patients with an irreparable medial meniscus injury were developed. Model 1 was used to investigate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of a meniscus scaffold compared with standard partial meniscectomy by the possibility of preventing the development of osteoarthritis. Model 2 was used to investigate the short-term (5-year) cost-effectiveness of a meniscus scaffold compared with standard partial meniscectomy by alleviating clinical symptoms, specifically in chronic patients with previous meniscus surgery. For both models, probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations were applied. Treatment effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), while costs (estimated in euros) were assessed from a societal perspective. We assumed euro20,000 as a reference value for the willingness to pay per QALY. Next, comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the most influential variables on the cost-effectiveness of meniscus scaffolds. RESULTS: Model 1 demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a meniscus scaffold treatment of euro54,463 per QALY (euro5991/0.112). A threshold analysis demonstrated that a meniscus scaffold should offer a relative risk reduction of at least 0.34 to become cost-effective, assuming a willingness to pay of euro20,000. Decreasing the costs of the meniscus scaffold procedure by 33% (euro10,160 instead of euro15,233; an absolute change of euro5073) resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro7876 per QALY. Model 2 demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a meniscus scaffold treatment of euro297,727 per QALY (euro9825/0.033). On the basis of the current efficacy data, a meniscus scaffold provides a relative risk reduction of ""limited benefit"" postoperatively of 0.37 compared with standard treatment. A threshold analysis revealed that assuming a willingness to pay of euro20,000, a meniscus scaffold would not be cost-effective within a period of 5 years. Most influential variables on the cost-effectiveness of meniscus scaffolds were the cost of the scaffold procedure, cost associated with osteoarthritis, and quality of life before and after the scaffold procedure. CONCLUSION: Results of the current health technology assessment emphasize that the monetary value of meniscus scaffold procedures is very much dependent on a number of influential variables. Therefore, before implementing the technology in the health care system, it is important to critically assess these variables in a relevant context. The models can be improved as additional clinical data regarding the efficacy of the meniscus scaffold become available.",2016-01-19495,27159309,Am J Sports Med,Jan J Rongen,2016,44 / 7,,No,27159309,"Jan J Rongen; Tim M Govers; Pieter Buma; Janneke P C Grutters; Gerjon Hannink; Societal and Economic Effect of Meniscus Scaffold Procedures for Irreparable Meniscus Injuries, Am J Sports Med, 2016 Jul; 44(7):1552-3365",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Meniscus scaffold procedure (standard arthroscopic treatment, followed by the placement of a meniscus scaffold, and joint debridement if indicated) vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard treatment (arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, removing as little of the meniscus as possible, and joint debridement as indicated).",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5 years",4.00,1.50,54463,Euro,2014,79170.63
15082,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of a population-based screening program for colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in Belgium. In Flanders (Belgium), a population-based screening program with a biennial immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) in women and men aged 56-74 has been organised since 2013. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the colorectal population-based screening program in Flanders (Belgium). METHODS: A health economic model was conducted, consisting of a decision tree simulating the screening process and a Markov model, with a time horizon of 20years, simulating natural progression. Predicted mortality and incidence, total costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with and without the screening program were calculated in order to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CRC screening. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted, taking into account uncertainty of the model parameters. RESULTS: Mortality and incidence were predicted to decrease over 20years. The colorectal screening program in Flanders is found to be cost-effective with an ICER of 1681/QALY (95% CI -1317 to 6601) in males and euro4,484/QALY (95% CI -3254 to 18,163). The probability of being cost-effective given a threshold of euro35,000/QALY was 100% and 97.3%, respectively. The budget impact analysis showed the extra cost for the health care payer to be limited.

15084,The cost-effectiveness of meniscal repair versus partial meniscectomy: A model-based projection for the United States,"BACKGROUND: Meniscal tears are the most common knee condition requiring surgery, and represent a substantial disease burden with clinical and cost implications. The success rates partial meniscectomy and meniscal repair have been studied, but limited information is available investigating their long-term costs and effects. Our objective was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of meniscal repair compared to meniscectomy. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic Markov disease progression model, using strategy-specific failure rates and treatment-specific probabilities for the development of osteoarthritis (OA) and subsequent knee replacement (TKR). Failure rates and OA incidence were derived from controlled and uncontrolled studies as well as meta-analyses. Costs were derived from 2014U.S. reimbursement amounts and published literature. RESULTS: Meniscal repair was associated with an increased failure rate (RR of 4.37), but meaningful reductions in OA and TKR incidence (29.7% vs. 39.4% and 19.6% vs. 27.9%, respectively) in our model-based analysis. Over the 30-year horizon, meniscal repair was associated with an increase in discounted QALYs to 16.52 (compared to 16.37 QALYs for meniscectomy), at overall discounted savings of $2384, making it the dominant index procedure strategy. Using age-specific per-patient cost and QALYs projected for the 30-year horizon, our computations suggest that payers could save approximately $43 million annually if 10% of current meniscectomies could be performed as meniscal repairs. CONCLUSIONS: Our projection suggests that meniscal repair, despite substantially higher failure rates, is associated with improved long-term outcomes and cost savings relative to meniscectomy in the majority of patients, making it the dominant treatment strategy.",2016-01-19500,27157145,Knee,Brian T Feeley,2016,23 / 4,,No,27157145,"Brian T Feeley; Shan Liu; Abigail M Garner; Alan L Zhang; Jan B Pietzsch; The cost-effectiveness of meniscal repair versus partial meniscectomy: A model-based projection for the United States, Knee, 2016 Aug; 23(4):1873-5800",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Meniscal repair vs. Partial menisectomy,Not Stated,80 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-14900,United States,2014,-16289.39
15085,Cost-Effectiveness of Ivabradine for Heart Failure in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Ivabradine is a heart rate-lowering agent approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding ivabradine to background therapy in the United States from the perspective of a commercial or Medicare Advantage payer. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-effectiveness, cohort-based Markov model using a state transition approach tracked a cohort of heart failure patients with heart rate >/=70 beats per minute in sinus rhythm who were treated with ivabradine+background therapy or background therapy alone. Model inputs, including adjusted hazard ratios, rates of hospitalization and mortality, adverse events, and utility-regression equations, were derived from a large US claims database and SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the If inhibitor ivabradine Trial). In the commercial population, ivabradine+background therapy was associated with a cost savings of $8594 versus the cost of background therapy alone over a 10-year time horizon, primarily because of reduced hospitalization. Ivabradine was associated with an incremental benefit of 0.24 quality-adjusted life years over a 10-year time horizon. In the Medicare Advantage population, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ivabradine was estimated to be $24 920/quality-adjusted life years. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness model suggests that for a commercial population, the addition of ivabradine to background therapy was associated with cost savings and improved clinical outcomes.

15086,"Cost-Effectiveness of Eplerenone Compared to Usual Care in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and NYHA Class II Symptoms, an Australian Perspective","The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of eplerenone compared with usual care in patients with chronic heart failure and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II symptoms.A Markov model was constructed with 5 health states to reflect NYHA symptom status (Classes I-IV) and death. All subjects began in the ""Class II"" health state and then moved to other symptom health states or died. Subjects could also be hospitalized for HF in any cycle. Transition probabilities were derived from the Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization And Survival Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS-HF) study. Decision analysis was applied to compare an Eplerenone Group with a Usual Care Group (UCG). In the UCG, 47.3% of subjects in Class II and 93.7% of subjects in Classes III and IV were assumed to be taking spironolactone (as per published data). In the Eplerenone Group, all subjects in Classes II, III, and IV were assumed to be taking eplerenone. The efficacy of spironolactone was assumed to be the same as eplerenone. Cost and utility data were derived from published sources. A discount rate of 5.0% was applied to future costs and benefits. The outcome of interest was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (cost per year of live saved (YoLS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained).Over 10 years the model predicted that for each patient compared with usual care, eplerenone would lead to 0.26 YoLS (discounted) and 0.19 QALYs gained (discounted), at a net cost of AUD $6961 (discounted). These equate to ICERs of AUD 28,001 per YoLS and AUD 37,452 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated a 99.0% likelihood of eplerenone being cost-effective compared with usual care at a willingness to pay threshold of AUD 50,000 per QALY gained.From an Australian healthcare perspective, the addition of eplerenone in management of patients with chronic heart failure and NYHA Class II symptoms represents a cost-effective strategy compared with usual care.",2016-01-19513,27149456,Medicine (Baltimore),Zanfina Ademi,2016,95 / 18,e3531,No,27149456,"Zanfina Ademi; Kumar Pasupathi; Danny Liew; Cost-Effectiveness of Eplerenone Compared to Usual Care in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and NYHA Class II Symptoms, an Australian Perspective, Medicine (Baltimore), 2016 May; 95(18):1536-5964; e3531",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eplerenone (up to 50mg daily) vs. Standard/Usual Care- spironolactone,New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II symptoms,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,37452,Australia,2014,36988.24

METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (stable, progressive, and death) was developed. Comparators were chosen based on reported utilization from a retrospective Canadian chart study; comparators were pemetrexed, best supportive care (BSC), and historical control (HC). HC comprised of all treatment alternatives reported. Progression-free survival and overall survival for ceritinib were estimated using data reported from single-arm clinical trials (ASCEND-1 [NCT01283516] and ASCEND-2 [NCT01685060]). Survival data for comparators were obtained from published clinical trials in a NSCLC population and from a Canadian retrospective chart study. Parametric models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the trial period. Drug acquisition, administration, resource use, and adverse event (AE) costs were obtained from databases. Utilities for health states and disutilities for AEs based on EQ-5D were derived from literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were estimated. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Over 4 years, ceritinib was associated with 0.86 QALYs and total direct costs of $89,740 for the post-ALK population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $149,117 comparing ceritinib vs BSC, $80,100 vs pemetrexed, and $104,436 vs HC.

15090,Cost-effectiveness of neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A population-based matched case-control study,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (NCCRT) is often considered for locally-advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LA-ESCC) patients; however, no data regarding the cost-effectiveness of this treatment is available. Our study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NCCRT versus esophagectomy for LA-ESCC at population level. METHODS: We identified LA-ESCC patients diagnosed within 2008-2009 and treated with either NCCRT or esophagectomy through the Taiwan Cancer Registry. We included potential confounding covariables (age, gender, residency, comorbidity, social-economic status, disease stage, treating hospital level and surgeon's experience, and the use of endoscopic ultrasound before treatment) and used propensity score (PS) to construct a 1:1 population. The duration of interest was three years within the date of diagnosis. Effectiveness was measured as overall survival. We took the payer's perspective and converted the cost to 2014 United States dollars (USD). In sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the potential impact of an unmeasured confounder on the statistical significance of incremental net benefit at suggested willingness-to-pay. RESULTS: Our study population constituted 150 PS matched subjects. The mean cost (2014 USD) and survival (year) were higher for NCCRT compared with esophagectomy (US$91,460 vs. $75,836 for cost; 2.2 vs. 1.8 for survival) with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$39,060/life-year. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to esophagectomy, NCCRT is likely to improve survival and is probably more cost-effective.

15091,Cost-Effectiveness of Different Forms of Intra-Articular Injections for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee,"INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA), as one of the leading causes of disability, decreases the quality of life for those suffering from the disease and creates a substantial financial burden. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) can provide relief from the symptoms of OA and multiple HA products are prescribed. The purpose of this study is to examine the single payer cost-effectiveness of various HA products in the treatment of knee OA. METHODS: A single payer economic evaluation was conducted comparing Synvisc((R)) (Sanofi, USA), Durolane((R)) (Bioventus, USA), Hyalgan((R)) (Fidia Pharma Inc., USA), Supartz (Bioventus, USA), and Euflexxa((R)) (Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA). Utility scores for HA products were obtained by extracting Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index pain, stiffness and function from randomized controlled trials and converting them to health utilities index mark 3 scores. The cost of a treatment included the cost of the HA injection, cost of a knee injection procedure and cost of a doctor''s visit for each required injection. Cost-utility in 2015 USD per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved was calculated for each HA product, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to compare the effectiveness of HA products to one another and to conventional care. RESULTS: When compared to conventional care, all investigated HA products were cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. The HA product Euflexxa had the most favorable cost-utility ratio ($5785.52/QALY) when compared to all other HA brands.

15096,Cost-effectiveness analysis of additional docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy from a Chinese perspective,"The E3805 (CHAARTED) study found that docetaxel combined with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly improved overall survival of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. This study aims to determine whether docetaxel combined with ADT is a cost-effective strategy for advanced prostate cancer in China. According to the E3805 study, two groups (docetaxel + ADT and ADT alone) and three health states [progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death] were analysed in a Markov model. All medical costs were calculated from the Chinese societal perspective. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were applied as the primary outcome. Overall, the addition of docetaxel was estimated to increase the cost by $12 816.93, with a gain of 0.48 QALY. Additionally, for patients with high-volume disease, the increased cost and effectiveness were $14 627.75 and 0.69 QALYs in docetaxel + ADT group versus the ADT alone group, and the ICER was $21 199.63 per QALY. These ICERs are far more than the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $20 301 per QALY in China.

15097,Cost-effectiveness analysis of apixaban compared to low-molecularweight heparins and vitamin k antagonists for treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism,"OBJECTIVE: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a 6-month treatment of apixaban (10 mg/12h, first 7 days; 5 mg/12h afterwards) for the treatment of the first event of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of recurrences, versus low-molecular-weight heparins/vitamin K antagonists treatment (LMWH/VKA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with 13 health states was used for describing the course of the disease. Efficacy and safety data were obtained from AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT clinical trials; health outcomes were measured as life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The chosen perspective of this analysis has been the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Drugs, management of VTE and complications costs were obtained from several Spanish data sources (euro, 2014). A 3% discount rate was applied to health outcomes and costs. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed in order to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Apixaban was the most effective therapy with 7.182 LYG and 5.865 QALY, versus 7.160 LYG and 5.838 QALYs with LMWH/VKA. Furthermore, apixaban had a lower total cost (euro13,374.70 vs euro13,738.30). Probabilistic SA confirmed dominance of apixaban (led to better health outcomes with less associated costs) in 89% of the simulations.

15098,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of interferon-free direct-acting antiviral-based regimens for hepatitis C treatment: the French case,"We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of new DAA-based regimen use in France. A Markov model simulated chronic hepatitis C (CHC) treatment interventions with IFN-based and IFN-free regimens at stage of fibrosis >/=F3, >/=F2 or regardless of fibrosis stage, and treatment either with the least or the most expensive combination. It estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). It also assessed the budget impact over 5 years of treating all CHC-screened patients, regardless of fibrosis, assuming </=20 000 patients treated/year and priority to >/=F3. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. For genotypes (G) 1-4, the initiation of IFN-free regardless of fibrosis was a cost-effective strategy compared to prior standard of care (SOC) initiated at stage F2: euro40 400-88 300/QALY gained in G1; similar results were obtained for patients infected with G4. Considering G2-3, the most cost-effective strategy was IFN-based regimens regardless of fibrosis compared to prior SOC initiated at stage F2: euro21 300 and euro19 400/QALY gained, respectively; the strategy with IFN-free regimens being more effective but not cost-effective at current costs. The budget impact of treating all CHC-screened patients over 5 years would range between 3.5 and 7.2 billion euro, depending on whether one considers the least or the most expensive combination of new DAAs and whether one treats G2-3 with IFN-based or IFN-free new DAAs.
