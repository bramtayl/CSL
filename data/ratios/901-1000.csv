901,Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for patients with chest pain,"BACKGROUND: Many noninvasive tests exist to determine whether patients should undergo coronary angiography. The routine use of coronary angiography without previous noninvasive testing is typically not advocated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for patients with chest pain. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published data. TARGET POPULATION: Patients who present with chest pain, have no history of myocardial infarction, and are able to perform an exercise stress test. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: No testing, exercise electrocardiography, exercise echocardiography, exercise single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and coronary angiography alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of routine coronary angiography compared with exercise echocardiography was $36,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved for 55-year-old men with typical angina. For 55-year-old men with atypical angina, exercise echocardiography compared with exercise electrocardiography cost $41,900 per QALY saved. If adequate exercise echocardiography was not available, exercise SPECT cost $54,800 per QALY saved compared with exercise electrocardiography for these patients. For 55-year-old men with nonspecific chest pain, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of exercise electrocardiography compared with no testing was $57,700 per QALY saved. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: On the basis of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there is a 75% chance that exercise echocardiography costs less than $50,900 per QALY saved for 55-year-old men with atypical angina. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise electrocardiography or exercise echocardiography resulted in reasonable cost-effectiveness ratios for patients at mild to moderate risk for coronary artery disease in terms of age, sex, and type of chest pain.

In addition, the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in normoalbuminuric patients was recently demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating all patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Markov model simulating the progression of diabetic nephropathy. DATA SOURCES: Randomized trials estimating the progression of diabetic nephropathy with and without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. TARGET POPULATION: Patients 50 years of age with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose level > or = 7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL]). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, screening for microalbuminuria, or screening for gross proteinuria. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and marginal cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Screening for gross proteinuria had the highest cost and the lowest benefit. Compared with screening for microalbuminuria, treating all patients was more expensive ($15240 and $14940 per patient) but was associated with increased quality-adjusted life expectancy (11.82 and 11.78 quality-adjusted life-years).

920,Low-molecular-weight heparins compared with unfractionated heparin for treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis. A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Low-molecular-weight heparins are effective for treating venous thrombosis, but their cost-effectiveness has not been rigorously assessed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparins compared with unfractionated heparin for treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis. DESIGN: Decision model. DATA SOURCES: Probabilities for clinical outcomes were obtained from a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement and other sources. TARGET POPULATION: Two hypothetical cohorts of 60-year-old men with acute deep venous thrombosis. TIME HORIZON: Patient lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Fixed-dose low-molecular-weight heparin or adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. An in-patient hospital setting was used for the base-case analysis. Secondary analyses examined outpatient treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Total costs for inpatient treatment were $26,516 for low-molecular-weight heparin and $26,361 for unfractionated heparin. The cost of initial care was higher in patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin, but this was partly offset by reduced costs for early complications. Low-molecular-weight heparin treatment increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by approximately 0.02 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness of inpatient low-molecular-weight heparin treatment was $7820 per QALY gained. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin was cost saving when as few as 8% of patients were treated at home. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: When late complications were assumed to occur 25% less frequently in patients who received unfractionated heparin, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased to almost $75,000 per QALY gained. When late complications were assumed to occur 25% less frequently in patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin, this treatment resulted in a net cost savings. Inpatient low-molecular-weight heparin treatment became cost saving when its pharmacy cost was reduced by 31% or more, when it reduced the yearly incidence of late complications by at least 7%, when as few as 8% of patients were treated entirely as outpatients, or when at least 13% of patients were eligible for early discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Low-molecular-weight heparins are highly cost-effective for inpatient management of venous thrombosis.

921,A prospective study of the cost-utility of the multichannel cochlear implant,"CONTEXT: Prior clinical studies have indicated that cochlear implantation provides benefits to individuals with advanced sensorineural hearing loss who are unable to gain effective speech recognition with hearing aids. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for adults receiving multichannel cochlear implants. DESIGN: Prospective 12-month multicenter study using preference-based quality-of-life measures and total cost determinations, comparing profoundly hearing-impaired adult subjects with and without cochlear implants. SETTING: Hospital-based and patient-resource clinics. PATIENTS: Severely to profoundly hearing-impaired adult recipients of a cochlear implant and adults eligible for the device who had not yet received it. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical assessment of implant participants included medical and audiologic (speech understanding) data at the time of enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months. All participants' health-utility was assessed at the time of enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months using the Health Utility Index. One-year medical resource utilization and cost data included bills related to implants, patient diaries, charge estimates from clinical sites, and published literature. A decision model was developed to determine cost per QALY. RESULTS: Of the 84 enrolled adults, 62 (75%) completed the study. Mean health-utility scores at the time of enrollment were identical between groups. The marginal 12-month health-utility gain for implant recipients was 0.20; 90% of this improvement was achieved within 6 months. For patients with a mean 22-year life expectancy, the marginal cost per QALY was $14,670. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, multichannel cochlear implants significantly improved recipients' performance on measures of speech understanding and ratings of health-utility within 6 months of implantation.

922,Population based cost utility study of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost utility of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Population based cost utility model (healthcare perspective). Data on use of health services were obtained from case records and routine morbidity data and utility values from a EuroQol survey. Local and published costs were used. Effectiveness was modelled using data on relative risk reductions from a randomised trial of interferon beta-1b. SETTING: Tayside region, 1993-5. SUBJECTS: 132 ambulatory people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Rate of relapse and proportion becoming wheelchair dependent over three years. RESULTS: The number needed to treat for 30 months to delay time to wheelchair dependence in one person by nine months was 18 (95% confidence interval 5 to 26). For every 18 people treated for 30 months, six relapses would be prevented, gaining 0.397 discounted QALYs. The cost per QALY gained was 1 024 667 pounds sterling (276 466 pounds sterling to 485 499 pound sterling). If treatment was restricted to patients attending neurology services, the number needed to treat was 14 (cost per QALY gained 833 pounds sterling 514 (161 358 pounds sterling to infinity)). The cost per QALY gained was not sensitive to changes in cost which took account of a societal perspective.

Alternatives to penicillins may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. Therefore, we used decision analysis to calculate maximum expected utility and minimum cost for skin-testing or not skin-testing patients who have endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus that is susceptible to cloxacillin and who have a questionable history of immediate-type hypersensitivity to penicillin. We used known probabilities of intermediate outcomes, actual costs, and measured utilities and included one-way sensitivity analysis. Whether utility, cost, or average cost-utility was the outcome of interest, skin-testing was preferred to no skin-testing in most conditions. Patients who have endocarditis due to S. aureus that is susceptible to cloxacillin and who also have a questionable history of immediate-type hypersensitivity to penicillin should be skin-tested before starting antibiotic therapy.",1999-01-02039,10524971,Clin Infect Dis,P Dodek,1999,29 / 5,1251-6,No,10524971,"P Dodek; P Phillips; Questionable history of immediate-type hypersensitivity to penicillin in Staphylococcal endocarditis: treatment based on skin-test results vers-us empirical alternative treatment--A decision analysis, Clin Infect Dis, 1999-Nov; 29(5):1537-6591; 1251-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Antibiotic treatment based on penicillin skin-test results vs. No skin test and treatment with vancomycin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-49931.03,Canada,1997,-58149.94
930,Cost effectiveness of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in young adults,"The cost effectiveness of ligament reconstruction for acute anterior cruciate ligament tears in young adults was compared with the cost effectiveness of nonoperative management. A decision tree was constructed to predict the expected functional outcomes for operative and nonoperative treatment. Outcome probabilities were derived from the surgical and natural history literature. Cost data were based on averaged figures from the senior author's institution. Utility values were determined from a questionnaire administered to 285 local university students. Cost effectiveness was calculated in terms of dollars spent per additional quality adjusted life year provided by the surgical reconstruction for the initial 7 years after an injury. The operative strategy provided 5.10 quality adjusted life years versus 3.49 years for nonoperative treatment, yielding a marginal effectiveness of 1.61 quality adjusted life years. The estimated total costs of the operative and nonoperative strategies were $11,768 and $2333, respectively, for a marginal cost of $9435. The resulting marginal cost effectiveness ratio was $5857 per quality adjusted life year. These data suggest that, when based on functional outcomes, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a cost effective method of treatment for acute tears in young adults.

The baseline analysis showed that strategy II is more cost-effective than strategy I, with marginal cost-effectiveness ratios of $7,267. 67 and $12,833.34, respectively, compared with a strategy of no intervention. Sensitivity analysis showed that if the cost of the two-dose vaccine could be reduced to less than $57, the strategy of universal vaccination would be the preferred immunization strategy.

METHOD: A decision-analysis model was designed wherein systematic screening with the tuberculin skin test of all elderly patients newly admitted to facilities was compared to public health interventions restricted to investigation of cases and contacts with symptoms of tuberculosis after suspected exposure. Differences in life-years (LY), quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), cost per QALY and LY gained, annual cost per 1000 institutional patients were calculated in a health-care system perspective. RESULTS: In every situation analysed, screening and chemoprophylaxis were more effective. The cost per LY gained was within an acceptable range: $3437 per LY with a 0.6% nosocomial transmission rate and $7552 per LY when no nosocomial transmission was postulated.

The model needs data specified for costs, quality of life, risks, and mortality rates. As an illustration, the CE of HRT in Sweden is calculated. Two treatment strategies are evaluated for asymptomatic women: estrogen-only therapy and estrogen combined with a progestin. The model produces similar results compared with earlier studies. The CE ratios improve with the size of the risk reduction and generally with age. Further, estrogen-only therapy is associated with a lower cost per gained effectiveness unit compared with combined therapy. Uncertainty surrounding the long-term effects of HRT means that the CE estimates should be interpreted carefully. The model permits the inclusion of indirect costs and costs in added life-years, allowing the analysis to be made from a societal perspective, which is an improvement relative to previous studies.",1999-01-02043,10507194,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,N Zethraeus,1999,15 / 2,352-65,No,10507194,"N Zethraeus; M Johannesson; B Jönsson; A computer model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 1999; 15(2):0266-4623; 352-65",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hormone replacement therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Sweden,1995,Not Stated

939,The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex in AIDS,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a simulation model to project costs, life expectancy, and cost-effectiveness in discounted dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved for clinical strategies to prevent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in patients with AIDS. METHODS: We used natural history data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, efficacy and toxicity data from randomized clinical trials, and cost data from the AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey. The model permits timing of prophylaxis to be stratified by CD4 count (201-300, 101-200, 51-100, and < or = 50/mm3), and allows combinations of prophylaxis, crossover to second- and third-line agents for toxicity, and consideration of adherence, resistance, and quality of life. RESULTS: The model projects that the average HIV-infected patient with a beginning CD4 count between 201 and 300/mm3 has total lifetime costs of approximately $43,150 and a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 42.35 months. If azithromycin prophylaxis for M. avium complex is begun after the CD4 declines to 50/mm3, costs and quality-adjusted survival increase to approximately $44,040 and 42.78 months, respectively, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,000/QALY compared with no M. avium complex prophylaxis. Other prophylaxis options (i.e., rifabutin, clarithromycin, and combination therapies) either cost more but offer shorter survival, or have cost-effectiveness ratios above $260,000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis reveals that, for reasonable assumptions about quality of life, risk of infection, prophylaxis cost, adherence, and resistance, azithromycin remains the most cost-effective prophylaxis option.

941,The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex in AIDS,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a simulation model to project costs, life expectancy, and cost-effectiveness in discounted dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved for clinical strategies to prevent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in patients with AIDS. METHODS: We used natural history data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, efficacy and toxicity data from randomized clinical trials, and cost data from the AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey. The model permits timing of prophylaxis to be stratified by CD4 count (201-300, 101-200, 51-100, and < or = 50/mm3), and allows combinations of prophylaxis, crossover to second- and third-line agents for toxicity, and consideration of adherence, resistance, and quality of life. RESULTS: The model projects that the average HIV-infected patient with a beginning CD4 count between 201 and 300/mm3 has total lifetime costs of approximately $43,150 and a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 42.35 months. If azithromycin prophylaxis for M. avium complex is begun after the CD4 declines to 50/mm3, costs and quality-adjusted survival increase to approximately $44,040 and 42.78 months, respectively, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,000/QALY compared with no M. avium complex prophylaxis. Other prophylaxis options (i.e., rifabutin, clarithromycin, and combination therapies) either cost more but offer shorter survival, or have cost-effectiveness ratios above $260,000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis reveals that, for reasonable assumptions about quality of life, risk of infection, prophylaxis cost, adherence, and resistance, azithromycin remains the most cost-effective prophylaxis option.

Other prophylaxis options (i.e., rifabutin, clarithromycin, and combination therapies) either cost more but offer shorter survival, or have cost-effectiveness ratios above $260,000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis reveals that, for reasonable assumptions about quality of life, risk of infection, prophylaxis cost, adherence, and resistance, azithromycin remains the most cost-effective prophylaxis option.

952,The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex in AIDS,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a simulation model to project costs, life expectancy, and cost-effectiveness in discounted dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved for clinical strategies to prevent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in patients with AIDS. METHODS: We used natural history data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, efficacy and toxicity data from randomized clinical trials, and cost data from the AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey. The model permits timing of prophylaxis to be stratified by CD4 count (201-300, 101-200, 51-100, and < or = 50/mm3), and allows combinations of prophylaxis, crossover to second- and third-line agents for toxicity, and consideration of adherence, resistance, and quality of life.

954,Mechanical ventilation of patients on long-term oxygen therapy with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: prognosis and cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prognosis and costs of mechanical ventilation in patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with long-term oxygen therapy. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. Follow-up at 1 and 5 years. Cost utility analysis. SETTING: A medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in a university hospital. PATIENTS: 20 patients with previous COPD treated with long-term oxygen therapy and needing mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality (ICU plus ward), and mortality at 1 and 5 years, and factors associated with prognosis and cost-utility were assessed. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 20 (median 20 range 12-36). Cumulative mortality was 35% in the ICU, 50% in hospital, 75% at 1 year, and 85% at 5 years. Factors significantly associated with mortality in the ICU were low levels of albumin (p = 0.05) and sodium (p = 0.01) at admission. Patients who died in hospital and in the first year after discharge had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) than survivors (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) was U.S. $26283 and U.S. $44602 in a ""best"" (cost/QALY calculated for the life expectancy in Spain) and a ""worst case scenario"" (cost/QALY calculated for a 68-year life expectancy), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Applying mechanical ventilation to COPD patients treated with long-term oxygen therapy carries a high mortality and cost. Factors significantly associated with mortality in the ICU were albumin and sodium concentrations and FEV1 in hospital and in the first year after discharge.",1999-01-02046,10401937,Intensive Care Med,J M Añón,1999,25 / 5,452-7,No,10401937,"J M Añón; A García de Lorenzo; A Zarazaga; V Gómez-Tello; G Garrido; Mechanical ventilation of patients on long-term oxygen therapy with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: prognosis and cost-utility analysis, Intensive Care Med, 1999-May; 25(5):0342-4642; 452-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mechanical ventilation vs. No mechanical ventilation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,44602,United States,1994,77891.28
955,Cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombi on initial transesophageal echocardiography: should transesophageal echocardiography be repeated before elective cardioversion? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used to expedite early cardioversion for patients with atrial fibrillation in whom TEE excludes the presence of atrial thrombi. However, the management of patients with atrial thrombi on initial TEE is controversial. Some advocate cardioversion after 3 to 4 weeks of anticoagulant therapy, whereas others perform a follow-up TEE to document thrombus resolution. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the two strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: A computer-based decision analysis model was used to compared 2 strategies: No Follow-up TEE-patients with thrombi on initial TEE complete 4 weeks of anticoagulation and undergo elective cardioversion. Follow-up TEE-patients undergo a follow-up TEE after 4 weeks of anticoagulant therapy. If a thrombus is detected, cardioversion is not performed and patients remain in atrial fibrillation; patients without a thrombus undergo cardioversion. Under our baseline estimates, the Follow-up TEE strategy is less costly and slightly more effective than the No Follow-up TEE strategy. The results are most sensitive to changes in the risk of postcardioversion stroke for patients with atrial thrombi on initial TEE who have completed 4 weeks of anticoagulation and to the probability of residual thrombi on follow-up TEE. CONCLUSIONS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis for patients with atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombi detected on initial TEE, a Follow-up TEE strategy may be more cost-effective than the No Follow-up TEE strategy. However, the decision is particularly dependent on the risk of postcardioversion stroke in patients with undetected residual left atrial thrombi.",1999-01-02047,10359923,J Am Soc Echocardiogr,T B Seto,1999,12 / 6,508-16,No,10359923,"T B Seto; D A Taira; W J Manning; Cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombi on initial transesophageal echocardiography: should transesophageal echocardiography be repeated before elective cardioversion?

958,An economic evaluation of trauma care in a Canadian lead trauma hospital,"BACKGROUND: The objective was to determine the average cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of treating trauma victims at a tertiary trauma hospital and to determine the cost-effectiveness of trauma care at this center. The setting was a tertiary trauma center in the province of Ontario, Canada. The study population consisted of consecutive trauma admissions with ISS > 12 from April, 1994 to April, 1996. The study was of a retrospective cohort design with a cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The hospital perspective was taken. Costs were determined from a retrospective cohort using a hospital-based case-costing system. Utility estimates for calculation of QALYs gained were obtained using a cross-sectional survey design. Cost-effectiveness was determined by estimating the incremental cost/QALY attributable to treatment at the trauma center. Sensitivity analysis was employed to vary assumptions about the proportion of costs and increased survival. RESULTS: 484 patients with a median age of 39 years and a median ISS of 22 were studied. The average cost per QALY was $1,721, with a maximum value of $3,861. The increase in cost per QALY gained for treatment in a tertiary care center as opposed to a nontrauma center was $4,303, assuming a 20% increase in survival and assuming that the existence of the center increased the cost of care by 50%. The incremental cost/QALY ranged from $191 to $15,492 in the sensitivity analysis varying assumptions about the increased proportion of costs and survival attributable to care at the tertiary trauma center. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first economic evaluation of tertiary trauma care which includes both costs as opposed to charges as well as estimates of the QALYs gained.

960,Is carotid endarterectomy cost-effective in symptomatic patients with moderate (50% to 69%) stenosis?,"OBJECTIVE: Recently published data from the North American Carotid Endarterectomy Trial revealed a benefit for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in symptomatic patients with moderate (50% to 69%) carotid stenosis. This benefit was significant but small (absolute stroke risk reduction at 5 years, 6.5%; 22.2% vs 15.7%), and thus, the authors of this study were tentative in the recommendation of operation for these patients. To better elucidate whether CEA in symptomatic patients with moderate carotid stenosis is a proper allocation of societal resources, we examined the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov process model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CEA versus medical treatment for a hypothetical cohort of 66-year-old patients with moderate carotid stenosis. This model allowed the comparison of not only the immediate hospitalization but also the lifetime costs and benefits of these two strategies. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), defined as the incremental lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life year saved. We assumed an operative stroke and death rate of 6.6% and a declining risk of ipsilateral stroke after the ischemic event with medical treatment (first year, 9.3%; second year, 4%; subsequent years, 3%). The hospitalization cost of CEA ($6,420) and the annual costs of major stroke ($26,880), minor stroke ($798), and aspirin therapy ($63) were estimated from a hospital cost accounting system and the literature. RESULTS: CEA for moderate carotid stenosis increased the survival rate by 0.13 quality-adjusted life years as compared with medical treatment at an additional lifetime cost of $580. Thus, CEA was cost-effective with a CER of $4,462. Society is usually willing to pay for interventions with CERs of less than $60,000 (eg, CERs for coronary artery bypass grafting at $9,100 and for dialysis at $53,000). CEA was not cost-effective if the perioperative risk was greater than 11.3%, if the ipsilateral stroke rate associated with medical treatment at 1 year was reduced to 4.3%, if the age of the patient exceeded 83 years, or if the cost of CEA exceeded $13,200. CONCLUSION: CEA in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis of 50% to 69% is cost-effective. Perioperative risk of stroke or death, medical and surgical stroke risk, cost of CEA, and age are important determinants of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.",1999-01-02050,10587386,J Vasc Surg,S T Patel,1999,30 / 6,1024-33,No,10587386,"S T Patel; P B Haser; P Korn; H L Bush; J S Deitch; K C Kent; Is carotid endarterectomy cost-effective in symptomatic patients with moderate (50% to 69%) stenosis?, J Vasc Surg, 1999-Dec; 30(6):0741-5214; 1024-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carotid endarterectomy vs. Medical Management,Not Stated,66 Years,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,4462,United States,1997,7195.11
961,The cost-effectiveness of endovascular repair versus open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: A decision analysis model,"PURPOSE: Endovascular repair (EVR) is a less-invasive method for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) as compared with open surgical repair (OSR). The potential benefits of EVR include increased patient acceptance, less resource utilization, and cost savings. This study was designed to determine whether the EVR of AAAs is a cost-effective alternative to OSR. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov decision analysis model to compute long-term survival rates in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients who underwent either OSR or EVR. Probability estimates of the different outcomes of the two alternative strategies were made on the basis of a review of the literature. The average costs of (1) the immediate hospitalization ($16,016 for OSR, $20,083 for EVR), (2) the complications that resulted from each procedure, (3) the subsequent interventions, and (4) the surveillance protocol were determined on the basis of average resource utilization as reported in the literature and from our hospital's cost accounting system. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: For our base-case analysis (70-year-old men with 5-cm AAAs), EVR was cost-effective with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $22,826-society usually is willing to pay for interventions with cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $60,000 (eg, cost-effectiveness ratios for coronary artery bypass grafting and dialysis are $9500 and $54,400, respectively). This conclusion did not vary significantly with increases in procedural costs for EVR (ie, if the cost of the endograft increased from $8000 to $12,000, EVR remained cost-effective with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $32,881). The cost-effectiveness of EVR was critically dependent on EVR producing a large reduction in the combined mortality and long-term morbidity rate (stroke, dialysis-dependent renal failure, major amputation, myocardial infarction) as compared with OSR (ie, a reduction in the combined mortality and long-term morbidity rate of OSR from 9.1% to 4.7% made EVR no longer cost-effective). CONCLUSION: Despite the high cost of new technology and the need for close postoperative surveillance, EVR is a cost-effective alternative for the repair of AAAs. However, the cost-effectiveness of this new technology is critically dependent on its potential to reduce morbidity and mortality rates as compared with OSR. EVR may not be cost-effective in medical centers where OSR can be performed with low risk.",1999-01-02051,10359930,J Vasc Surg,S T Patel,1999,29 / 6,958-72,No,10359930,"S T Patel; P B Haser; H L Bush; K C Kent; The cost-effectiveness of endovascular repair versus open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: A decision analysis model, J Vasc Surg, 1999-Jun; 29(6):0741-5214; 958-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular repair (EVR) vs. Open surgical repair (OSR),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,22826,United States,1997,36807.6
962,Cost-effectiveness of outpatient geriatric assessment with an intervention to increase adherence,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can be effective in inpatient units, but such inpatient settings are prohibitively expensive. If similar benefits could be obtained in outpatient settings, CGA might be a more attractive option. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness (CE) of an outpatient geriatric assessment with an intervention to increase adherence. SUBJECTS: Three hundred fifty-one community-dwelling, elderly subjects with at least one of four geriatric conditions. MEASURES: In addition to the measures of functioning, we collected data on the costs of the intervention itself and on the use of medical services in the 64 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention, which prevented functional decline, cost $273 per participant. The intervention group averaged three more visits than the control group in the first 32 weeks after the intervention, but only 1.2 extra visits in the next 32 weeks. We estimate that the costs of these additional medical services would be $473 for the 5 years after the intervention, leading to a total cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) of $10,600.

963,Cost-effectiveness of regulations against using a cellular telephone while driving,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of regulations that prohibit using a cellular telephone while driving a motor vehicle. DESIGN: Decision analysis of risks and benefits related to cellular telephones and driving. SETTING: United States population in 1997. MEASURES: Health benefits measured as the quality-adjusted life years potentially saved. Financial benefits measured as health care and other services potentially averted. Costs of regulation measured as the lost productivity derived from willingness to pay for cellular telephone calls. RESULTS: Under base-case conditions, cellular telephone calls in the United States each day accounted for about 984 reported collisions, 1,729 total collisions, 2 deaths, 317 persons with injuries, 99 lost years of life expectancy, 161 lost quality-adjusted life years, $1 million in health care costs, and $4 million in property damage and other costs. This reflected a total of about 35 million telephone calls while driving, 70 million calling minutes, and $33 million in total value to society. The estimated cost-effectiveness ratio for a regulation restricting cellular telephone usage while driving was $300,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved, but ranged from $50,000 to $700,000 under alternative assumptions and interpretations of data. Regulations applied to teenage males could be cost-saving to society if the value of a call fell below 37 cents per minute. CONCLUSIONS: Regulations restricting cellular telephone usage while driving are less cost-effective for society than other safety measures. Nevertheless, regulations may be justifiable because the benefits and harms do not always involve the individual who has the cellular telephone. Increasing the price of a call (or adding a supplementary tax) might decrease the number of discretionary calls, be cost-saving for society, and be life-saving for individuals.",1999-01-02053,9917014,Med Decis Making,D A Redelmeier,1999,19 / 1,1-8,No,9917014,"D A Redelmeier; M C Weinstein; Cost-effectiveness of regulations against using a cellular telephone while driving, Med Decis Making, 1999 Jan-Mar; 19(1):0272-989X; 1-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,National regulation against using a cellular telephone while driving vs. No regulation against using a cellular telephone while driving,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,300000,United States,1997,483758.88
964,Cost-effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the use of cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the economic impact of donepezil in the treatment of mild or moderate AD. BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses show the relationship between resources used (costs) and health benefits achieved (effects) for an intervention compared with an alternative strategy. METHODS: We developed a model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared with no treatment. We determined costs per quality-adjusted life-years gained, a measurement that enhances the comparability of diverse studies. The model projects the progression of AD patients into more severe disease stages and into nursing homes. Data from a randomized clinical trial of donepezil were used to assess the drug's impact on the 6-week probabilities of progression. Data on the costs and health-related quality of life associated with different disease stages and settings were taken from published estimates and our companion cross-sectional study, respectively. RESULTS: Donepezil costs are partially offset by a reduction in the costs of care due to enhancement in cognitive functioning and the delay to more costly disease stages and settings. The magnitude of this cost offset and of the effect of donepezil on health-related quality of life depends on the model's assumptions about the duration of the drug effect, where controlled data are lacking. If the drug effect exceeds 2 years, the model predicts that for mild AD the drug would pay for itself in terms of cost offsets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the cost-effectiveness model presented here suggest that donepezil may be cost-effective but additional controlled data on long-term drug efficacy are needed.",1999-01-02054,10214734,Neurology,P J Neumann,1999,52 / 6,1138-45,No,10214734,"P J Neumann; R C Hermann; K M Kuntz; S S Araki; S B Duff; J Leon; P A Berenbaum; P A Goldman; L W Williams; M C Weinstein; Cost-effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease, Neurology, 1999-Apr-12; 52(6):1526-632X; 1138-45",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Donepezil vs. No therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,18 Months,3.00,3.00,9300,United States,1997,14996.53

966,Which unruptured cerebral aneurysms should be treated? A cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which unruptured cerebral aneurysms should be treated considering the risks. benefits, and costs. BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic unruptured cerebral aneurysms are commonly treated by surgical clipping or endovascular coil embolization to prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis comparing surgical clipping and endovascular coil embolization with no treatment for unruptured aneurysms. Eight clinical scenarios were defined based on aneurysm size, symptoms, and history of SAH from a different aneurysm. Health outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women were modeled over the projected lifetime of the cohort. Costs were assessed from the societal perspective. We compared net quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost per QALY of each therapy to no treatment. RESULTS: For an asymptomatic unruptured aneurysm less than 10 mm in diameter in patients with no history of SAH from a different aneurysm, both procedures resulted in a net loss in QALYs, and confidence intervals (CI) were not compatible with a benefit from treatment (clipping, loss of 1.6 QALY [95% CI 1.1 to 2.1]; coiling, loss of 0.6 QALY [95% CI 0.2 to 0.8]). For larger aneurysms (> or = 10 mm), those producing symptoms by compressing neighboring nerves and brain structures, or in patients with a history of SAH from a different aneurysm, treatment was cost-effective. Coiling appeared more effective and cost-effective than clipping but these differences depended on relatively uncertain model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of small, asymptomatic, unruptured cerebral aneurysms in patients without a history of SAH worsens clinical outcomes, and thus is neither effective nor cost-effective.

976,Which unruptured cerebral aneurysms should be treated? A cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which unruptured cerebral aneurysms should be treated considering the risks. benefits, and costs. BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic unruptured cerebral aneurysms are commonly treated by surgical clipping or endovascular coil embolization to prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis comparing surgical clipping and endovascular coil embolization with no treatment for unruptured aneurysms. Eight clinical scenarios were defined based on aneurysm size, symptoms, and history of SAH from a different aneurysm. Health outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women were modeled over the projected lifetime of the cohort. Costs were assessed from the societal perspective. We compared net quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost per QALY of each therapy to no treatment. RESULTS: For an asymptomatic unruptured aneurysm less than 10 mm in diameter in patients with no history of SAH from a different aneurysm, both procedures resulted in a net loss in QALYs, and confidence intervals (CI) were not compatible with a benefit from treatment (clipping, loss of 1.6 QALY [95% CI 1.1 to 2.1]; coiling, loss of 0.6 QALY [95% CI 0.2 to 0.8]).

982,A prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of vertical banded gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of morbid obesity is gaining in popularity, because conservative treatment is ineffective. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis has never been performed and is the main goal of the present study. METHODS: 21 consecutive morbidly obese patients were tested before and after vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Quality of life was assessed with the Nottingham Health Profile and a visual analogue scale. A prevalence-based cost-of-illness analysis of morbid obesity was performed and the cost-effectiveness of VBG assessed. RESULTS: VBG resulted in a significant weight loss and an improved quality of life. The improved quality of life combined with 3.6 life-years gained after VBG resulted in 12 quality adjusted life-years (QALY) gained in a lifelong scenario. Lifelong costs of illness of morbidly obese persons ranged from $8,304 to $9,367. Total direct costs of VBG were $5,865. The percentage of patients performing paid labor increased from 19% before VBG to 48% after VBG, resulting in an average productivity gain of $2,765 per year. In summary, the cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that surgical treatment of morbid obesity by means of VBG saves $4,004 to $3,928 per QALY (overall dominance). CONCLUSION: Because treatment of morbid obesity with VBG results in QALYs gained and less costs, there is no doubt that this procedure should be introduced or continued from a societal point of view.",1999-01-02056,10605908,Obes Surg,W G van Gemert,1999,9 / 5,484-91,No,10605908,"W G van Gemert; E M Adang; M Kop; G Vos; J W Greve; P B Soeters; A prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of vertical banded gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity, Obes Surg, 1999-Oct; 9(5):0960-8923; 484-91",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,1997,Not Stated
983,Effect and offset of effect of treatments for hip fracture on health outcomes,"We investigated the cost-effectiveness of treatments that reduce the risk of hip fracture using a computer simulation model. Cost-effectiveness was measured as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using a threshold value for cost-effectiveness of $30,000/QALY gained. The baseline simulations assumed a 5-year intervention that reduced the risk of hip fracture by 50% during the intervention period, and an effect which reversed to the pretreatment risk during the next 5 years. Sensitivity analyses included the effects of age, different fracture risks, and different treatment costs and duration of therapeutic effect once treatment was stopped. Cost-effectiveness was critically dependent upon absolute risk determined by the age and the relative risk of hip fracture at any given age. Reasonable cost-effectiveness was shown even with relatively high intervention costs for women with a risk about twice the average at the age of 70 or more years. Cost-effectiveness was critically dependent upon the assumptions made concerning offset of effect of intervention after the end of treatment. Where no residual effect was assumed, it was difficult to show cost-effectiveness from any intervention except for the most effective and least expensive. Conversely, cost-effectiveness improved considerably where effectiveness persisted for a longer time.

Cost-effectiveness was measured as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using a threshold value for cost-effectiveness of $30,000/QALY gained. The baseline simulations assumed a 5-year intervention that reduced the risk of hip fracture by 50% during the intervention period, and an effect which reversed to the pretreatment risk during the next 5 years. Sensitivity analyses included the effects of age, different fracture risks, and different treatment costs and duration of therapeutic effect once treatment was stopped. Cost-effectiveness was critically dependent upon absolute risk determined by the age and the relative risk of hip fracture at any given age. Reasonable cost-effectiveness was shown even with relatively high intervention costs for women with a risk about twice the average at the age of 70 or more years. Cost-effectiveness was critically dependent upon the assumptions made concerning offset of effect of intervention after the end of treatment. Where no residual effect was assumed, it was difficult to show cost-effectiveness from any intervention except for the most effective and least expensive.

996,Cost-effectiveness of treatment for threshold retinopathy of prematurity,"OBJECTIVE: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of adverse visual outcomes in premature infants. Both laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy have been demonstrated in clinical trials to be efficacious in reducing the incidence of visual loss occurring secondary to threshold ROP. Visual data recently have become available concerning the long-term clinical efficacy of both treatments, as have data concerning the utility value of visual states in general. Accordingly, we undertook an analysis to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy in the treatment of threshold ROP. DESIGN: A computer simulation economic model is presented to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation therapy, compared with the natural course of the disease, for treating premature infants with threshold ROP. The model applies long-term visual data from previous clinical trials, utility analysis, decision analysis, and economic principles, such as present value analysis, to account for the time value of money to arrive at a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per QALY gained from laser therapy and cryotherapy. RESULTS: Laser photocoagulation therapy for threshold ROP costs $678 1998 US dollars (at a 3% discount rate to account for the time value of money) for each QALY gained from treatment.

Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) has been shown to be useful in treating ALS. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of rhIGF-I therapy in patients who have ALS. DESIGN: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective on 177 patients who received treatment with rhIGF-I or placebo in a North American randomised clinical trial. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of rhIGF-I using resource utilisation and functional status measurements from the clinical trial. Costs were estimated from 1996 US Medicare reimbursement schedules. Utility weights were elicited from ALS healthcare providers using the standard gamble technique. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The overall cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for rhIGF-I therapy compared with placebo was $US67,440. For the subgroups of patients who were progressing rapidly or were in earlier stages of disease at enrolment, rhIGF-I cost $US52,823 and $US43,197 per QALY gained, respectively.
