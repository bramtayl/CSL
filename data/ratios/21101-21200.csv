21101,Cost-Effectiveness and National Effects of Initiating Colorectal Cancer Screening for Average-Risk Persons at Age 45 Years Instead of 50 Years,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The American Cancer Society has recommended initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening at age 45 years instead of 50 years. We estimated the cost effectiveness and national effects of adopting this recommendation. METHODS: We compared screening strategies and alternative resource allocations in a validated Markov model. We based national projections on screening participation rates by age and census data. RESULTS: Screening colonoscopy initiation at age 45 years instead of 50 years in 1000 persons averted 4 CRCs and 2 CRC deaths, gained 14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cost $33,900/QALY gained, and required 758 additional colonoscopies. These 758 colonoscopies could instead be used to screen 231 currently unscreened 55-year-old persons or 342 currently unscreened 65-year-old persons, through age 75 years. These alternatives averted 13-14 CRC cases and 6-7 CRC deaths and gained 27-28 discounted QALYs while saving $163,700-$445,800. Improving colonoscopy completion rates after abnormal results from a fecal immunochemical test yielded greater benefits and savings. Initiation of fecal immunochemical testing at age 45 years instead of 50 years cost $7700/QALY gained. Shifting current age-specific screening rates to 5 years earlier could avert 29,400 CRC cases and 11,100 CRC deaths over the next 5 years but would require 10.7 million additional colonoscopies and cost an incremental $10.4 billion. Improving screening rates to 80% in persons who are 50-75 years old would avert nearly 3-fold more CRC deaths at one third the incremental cost. CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model analysis, we found that starting CRC screening at age 45 years is likely to be cost effective. However, greater benefit, at lower cost, could be achieved by increasing participation rates for unscreened older and higher-risk persons.",2019-01-29954,30930021,Gastroenterology,Uri Ladabaum,2019,157 / 1,137-148,No,30930021,"Uri Ladabaum; Ajitha Mannalithara; Reinier G S Meester; Samir Gupta; Robert E Schoen; Cost-Effectiveness and National Effects of Initiating Colorectal Cancer Screening for Average-Risk Persons at Age 45 Years Instead of 50 Years, Gastroenterology, 2019 Jul; 157(1):0016-5085; 137-148",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Screening","fecal immunochemical test yearly vs. Standard/Usual Care- FIT yearly, ages 50–75 years",Not Stated,75 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7700,United States,2018,7936.24

21107,Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing Depression Among At-Risk Youths: Postintervention and 2-Year Follow-Up,"OBJECTIVE:: Youth depression can be prevented, yet few programs are offered. Decision makers lack cost information. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral prevention program (CBP) versus usual care. METHODS:: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted with data from a randomized controlled trial of 316 youths, ages 13-17, randomly assigned to CBP or usual care. Youths were at risk of depression because of a prior depressive disorder or subthreshold depressive symptoms, or both, and had parents with a prior or current depressive disorder. Outcomes included depression-free days (DFDs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. RESULTS:: Nine months after baseline assessment, youths in CBP experienced 12 more DFDs (p=.020) and .018 more QALYs (p=.007), compared with youths in usual care, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $24,558 per QALY. For youths whose parents were not depressed at baseline, CBP youths had 26 more DFDs (p=.001), compared with those in usual care (ICER=$10,498 per QALY). At 33 months postbaseline, youths in CBP had 40 more DFDs (p=.05) (ICER=$12,787 per QALY). At 33 months, CBP youths whose parents were not depressed at baseline had 91 more DFDs (p=.001) (ICER=$13,620 per QALY). For youths with a currently depressed parent at baseline, CBP was not significantly more effective than usual care at either 9 or 33 months, and costs were higher.

21109,Cost-Effectiveness of the Adjuvant Recombinant Zoster Vaccine in Japanese Adults Aged 65 Years and Older,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) rises steeply after the age of 50 years and the number of HZ cases and complications such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is predicted to increase because of the ageing population. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) compared with no vaccine for the Japanese population aged >/= 65 years. METHODS: A multi-cohort static Markov model with a cycle length of 1 year was used to follow a hypothetical cohort of 1 million people aged >/= 65 years over their remaining lifetime. Vaccination at >/= 65 years was used in alignment with the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines recommended from 65 years. Japan-specific data inputs for the model were obtained from local data sources. Age-stratified vaccine efficacy and waning rates were based on published clinical trial data. In the base-case analysis, vaccine coverage was assumed to be 40% with a second dose compliance of 95%. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 2% annually and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from both a payer''s and the societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore the overall uncertainty in the model. RESULTS: Vaccination with RZV was projected to prevent 48,943 HZ cases and 12,136 PHN cases per million people aged >/= 65 years compared with no vaccination. The incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were yen9.99 billion and 2314 QALYs from a payer''s perspective and yen9.34 billion and 2314 QALYs from a societal perspective. The resulting ICERs were approximately yen4,320,000 and yen4,040,000 per QALY gained from a payer''s and the societal perspective, respectively. The ICER remained below a willingness-to-pay threshold of yen5,000,000 for most sensitivity analyses carried out. CONCLUSION: Vaccination against HZ with RZV would be cost-effective compared with no vaccination for the Japanese population aged >/= 65 years. TRIAL REGISTRATION: GSK study identifier: HO-16-17837.

21110,Cost Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Once-Weekly Dulaglutide in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of semaglutide versus dulaglutide, as an add-on to metformin monotherapy, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), from a Canadian societal perspective. METHODS: The Swedish Institute for Health Economics Cohort Model of T2D was used to assess the cost effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 or 1.0 mg) versus once-weekly dulaglutide (0.75 or 1.5 mg) over a 40-year time horizon. Using data from the SUSTAIN 7 trial, which demonstrated comparatively greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index and systolic blood pressure with semaglutide, compared with dulaglutide, a deterministic base-case and scenario simulation were conducted. The robustness of the results was evaluated with probabilistic sensitivity analyses and 15 deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The base-case analysis indicated that semaglutide is a dominant treatment option, compared with dulaglutide. Semaglutide was associated with lower total costs (Canadian dollars [CAN$]) versus dulaglutide for both low-dose (CAN$113,287 vs. CAN$113,690; cost-saving: CAN$403) and high-dose (CAN$112,983 vs. CAN$113,695; cost-saving: CAN$711) comparisons. Semaglutide resulted in increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and QALY gains, compared with dulaglutide, for both low-dose (11.10 vs. 11.07 QALYs; + 0.04 QALYs) and high-dose (11.12 vs. 11.07 QALYs; + 0.05 QALYs) comparisons. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that for 66-73% of iterations, semaglutide was either dominant or was considered cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of CAN$50,000. CONCLUSIONS: From a Canadian societal perspective, semaglutide may be a cost-effective treatment option versus dulaglutide in patients with T2D who are inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.",2019-01-29961,30927241,Pharmacoeconom Open,Pierre Johansen,2019,/,,No,30927241,"Pierre Johansen; Jonas Hakan-Bloch; Aiden R Liu; Peter G Bech; Sofie Persson; Lawrence A Leiter; Cost Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Once-Weekly Dulaglutide in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in Canada, Pharmacoeconom Open, 2019 Jun 25; ():2509-4262",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,semaglutide vs. Dulaglutide,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,1.50,1.50,-13433.33,Canada,2017,-10924.16

Semaglutide resulted in increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and QALY gains, compared with dulaglutide, for both low-dose (11.10 vs. 11.07 QALYs; + 0.04 QALYs) and high-dose (11.12 vs. 11.07 QALYs; + 0.05 QALYs) comparisons. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that for 66-73% of iterations, semaglutide was either dominant or was considered cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of CAN$50,000.

21112,Cost-effectiveness of public automated external defibrillators,"BACKGROUND: Despite a consistent association with improved outcomes, public automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely used in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. One of the barriers towards increased use might be cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of public AEDs to no AEDs for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States over a life-time horizon. The analysis assumed a societal perspective and results are presented as costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Model inputs were based on reviews of the literature. For the base case, we modelled an annual cardiac arrest incidence per AED of 20%. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for joint parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The no AED strategy resulted in 1.63 QALYs at a cost of $28,964. The AED strategy yielded an additional 0.26 QALYs for an incremental increase in cost of $13,793 per individual. The AED strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $53,797 per QALY gained. The yearly incidence of cardiac arrests occurring in the presence of an AED had minimal effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio except at very low incidences. In several sensitivity analyses across a plausible range of health care and societal estimates, the AED strategy remained cost-effective. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the AED strategy was cost-effective in 43%, 85%, and 91% of the scenarios at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY gained, respectively.

21114,Short-term cost-utility of degludec versus glargine U100 for patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular events: A Canadian setting (DEVOTE 9),"AIMS: To evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec (degludec) vs insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) from a Canadian public healthcare payer perspective in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who are at high risk of cardiovascular events and hypoglycaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate costs (2017 Canadian dollars [CAD]) and clinical outcomes (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) with degludec vs glargine U100 over a 2-year time horizon. The model captured first major adverse cardiovascular event, death, severe hypoglycaemia and insulin dosing. Clinical outcomes were informed by a post hoc subgroup analysis of the DEVOTE trial (NCT01959529), which compared the cardiovascular safety of degludec and glargine U100 in patients with T2D who are at high cardiovascular risk. High hypoglycaemia risk was defined as the top quartile of patients (n = 1887) based on an index of baseline hypoglycaemia risk factors. RESULTS: In patients at high hypoglycaemia risk, degludec was associated with mean cost savings (CAD 129 per patient) relative to glargine U100, driven by a lower incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and severe hypoglycaemia, which offset the slightly higher cost of treatment with degludec. A reduced risk of cardiovascular death and severe hypoglycaemia resulted in improved effectiveness (+0.0132 QALYs) with degludec relative to glargine U100. In sensitivity analyses, changes to the vast majority of model parameters did not materially affect model outcomes. CONCLUSION: Over a 2-year period, degludec improved clinical outcomes at a lower cost as compared to glargine U100 in patients with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events and hypoglycaemia.",2019-01-29970,30924579,Diabetes Obes Metab,Richard F Pollock,2019,21 / 7,1706-1714,No,30924579,"Richard F Pollock; Simon Heller; Thomas R Pieber; Vincent Woo; Jens Gundgaard; Nino Hallen; Maria Luckevich; Deniz Tutkunkardas; Bernard Zinman; DEVOTE Study Group; Short-term cost-utility of degludec versus glargine U100 for patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular events: A Canadian setting (DEVOTE 9), Diabetes Obes Metab, 2019 Jul; 21(7):1462-8902; 1706-1714",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,degludec vs. Glargine U10,High risk of hypoglycemia,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,1.50,1.50,-23380,Canada,2017,-19012.91
21115,Clinical and Economic Benefits of Upper Airway Stimulation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in a European Setting,"BACKGROUND: Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is a treatment approach for patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea who cannot adhere to continuous positive airway pressure therapy. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate added patient benefit and cost-effectiveness of UAS in the German health care system. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic Markov model to project major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke), motor vehicle collision (MVC), mortality, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. The assumed reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index with UAS compared to no treatment is based on German real-world data. Other input data were derived from the literature, public statistics, and multivariate regression. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in Euros per QALY gained, both discounted at 3%. RESULTS: UAS was projected to reduce event risks (10-year relative risk for stroke, MI, cardiovascular death, and MVC: 0.76, 0.64, 0.65, and 0.34, respectively), and to increase survival by 1.27 years.

21117,Cost effectiveness and quality of life analysis of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for refractory cardiac arrest,"BACKGROUND: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in refractory cardiac arrest (ECPR) has increased exponentially. ECPR is a resource intensive service and its cost effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. We sought to complete a cost analysis with modelling of cost effectiveness and quality of life outcomes. We sought to complete a cost analysis with modelling of cost effectiveness and quality of life outcomes of patients who have undergone ECPR. METHODS: Using data on all extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) patients at two ECMO centres in Sydney, Australia; we completed a costing analysis of ECPR patients. A Markov model of cost, quality of life and survival outcomes was developed to examine cost per QALY estimates and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was completed to assess the probability of cost effectiveness for base case and variations. RESULTS: Sixty-two consecutive ECPR patients were analysed; mean age of 51.9 +/- 13.6 years, 38 (61%) were in hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). Twenty-five patients (40%) survived to hospital discharge; all with a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 or 2. The mean cost per ECPR patient was AUD 75,165 (euro50,535; +/-AUD 75,737). Over 10 years ECPR was estimated to add a mean gain of 3.0 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) per patient with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD 25,212 (euro16,890) per QALY, increasing to 4.0 QALYs and an ICER of AUD 18,829 (euro12,614) over a 15-year survival scenario.

21118,Cost-effectiveness of the treatments for critical limb ischemia in the elderly population,"OBJECTIVE: The treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI), with the intention to prevent limb loss, is often an intensive and expensive therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of endovascular and conservative treatment of elderly CLI patients unsuitable for surgery. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, data were gathered in two Dutch peripheral hospitals. CLI patients aged 70 years or older were included in the outpatient clinic. Exclusion criteria were malignant disease, lack of language skills, and cognitive impairment; 195 patients were included and 192 patients were excluded. After a multidisciplinary vascular conference, patients were divided into three treatment groups (endovascular revascularization, surgical revascularization, or conservative therapy). Subanalyses based on age were made (70-79 years and >/=80 years). The follow-up period was 2 years. Cost-effectiveness of endovascular and conservative treatment was quantified using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in euros per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: At baseline, patients allocated to surgical revascularization had better health states, but the health states of endovascular revascularization and conservative therapy patients were comparable. With an ICER of euro38,247.41/QALY ( approximately $50,869/QALY), endovascular revascularization was cost-effective compared with conservative therapy. This is favorable compared with the Dutch applicable threshold of euro80,000/QALY ( approximately $106,400/QALY). The subanalyses also established that endovascular revascularization is a cost-effective alternative for conservative treatment both in patients aged 70 to 79 years (ICER euro29,898.36/QALY; approximately $39,765/QALY) and in octogenarians (ICER euro56,810.14/QALY; approximately $75,557/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that endovascular revascularization is cost-effective compared with conservative treatment of CLI patients older than 70 years and also in octogenarians. Given the small absolute differences in costs and effects, physicians should also consider individual circumstances that can alter the outcome of the intervention.

21123,The Impact of Price Reductions After Loss of Exclusivity in a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Fingolimod Versus Interferon Beta-1a for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses tend not to take into account the availability of lower-priced generics following loss of exclusivity (LOE) of branded products. By not considering these generics, which are typically adopted quickly, total costs are likely to be overestimated and may be unreflective of real-world payer conditions in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of including future price reductions following LOE on the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod versus intramuscularly administered interferon beta-1a (IM IFNbeta-1a) as treatments for multiple sclerosis. METHODS: This model was adopted from a previously published Markov model and was conducted from a U.S. payer perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis entered the model and received either fingolimod (an oral therapy) or IM IFNbeta-1a (an injectable). These treatments reflect the interventions studied in the TRANSFORMS randomized clinical trial. Clinical, cost, and utility inputs were based on a recent cost-effectiveness review of therapies for multiple sclerosis. To model LOE, price reductions and the proportion of patients switching to generic versions following LOE were based on published estimates. Price reductions varied to reflect the difference in product types (oral vs. large molecule injectable). Assumptions were also made around the proportion of patients switching to generic versions over time following LOE and the projected date of LOE. Outcomes included per-patient total direct costs (medication, administration and monitoring, and disease-related costs including relapses), quality-adjusted life-years, and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: Assuming no price reductions following LOE, fingolimod was considered cost-effective versus IM IFNbeta-1a ($118,434 per quality-adjusted life-year), despite having higher total direct costs over 10 years ($475,740 vs. $446,792). When including future price reductions following LOE, total direct costs were reduced with fingolimod and were lower than those accrued with IM IFNbeta-1a over the model time horizon ($308,570 vs. $442,653). Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to changes in both clinical parameters and medication costs. Scenario analyses demonstrated that an earlier date of LOE was associated with lower total costs. CONCLUSIONS: Health economic models may predict higher total costs when the price reductions following LOE are not considered. Here, oral fingolimod was seen to be cost-saving versus IM IFNbeta-1a over the model time horizon when such price reductions were included. The cost implications of not accounting for future price changes may determine whether an intervention is considered cost-effective and as such may influence reimbursement decisions based on cost-effectiveness thresholds. Multiple product types (e.g., oral, injectable, and infused agents) have been approved for use as treatments for multiple sclerosis in the United States, and LOE is likely to have a different effect on each of these therapies.

21125,Cost-effectiveness of Intraoperative MRI for Treatment of High-Grade Gliomas,"Background Intraoperative MRI has been shown to improve gross-total resection of high-grade glioma. However, to the knowledge of the authors, the cost-effectiveness of intraoperative MRI has not been established. Purpose To construct a clinical decision analysis model for assessing intraoperative MRI in the treatment of high-grade glioma. Materials and Methods An integrated five-state microsimulation model was constructed to follow patients with high-grade glioma. One-hundred-thousand patients treated with intraoperative MRI were compared with 100 000 patients who were treated without intraoperative MRI from initial resection and debulking until death (median age at initial resection, 55 years). After the operation and treatment of complications, patients existed in one of three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease, or dead. Patients with recurrence were offered up to two repeated resections. PFS, valuation of health states (utility values), probabilities, and costs were obtained from randomized controlled trials whenever possible. Otherwise, national databases, registries, and nonrandomized trials were used. Uncertainty in model inputs was assessed by using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. A health care perspective was used for this analysis. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was used to determine cost efficacy. Results Intraoperative MRI yielded an incremental benefit of 0.18 QALYs (1.34 QALYs with intraoperative MRI vs 1.16 QALYs without) at an incremental cost of $13 447 ($176 460 with intraoperative MRI vs $163 013 without) in microsimulation modeling, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $76 442 per QALY. Because of parameter distributions, probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that intraoperative MRI had a 99.5% chance of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Conclusion Intraoperative MRI is likely to be a cost-effective modality in the treatment of high-grade glioma. (c) RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

21130,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Multifocal Intraocular Lenses Compared to Monofocal Intraocular Lenses in Cataract Surgery,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) compared to monofocal IOLs from a societal and healthcare sector perspective. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model where we simulated patients received either multifocal or monofocal IOLs during cataract surgery. Post-operatively, patients could experience spectacle dependence, glare, and haloes. Cost-effectiveness was determined by measuring the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the incremental cost in dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Treatments with an ICER below the standard willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY were considered cost effective. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were utilized to evaluate for model sensitivity to cost, utilities and other model inputs. RESULTS: Multifocal IOLs were associated with a 0.71 QALY increase at an increased cost of $3,415 compared to monofocal IOLs, leading to an ICER of $4,805/QALY from the societal and healthcare sector perspective. The cost-effectiveness model was most sensitive to patient age, probability of spectacle dependence with multifocal IOLs and monofocal IOLs, and the disutility of glasses. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found multifocal IOLs to be the cost-effective option over monofocal IOLs 99.9% of the time at a WTP threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: From a societal and healthcare sector perspective, multifocal IOLs would be considered a cost-effective strategy compared to monofocal IOLs for patients who desire a higher chance to be spectacle-free. However, more studies still need to be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy of multifocal IOLs.",2019-01-30036,30905724,Am J Ophthalmol,Jenny Q Hu,2019,/,,No,30905724,"Jenny Q Hu; Reith Sarkar; Ruti Sella; James D Murphy; Natalie A Afshari; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Multifocal Intraocular Lenses Compared to Monofocal Intraocular Lenses in Cataract Surgery, Am J Ophthalmol, 2019 Mar 21; ():0002-9394",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Surgical",multifocal intraocular lenses vs. Standard/Usual Care- Cataract surgery with monofocal intraocular lenses,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,4804.63,United States,2018,4952.04
21131,Cost-Effectiveness of Alectinib for Patients with Untreated ALK-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in China,"INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of alectinib versus crizotinib as first-line treatments for advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from the perspective of China''s healthcare system. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the clinical outcomes and costs of alectinib and crizotinib, which included five health states: progression-free (PF) without central nervous system (CNS) progression, PF with CNS progression, post-progression (PP) without CNS progression, PP with CNS progression, and death. Clinical data for transition probabilities were obtained from the ALEX trial at the updated data cutoff. Healthcare resource utilization and costs were derived from clinical expert opinions and published literature. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the results. Scenario analyses were conducted including using clinical data from the ALESIA trial in Asian patients, using utilities from the ALEX trial, and choosing different parametric survival models. RESULTS: In base case analysis, alectinib yielded an additional 1.04 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with incremental costs of $54,827, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $52,869/QALY. In scenario analysis, the ICER was $56,787/QALY using clinical data from the ALESIA trial. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probabilities of alectinib being cost-effective were 0.4% and 43.7% when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were $28,109/QALY and $50,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSION: Alectinib could prolong the mean time of PF and delay the time to CNS progression.

21132,Cost-effectiveness of Pneumococcal Vaccination Among Patients With CKD in the United States,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years with clinical indications (eg, diabetes, lung/heart disease, kidney failure, and nephrotic syndrome). Its cost-effectiveness in less severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncharacterized. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: US adults aged 50 to 64 and 65 to 79 years stratified by CKD risk status: no CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate>/=60mL/min/1.73m(2) and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio<30mg/g), CKD with moderate risk, CKD with high risk, and kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate<15mL/min/1.73m(2)) or nephrotic-range albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio>/=2,000mg/g). Data sources were the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. INTERVENTION(S): Vaccination compared to no vaccination. OUTCOMES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Markov model, US health sector perspective, and lifetime horizon. RESULTS: The prevalence of pneumococcal vaccination in NHANES 1999 to 2004 was 56.6% (aged 65-79 years), 28.5% (aged 50-64 years with an indication), and 9.7% (aged 50-64 years without an indication), with similar prevalences across CKD risk status.

21141,Cost-effectiveness of Pneumococcal Vaccination Among Patients With CKD in the United States,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years with clinical indications (eg, diabetes, lung/heart disease, kidney failure, and nephrotic syndrome). Its cost-effectiveness in less severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncharacterized. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: US adults aged 50 to 64 and 65 to 79 years stratified by CKD risk status: no CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate>/=60mL/min/1.73m(2) and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio<30mg/g), CKD with moderate risk, CKD with high risk, and kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate<15mL/min/1.73m(2)) or nephrotic-range albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio>/=2,000mg/g). Data sources were the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. INTERVENTION(S): Vaccination compared to no vaccination. OUTCOMES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Markov model, US health sector perspective, and lifetime horizon. RESULTS: The prevalence of pneumococcal vaccination in NHANES 1999 to 2004 was 56.6% (aged 65-79 years), 28.5% (aged 50-64 years with an indication), and 9.7% (aged 50-64 years without an indication), with similar prevalences across CKD risk status. Pneumococcal vaccination was overall cost-effective (<US $100,000/QALY) for adults aged 65 to 79 years (US $15,000/QALY) and 50 to 64 years (US $38,000/QALY). Among those aged 50 to 64 years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were lowest for kidney failure or nephrotic-range albuminuria (US $1,000/QALY), followed by CKD with high risk (US $17,000/QALY), CKD with moderate risk (US $25,000/QALY), and no CKD (US $43,000/QALY). Pneumococcal vaccination was cost-effective among adults aged 50 to 64 years with CKD even when assuming the lowest vaccine efficacy or 50% higher vaccine costs. LIMITATIONS: Some model parameters were based on data from the general population. Analysis did not consider costs associated with kidney disease progression.

21142,Critical Care Beds With Continuous Lateral Rotation Therapy to Prevent Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injury: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Mechanical ventilation increases the risk of hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and pressure injury (PrI). Beds with continuous lateral rotation therapy (CLRT) are shown to reduce HAC incidence, but the value of switching to CLRT beds is presently unknown. We compared the cost-effectiveness of CLRT beds with standard care in intensive care units. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis from the healthcare sector and societal perspectives was conducted. A Markov model was constructed to predict health state transitions from time of ventilation through 28 days for the healthcare sector perspective and 1 year for the U.S. societal perspective. Value of information was calculated to determine whether parameter uncertainty warranted further research. RESULTS: Our analysis suggested that CLRT beds dominate standard care from both perspectives. From the healthcare sector perspective, expected cost for CLRT was U.S. $47,165/patient compared with a higher cost of U.S. $49,258/patient for standard care. The expected effectiveness of CLRT is 0.0418 quality-adjusted life years/patient compared with 0.0416 quality-adjusted life years/patient for standard care. Continuous lateral rotation therapy dominated standard care in approximately 93% of Monte Carlo simulations from both perspectives.

21144,The cost-effectiveness of biological therapy cycles in the management of Crohn's disease,"OBJECTIVES: to examine the cost-effectiveness of continued treatment for patients with moderate-severe Crohn''s disease in clinical remission, with a combination of anti-TNFalpha (infliximab) and immunomodulator therapy compared to two different withdrawal strategies (1) withdrawal of the anti-TNFalpha therapy, and (2) withdrawal of the immunomodulator therapy, respectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed mimicking three treatment arms: (1) continued combination therapy with infliximab and immunomodulator, (2) withdrawal of infliximab, or (3) withdrawal of the immunomodulator. Relapses in each arm are managed with treatment intensification and reinstitution of the de-escalated drug according to a prespecified algorithm. State dependent relapse risks, remission probabilities and quality of life weights were collected from previous published studies. RESULTS: Combination therapy was less costly and more efficient than the withdrawal of the immunomodulator, and more costly and more efficient than withdrawal of infliximab. Whether or not combination therapy is cost effective, compared to the alternatives, depends, primarily, on current pharmaceutical prices and the willingness to pay per additional QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy using a combination of anti-TNFalpha (infliximab) and an immunomodulator is cost effective in the treatment of Crohn''s disease compared to treatment cycles in which the immunomodulator is withdrawn.

We conducted cost-effectiveness analyses to identify optimal HBV screening strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed decision-analytic models to analyze three strategies (no screening, universal screening, and selective screening based on use of an HBV infection risk tool) for hypothetic cohorts of patients anticipating anticancer therapy at high or lower risk for HBV reactivation. Model parameters were drawn from previously published studies, the SEER-Medicare database, and other online resources. Outcomes included lifetime expected cost, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, measured in US dollars required to gain an additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: For patients at high reactivation risk, universal screening dominated (ie, was cheaper and more effective than) the other two strategies. Universal screening was associated with a gain in life expectancy of 0.01 QALY compared with no screening and cost $76.06 less than no screening and $4.34 less than selective screening. For those at lower reactivation risk, universal screening still dominated selective screening; however, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the universal screening strategy compared with no screening was $186,917 per QALY gained.

21150,"Cost-effectiveness of measles control during elimination in Ontario, Canada, 2015","BackgroundGiven that measles is eliminated in Canada and measles immunisation coverage in Ontario is high, it has been questioned whether Ontario''s measles outbreak response is worthwhile.AimOur objective was to determine cost-effectiveness of measles containment protocols in Ontario from the healthcare payer perspective.MethodsWe developed a decision-analysis model comparing Ontario''s measles containment strategy (based on actual 2015 outbreak data) with a hypothetical ''modified response''. The modified scenario assumed 10% response costs with reduced case and contact tracing and no outbreak-associated vaccinations; it was based on local and provincial administrative and laboratory data and parameters from peer-reviewed literature. Short- and long-term health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs discounted at 1.5%, were estimated. We conducted one- and two-way sensitivity analyses.ResultsThe 2015 outbreak in Ontario comprised 16 measles cases and an estimated 3,369 contacts. Predictive modelling suggested that the outbreak response prevented 16 outbreak-associated cases at a cost of CAD 1,213,491 (EUR 861,579). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CAD 739,063 (EUR 524,735) per QALY gained for the outbreak response vs modified response. To meet the commonly accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of CAD 50,000 (EUR 35,500) per QALY gained, the outbreak response would have to prevent 94 measles cases. In sensitivity analyses, the findings were robust.ConclusionsOntario''s measles outbreak response exceeds generally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds and may not be the most efficient use of public health resources from a healthcare payer perspective. These findings should be balanced against benefits of increased vaccine coverage and maintaining elimination status.",2019-01-30071,30892178,Euro Surveill,Lauren C Ramsay,2019,24 / 11,,No,30892178,"Lauren C Ramsay; Natasha S Crowcroft; Shari Thomas; Elena Aruffo; Alexandra Teslya; Jane M Heffernan; Effie Gournis; Joanne Hiebert; Valerie Jaeger; Manisa Jiaravuthisan; Jennifer Sharron; Alberto Severini; Shelley L Deeks; Jonathan Gubbay; Tony Mazzulli; Beate Sander; Cost-effectiveness of measles control during elimination in Ontario, Canada, 2015, Euro Surveill, 2019 Mar; 24(11):1560-7917",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Immunization",measles containment protocol vs. Modified response scenario including minimal contact follow-up focused only on high-risk contacts,population of Ontario,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,739063,Canada,2015,631915.07
21151,Cost-effectiveness of increased hiv testing among men who have sex with men in the netherlands,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of increased consistent HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands. METHODS: Among MSM testing at STI clinics in the Netherlands in 2014-2015, approximately 20% tested consistently every six months. We examined four scenarios with increased percentage of MSM testing every six months: a small and a moderate increase among all MSM; a small and a moderate increase only among MSM with >/=10 partners in the preceding six months. We used an agent-based model to calculate numbers of HIV infections and AIDS cases prevented with increased HIV testing. These numbers were used in an economic model to calculate costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) due to increased testing, over 2018-2027, taking a healthcare payer perspective. RESULTS: A small increase in the percentage testing every six months among all MSM resulted in 490 averted HIV infections and an average ICER of &OV0556;27,900/QALY gained. A moderate increase among all MSM, resulted in 1380 averted HIV infections and an average ICER of &OV0556;36,700/QALY gained. Both were not cost-effective, with a &OV0556;20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Increasing the percentage testing every six months only among MSM with >/=10 partners in the preceding six months resulted in less averted HIV infections than increased testing among all MSM, but was on average cost-saving.

21153,Cost-effectiveness of increased hiv testing among men who have sex with men in the netherlands,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of increased consistent HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands. METHODS: Among MSM testing at STI clinics in the Netherlands in 2014-2015, approximately 20% tested consistently every six months. We examined four scenarios with increased percentage of MSM testing every six months: a small and a moderate increase among all MSM; a small and a moderate increase only among MSM with >/=10 partners in the preceding six months. We used an agent-based model to calculate numbers of HIV infections and AIDS cases prevented with increased HIV testing. These numbers were used in an economic model to calculate costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) due to increased testing, over 2018-2027, taking a healthcare payer perspective. RESULTS: A small increase in the percentage testing every six months among all MSM resulted in 490 averted HIV infections and an average ICER of &OV0556;27,900/QALY gained.

21155,Management of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms in Older Adults: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"Background Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are relatively common and are being increasingly diagnosed, with a significant proportion in older patients (> 65 years old). Serial imaging is often performed to assess change in size or morphology of UIAs since growing aneurysms are known to be at high risk for rupture. However, the frequency and duration of surveillance imaging have not been established. Purpose To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine treatment (aneurysm coil placement) versus four different strategies for imaging surveillance of UIAs in adults older than 65 years. Materials and Methods A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed from a societal perspective. Age-dependent input parameters were obtained from published literature. Analysis included adults older than 65 years, with incidental detection of UIA and no prior history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Five different management strategies for UIAs in older adults were evaluated: (a) annual MR angiography, (b) biennial MR angiography, (c) MR angiography every 5 years, (d) coil placement and follow-up, and (e) limited MR angiography follow-up for the first 2 years after detection only. Outcomes were assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Probabilistic, one-way, and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Results Imaging follow-up for the first 2 years after detection is the most cost-effective strategy (cost = $24 572, effectiveness = 13.73 QALYs), showing the lowest cost and highest effectiveness. The conclusion remains robust in probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses. Time-limited imaging follow-up remains the optimal strategy when the annual growth rate and rupture risk of growing aneurysms are varied. If annual rupture risk of nongrowing aneurysms is greater than 7.1%, coil placement should be performed directly. Conclusion Routine preventive treatment or periodic, indefinite imaging follow-up is not a cost-effective strategy in all adults older than 65 years with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. More aggressive management strategies should be reserved for patients with high risk of rupture, such as those with aneurysms larger than 7 mm and those with aneurysms in the posterior circulation.

21159,A one-year cost-utility analysis of REBOA versus RTACC for non-compressible torso haemorrhage,"Introduction: Major trauma is a leading cause of death and disability in young adults, especially from massive non-compressible torso haemorrhage. The standard technique to control distal haemorrhage and maximise central perfusion is resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping (RTACC). More recently, the minimally invasive technique of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has been developed to similarly limit distal haemorrhage without the morbidity of thoracotomy; cost-utility studies on this intervention, however, are still lacking. The aim of this study was to perform a one-year cost-utility analysis of REBOA as an intervention for patients with major traumatic non-compressible abdominal haemorrhage, compared to RTACC within the U.K.''s National Health Service. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the outcomes following REBOA and RTACC was conducted based on the published literature of survival and complication rates after intervention. Utility was obtained from studies that used the EQ-5D index and from self-conducted surveys. Costs were calculated using 2016/2017 National Health Service tariff data and supplemented from further literature. A cost-utility analysis was then conducted. Results: A total of 12 studies for REBOA and 20 studies for RTACC were included. The mean injury severity scores for RTACC and REBOA were 34 and 39, and mean probability of death was 9.7 and 54%, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of REBOA when compared to RTACC was pound44,617.44 per quality-adjusted life year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, by exceeding the National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness''s willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30,000/quality-adjusted life year, suggests that this intervention is not cost-effective in comparison to RTACC. However, REBOA yielded a 157% improvement in utility with a comparatively small cost increase of 31.5%. Conclusion: Although REBOA has not been found to be cost-effective when compared to RTACC, ultimately, clinical experience and expertise should be the main factor in driving the decision over which intervention to prioritise in the emergency context.",2019-01-30083,30886535,Trauma,Maxwell S Renna,2019,21 / 1,45-54,No,30886535,"Maxwell S Renna; Cristiano van Zeller; Farah Abu-Hijleh; Cherlyn Tong; Jasmine Gambini; Mengyao Ma; A one-year cost-utility analysis of REBOA versus RTACC for non-compressible torso haemorrhage, Trauma, 2019 Jan; 21(1):1460-4086; 45-54",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Surgical,resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta vs. Standard/Usual Care- Resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,44617.44,United Kingdom,2017,60725.45
21160,Cost-effectiveness analysis of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer,"OBJECTIVES: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial has shown atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer could significantly prolong overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung from an American perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Basic medical information was derived from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (IMpower133, NCT02763579). A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of small-cell lung cancer, including three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death. Utilities and costs were obtained from published resources. Sensitivity analyses were applied to explore the impact of essential variables. RESULTS: Treatment with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was estimated to increase costs by $52,881compared with chemotherapy alone, with a gain of 0.10 quality adjusted life years (QALYs), leading to an incremental cost-effective ratio of $528,810 per QALY. The cost of PFS state and atezolizumab were the most influential factors to the model.

21161,The cost effectiveness of REACH-HF and home-based cardiac rehabilitation compared with the usual medical care for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: A decision model-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: The REACH-HF (Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure) trial found that the REACH-HF home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in disease-specific health-related quality of life in patients with reduced ejection fraction heart failure (HFrEF). The aims of this study were to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the addition of REACH-HF intervention or home-based cardiac rehabilitation to usual care compared with usual care alone in patients with HFrEF. DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed using a patient lifetime horizon and integrating evidence from the REACH-HF trial, a systematic review/meta-analysis of randomised trials, estimates of mortality and hospital admission and UK costs at 2015/2016 prices. Taking a UK National Health and Personal Social Services perspective we report the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, assessing uncertainty using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In base case analysis, the REACH-HF intervention was associated with per patient mean QALY gain of 0.23 and an increased mean cost of pound400 compared with usual care, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of pound1720. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 78% probability that REACH-HF is cost effective versus usual care at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained. Results were similar for home-based cardiac rehabilitation versus usual care. Sensitivity analyses indicate the findings to be robust to changes in model assumptions and parameters.

21163,Cost-utility analysis comparing hospital-based intravenous immunoglobulin with home-based subcutaneous immunoglobulin in patients with secondary immunodeficiency,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) is often used to support patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency disease (SID). Home-based subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) is reported to be a cheaper and more efficient option compared to hospital-based intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for PID. In contrast, there is little information on the cost-effectiveness of IRT in SID. However, patients who develop hypogammaglobulinaemia secondary to other conditions (SID) have different clinical aetiology compared to PID. This study assesses whether SCIg provides a good value-for-money treatment option in patients with secondary immunodeficiency disease (SID). METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation model with six health states was used to compare cost-effectiveness of IVIg with SCIg from a healthcare system perspective. The costs of treatment, infection and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for IVIg and SCIg treatment options were modelled with a time horizon of 10 years and weekly cycles. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed around key parameters. RESULTS: The cumulative cost for IVIg was A$151 511 and for SCIg A$144 296. The QALYs with IVIg were 3.07 and with SCIg 3.51. Based on the means, SCIg is the dominant strategy with better outcomes and at lower cost.

21170,Goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation for early-stage Alzheimer's and related dementias: the GREAT RCT,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is an individualised, person-centred intervention for people with mild to moderate dementia that addresses the impact of cognitive impairment on everyday functioning. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not CR is a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer''s disease or vascular or mixed dementia, and their carers. DESIGN: This multicentre randomised controlled trial compared CR with treatment as usual (TAU). Following a baseline assessment and goal-setting to identify areas of everyday functioning that could be improved or better managed, participants were randomised (1 : 1) via secure web access to an independent randomisation centre to receive either TAU or CR and followed up at 3 and 9 months post randomisation. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Participants had an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, diagnosis of Alzheimer''s disease or vascular or mixed dementia, had mild to moderate cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination score of >/= 18 points), were stable on medication if prescribed, and had a family carer who was willing to contribute. The exclusion criteria were people with a history of brain injury or other neurological disorder and an inability to speak English. To achieve adequate power, we needed 350 people to complete the trial, with 175 people in each trial arm. INTERVENTION: Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of 10 therapy sessions over 3 months, followed by four maintenance sessions over 6 months, delivered in participants'' homes. The therapists were nine occupational therapists and one nurse. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-reported goal attainment at 3 months. Goal attainment was also assessed at 9 months. Carers provided independent ratings of goal attainment at both time points. The secondary outcomes were participant quality of life, mood, self-efficacy and cognition, and carer stress, health status and quality of life. The assessments at 3 and 9 months were conducted by researchers who were blind to the participants'' group allocation. RESULTS: A total of 475 participants were randomised (CR arm, n = 239; TAU arm, n = 236), 427 participants (90%) completed the trial and 426 participants were analysed (CR arm, n = 208, TAU arm, n = 218). At 3 months, there were statistically significant large positive effects for participant-rated goal attainment [mean change in the CR arm: 2.57; mean change in the TAU arm: 0.86; Cohen''sd = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.19], corroborated by carer ratings (Cohen''sd = 1.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.34). These effects were maintained at 9 months for both the participant ratings (Cohen''s d = 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17) and the carer ratings (Cohen''s d = 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.20). There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes. In the cost-utility analyses, there was no evidence of cost-effectiveness in terms of gains in the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of the person with dementia (measured using the DEMentia Quality Of Life questionnaire utility score) or the QALYs of the carer (measured using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version) from either cost perspective. In the cost-effectiveness analyses, by reference to the primary outcome of participant-rated goal attainment, CR was cost-effective from both the health and social care perspective and the societal perspective at willingness-to-pay values of pound2500 and above for improvement in the goal attainment measure. There was no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the self-efficacy measure (the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale) from either cost perspective. LIMITATIONS: Possible limitations arose from the non-feasibility of using observational outcome measures, the lack of a general measure of functional ability and the exclusion of people without a carer or with rarer forms of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive rehabilitation is clinically effective in enabling people with early-stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy sessions. FUTURE WORK: Next steps will focus on the implementation of CR into NHS and social care services and on extending the approach to people with rarer forms of dementia.

21171,Tibial nerve decompression for the prevention of the diabetic foot: a cost-utility analysis using Markov model simulations,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tibial neurolysis performed as a surgical intervention for patients with diabetic neuropathy and superimposed tibial nerve compression in the prevention of the diabetic foot is cost-effective when compared with the current prevention programme. DESIGN: A baseline analysis was built on a 5-year model to determine the cumulative incidence of foot ulcers and amputations with each strategy. Subsequently, a cost-effectiveness analysis and cohort-level Markov simulations were conducted with a model composed of 20 6-month cycles. A sensitivity analysis was also performed. SETTING: A Markov model was used to simulate the effects of standard prevention compared with tibial neurolysis on the long-term costs associated with foot ulcers and amputations. This model included eight health states. PARTICIPANTS: Each cohort includes simulated patients with diabetic neuropathy at different levels of risk of developing foot ulcers and amputations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the long-term trends concerning the development of ulcers and amputations with each strategy. The secondary outcome measures were quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness and net monetary benefits of the optimal strategy. RESULTS: When compared with standard prevention, for a patient population of 10 000, surgery prevented a simulated total of 1447 ulcers and 409 amputations over a period of 5 years. In a subsequent analysis that consisted of 20 6-month cycles (10 years), the incremental cost of tibial neurolysis compared with current prevention was $12 772.28; the incremental effectiveness was 0.41 QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $31 330.78. Survival was 73% for those receiving medical prevention compared with 95% for those undergoing surgery. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that among patients with diabetic neuropathy and superimposed nerve compression, surgery is more effective at preventing serious comorbidities and is associated with a higher survival over time. It also generated greater long-term economic benefits.",2019-01-30102,30878982,BMJ Open,Samuel Sarmiento,2019,9 / 3,e024816,No,30878982,"Samuel Sarmiento; James A Jr Pierre; A Lee Dellon; Kevin D Frick; Tibial nerve decompression for the prevention of the diabetic foot: a cost-utility analysis using Markov model simulations, BMJ Open , 2019 Mar 23; 9(3):2044-6055; e024816",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",tibial neurolysis; patient education about foot care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Current prevention,Not Stated,97 Years,24 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,31330.78,United States,2017,33080.74
21172,BRCA mutation testing for first-degree relatives of women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"BACKGROUND: Women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) have a 20% chance of carrying a BRCA1 or 2 mutation. Not all undergo genetic testing, and there is a large legacy group of untested patients. Their female first-degree relatives (FDR) may not qualify for testing unless they have specific ethnicity, or personal/family cancer history. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate risk-reducing strategies for these FDR who are ineligible for testing. METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo simulation model estimated the costs and benefits of 3 strategies for female FDR of HGSC patients whose BRCA status is unknown: (1) no BRCA testing; (2) universal BRCA testing, followed by risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) for mutation carriers; (3) universal RRBSO, without BRCA testing. Effectiveness was estimated in quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains over a 50-year time horizon. Sensitivity analyses accounted for uncertainty around various parameters. RESULTS: Universal BRCA testing for female FDR of women with HGSC yielded a higher average QALY gain at acceptable cost compared to no BRCA testing, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $7888 per QALY. Universal BRCA testing was more effective and less costly than universal RRBSO (19.20 QALYs vs. 18.52 QALYs, and $10,135 vs. $14,231, respectively). Results were stable over wide ranges of plausible costs and estimates. Compliance with hormone replacement therapy had to exceed 79.3% for universal RRBSO to be the most effective strategy.

21177,Assessing optimal use of the standard dose adjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly,"BACKGROUND: Despite a long-standing vaccination programme, seasonal influenza remains a major public health problem in England, in particular for the elderly where a significant disease burden remains despite vaccine coverage approaching the WHO target of 75%. The recently licensed adjuvanted trivalent vaccines (TIV-ADJ) have been shown to offer greater protection for the elderly compared to the standard-dose non-adjuvanted trivalent vaccines (TIV), particularly for those individuals 75years old and above for whom the TIV has limited effectiveness. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the TIV-ADJ for use in the elderly. METHODS: We used a dynamic SEIR-type transmission model coupled with an economic evaluation framework, estimating the reduction in GP consultations, hospitalisations and influenza-attributable mortality. We assessed the optimal use of the TIV-ADJ by estimating the cost-effectiveness of programmes that used this vaccine in the 65+ and 75+ age groups. FINDINGS: The use of TIV-ADJ is highly cost-effective for both target age cohorts with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios well below the pound20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with over 90% probability that the vaccine is cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound30,000 per QALY. INTERPRETATION: The increased protection provided across all three influenza vaccine sub-types makes TIV-ADJ a more attractive option than TIV from the perspective of the healthcare provider, driven by the increased efficacy against A(H3N2). When deciding on the optimal use of the newly available vaccine it is important to consider the fact that TIV has very limited effectiveness for the 75+ age group, who would therefore get the greatest benefit from a more effective vaccine.

21179,U.S. Food and Drug Administration-Approved Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor Maintenance Therapy for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether use of a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor is cost effective for maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS: A decision analysis model compared four maintenance strategies: 1) observation, 2) BRCA germline mutation testing and selective treatment of carriers (gBRCA only), 3) BRCA germline and tumor homologous recombination deficiency testing and selective treatment of either BRCA carriers or those with tumor HRD (gBRCA and HRD only), and 4) treat all with niraparib to progression (treat all). Costs were estimated in 2016 U.S. dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were in dollars per progression-free quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). One-way sensitivity analyses tested multiple assumptions. RESULTS: Maintenance poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor was costlier and more effective than observation. Mean costs and progression-free QALYs were $827 and 3.4 months for observation, $46,157 and 5.7 for a BRCA-only strategy, $109,368 and 8.5 for a gBRCA and homologous recombination deficiency-only strategy, and $169,127 and 8.8 for a treat-all strategy. gBRCA-only had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $243,092/progression-free QALY compared with observation; other strategies did not approach cost effectiveness. Using the current U.S. Food and Drug Administration label for maintenance poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor regardless of biomarker status, the third-party payer cost per month (28-day supply) would need to be reduced from approximately $14,700 to $3,600 to be considered cost effective compared with observation using a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/progression-free QALY. CONCLUSION: Maintenance poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer is not cost effective.

21182,Cost-Utility Analysis of Surgical Decompression Relative to Injection Therapy for Chronic Migraine Headaches,"BACKGROUND: Common treatment for chronic migraine headaches include injection of corticosteroid and anesthetic agents at local trigger sites. However, the effects of therapy are short-term and lifelong treatment is often necessary. In contrast, surgical decompression of migraine trigger sites accomplishes the same goal yet demonstrates successful long-term elimination of chronic migraines. OBJECTIVES: Analysis is necessary to determine the complex interplay between the quality of life conferred to patients and cost of the available treatment options for chronic migraine disorders. As such, our primary objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis to determine which patients would benefit most from available treatment options in a cost-conscious model. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed in consideration of costs, probabilities, and health state utility scores of opposing interventions. RESULTS: Injection therapy offered a minor incremental benefit in quality-adjusted life-years greater than surgical decompression (QALY Delta = 0.6). However, long-term injection therapy was significantly costlier to society than surgical decompression, with treatment estimated at $106,887.96 greater than the cost of surgery. The results of our cost-utility analysis thus conferred a positive ICUR of $178,163.27 in favor of surgical decompression. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery provides a durable intervention and has been shown in this study to be extremely cost-effective despite a very minor QALY deficit in comparison to injection therapy. If patients are identified that require treatment in the form of injections for less than 8.25 years, they may fall into a group that should not be offered surgery.",2019-01-30135,30868158,Aesthet Surg J,Orr Shauly,2019,/,,No,30868158,"Orr Shauly; Daniel J Gould; Ketan M Patel; Cost-Utility Analysis of Surgical Decompression Relative to Injection Therapy for Chronic Migraine Headaches, Aesthet Surg J, 2019 Mar 14; ():1527-330X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,nonsurgical anesthetic nerve block injection treatment vs. surgical decompression,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 1, 3, 5, 10 years",Not Stated,Not Stated,178163.27,United States,2017,188114.45
21183,Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Bariatric Surgery for Morbidly Obese with Diabetes Patients in Thailand,"Background: Bariatric surgery is a choice for treatment in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM type 2) who have inadequate diabetes control with only medical treatment. However, bariatric surgery requires highly sophisticated equipment, and thus the cost of surgery seems to be very high following the procedure compared with the cost of conventional diabetes care. This raises the question of whether bariatric surgery is cost-effective for morbidly obese people with diabetes in Thailand. Objective: To perform a cost-effectiveness evaluation of bariatric surgery compared with ordinary treatment for diabetes control in morbidly obese DM type 2 patients in Thailand. Methods: Cost-effectiveness study was conducted, using a combination of decision tree and Markov model in analysis. Treatment outcomes and healthcare costs were incurred by data from literature review and retrospective cohort in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from September 2009 to March 2016 for the conventional and bariatric surgery group, respectively. One-way sensitivity was used for analysis of the robustness of the model. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Monetary benefits at a threshold of 150,000 to 200,000 Thai baht (THB) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) based on the Thailand gross domestic products (GDP) value was regarded as cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery. Results: Bariatric surgery significantly improves the clinical outcome including long-term diabetes remission rate, hemoglobin A1C, and body mass index (BMI). The incremental cost per QALY of bariatric surgery compared with the medication control is 26,907.76 THB/QALY which can consider bariatric surgery as a cost-effective option.

21184,Long-term cost-effectiveness of the fixed-dose combination of tiotropium plus olodaterol based on the DYNAGITO trial results,"Purpose: Combinations of long-acting bronchodilators are recommended to reduce the rate of COPD exacerbations. Evidence from the DYNAGITO trial showed that the fixed-dose combination of tiotropium + olodaterol reduced the annual rate of total exacerbations (P<0.05) compared with tiotropium monotherapy. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the fixed-dose combination of tiotropium + olodaterol vs tiotropium monotherapy in COPD patients in the French setting. Patients and methods: A recently developed COPD patient-level simulation model was used to simulate the lifetime effects and costs for 15,000 patients receiving either tiotropium + olodaterol or tiotropium monotherapy by applying the reduction in annual exacerbation rate as observed in the DYNAGITO trial. The model was adapted to the French setting by including French unit costs for treatment medication, COPD maintenance treatment, COPD exacerbations (moderate or severe), and pneumonia. The main outcomes were the annual (severe) exacerbation rate, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total lifetime costs. Results: The number of QALYs for treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol was 0.042 higher compared with tiotropium monotherapy. Using a societal perspective, tiotropium + olodaterol resulted in a cost increase of +euro123 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro2,900 per QALY compared with tiotropium monotherapy. From a French National Sickness Fund perspective, total lifetime costs were reduced by euro272 with tiotropium + olodaterol, resulting in tiotropium + olodaterol being the dominant treatment option, that is, more effects with less costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that reducing the cost of exacerbations by 34% increased the ICER to euro15,400, which could still be considered cost-effective in the French setting. Conclusion: Treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol resulted in a gain in QALYs and savings in costs compared with tiotropium monotherapy using a National Sickness Fund perspective in France.

21186,Selective laser trabeculoplasty versus eye drops for first-line treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma (LiGHT): a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension are habitually treated with eye drops that lower intraocular pressure. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is a safe alternative but is rarely used as first-line treatment. We compared the two. METHODS: In this observer-masked, randomised controlled trial treatment-naive patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and no ocular comorbidities were recruited between 2012 and 2014 at six UK hospitals. They were randomly allocated (web-based randomisation) to initial selective laser trabeculoplasty or to eye drops. An objective target intraocular pressure was set according to glaucoma severity. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 3 years (assessed by EQ-5D). Secondary outcomes were cost and cost-effectiveness, disease-specific HRQoL, clinical effectiveness, and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN32038223). FINDINGS: Of 718 patients enrolled, 356 were randomised to the selective laser trabeculoplasty and 362 to the eye drops group. 652 (91%) returned the primary outcome questionnaire at 36 months. Average EQ-5D score was 0.89 (SD 0.18) in the selective laser trabeculoplasty group versus 0.90 (SD 0.16) in the eye drops group, with no significant difference (difference 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; p=0.23). At 36 months, 74.2% (95% CI 69.3-78.6) of patients in the selective laser trabeculoplasty group required no drops to maintain intraocular pressure at target. Eyes of patients in the selective laser trabeculoplasty group were within target intracoluar pressure at more visits (93.0%) than in the eye drops group (91.3%), with glaucoma surgery to lower intraocular pressure required in none versus 11 patients. Over 36 months, from an ophthalmology cost perspective, there was a 97% probability of selective laser trabeculoplasty as first treatment being more cost-effective than eye drops first at a willingness to pay of pound20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

21187,Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce fear of cancer recurrence: The ConquerFear randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: Alongside a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of the ConquerFear intervention for reducing fear of cancer recurrence in cancer survivors, the cost-effectiveness of this novel intervention was assessed, primarily from the health sector perspective, with broader societal productivity impacts assessed. METHODS: Health care resource use was collected by a tailored cost diary. Incremental costs were calculated as the difference in total costs between the intervention and control groups. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated by cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, comparing incremental costs with incremental outcomes measured. Nonparametric bootstrap analysis was performed to evaluate uncertainty in costs and outcomes. RESULTS: Cancer survivors were randomized into ConquerFear (n = 121), or an active control group receiving relaxation training (n = 101). Participants received on average 3.69 sessions, incurring an average cost of $297 per person, with no group difference. The ITT analysis results indicated a mean ICER $34 300 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with average incremental cost $488 and health gain of 0.0142 QALYs, from the health care sector perspective. Bootstrap analysis showed 30% of iterations were dominant and overall 53% ICERs were cost-effective as judged by the commonly used $50 000/QALY threshold.

21196,"Costs and Cost-Effectiveness of Targeted, Personalized Risk Information to Increase Appropriate Screening by First-Degree Relatives of People With Colorectal Cancer","BACKGROUND: Economic evaluations are less commonly applied to implementation interventions compared to clinical interventions. The efficacy of an implementation strategy to improve adherence to screening guidelines among first-degree relatives of people with colorectal cancer was recently evaluated in a randomized-controlled trial. Using these trial data, we examined the costs and cost-effectiveness of the intervention from societal and health care funder perspectives. METHOD: In this prospective, trial-based evaluation, mean costs, and outcomes were calculated. The primary outcome of the trial was the proportion of participants who had screening tests in the year following the intervention commensurate with their risk category. Quality-adjusted life years were included as secondary outcomes. Intervention costs were determined from trial records. Standard Australian unit costs for 2016/2017 were applied. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the net benefit framework. Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to calculate uncertainty intervals (UIs) around the costs and the incremental net monetary benefit statistic. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, mean health sector costs were $17 (95% UI [$14, $24]) higher for those receiving the intervention. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the primary trial outcome was calculated to be $258 (95% UI [$184, $441]) per additional person appropriately screened. The significant difference in adherence to screening guidelines between the usual care and intervention groups did not translate into a mean quality-adjusted life year difference. DISCUSSION: Providing information on both the costs and outcomes of implementation interventions is important to inform public health care investment decisions.

21198,Cost Effectiveness of a Technology-Enhanced Diabetes Care Management Program in Mexico,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes has increased substantially in Mexico over the last 40 years, leading to significant impacts on population health and the healthcare system. Technology-based solutions may improve diabetes outcomes in areas where lack of efficient transportation creates barriers to care. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime cost effectiveness of a technology-based diabetes care management program from the perspective of the Mexican healthcare system. METHODS: Clinical outcomes and cost data from a 3-arm randomized clinical trial of Dulce Wireless Tijuana, a diabetes care management program incorporating short-term mobile technology, were used as inputs in a validated simulation model for type 2 diabetes. Study arms included a control group (CG), Project Dulce diabetes care management (PD), and Project Dulce with technology enhancement (PD-TE). RESULTS: Intervention costs were $1448 for PD and $1740 for PD-TE compared with $740 for CG. Both intervention arms increased quality-adjusted life-years and costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PD was $1635 and for PD-TE was $2220, both compared with CG. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PD-TE versus PD was $4299. The results were sensitive to the time horizon. The PE and PD-TE interventions were cost-effective under time horizons of 15 to 20 years, but were not cost-effective under time horizons of 5 to 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Both the PD and PD-TE were highly cost-effective from a Mexican health system perspective.

21199,Cost Effectiveness of a Technology-Enhanced Diabetes Care Management Program in Mexico,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes has increased substantially in Mexico over the last 40 years, leading to significant impacts on population health and the healthcare system. Technology-based solutions may improve diabetes outcomes in areas where lack of efficient transportation creates barriers to care. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime cost effectiveness of a technology-based diabetes care management program from the perspective of the Mexican healthcare system. METHODS: Clinical outcomes and cost data from a 3-arm randomized clinical trial of Dulce Wireless Tijuana, a diabetes care management program incorporating short-term mobile technology, were used as inputs in a validated simulation model for type 2 diabetes. Study arms included a control group (CG), Project Dulce diabetes care management (PD), and Project Dulce with technology enhancement (PD-TE). RESULTS: Intervention costs were $1448 for PD and $1740 for PD-TE compared with $740 for CG. Both intervention arms increased quality-adjusted life-years and costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PD was $1635 and for PD-TE was $2220, both compared with CG. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PD-TE versus PD was $4299. The results were sensitive to the time horizon.
