6,"Estrogen use in postmenopausal women--costs, risks, and benefits","The cost effectiveness of estrogen use in postmenopausal women was analyzed with use of data from the medical and epidemiologic literature. Risks of endometrial cancer, uterine bleeding, and gallbladder disease were weighed against benefits associated with relief of menopausal symptoms and with prevention of osteoporosis and consequent fractures. Net effects on life expectancy are probably small in either direction, although they are likely to be positive in women with existing osteoporosis or prior hysterectomy. Treatment appears to be relatively cost effective in menopausal women with prior hysterectomy or osteoporosis but does not appear to be cost effective as a prophylactiv measure in asymptomatic women with intact uteri.

13,Cost effectiveness of vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia,"We used cost-effectiveness analysis to examine the medical-care costs of vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia in relation to its effects on health. Vaccination could add a year of healthy life among all age groups for about $4,800 in net medical-care costs.

These ratios may change substantially with variations in such factors as the cost of vaccination, the duration of immunity, the efficacy and composition of the vaccine, and the percentage of pneumonia that is pneumococcal.

19,Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: clinical decision making and cost-effectiveness analysis,"Decision-analytic techniques were used to evaluate the choice between an aortocoronary bypass operation and medical management in a set of hypothetical patients with coronary artery disease. The decision framework incorporates variables believed to have an important bearing on the choice of treatment. Probability estimates were obtained from two cardiologists and one cardiac surgeon. Patient preferences for the trade-off between years of survival and the quality of life as reflected by the severity of angina pectoris were made explicit by assigning utility values to alternative health outcomes. The results are expressed in terms of quality-adjusted years of life expectancy. Decision analysis favored operation for 13 of the 14 hypothetical patients, including patients with one- and two-vessel disease. The one patient for whom medical treatment was preferred had mild angina pectoris, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and a poor prognosis regardless of therapeutic modality. The results are sensitive to changes in the probability of long-term survival, but not to changes in operative mortality rates. In five patients, the physicians' clinical judgments favored medical treatment, whereas their decision-analysis-derived estimates of survival favored operation. Possible explanations for these discrepancies are discussed.

For infants weighing 500 to 999 g, the corresponding costs were $102,500 per additional survivor, $9,300 per life-year gained, and $22,400 per quality-adjusted life-year gained; intensive care resulted in a net economic loss. By every measure of economic evaluation, the impact of neonatal intensive care was more favorable among infants weighing 1000 to 1499 g than among those weighing 500 to 999 g.

40,Parasite screening and treatment among Indochinese refugees. Cost-benefit/utility and the General Health Policy Model,"The General Health Policy Model and the Quality of Well-being scale are used to describe a ""cost-benefit/utility"" evaluation of a screening and treatment program for intestinal parasites among indochinese refugees in the United States. Cost-benefit/utility analysis subsumes conventional cost-effectiveness by explicitly adding social utility factors to the dollar dimension. Using actual data on parasite prevalence and program costs from one screening project and estimated figures for other factors, this article demonstrates calculation of the cost-benefit/utility outcome measure, dollars per well-year. Dollars per well-year for parasite screening are calculated for a number of examples. Further analysis and final conclusions on the worth of parasite screening and treatment programs await more reliable data for some terms of the developed model.",1985-01-01733,3919193,JAMA,J P Anderson,1985,253 / 15,2229-35,No,3919193,"J P Anderson; R J Moser; Parasite screening and treatment among Indochinese refugees.

41,The decision concerning coronary angiography in patients with chest pain. A cost-effectiveness analysis,"We examined the decision whether to perform coronary angiography (followed by bypass surgery if appropriate findings are present) in middle-aged men who have chest pain and have undergone exercise tolerance testing (ETT). We developed a model of this decision that combines data from a variety of sources and selects the optimal strategy based on health outcome and, if desired, monetary cost. The analysis supports the following conclusions: for patients with nonspecific chest pain or atypical angina, the ETT provides useful information concerning the decision; furthermore, the number of millimeters of ST-segment depression above which angiography should be performed depends on coronary risk factors and pain severity. A normal ETT is insufficient evidence to exclude coronary angiography for patients with typical angina, provided that one is willing to expand resources for health benefits at levels comparable to those for other accepted medical practices. If monetary considerations are excluded, the preceding statement concerning ETT and angiography also holds for patients with atypical angina and for those with nonspecific pain and advanced risk factors. These last two conclusions suggest that ETT is not useful in guiding management decisions concerning coronary angiography in patients at high enough risk of coronary artery disease on the basis of symptoms and risk profile.",1985-01-01734,3939247,Med Decis Making,P Doubilet,1985,5 / 3,293-309,No,3939247,"P Doubilet; B J McNeil; M C Weinstein; The decision concerning coronary angiography in patients with chest pain.

This article examines the costs and effects of the first 5 years of the project. There were 288 fewer than expected fatal strokes and myocardial infarctions during the period; 134 of these are attributable to the hypertension program. The costs of the hypertension program totalled $5.16 million. Drugs consumed 86% of this cost. Using the zero discount rate as an outside boundary, the program is expected to increase old age pension costs by $2.5 million for the 5 years but will decrease earnings losses by $7 million for the same period. With earnings excluded, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained is $3,612 at zero discount and $5,830 at 10% discount.

A survival benefit of 1.6 months in favor of alternating chemotherapy was associated with an additional cost of $450 (1984 Canadian dollars) per patient. This translated to a cost of $3,370 per year of life gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness (CEA) of alternating chemotherapy was greatest when treatment was given on an outpatient basis. The results of the evaluation were sensitive to hospitalization rates, but even the most unfavorable analyses revealed the CEA of alternating chemotherapy to be comparable to that of treatments of common nonmalignant diseases. It is concluded that the CEA of alternating chemotherapy for SCLC was favorable when compared with accepted treatments for nonmalignant diseases.

Despite the considerable cost of long-term cyclosporine treatment, analysis reveals collective financial and social benefits from the reduced rate of graft failure and subsequent return to dialysis.",1988-01-01741,10302355,Health Policy,T Schneider,1988,9 / 1,75-89,No,10302355,"T Schneider; F Fagnani; J L Lanoe; M Hourmant; J P Soulillou; Economic analysis of an immunosuppressive strategy in renal transplantation, Health Policy, 1988; 9(1):0168-8510; 75-89",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cyclosporine-A immunosuppressive treatment after renal transplantation vs. Dialysis (no renal transplantation),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,-544453.7,France,1985,-147031.27
74,The high cost and low efficacy of weekly viral cultures for pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes: a reappraisal,"The use of weekly cultures to prevent neonatal infection among infants of pregnant women who have histories of genital herpes has been controversial since a decision analysis study in 1983 suggested that this strategy was not cost-effective and would avert relatively few cases of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. Using more recent and better data, the authors reanalyzed this approach to reducing neonatal herpes infection. The reanalysis revealed that a national screening program would prevent only 1.8 cases of neonatal herpes in the United States annually, at a cost of more than 37 million dollars per case averted. The program would cost nearly 7 million dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained when only infant deaths are taken into consideration. When maternal deaths from excess cesarean deliveries are taken into account, over 44 million dollars would be spent for every quality-adjusted life-year gained. On the basis of the strategy's limited benefits and low cost-effectiveness, the authors support the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology's position of abandoning the recommendation for weekly prenatal herpes cultures.",1989-01-01742,2552249,Med Decis Making,N J Binkin,1989,9 / 4,225-30,No,2552249,"N J Binkin; J P Koplan; The high cost and low efficacy of weekly viral cultures for pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes: a reappraisal, Med Decis Making, 1989 Oct-Dec; 9(4):0272-989X; 225-30",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Examination and culture for herpes virus vs. Examination only,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,36207044,United States,1987,82489271.7
75,Nonionic contrast media: economic analysis and health policy development,"The replacement of old radiologic contrast media with supposedly safer but more expensive media has created a dilemma for radiologists and hospital administrators. To quantitate the nature of this trade-off we performed a cost-utility analysis using optimistic assumptions that favoured the new media. A complete conversion to the new media would result in an incremental cost of at least $65,000 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). For a selective strategy in which only high-risk patients would receive the new media the cost would be about $23,000 per QALY gained. However, the incremental cost for low-risk patients is over $220,000 per QALY gained. Conversion to the new contrast media, although not necessarily the most efficient use of scarce resources, has already occurred in Ontario, primarily because of press publicity, pressure from insurers and a political unwillingness of policymakers to decide the fate of identifiable victims.

78,Cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures in patients with artificial joints,"We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate whether patients with artificial joints should take penicillin, erythromycin, or no antibiotics before dental procedures. We modeled the risk of anaphylaxis from penicillin, the risks and consequences of an artificial joint infection, and the actual variable costs of hospitalization and antibiotics. Penicillin prophylaxis is slightly less expensive than erythromycin prophylaxis but is both more expensive and less effective than no prophylaxis. Erythromycin prophylaxis, the most effective, is the most expensive strategy. The marginal cost effectiveness of erythromycin prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis is $12,900 per quality-adjusted year of life saved. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the risk of developing a joint infection is the key parameter in the analysis.

We performed cost-effectiveness analyses addressing these issues.

86,Utility and cost of carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring in colon cancer follow-up evaluation. A Markov analysis,"The use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to monitor patients after intentionally curative colon cancer resection can have advantages (improved life expectancy as a result of early detection of recurrences) as well as disadvantages (false-positive CEA rises and early detection of incurable recurrences in asymptomatic patients). This study estimated how the favorable and unfavorable effects of CEA monitoring affect life expectancy and quality of life of colon cancer patients. These effects were simulated using a Markov analysis for which the variables had been defined on the basis of data found in literature. The influence of CEA monitoring on quality adjusted life expectancy appears to be modest and varies, according to the data used, from an average increase of +7 days (+0.3%) to an average decrease of -5 days (-0.09%). This value is dependent, among other things, on patient related variables; the adverse effects especially dominate in older patients with a favorable Dukes' stage of the primary tumor and if operative mortality exceeds 2%. The total cost of CEA monitoring, including diagnosis and therapy performed as a result of true- or false-positive CEA rise, is considerable. High cost and low return leads to a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio, which varies from $22,963 to $4,888,208 per quality adjusted life year saved. It is concluded that CEA monitoring should not be used for routine following of colon cancer patients, as its advantages have so far been demonstrated insufficiently.",1990-01-01746,2337875,Cancer,J Kievit,1990,65 / 11,2580-7,No,2337875,"J Kievit; C J van de Velde; Utility and cost of carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring in colon cancer follow-up evaluation.

92,Screening for hypertension,"PURPOSE: To review the evidence on four questions about screening asymptomatic adults for arterial hypertension: Is hypertension a significant health problem? Is it detectable at an early, presymptomatic stage? Is treatment available and effective? Do the benefits of screening outweigh the costs and risks? DATA IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION: We did a computerized search of the MEDLARS data base to identify community-based trials of drug therapy for mild hypertension; other relevant citations are included when appropriate. DATA SYNTHESIS: We approached the preliminary questions in our analysis by narrative review and argument. The estimates of therapeutic efficacy are based on previously published meta-analyses. The cost-effectiveness of screening was addressed by formal mathematical modeling of the effect of screening on various U.S. populations. RESULTS OF ANALYSIS: Hypertension is clearly a significant health problem. It can be detected early, and effective treatment is available. Screening asymptomatic adults for hypertension has benefits that compare favorably to the risks and costs involved. According to our estimates, screening is most cost-effective for older adults compared with younger adults and for men compared with women and is highly sensitive to the cost of therapy for mild hypertension.

93,Steps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care,"OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases.
