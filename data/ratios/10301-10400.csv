10301,Cost-effectiveness of truncated therapy for hepatitis C based on rapid virologic response,"Shortened courses of treatment with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for patients with hepatitis C virus infection who experience rapid virologic response can be effective in appropriately selected patients. The cost-effectiveness of truncated therapy is not known.To assess the cost-effectiveness of response-guided therapy versus standard-duration therapy on the basis of best available evidence.We developed a decision model for chronic hepatitis C virus infection representing two treatment strategies: 1) standard-duration therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1 or 4 and for 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 or 3 and 2) truncated therapy (i.e., 50% decrease in treatment duration) in patients with rapid virologic response. Patients for whom truncated therapy failed began standard-duration therapy guided by genotype. We used a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years.In the base-case analysis, mean lifetime costs were $46,623 ? $2,483 with standard-duration therapy and $42,354 ? $2,489 with truncated therapy. Mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years were similar between the groups (17.1 ? 0.7 with standard therapy; 17.2 ? 0.7 with truncated therapy). Across model simulations, the probability of truncated therapy being economically dominant (i.e., both cost saving and more effective) was 78.6%. The results were consistent when we stratified the data by genotype. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the results were sensitive only to changes in treatment efficacy.Truncated therapy based on rapid virologic response is likely to be cost saving for treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

We investigated the cost-effectiveness of this intervention targeted at one million insufficiently active adults who visit their general practitioner in the Netherlands.We used the RIVM chronic disease model to estimate the long-term effects of increased physical activity on the future health care costs and quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained, from a health care perspective.The intervention resulted in almost 6000 people shifting to more favorable physical-activity levels, and in 5100 life years and 6100 QALYs gained, at an additional total cost of EUR 67.6 million. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was EUR 13,200 per life year gained and EUR 11,100 per QALY gained. The intervention has a probability of 0.66 to be cost-effective if a QALY gained is valued at the Dutch informal threshold for cost-effectiveness of preventive intervention of EUR 20,000. A sensitivity analysis showed substantial uncertainty of ICER values.Counseling in combination with pedometer use aiming to increase physical activity may be a cost-effective intervention.

10309,Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy: perspective from Argentina,"Objectives: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has recently been shown to reduce both mid-term and long-term mortality in patients with mild heart failure. Although proven effective, it is unclear whether CRT is cost-effective in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Therefore, we set out to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CRT in Argentina in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) I or II heart failure (HF). We chose to compare patients receiving optimal medical treatment (OMT) and CRT with those patients receiving only OMT. Methods: We constructed a Markov model with a cohort simulation, and a life-time horizon to assess costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained as a result of treatment with both CRT and OMT from an Argentine third party payer perspective. We included patients who met the following criteria: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) = 40 percent, sinus rhythm with a QRS = 120 msec, and NYHA FC I-II HF. The results were expressed as cost per life-year and QALY gained in international dollars (ID$) for the year 2009. Results: For the base case analysis performed, we started at a fixed age of 65. After applying a 3 percent annual discount rate, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 38.005 ID$ per year of life gained and 34.185 ID$ per QALY gained.

10311,Cost-utility analysis of liraglutide versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in type 2 diabetes patients in china,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-utility of liraglutide versus glimepiride as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on the results of clinical trial conducted in Asian population. Methods: The validated UKPDS Outcomes Model was used to project life expectancy, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), incidence of diabetes-related complication and cost of complications in patients receiving those regimens. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were derived from an Asian study. China-specific complication costs and utility score were taken from local studies. Patients' outcomes were modeled for 30 years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for liraglutide compared with glimepiride from the healthcare system perspective. Both future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3 percent. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Over a period of 30 years, compared with glimepiride, liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with improvements in life expectancy (0.1 year) and quality adjusted life-year (0.168 QALY), and a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained versus glimepiride of CNY 25,6871 (DEC 2010, 1 USD = 6.6227 CNY). Conclusions: Long-term projections indicated that liraglutide was associated with increased life expectancy, QALYs, and reduced complication incidences comparing with glimepiride. When the UK cost of liraglutide was discounted by 38 percent, liraglutide would be a cost-effective option in China from the healthcare system perspective using the 3X GDP/capita per QALY as the WTP threshold.",2012-01-09803,23006540,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Lan Gao,2012,28 / 4,436-44,No,23006540,"Lan Gao; Fei-Li Zhao; Shu-Chuen Li; Cost-utility analysis of liraglutide versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in type 2 diabetes patients in china, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, ; 28(4):0266-4623; 436-44",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Liraglutide (1.8 mg) + metformin vs. Glimepiride (4 mg)+metformin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,215771.7,China,2010,37835.05
10312,Cost-effectiveness of vaccination with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Germany using a dynamic transmission model,"ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Persistent infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) are a necessary cause of cervical cancer and are responsible for important morbidity in men and women. Since 2007, HPV vaccination has been recommended and funded for all girls aged 12 to 17 in Germany. A previously published cost-effectiveness analysis, using a static model, showed that a quadrivalent HPV vaccination programme for 12-year-old girls in Germany would be cost effective. Here we present the results from a dynamic transmission model that can be used to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of different vaccination schemas. METHODS: We adapted a HPV dynamic transmission model, which has been used in other countries, to the German context. The model was used to compare a cervical cancer screening only strategy with a strategy of combining vaccination of females aged 12--17 years old and cervical cancer screening, based on the current recommendations in Germany. In addition, the impact of increasing vaccination coverage in this cohort of females aged 12--17 years old was evaluated in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The results from this analysis show that the current HPV vaccination programme of females ages 12 to 17 in Germany is cost-effective with an ICER of 5,525[euro sign]/QALY (quality adjusted life year). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) increased to 10,293[euro sign]/QALY when the vaccine effects on HPV6/11 diseases were excluded. At steady state, the model predicted that vaccinating girls aged 12 to 17 could reduce the number of HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancers by 65% and genital warts among women and men by 70% and 48%, respectively. The impact on HPV-related disease incidence and costs avoided would occur relatively soon after initiating the vaccine programme, with much of the early impact being due to the prevention of HPV6/11-related genital warts. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the current quadrivalent HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening programmes in Germany will substantially reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and genital warts. The evaluated vaccination strategies were all found to be cost-effective. Future analyses should include more HPV-related diseases.",2012-01-09805,23009387,Health Econ Rev,Deniz Schobert,2012,2 / 1,19,No,23009387,"Deniz Schobert; Vanessa Remy; Oliver Schoeffski; Cost-effectiveness of vaccination with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Germany using a dynamic transmission model, Health Econ Rev, Sep/25/2012; 2(1):2191-1991; 19",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination + cervical cancer screening vs. Cervical cancer screening,Not Stated,17 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,5525,Euro,2010,8678.61
10313,Cost-effectiveness of oral triptans for acute migraine: mixed treatment comparison,"Background: The cost-effectiveness of triptans in the treatment of migraine has not been assessed since generic sumatriptan entered the Finnish market in 2008. Methods: Using systematic review and mixed treatment comparison, the effectiveness of triptans was estimated with regard to 2-hour response, 2-hour pain-free, recurrence, and any adverse event, using published clinical data. Direct and indirect costs (2010 EUR, societal perspective) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were evaluated over one acute migraine attack using a decision-tree model. Results: The meta-analysis combined data from fifty-six publications. The highest probability of achieving the primary outcome, ""sustained pain-free, no adverse event"" (SNAE), was estimated for eletriptan 40 mg (20.9 percent). Sumatriptan 100 mg was the treatment with lowest estimated costs (?20.86), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of eletriptan 40 mg compared with sumatriptan 100 mg was ?43.65 per SNAE gained (?19,659 per QALY gained). Conclusion: Depending on the decision-maker's willingness-to-pay threshold, either sumatriptan 100 mg or eletriptan 40 mg is likely to be cost-effective.",2012-01-09810,23013610,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Christian Asseburg,2012,28 / 4,382-9,No,23013610,"Christian Asseburg; Piia Peura; Tuija Oksanen; Juha Turunen; Timo Purmonen; Janne Martikainen; Cost-effectiveness of oral triptans for acute migraine: mixed treatment comparison, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, ; 28(4):0266-4623; 382-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eetriptan (40 mg) vs. Sumatriptan (100 mg),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,19659,Euro,2010,30880.15
10314,Cost effectiveness of epidural steroid injections to manage chronic lower back pain,"The efficacy of epidural steroid injections in the management of chronic low back pain is disputed, yet the technique remains popular amongst physicians and patients alike. This study assesses the cost effectiveness of injections administered in a routine outpatient setting in England.Patients attending the Nottingham University Hospitals' Pain Clinic received two injections of methylprednisolone plus levobupivacaine at different dosages, separated by at least 12?weeks. Prior to each injection, and every week thereafter for 12?weeks, participants completed the EQ-5D health-related quality of life instrument. For each patient for each injection, total health state utility gain relative to baseline was calculated. The cost of the procedure was modelled from observed clinical practice. Cost effectiveness was calculated as procedure cost relative to utility gain.39 patients provided records. Over a 13-week period commencing with injection, mean quality adjusted life year (QALY) gains per patient for the two dosages were 0.028 (SD 0.063) and 0.021 (SD 0.057). The difference in QALYs gained by dosage was insignificant (paired t-test, CIs -0.019 - 0.033). Based on modelled resource use and data from other studies, the mean cost of an injection was estimated at ?219 (SD 83). The cost utility ratio of the two injections amounted to ?8,975 per QALY gained (CIs 5,480 - 22,915). However, at costs equivalent to the tariff price typically paid to providers by health care purchasers, the ratio increased to ?27,459 (CIs 16,779 - 70,091).When provided in an outpatient setting, epidural steroid injections are a short term, but nevertheless cost effective, means of managing chronic low back pain. However, designation of the procedure as a day case requires the National Health Service to reimburse providers at a price which pushes the procedure to the margin of cost effectiveness.ISRCTN 43299460.",2012-01-09814,23016755,BMC Anesthesiol,David K Whynes,2012,12 / 1,26,No,23016755,"David K Whynes; Robert A McCahon; Andrew Ravenscroft; Jonathan Hardman; Cost effectiveness of epidural steroid injections to manage chronic lower back pain, BMC Anesthesiol, ; 12(1):1471-2253; 26",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,40 mg and 80 mg injection of methylprednisone + 25 mg levobupivacaine vs. 25 mg levobupivacaine (analgesics alone),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,8975,United Kingdom,2010,16445.09
10315,Cost-Utility Analysis of a Telerehabilitation Program: A Case Study of COPD Patients,"Abstract Objective: The present study seeks to conduct cost-utility analysis (CUA) of the Danish TELEKAT (Telehomecare, Chronic Patients and the Integrated Healthcare System) project. The TELEKAT project seeks to test and develop a preventive home monitoring concept across sectors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The concept of the TELEKAT project is to reduce admissions by enabling the COPD patients to conduct self-monitoring and maintain rehabilitation activities in their own home. COPD patients with severe and very severe COPD were included in the study. Subjects and Methods: This economic evaluation follows international guidelines for the conduction of a CUA alongside a clinical randomized controlled trial. The analysis is based on a health sector perspective. Results: The mean incremental cost efficiency ratio, located in the southeast quadrant, shows that telerehabilitation is less costly and more effective than the rehabilitation given to the control group. The telerehabilitation program produces more value for money and generates savings on healthcare budgets. Conclusions: The telerehabilitation program appears to be more cost-effective than the conventional rehabilitation program for COPD patients.

Sacco"" Hospital, Milan, Italy.The incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was completed by means of a Markov model. Through a decision-analytic approach, this enabled us to compare the studied antiretroviral regimens. The model considered a population of adult HIV subjects who received HAART therapy for the first time according to clinical practice in the Infectious Diseases Department of ""L.

We considered the following outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and direct health costs calculated for the years 2008 and 2009. The time horizon adopted in the model was 2 years.The model revealed that, in terms of cost per gained QALY, the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine + efavirenz (TDF+FTC+EFV) once-a-day treatment strategy seems to be the most cost-effective therapeutic choice (?34,965); the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values for the remaining strategies ranged from ?53,000 to around ?62,000 per QALY. The validity of the base case scenario was then confirmed by means of a sensitivity analysis on the main variables.The TDF+FTC+EFV treatment strategy (TDF/FTC+EFV fixed-dose combination then switched to single-tablet regimen [STR]) in this setting is the most cost-effective treatment strategy compared with the other therapeutic regimens. The ICER value for the TDF+FTC+EFV once-a-day then switched to STR treatment was lower than the internationally generally accepted threshold value of ?50,000.

World Health Organization guidelines recommend 14-d amphotericin-based induction therapy; however, this is impractical for many resource-limited settings due to cost and intensive monitoring needs. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to guide stakeholders with respect to optimal CM treatment within resource limitations.We conducted a decision analysis to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of six CM induction regimens: fluconazole (800-1,200 mg/d) monotherapy, fluconazole + flucytosine (5FC), short-course amphotericin (7-d) + fluconazole, 14-d of amphotericin alone, amphotericin + fluconazole, and amphotericin + 5FC. We computed actual 2012 healthcare costs in Uganda for medications, supplies, and personnel, and average laboratory costs for three African countries. A systematic review of cryptococcal treatment trials in resource-limited areas summarized 10-wk survival outcomes. We modeled one-year survival based on South African, Ugandan, and Thai CM outcome data, and survival beyond one-year on Ugandan and Thai data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were determined and used to calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio and ICER. The cost of hospital care ranged from $154 for fluconazole monotherapy to $467 for 14 d of amphotericin + 5FC. Based on 18 studies investigating outcomes for HIV-infected individuals with CM in resource-limited settings, the estimated mean one-year survival was lowest for fluconazole monotherapy, at 40%. The cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $20 to $44 per QALY. Overall, amphotericin-based regimens had higher costs but better survival. Short-course amphotericin (1 mg/kg/d for 7 d) with fluconazole (1,200 mg/d for14 d) had the best one-year survival (66%) and the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio, at $20.24/QALY, with an ICER of $15.11 per additional QALY over fluconazole monotherapy. The main limitation of this study is the pooled nature of a systematic review, with a paucity of outcome data with direct comparisons between regimens.Short-course (7-d) amphotericin induction therapy coupled with high-dose (1,200 mg/d) fluconazole is ""very cost effective"" per World Health Organization criteria and may be a worthy investment for policy-makers seeking cost-effective clinical outcomes.

The cost of hospital care ranged from $154 for fluconazole monotherapy to $467 for 14 d of amphotericin + 5FC. Based on 18 studies investigating outcomes for HIV-infected individuals with CM in resource-limited settings, the estimated mean one-year survival was lowest for fluconazole monotherapy, at 40%. The cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $20 to $44 per QALY. Overall, amphotericin-based regimens had higher costs but better survival. Short-course amphotericin (1 mg/kg/d for 7 d) with fluconazole (1,200 mg/d for14 d) had the best one-year survival (66%) and the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio, at $20.24/QALY, with an ICER of $15.11 per additional QALY over fluconazole monotherapy. The main limitation of this study is the pooled nature of a systematic review, with a paucity of outcome data with direct comparisons between regimens.Short-course (7-d) amphotericin induction therapy coupled with high-dose (1,200 mg/d) fluconazole is ""very cost effective"" per World Health Organization criteria and may be a worthy investment for policy-makers seeking cost-effective clinical outcomes.

10340,Cryptococcal meningitis treatment strategies in resource-limited settings: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is the most common form of meningitis in Africa. World Health Organization guidelines recommend 14-d amphotericin-based induction therapy; however, this is impractical for many resource-limited settings due to cost and intensive monitoring needs. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to guide stakeholders with respect to optimal CM treatment within resource limitations.We conducted a decision analysis to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of six CM induction regimens: fluconazole (800-1,200 mg/d) monotherapy, fluconazole + flucytosine (5FC), short-course amphotericin (7-d) + fluconazole, 14-d of amphotericin alone, amphotericin + fluconazole, and amphotericin + 5FC. We computed actual 2012 healthcare costs in Uganda for medications, supplies, and personnel, and average laboratory costs for three African countries. A systematic review of cryptococcal treatment trials in resource-limited areas summarized 10-wk survival outcomes. We modeled one-year survival based on South African, Ugandan, and Thai CM outcome data, and survival beyond one-year on Ugandan and Thai data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were determined and used to calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio and ICER.

10341,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) for Treatment of Aortic Valve Stenosis: An Evidence-Based Analysis (Part B),"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR) for patients at high risk for surgery.To evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of TAVI for treatment of aortic valve stenosis in symptomatic older adults.A literature search was performed on September 6, 2011, for studies published from January 1, 2007, to September 6, 2011. A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed to compare costs, life years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of all treatment options in their respective patient populations over a 20-year time horizon.Two studies from the PARTNER trial were identified. The first study compared TAVI to sAVR in patients who were candidates for sAVR. The second study compared TAVI to standard treatment in patients who were not eligible for sAVR. The first study showed that TAVI and sAVR had similar mortality rates at 1 year. The second study showed a significant improvement in patient survival in those undergoing TAVI. However, in both studies, the TAVI group had significantly higher rates of stroke/transient ischemic attack, and major vascular complications. Rates of major bleeding were significantly higher in sAVR group in the first study and significantly higher in TAVI group in the second study. The base-case cost-effectiveness of TAVI was $48,912 per QALY, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $36,000 to $291,000 per QALY depending on the assumptions made in the longer-term prediction portion of the model (i.e., beyond the follow-up period of the PARTNER trial).TAVI improves survival in patients who cannot undergo surgery. For those who are candidates for surgery, TAVI has a mortality rate similar to sAVR, but it is associated with significant adverse effects.

10342,Epilepsy care in ontario: an economic analysis of increasing access to epilepsy surgery,"In August 2011 a proposed epilepsy care model was presented to the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) by an Expert Panel on a Provincial Strategy for Epilepsy Care in Ontario. The Expert Panel recommended leveraging existing infrastructure in the province to provide enhanced capacity for epilepsy care. The point of entry for epilepsy care and the diagnostic evaluation for surgery candidacy and the epilepsy surgery would occur at regional and district epilepsy centres in London, Hamilton, Toronto, and Ottawa and at new centres recommended for northern and eastern Ontario. This economic analysis report was requested by OHTAC to provide information about the estimated budgetary impact on the Ontario health care system of increasing access to epilepsy surgery and to examine the cost-effectiveness of epilepsy surgery in both children and adults.A prevalence-based ""top-down"" health care system budgetary impact model from the perspective of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care was developed to estimate the potential costs associated with expanding health care services to increase access to epilepsy care in general and epilepsy surgery in particular. A 5-year period (i.e., 2012-2016) was used to project annual costs associated with incremental epilepsy care services. Ontario Health Survey estimates of epilepsy prevalence, published epilepsy incidence data, and Canadian Census results for Ontario were used to approximate the number of individuals with epilepsy in the province. Applying these population estimates to data obtained from a recent field evaluation study that examined patterns of care and costs associated with epilepsy surgery in children, a health care system budget impact was calculated and the total costs and incremental costs associated with increasing access to surgery was estimated. In order to examine the cost-effectiveness of epilepsy surgery in children, a decision analysis compared epilepsy surgery to continued medical management in children with medically intractable epilepsy. Data from the field evaluation were combined with various published data to estimate the costs and outcomes for children with drug-refractory epilepsy over a 20-year period. Outcomes were defined as the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accumulated over 20 years following epilepsy surgery.There are about 20,981 individuals with medically intractable epilepsy in Ontario. Of these, 9,619 (1,441 children and 8,178 adults) could potentially be further assessed at regional epilepsy centres for suitability for epilepsy surgery, following initial evaluation at a district epilepsy care centre. The health care system impact analysis related to increasing access to epilepsy surgery in the Ontario through the addition of epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) beds with video electroencephalography (vEEG) monitoring (total capacity of 15 pediatric EMU beds and 35 adult EMU beds distributed across the province) and the associated clinical resources is estimated to require an incremental $18.1 million (Cdn) annually over the next 5 years from 2012 to 2016. This would allow for about 675 children and 1050 adults to be evaluated each year for suitability for epilepsy surgery representing a 150% increase in pediatric epilepsy surgery evaluation and a 170% increase in adult epilepsy surgery evaluation. Epilepsy surgery was found to be cost-effective compared to continued medical management in children with drug-refractory epilepsy with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,020 (Cdn) to $69,451 (Cdn) per QALY for 2 of the scenarios examined. In the case of choosing epilepsy surgery versus continued medical management in children known to be suitable for surgery, the epilepsy surgery was found to be less costly and provided greater clinical benefit, that is, it was the dominant strategy.Epilepsy surgery for medically intractable epilepsy in suitable candidates has consistently been found to provide favourable clinical outcomes and has been demonstrated to be cost-effective in both adult and child patient populations. The first step to increasing access to epilepsy surgery is to provide access to evidence-based care for all patients with epilepsy, both adults and children, through the provision of resources to expand EMU bed capacity and associated clinical personnel across the province of Ontario. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent, unpredictable, and spontaneous seizures, affects approximately 70,000 people in Ontario. About 30% continue to suffer from seizures despite using 2 or more anti-seizure medications. For these individuals epilepsy surgery is a treatment option to stop the seizures or at least reduce their frequency. Awareness of this treatment option is not widespread and people are not commonly referred to those hospitals in Ontario where this surgery is available. A proposal to increase access to epilepsy care and surgery has been made by an expert committee that provided a report to the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC). In order to address the lack of access of patients with medically intractable epilepsy to the possibility of curative surgical treatment, it is necessary to design a system that provides equal availability of evidence-based treatment for all epilepsy patients in Ontario, both adults and children. To this end, the establishment of district epilepsy care centres and the further development of the existing regional epilepsy care centres in the province have been proposed. This report outlines the estimated additional funds that will be required to implement the proposal. It also examines the cost-effectiveness of referral to these centres and epilepsy surgery. For the 21,000 people in the province with drug-refractory epilepsy, referral to an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) located at one of the epilepsy care centres is the first step to determining if epilepsy surgery is an option for them. The expert committee proposal suggests that the number of EMU beds be increased from the current 19 to 50 to allow for the assessment of those individuals with drug-refractory epilepsy. The health care system budget impact model presented in this report estimates that it would cost approximately $18 million (Cdn) each year over the next 5 years to increase the number of EMU beds and expand associated epilepsy care centres to permit the systematic evidence-based care of all Ontarians with epilepsy and evaluate more people for surgery candidacy. This amount would provide appropriate care for patients with epilepsy and ensure that about 675 children and 1050 adults could be assessed each year for suitability for epilepsy surgery. Surgery could then be made available to just over 300 people per year. Epilepsy surgery over the long term is a less expensive treatment alternative for adults and children with medically refractory epilepsy compared with continued drug treatment. In addition, drug treatment does not always work for some patients; nor does it necessarily provide improved quality of life. This report includes a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing referral for assessment for epilepsy surgery with continuing medical management in children with drug-refractory epilepsy. In all the cases examined epilepsy surgery provides good value for money over a 20-year period.

10345,Value-of-information analysis to reduce decision uncertainty associated with the choice of thromboprophylaxis after total hip replacement in the irish healthcare setting,"The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, in collaboration with the Health Services Executive, considers the cost effectiveness of all new medicines introduced into Ireland. Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are conducted in accordance with the existing agreed Irish HTA guidelines. These guidelines do not specify a formal analysis of value of information (VOI).The aim of this study was to demonstrate the benefits of using VOI analysis in decreasing decision uncertainty and to examine the viability of applying these techniques as part of the formal HTA process for reimbursement purposes within the Irish healthcare system.The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health payer perspective. A lifetime model evaluated the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after total hip replacement. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was determined directly from the probabilistic analysis (PSA). Population-level EVPI (PEVPI) was determined by scaling up the EVPI according to the decision incidence. The expected value of perfect parameter information (EVPPI) was calculated for the three model parameter subsets: probabilities, preference weights and direct medical costs.In the base-case analysis, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium. PSA indicated that rivaroxaban had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy over a threshold range of &U20AC;0-&U20AC;100?000 per QALY. At a threshold of &U20AC;45?000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy was 67%. At a threshold of &U20AC;45?000 per QALY, assuming a 10-year decision time horizon, the PEVPI was &U20AC;11.96?million and the direct medical costs subset had the highest EVPPI value (&U20AC;9.00?million at a population level). In order to decrease uncertainty, a more detailed costing study was undertaken. In the subsequent analysis, rivaroxaban continued to dominate both comparators. In the PSA, rivaroxaban continued to have the highest probability of being optimal over the threshold range &U20AC;0-&U20AC;100?000 per QALY.

10356,Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic vs open resection for colon and rectal cancer,"Whether laparoscopic surgery for colon and rectal cancer is cost-effective in comparison with open surgery remains unclear, because laparoscopic surgery results in shorter hospital stays but is associated with increased equipment costs.This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open surgery for colon and rectal cancer, incorporating factors not included in previous cost-effectiveness studies.A decision analysis model was constructed, and extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to test the assumptions of the model.Data were taken from previously published studies; data from large randomized trials were used whenever possible as inputs into the model.Patients enrolled in the trials from which data were gathered for the model.There were no interventions.The primary outcome measured was the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open surgery for colon and rectal cancer, expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year.Laparoscopic resection results in savings of $4283 and essentially no difference in quality-adjusted life-years (0.001 more quality-adjusted life-years than open resection). Sensitivity analyses indicate that laparoscopic surgery is cost-effective at <$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year under almost all conditions. The only circumstance that affects the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery is postoperative hernia rates. Because of the additional time off work for hernia repair, laparoscopic resection is cost-effective only if it results in a hernia rate less than or equal to open surgery. For all other variables, the laparoscopic approach remains less costly than the open approach with no difference in quality of life.The model relies on data from other studies, rather than being an independent trial designed to specifically collect these data.Laparoscopic resection for colon and rectal cancer results in decreased costs and equivalent quality of life, making it the preferred approach in suitable patients.",2012-01-09865,22965399,Dis Colon Rectum,Christine C Jensen,2012,55 / 10,1017-23,No,22965399,"Christine C Jensen; Leela M Prasad; Herand Abcarian; Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic vs open resection for colon and rectal cancer, Dis Colon Rectum, ; 55(10):0012-3706; 1017-23",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic surgery vs. Open resection,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-4283000,United States,2010,-5083499.25
10357,The cost effectiveness of genetic testing for CYP2C19 variants to guide thienopyridine treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes: a New Zealand evaluation,"A recent clinical trial has demonstrated that patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the reduced function allele CYP2C19*2 (*2 allele), who are treated with thienopyridines, have an increased risk of adverse cardiac events with clopidogrel, but not with prasugrel. The frequency of the *2 allele varies by ethnicity and the Maoris, Asians and Pacific Islanders of New Zealand have a relatively high incidence.Our objective was to evaluate, from a New Zealand health system perspective, the cost effectiveness of treating all ACS patients with generic clopidogrel compared with prasugrel, and also compared with the genetically guided strategy that *2 allele carriers receive prasugrel and non-carriers receive clopidogrel.A decision-tree model consisting of five health states (myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, stent thrombosis and cardiovascular death) was developed. Clinical outcome data (two TRITON-TIMI 38 genetic sub-studies) comparing clopidogrel and prasugrel for both *2 allele carriers and non-carriers were combined with the prevalence of the heterozygosity for the *2 allele in New Zealand Europeans (15%), Maoris (24%), Asians (29%) and Pacific Islanders (45%) to determine the predicted adverse event rate for the New Zealand population. National hospital diagnosis-related group (DRG) discharge codes were used to determine alternative adverse event rates, along with the costs of hospitalizations during the 15 months after patients presented with an ACS. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per QALY (calculated using literature-reported weights).

10365,The cost effectiveness of genetic testing for CYP2C19 variants to guide thienopyridine treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes: a New Zealand evaluation,"A recent clinical trial has demonstrated that patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the reduced function allele CYP2C19*2 (*2 allele), who are treated with thienopyridines, have an increased risk of adverse cardiac events with clopidogrel, but not with prasugrel. The frequency of the *2 allele varies by ethnicity and the Maoris, Asians and Pacific Islanders of New Zealand have a relatively high incidence.Our objective was to evaluate, from a New Zealand health system perspective, the cost effectiveness of treating all ACS patients with generic clopidogrel compared with prasugrel, and also compared with the genetically guided strategy that *2 allele carriers receive prasugrel and non-carriers receive clopidogrel.A decision-tree model consisting of five health states (myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, stent thrombosis and cardiovascular death) was developed. Clinical outcome data (two TRITON-TIMI 38 genetic sub-studies) comparing clopidogrel and prasugrel for both *2 allele carriers and non-carriers were combined with the prevalence of the heterozygosity for the *2 allele in New Zealand Europeans (15%), Maoris (24%), Asians (29%) and Pacific Islanders (45%) to determine the predicted adverse event rate for the New Zealand population. National hospital diagnosis-related group (DRG) discharge codes were used to determine alternative adverse event rates, along with the costs of hospitalizations during the 15 months after patients presented with an ACS. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per QALY (calculated using literature-reported weights). Monte Carlo simulations and alternative scenario analysis based on both clinical trial and national hospital incidence were used. Additional analysis considered the overall TRITON-TIMI 38 rates. Costs (in New Zealand dollars [$NZ], year 2009 values) and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum.Actual hospital-based adverse event rates were higher than those reported in the TRITON-TIMI 38 randomized controlled trial and the genetic sub-studies, especially for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, and for Maoris and Pacific Islanders. For both sources of adverse event rates, treating the population with prasugrel was associated with worse outcomes (QALYs) than clopidogrel.

10372,Evaluation of a predevelopment service delivery intervention: an application to improve clinical handovers,"We developed a method to estimate the expected cost-effectiveness of a service intervention at the design stage and 'road-tested' the method on an intervention to improve patient handover of care between hospital and community.The development of a nine-step evaluation framework: 1. Identification of multiple endpoints and arranging them into manageable groups; 2. Estimation of baseline overall and preventable risk; 3. Bayesian elicitation of expected effectiveness of the planned intervention; 4. Assigning utilities to groups of endpoints; 5. Costing the intervention; 6. Estimating health service costs associated with preventable adverse events; 7. Calculating health benefits; 8. Cost-effectiveness calculation; 9. Sensitivity and headroom analysis.Literature review suggested that adverse events follow 19% of patient discharges, and that one-third are preventable by improved handover (ie, 6.3% of all discharges). The intervention to improve handover would reduce the incidence of adverse events by 21% (ie, from 6.3% to 4.7%) according to the elicitation exercise. Potentially preventable adverse events were classified by severity and duration. Utilities were assigned to each category of adverse event. The costs associated with each category of event were obtained from the literature. The unit cost of the intervention was ?16.6, which would yield a Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gain per discharge of 0.010. The resulting cost saving was ?14.3 per discharge. The intervention is cost-effective at approximately ?214 per QALY under the base case, and remains cost-effective while the effectiveness is greater than 1.6%.We offer a usable framework to assist in ex ante health economic evaluations of health service interventions.",2012-01-09867,22976505,BMJ Qual Saf,Guiqing Lily Yao,2012,21Suppl1 /,i29-38,No,22976505,"Guiqing Lily Yao; Nicola Novielli; Semira Manaseki-Holland; Yen-Fu Chen; Marcel van der Klink; Paul Barach; Peter J Chilton; Richard J Lilford; European HANDOVER Research Colla; Evaluation of a predevelopment service delivery intervention: an application to improve clinical handovers, BMJ Qual Saf, ; 21Suppl1():2044-5423; i29-38",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Service delivery/educational intervention to improve patient care at the point of discharge from hospital to the community vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,214.15,Euro,2011,342.88
10373,"Determination of the minimum improvement in pain, disability, and health state associated with cost-effectiveness: introduction of the concept of minimum cost-effective difference","Background: Minimum clinical important difference (MCID) has been adopted as the smallest improvement in patient-reported outcome needed to achieve a level of improvement thought to be meaningful to patients. Objective: To use a common MCID calculation method with a cost-utility threshold anchor to introduce the concept of minimum cost-effective difference (MCED). Methods: Forty-five patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis were included. Outcome questionnaires were administered before and 2 years after surgery. Total cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated for each patient. MCED was determined from receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis with a cost-effective anchor of < $50,000/QALY and < $75,000/QALY. MCID was determined with the health transition item as the anchor. Results: Significant improvement was observed 2 years after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for all outcome measures. Mean total cost per QALY gained at 2 years was $42,854. MCED was greater than MCID for each outcome measure, meaning that a greater improvement was required to represent cost-effectiveness than a clinically meaningful improvement to patients. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was consistently ≥ 0.70 with both cost-effective anchors, suggesting that outcome change scores were accurate predictors of cost-effectiveness. Mean cost per QALY gained was significantly lower for patients achieving compared with those not achieving an MCED in visual analog scale for leg pain ($43,560 vs. $112,087), visual analog scale for back pain ($41,280 vs. $129,440), Oswestry disability index ($30,954 vs. $121,750), and EuroQol 5D ($35,800 vs. $189,412). Conclusion: MCED serves as the smallest improvement in an outcome instrument that is associated with a cost-effective response to surgery. With the use of cost-effective anchor of < $50,000/QALY, MCED after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion was 4 points for visual analog scale for low back pain, 3 points for visual analog scale for leg pain, 22 points for Oswestry disability index, and 0.31 QALYs for EuroQol 5D.",2012-01-09868,22986596,Neurosurgery,Scott L Parker,2012,71 / 6,1149-55,No,22986596,"Scott L Parker; Matthew J McGirt; Determination of the minimum improvement in pain, disability, and health state associated with cost-effectiveness: introduction of the concept of minimum cost-effective difference, Neurosurgery, ; 71(6):0148-396X; 1149-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) surgery vs. None (pre-surgery),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,42854,United States,2010,50863.48

10379,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of needle-syringe programs in Australia,"To evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of needle-syringe programs (NSPs) with respect to HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among Australian injecting drug users (IDUs).A health economic analysis was conducted incorporating a mathematical model of HIV and HCV transmission among IDUs. An empirical relationship between syringe availability and receptive syringe sharing (RSS) was assessed. We compared the epidemiological outcomes and costs of NSP coverage (status quo RSS of 15-17%) with scenarios that had no NSPs (RSS of 25-50%). Outcomes included numbers of HIV and HCV infections averted, lifetime health sector costs, and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Discounting was applied at 3% (sensitivity: 0%, 5%) per annum.We estimated that NSPs reduced incidence of HIV by 34-70% (192-873 cases) and HCV by 15-43% (19?000-77?000 cases) during 2000-2010, leading to 20?000-66?000 QALYs gained. Economic analysis showed that NSP coverage saved A$70-220 million in healthcare costs during 2000-2010 and will save an additional A$340-950 million in future healthcare costs. With NSPs costing A$245 million, the programs are very cost-effective at A$416-8750 per QALY gained. Financial investment in NSPs over 2000-2010 is estimated to be entirely recovered in healthcare cost savings by 2032 with a total future return on investment of $1.3-5.5 for every $1 invested.Australia's early introduction and high coverage of NSPs has significantly reduced the prevalence of HIV and HCV among IDUs.

10380,Novel health economic evaluation of a vaccination strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases: the BEST study,"The development of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related diseases is not understood perfectly and uncertainties associated with commonly utilized probabilistic models must be considered. The study assessed the cost-effectiveness of a quadrivalent-based multicohort HPV vaccination strategy within a Bayesian framework.A full Bayesian multicohort Markov model was used, in which all unknown quantities were associated with suitable probability distributions reflecting the state of currently available knowledge. These distributions were informed by observed data or expert opinion. The model cycle lasted 1 year, whereas the follow-up time horizon was 90 years. Precancerous cervical lesions, cervical cancers, and anogenital warts were considered as outcomes.The base case scenario (2 cohorts of girls aged 12 and 15 y) and other multicohort vaccination strategies (additional cohorts aged 18 and 25 y) were cost-effective, with a discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained that corresponded to ?12,013, ?13,232, and ?15,890 for vaccination programs based on 2, 3, and 4 cohorts, respectively. With multicohort vaccination strategies, the reduction in the number of HPV-related events occurred earlier (range, 3.8-6.4 y) when compared with a single cohort. The analysis of the expected value of information showed that the results of the model were subject to limited uncertainty (cost per patient = ?12.6).This methodological approach is designed to incorporate the uncertainty associated with HPV vaccination. Modeling the cost-effectiveness of a multicohort vaccination program with Bayesian statistics confirmed the value for money of quadrivalent-based HPV vaccination.

10381,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sacral neuromodulation for faecal incontinence in The Netherlands,"Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) plays a major part in the algorithm of management of faecal incontinence, but there are limited data on its cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to analyse this and the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with two different treatment algorithms. The first (SNM-) included use of an artificial sphincter [dynamic graciloplasty (DGP) (50%) and artificial bowel sphincter (ABS) (50%)]. The second (SNM+) included SNM (80% of cases) and artificial sphincter (DGP 10%; ABS 10%) The incidence of sphincteroplasty was assumed to be equal in both algorithms.A Markov model was developed. A hypothetical cohort of patients was run through both strategies of the model. A mailed EuroQoL-5D questionnaire was used to determine health-related quality of life. Costs were reproduced from the Maastricht University Medical Centre prospective faecal incontinence database. The time scale of the analysis was 5 years.The former treatment protocol cost ?22,651 per patient and the latter, after the introduction of SNM, cost ?16,473 per patient. The former treatment protocol resulted in a success rate of 0.59 after 5 years, whereas with the introduction of SNM this was 0.82. Adhering to the former treatment protocol yielded 4.14 QALYs and implementing the latter produced 4.21 QALYs.The study demonstrated that introducing SNM in the surgical management algorithm for faecal incontinence was both more effective and less costly than DGP or ABS without SNM.

NICE had previously considered the use of omalizumab in patients aged 12 years and over. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and the Centre for Health Economics (CHE) at the University of York were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) to critically appraise the evidence presented by the manufacturer. This article summarizes that review of the evidence, the deliberations of the NICE Appraisal Committee and the resulting NICE guidance. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The relevant patient population was patients aged 6-11 years of age with severe persistent allergic immunoglobulin E-mediated asthma whose condition remained uncontrolled despite best standard care with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting inhaled ?2-agonist. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a pre-planned subgroup analysis of a single randomized controlled trial comparing omalizumab plus standard therapy against standard therapy alone. At a 52-week follow-up, the only outcome to show a statistically significant benefit of omalizumab compared with placebo was the number of exacerbations defined as 'clinically significant' [CS] (relative risk [RR] 0.504; 95% CI 0.350, 0.725; p?<?0.001). At the ERG's request, the manufacturer provided analyses stratified by baseline exacerbation rate, which indicated the effect of omalizumab on CS exacerbations was statistically significant only for those children with =3 exacerbations as baseline. The ERG identified a number of issues relating to the clinical effectiveness results: it was unclear whether the pre-planned subgroup analysis had sufficient power; the definition of CS exacerbation was less severe than that used in UK clinical practice; and the method for imputing exacerbations for those who withdrew from treatment may have underestimated the exacerbation rate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on the manufacturer's results was considerably above the threshold range stated in the NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal. The ERG identified numerous issues relating to the cost-effectiveness results, which included the following: the 10-year time horizon for treatment may exceed that in clinical practice; the assumption of constant exacerbation rates over a lifetime given that adolescence is expected to impact on the severity of asthma; and whether it is appropriate to use health-related quality-of-life data collected in adults for children. The ERG concluded that omalizumab appears to reduce CS exacerbations but there was no evidence of improvement in daily symptoms, CS severe (CSS) exacerbations or hospitalization rates. The main driver of cost effectiveness was the reduction in asthma-related mortality associated with a reduction in CSS exacerbations. As the number of CSS exacerbations avoided was low, as is asthma-related mortality in children, the potential small gain in QALYs associated with omalizumab was not sufficient to compensate for the high treatment cost even under the most favourable scenario analyses.

10388,Lifetime cost-utility analyses of deferasirox in beta-thalassaemia patients with chronic iron overload: a UK perspective,"Regular blood transfusions for beta-thalassaemia patients lead to the accumulation of iron deposits in the body. In order to remove such deposits, iron chelation therapy is required. Subcutaneously administered deferoxamine has been the gold standard chelation therapy for over 40?years. Deferasirox is a newer chelation therapy that is taken orally once daily. The objective of this study was to estimate the long-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with deferoxamine and deferasirox in a cohort of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia patients from a UK health service perspective.A 50-year annual cycle state transition model comprised three core health states: alive without cardiac complications, alive with cardiac complications, and dead, as well as representing other chronic complications of iron overload: diabetes, hypogonadism, hypoparathyroidism and hypothyroidism. The model was calibrated to identify sets of convergent input parameter values that predicted observed overall survival by mean lifetime compliance with chelation therapy. A pivotal non-inferiority trial informed the main estimates of the effectiveness of deferasirox, which were applied to the calibrated model. Using cost values for the year 2011, costs and utilities were summed over patients' lifetimes to estimate lifetime costs and QALY gains.Mean lifetime treatment costs for patients receiving deferoxamine were ?70,000 higher than deferasirox. Drug acquisition costs were ?100,000 higher for deferasirox, but administration costs associated with deferoxamine were ?170,000 higher. Higher compliance associated with oral deferasirox administration led to fewer complications. Combined with the quality-of-life effects of an oral mode of administration, an average gain of 4.85?QALYs for deferasirox was estimated. In the base case, deferasirox dominates deferoxamine, i.e., costs less and patients gain more QALYs. The key parameter is the proportion of deferoxamine patients using balloon infusers. Sensitivity analyses showed that even when the proportion of patients using balloon infusers is decreased from 79 to 25?%, the incremental cost per QALY gained remains well under ?20,000.Higher drug acquisition costs for deferasirox are offset by the avoidance of infusion-related equipment costs.

10392,Cost-effectiveness of compression technologies for evidence-informed leg ulcer care: results from the Canadian Bandaging Trial,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Venous leg ulcers, affecting approximately 1% of the population, are costly to manage due to poor healing and high recurrence rates. We evaluated an evidence-informed leg ulcer care protocol with two frequently used high compression systems: 'four-layer bandage' (4LB) and 'short-stretch bandage' (SSB). METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using individual patient data from the Canadian Bandaging Trial, a publicly funded, pragmatic, randomized trial evaluating high compression therapy with 4LB (n?=?215) and SSB (n?=?209) for community care of venous leg ulcers. We estimated costs (in 2009-2010 Canadian dollars) from the societal perspective and used a time horizon corresponding to each trial participant's first year. RESULTS: Relative to SSB, 4LB was associated with an average 15 ulcer-free days gained, although the 95% confidence interval [-32, 21 days] crossed zero, indicating no treatment difference; an average health benefit of 0.009 QALYs gained [-0.019, 0.037] and overall, an average cost increase of $420 [$235, $739] (due to twice as many 4LB bandages used); or equivalently, a cost of $46,667 per QALY gained. If decision makers are willing to pay from $50,000 to $100,000 per QALY, the probability of 4LB being more cost effective increased from 51% to 63%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings differ from the emerging clinical and economic evidence that supports high compression therapy with 4LB, and therefore suggest another perspective on high compression practice, namely when delivered by trained registered nurses using an evidence-informed protocol, both 4LB and SSB systems offer comparable effectiveness and value for money.

This study estimated cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs usual care from the perspective of the Ontario public payer.A previously published PMO Markov cohort model was adapted for Canada to estimate cost-effectiveness of denosumab. The primary analysis included women with demographic characteristics similar to those from the pivotal phase III denosumab PMO trial (FREEDOM; age 72 years, femoral neck BMD T-score -2.16 SD, vertebral fracture prevalence 23.6%). Three additional scenario sub-groups were examined including women: (1) at high fracture risk, defined in FREEDOM as having at least two of three risk factors (age 70+; T-score = -3.0 SD at lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; prevalent vertebral fracture); (2) age 75+; and (3) intolerant or contraindicated to oral bisphosphonates (BPs). Analyses were conducted over a lifetime horizon comparing denosumab to usual care ('no therapy', alendronate, risedronate, or raloxifene [sub-group 3 only]). The analysis considered treatment-specific persistence and post-discontinuation residual efficacy, as well as treatment-specific adverse events. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.The multi-therapy comparisons resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for denosumab vs alendronate of $60,266 (2010 CDN$) (primary analysis) and $27,287 per quality-adjusted life year gained for scenario sub-group 1.

Analyses were conducted over a lifetime horizon comparing denosumab to usual care ('no therapy', alendronate, risedronate, or raloxifene [sub-group 3 only]). The analysis considered treatment-specific persistence and post-discontinuation residual efficacy, as well as treatment-specific adverse events. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.The multi-therapy comparisons resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for denosumab vs alendronate of $60,266 (2010 CDN$) (primary analysis) and $27,287 per quality-adjusted life year gained for scenario sub-group 1.
