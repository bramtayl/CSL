20501,Cost-Effectiveness of a US National Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax With a Multistakeholder Approach: Who Pays and Who Benefits,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of a national penny-per-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax, overall and with stratified costs and benefits for 9 distinct stakeholder groups. METHODS: We used a validated microsimulation model (CVD PREDICT) to estimate cardiovascular disease reductions, quality-adjusted life years gained, and cost-effectiveness for US adults aged 35 to 85 years, evaluating full and partial consumer price pass-through. RESULTS: From health care and societal perspectives, the SSB tax was highly cost-saving. When we evaluated health gains, taxes paid, and out-of-pocket health care savings for 6 distinct consumer categories, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $20 247 to $42 662 per quality-adjusted life year for 100% price pass-through (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios similar with 50% pass-through). For the beverage industry, net costs were $0.92 billion with 100% pass-through (largely tax-implementation costs) and $49.75 billion with 50% pass-through (largely because of partial industry coverage of the tax). For government, the SSB tax positively affected both tax revenues and health care cost savings.

20511,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a multicentre randomized clinical trial comparing surgery with conservative management for recurrent and ongoing diverticulitis (DIRECT trial),"BACKGROUND: The results of the DIRECT trial, an RCT comparing conservative management with elective sigmoid resection in patients with recurrent diverticulitis or persistent complaints, showed that elective sigmoid resection leads to higher quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment at 1- and 5-year follow-up from a societal perspective. METHODS: Clinical effectiveness and resource use were derived from the DIRECT trial. The actual resource use and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L score) were documented prospectively per individual patient and analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle for up to 5 years after randomization. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: The study included 106 patients, of whom 50 were randomized to surgery and 56 to conservative treatment. At 1- and 5-year follow-up an incremental effect (QALY difference between groups) of 0.06 and 0.43 respectively was found, and an incremental cost (cost difference between groups) of euro6957 and euro2674 respectively, where surgery was more expensive than conservative treatment. This resulted in an ICER of euro123 365 per additional QALY at 1-year follow-up, and euro6275 at 5 years. At a threshold of euro20 000 per QALY, operative treatment has 0 per cent probability of being cost-effective at 1-year follow-up, but a 95 per cent probability at 5 years.

MATERIALS & METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to estimate total costs and health outcomes over a patient''s lifetime (30 years). Efficacy was based on the CheckMate 067/069 trials and a matching-adjusted-indirect comparison between immuno-oncology and targeted therapies. Safety, cost (in US dollars; US third-party payer perspective) and health-related quality-of-life inputs were based on published literature. RESULTS: Estimated survival gain was higher for sequences initiating with anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 than for anti-PD-1 monotherapy or BRAF+MEK inhibitors. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained for first-line anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 was US$54,273 versus first-line anti-PD-1 and $79,124 versus first-line BRAF+MEK inhibitors.

20516,A decision analysis comparing 3 active surveillance protocols for the treatment of patients with low-risk prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) is a viable management option for approximately 50% of men who are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer. To the authors'' knowledge, no direct comparisons between the different variants of AS protocols have been conducted to date. The authors developed a microsimulation decision model to evaluate which of 3 alternative AS protocols is optimal for men with low-risk prostate cancer, and compared each of these with immediate treatment. METHODS: Men who were diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer at age 65 years were modeled as having been treated with either immediate therapy or via each of 3 AS protocols. Modeled AS protocols represent those in the literature; a modified AS protocol was included in a sensitivity analysis. Immediate therapy included radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Immediate therapy produced fewer QALYs than all variants of AS. Of the AS protocols evaluated, biennial biopsy was found to be the only efficient option, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3490 per QALY compared with immediate therapy. It delayed the need for curative therapy by a mean of 56 months, and was found to be preferred in >86.9% of cases in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. A modified version of low-intensity AS dominated all other options. CONCLUSIONS: For a 65-year-old man with low-risk prostate cancer, AS with biennial biopsy appears to be highly cost-effective compared with common alternatives. An AS protocol using triennial biopsy was found to dominate all other strategies and should be considered for men who are comfortable with a longer period between biopsies.

20519,Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation Versus Cryoballoon Ablation in the Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis in China,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) compared with cryoballoon (CB) ablation in the treatment of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) from the payer''s perspective in China. METHODS: We constructed a cohort model, combining a 12-month decision-tree model with a lifetime Markov state-transition model, in a hypothetical cohort of patients with drug-refractory PAF managed with either RFCA or CB ablation, to compare the cost-effectiveness of the 2 procedures. Data related to clinical outcomes and costs in this model were obtained from a retrospective 12-month follow-up study in patients in China and from related literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a 10-year time period was calculated and compared against the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. We used a 1-way sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to access the structural uncertainty and the parameter uncertainty, respectively. FINDINGS: Over a 10-year time horizon, the total costs per patient of RFCA and CB ablation were yen98,164.04 (US $15,339.57; euro13,058.94) and yen107,542.37 ($16,805.07; euro14,306.55), respectively, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were 5.47 and 5.43, respectively. The ICER ratio was - yen224,365.01 (-$35,060.32; -euro29,847.68) per QALY, indicating that RFCA is associated with greater QALYs and lower costs than CB ablation. The 1-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model results were most sensitive to the odds ratio of the atrial fibrillation recurrence within 12 months in the RFCA group versus the CB ablation group, the cost of RFCA, and the perioperative stroke risk with RFCA. According to the results of the PSA, RFCA was associated with a high probability of being cost-effective (99.48%) compared with CB ablation at a WTP threshold of yen161,940 ($25,305.50; euro21,543.17) per QALY. IMPLICATIONS: Our analysis indicates that RFCA is cost-saving compared with CB ablation in the treatment of patients with PAF in China, based on better QALYs and lower costs over a 10-year time horizon, from the payer''s perspective.",2019-01-28209,30559005,Clin Ther,Xue-Rong Sun,2019,41 / 1,78-91,Yes,30559005,"Xue-Rong Sun; Shu-Nan He; Zi-Yi Lin; Lei Zhang; Yan-Jiang Wang; Li-Jun Zeng; Liang Shi; Jian-Wei Xuan; Ying Tian; Xin-chun Yang; Xing-Peng Liu; Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation Versus Cryoballoon Ablation in the Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis in China, Clin Ther, 2019 Jan; 41(1):1879-114X; 78-91",QALY,China,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation vs. Cryoballoon Ablation,Refractory to 1 or more antiarrhythmic drug,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-234458.25,China,2017,-36637.18
20520,An economic evaluation of perioperative enteral nutrition in patients undergoing colorectal surgery (SANICS II study),"AIMS: The objective of this (trial based) economic evaluation was to assess, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of perioperative enteral nutrition compared with standard care in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alongside the SANICS II randomized controlled trial, global quality-of-life, utilities (measured by EQ-5D-5L), healthcare costs, production losses, and patient and family costs were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e. cost per increased global quality-of-life score or quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) and cost effectiveness acceptability curves were visualized. RESULTS: In total, 265 patients were included in the original trial (n = 132 in the perioperative enteral nutrition group and n = 133 in the standard care group). At 6 months, global quality-of-life (83 vs 83, p = .357) did not differ significantly between the groups. The mean total societal costs for the intervention and standard care groups were euro14,673 and euro11,974, respectively, but did not reach statistical significance (p = .109). The intervention resulted in an ICER of -euro6,276 per point increase in the global quality of life score. The gain in QALY was marginal (0.003), with an additional cost of euro2,941, and the ICUR (Incremental cost utility ratio) was estimated at euro980,333. LIMITATIONS: The cost elements for all the participating centers reflect the reference prices from the Netherlands. Patient-reported questionnaires may have resulted in recall bias. Sample size was limited by exclusion of patients who did not complete questionnaires for at least at two time points. A power analysis based on costs and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) was not performed. The economic impact could not be analyzed at 1 month post-operatively where the effects could potentially be higher.

20521,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Routine Screening Using Massively Parallel Sequencing for Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young in a Pediatric Diabetes Cohort: Reduced Health System Costs and Improved Patient Quality of Life,"OBJECTIVE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes, with multiple causative genes. Some MODY subtypes can be treated with sulfonylureas instead of insulin, improving glycemic control, complication rates, quality of life (QoL), and costs. Using massively parallel sequencing (MPS), we recently determined the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic MODY variants in an Australian pediatric diabetes cohort. Here, these data are used to estimate cost-effectiveness of using MPS for MODY in all pediatric diabetes cases compared with standard practice (sequencing limited to individuals with specific clinical features). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to estimate incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of MPS screening, modeled over 30 years. We used our observed prevalence of 2.14% compared with 0.7% for standard practice, based on published data. The probabilities and utility weightings of long-term diabetes complications were based on HbA1c and estimated from published data. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses were performed using the net monetary benefit framework. RESULTS: Routine MPS screening for MODY was more effective and less costly than standard care screening, with 26 QALYs gained and 1,016,000 AUD (782,000 USD) saved per 1,000 patients. Cost of screening was fully offset within 10 years. Routine MPS screening remained dominant until MODY prevalence fell to <1.1%.

Approximately 63% of cases are classified as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) at the time of diagnosis. The aim of this cost-utility analysis is to evaluate alemtuzumab vs interferon beta (intramuscular [IM] interferon beta-1a, subcutaneous [SC] interferon beta-1a, SC interferon beta-1b, and SC pegylated interferon beta-1a) in previously treated, and vs SC interferon beta-1a, fingolimod, and natalizumab in untreated RRMS patients to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio among the treatment alternatives as prices, the route, and the frequency of administration of considered products vary significantly. METHODS: The primary outcome was the modeled incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; euro/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Markov modeling with a 10-year time horizon was carried out. During each 3-month cycle, patients maintained the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or experienced progression, developed secondary progressive MS (SPMS), or showed EDSS progression in SPMS; experienced relapses; suffered from an adverse event (AE); changed treatment; or died. A published network meta-analysis (NMA) was used for indirect comparison. The possibility of a therapy switch was considered.

The aim of this cost-utility analysis is to evaluate alemtuzumab vs interferon beta (intramuscular [IM] interferon beta-1a, subcutaneous [SC] interferon beta-1a, SC interferon beta-1b, and SC pegylated interferon beta-1a) in previously treated, and vs SC interferon beta-1a, fingolimod, and natalizumab in untreated RRMS patients to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio among the treatment alternatives as prices, the route, and the frequency of administration of considered products vary significantly. METHODS: The primary outcome was the modeled incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; euro/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Markov modeling with a 10-year time horizon was carried out. During each 3-month cycle, patients maintained the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or experienced progression, developed secondary progressive MS (SPMS), or showed EDSS progression in SPMS; experienced relapses; suffered from an adverse event (AE); changed treatment; or died. A published network meta-analysis (NMA) was used for indirect comparison. The possibility of a therapy switch was considered. Clinical input data and resource utilization data were derived from the literature. Costs were extracted from price lists published in Austria and were calculated from the payer''s perspective. RESULTS: In treatment naive patients, alemtuzumab is associated with costs of euro132,663 and 5.25 QALYs in a 10-year time horizon. Costs for SC interferon beta amount to euro164,159 and generate 4.85 QALYs. Also, in the pre-treated patients, alemtuzumab dominated comparators by accumulating higher total QALYs (4.88) and lower total costs (euro137.409) compared to interferon beta-1a (euro200.133), fingolimod (euro240.903), and natalizumab (euro247.758).

20527,Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Once-Daily Liraglutide for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: A Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Estonia,"INTRODUCTION: Once-weekly semaglutide is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that was associated with greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) versus once-daily GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in a recent network meta-analysis (NMA). The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus liraglutide 1.2 mg in Estonia. METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.0), with baseline cohort characteristics sourced from SUSTAIN 3 and changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and BMI associated with once-weekly semaglutide and liraglutide derived from the NMA. Patients were assumed to receive once-weekly semaglutide or liraglutide for 5 years before intensifying to basal insulin. Treatment effects were applied for the first 5 years, after which HbA1c increased to 7.0%, SBP followed a natural progression, and BMI reverted to baseline for the remainder of the analysis. Costs were expressed in euros (EUR) and estimated from a healthcare payer perspective. Utilities associated with diabetes and diabetes-related complications were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.13 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus liraglutide 1.2 mg. Direct costs were EUR 67 higher with once-weekly semaglutide, due to the increased acquisition cost, but this was mostly offset by cost savings due to avoidance of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was therefore associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 523 per QALY gained versus liraglutide 1.2 mg, which falls well below a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 52,390 per QALY gained (three times the Estonian GDP per capita). CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide was considered highly cost-effective versus liraglutide 1.2 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in Estonia. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk A/S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to compare 3 treatment strategies: (1) treat all patients with standard-of-care chemotherapy, (2) treat all patients with pembrolizumab, and (3) treat patients with PD-L1-positive tumors at a >/=1% expression threshold with pembrolizumab, and all others with standard-of-care chemotherapy. Additionally, we performed a budget impact analysis based on the projected number of urothelial carcinoma patients eligible for second-line pembrolizumab treatment. RESULTS: Treating all patients with chemotherapy resulted in a mean cost of $17,232 and mean effect of 0.43 quality-adjusted life-years. The PD-L1 test strategy was the most efficient strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $122,933/quality-adjusted life-year. Treating all patients with pembrolizumab resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $197,383/quality-adjusted life-year compared to the PD-L1 test strategy. The PD-L1 test strategy would produce an incremental budget impact of $14.9 million in the first year of use compared to chemotherapy, increasing to $16.5 million in the fifth year of use. Treating all patients with pembrolizumab would produce an incremental budget impact of $19.6 million compared to the PD-L1 test strategy in its first year of use, increasing to $20.9 million by year 5. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab was not cost-effective in either strategy based on a $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year willingness-to-pay threshold.

20530,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin for treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in patients with worsening renal function,"BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is highly prevalent and increases the risks of cardiovascular events. In a recent subgroup analysis, treatment response was shown to vary for patients exhibiting worsening renal function (WRF) on-treatment. It is important to understand the cost-effectiveness of novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) use in this population. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted using a Markov model to determine whether NOAC rivaroxaban treatment is cost-effective relative to warfarin in NVAF patients with on-treatment WRF. Input parameters were sourced from clinical literature including a multicenter clinical trial and subgroup analysis. We studied elderly US male patients at increased risk for stroke (CHADS2 score>/=2) undergoing treatment for NVAF and exhibiting WRF. Main outcome measures included total healthcare costs in 2017 US dollars (societal perspective), total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental net monetary benefits (INMB) per-patient. RESULTS: The remaining lifetime use of rivaroxaban is associated with 5.69 QALYs at a cost of $66,075 per patient, while warfarin produced 5.22 QALYs with costs of $78,504 per patient. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $150,000 per QALY, incremental net monetary benefits (INMB) per patient are $83,590. In our population, treatment with warfarin was dominated by rivaroxaban in 99.4% of 10,000 simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban is likely a dominant treatment over warfarin in elderly US male NVAF patients exhibiting WRF, providing increased QALYs at a decreased overall cost.

DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a clinical trial. SETTING: Five obstetric departments in Denmark. POPULATION: Women with a pregestational body mass index (BMI) >/=30 kg/m(2) . METHOD: We used data from a randomised controlled trial of 876 obese women who underwent elective or emergency caesarean section and were subsequently treated with iNPWT (n = 432) or a standard dressing (n = 444). Costs were estimated using data from four Danish National Databases and analysed from a healthcare perspective with a time horizon of 3 months after birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness based on incremental cost per surgical site infection avoided and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The total healthcare costs per woman were euro5793.60 for iNPWT and euro5840.89 for standard dressings. Incisional NPWT was the dominant strategy because it was both less expensive and more effective; however, no statistically significant difference was found for costs or QALYs. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 92.8%.

20534,Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Manual Physical Therapy Versus Surgery for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Evidence From a Randomized Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) results in substantial societal costs and can be treated either by nonsurgical or surgical approaches. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in cost-effectiveness of manual physical therapy versus surgery in women with CTS. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 120 women with a clinical and an electromyographic diagnosis of CTS were randomized through concealed allocation to either manual physical therapy or surgery. Interventions consisted of 3 sessions of manual physical therapy, including desensitization maneuvers of the central nervous system, or decompression/release of the carpal tunnel. Societal costs and health-related quality of life (estimated by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions [EQ-5D] scale) over 1 year were used to generate incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ratios for each treatment. RESULTS: The analysis was possible for 118 patients (98%). Incremental quality-adjusted life years showed greater cost-effectiveness in favor of manual physical therapy (difference, 0.135; 95% confidence interval: 0.134, 0.136). Manual therapy was significantly less costly than surgery (mean difference in cost per patient, euro2576; P<.001). Patients in the surgical group received a greater number of other treatments and made more visits to medical doctors than those receiving manual physical therapy (P = .02). Absenteeism from paid work was significantly higher in the surgery group (P<.001). The major contributors to societal costs were the treatment protocol (surgery versus manual therapy mean difference, euro106 980) and absenteeism from paid work (surgery versus manual physical therapy mean difference, euro42 224). CONCLUSION: Manual physical therapy, including desensitization maneuvers of the central nervous system, has been found to be equally effective but less costly (ie, more cost-effective) than surgery for women with CTS. From a cost-benefit perspective, the proposed CTS manual physical therapy intervention can be considered. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and decision analyses, level 1b.

20535,aPCC vs. rFVIIa for the treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired haemophilia - a cost-effectiveness model,"BACKGROUND: Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. Bleeding AHA patients with high titre inhibitors can be treated with either activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). Given that both replacement therapies have inherent benefits and limitations, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed in this population to compare rFVIIa with aPCC. METHODS: In high-titered AHA patients with bleeding treated with either aPCC or rFVIIa, during a 5-day study period, a Markov model was developed such that these patients were transitioned into four different health states: (1) continuous bleeding, (2) thrombosis, (3) stop bleeding and (4) death, with states (2), (3) and (4) modelled as absorbing states. Model parameters, including probabilities, health utility index and costs, were gathered from the medical literature, except for the costs of aPCC and rFVIIa, which were obtained from our institutional data. RESULTS: During the 5-day period, the total treatment cost of rFVIIa was substantially more than the cost of aPCC ($13 635 vs. $1741). The average quality-adjusted life days (QALDs) gained for rFVIIa were slightly lower compared to aPCC (4.08 vs. 4.09). Overall, aPCC prevailed over rFVIIa. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the model across tested ranges of all input variables. CONCLUSION: In high-titered AHA patients with bleeding, aPCC is a cost-effective treatment option when compared to rFVIIa. Thus, aPCC may be considered in these patients, if available, and provided there is no clinical contraindication.",2019-01-28359,30499154,Vox Sang,Chong H Kim,2019,114 / 1,63-72,No,30499154,"Chong H Kim; Sierra C Simmons; Chau M Bui; Ning Jiang; Huy P Pham; aPCC vs. rFVIIa for the treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired haemophilia - a cost-effectiveness model, Vox Sang, 2019 Jan; 114(1):0042-9007; 63-72",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Recombinant activated factor VII vs. Activated prothrombin complex concentrate,Bleeding; Severe deficiency of factor VIII with the presence of a high inhibitor titre (>5 Bethesda units),Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Week,Not Stated,Not Stated,-440518518.52,United States,2017,-465123361.2
20536,Cost-utility analysis of levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa) in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease in patients in Scotland and Wales,"AIMS: To carry out a cost-utility analysis comparing the cost-effectiveness of levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) with standard of care (SOC) in patients with advanced Parkinson''s Disease (aPD) unsuitable for apomorphine or deep brain stimulation (DBS). LCIG is the only treatment option in this small, but clinically important, population. METHODS: A Markov model with 25 disease states based on disease stage and off-time status plus death. Patients enter the model with aPD spending >50% of their waking day in the off-state. Patients progress through the model in 6-monthly cycles for 20 years to approximate lifetime treatment and capture long-term costs and effects of therapy. Inputs are based on LCIG clinical trials for clinical outcomes and health state utilities, the literature for health state transitions and use UK-based input data wherever possible (drug costs, disease/adverse event management costs, discontinuation rates, mortality rates). LIMITATIONS: Data collection can be challenging in this small, elderly population with advanced disease, therefore some model inputs were estimated, rather than collected directly. It was assumed that a reduction in off-time was the only benefit after the first year of treatment with LCIG; this is a conservative approach, since there may be additional clinical benefits. RESULTS: There is a considerable incremental gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients treated with LCIG of 1.26 QALY with an associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound52,110. If the impact on caregivers is included, the ICER reduces to pound47,266. CONCLUSIONS: In cases where there is an orphan population, with no alternative treatment options, HTA assessments have a broader decision-making framework and the ICER is interpreted in this context. In the setting of a very small population, with considerable unmet need, LCIG represents value for money, as reflected by funding approval across the UK.",2019-01-28393,30484353,J Med Econ,Svetlana Kalabina,2019,22 / 3,215-225,Yes,30484353,"Svetlana Kalabina; Jonathan Belsey; Dominic Pivonka; Biju Mohamed; Chris Thomas; Brian Paterson; Cost-utility analysis of levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa) in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease in patients in Scotland and Wales, J Med Econ, 2019 Mar; 22(3):1369-6998; 215-225",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Pharmaceutical",Levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel vs. Standard/Usual Care- Best available oral treatment with or without apomorphine,"Motor fluctuations, despite optimized therapy; unsuitable for apomorphine or deep brain stimulation",64 Years,64 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.50,3.50,52110,United Kingdom,2017,70923.01
20537,Cost-effectiveness of sorafenib versus best supportive care in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in Egypt,"BACKGROUND: In light of constrained budgets and the need to fund efficient treatment options, this study set out to assess the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib as a first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to best supportive care (BSC) from the military hospital perspective in Egypt. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model simulated disease progression with clinical parameters and utility values derived from published data. Data on direct medical costs were collected from the local healthcare system or payer. Costs and effects were discounted at 3.5% annually and reported in USD using purchasing power parity adjustments. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Mortality occurred less frequently in the sorafenib group (sorafenib group: 99.96%, BSC group: 99.99%). The total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the sorafenib cohort were estimated to be 46.24 compared with 42.27 for the BSC cohort, which resulted in an incremental gain of 3.96 QALYs. The total costs for the sorafenib and BSC cohorts were USD 4,229,940 and USD 3,092,886, respectively (incremental cost = $1,137,054), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 286,776 per QALY gained for the sorafenib cohort. One-way sensitivity analyses that addressed the uncertainty of the BSC estimates indicated that the progression-free survival for BSC and utility value of progression had the greatest effects on the results. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that sorafenib does offer increased survival and quality-of-life at an increased cost but at an ICER that exceeds the nationally accepted cost-effectiveness threshold. The findings support healthcare decision-making of the efficient allocation of healthcare system resources to improve the health of the Egyptian population.

20538,The cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy versus standard tubal ligation at the time of cesarean delivery for ovarian cancer risk reduction,"OBJECTIVES: Opportunistic salpingectomy is a cost-effective strategy recommended for ovarian cancer (OvCa) risk reduction at the time of gynecologic surgery in women who have completed childbearing. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy compared to standard tubal ligation (TL) during cesarean delivery. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using decision modeling to compare opportunistic salpingectomy to TL at the time of cesarean using probabilities of procedure completion derived from a trial. Probability and cost inputs were derived from local data and the literature. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2017U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000/QALY. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed for all variables. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis determined the proportion of simulations in which each strategy would be cost-effective. RESULTS: Opportunistic salpingectomy was cost-effective compared to TL with an ICER of $26,616 per QALY. In 10,000 women desiring sterilization with cesarean, opportunistic salpingectomy would result in 17 fewer OvCa diagnoses, 13 fewer OvCa deaths, and 25 fewer unintended pregnancies compared to TL - with an associated cost increase of $4.7 million. The model was sensitive only to OvCa risk reduction from salpingectomy and TL. Opportunistic salpingectomy was not cost-effective if its cost was >$3163.74 more than TL, if the risk-reduction of salpingectomy was <41%, or if the risk-reduction of TL was >46%. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis opportunistic salpingectomy was cost effective in 75% of simulations.

20539,Cost-effectiveness analysis of English memory assessment services 2 years after first consultation for patients with dementia,"OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to compare changes over 2 years in patients'' health-related quality of life (HRQL) with the health and social care costs of diagnosis and treatment of people newly referred to memory assessment services (MAS). METHODS: We analysed observational data from 1318 patients referred to 69 MAS who completed resource use and HRQL questionnaires at baseline 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. We reported mean differences in HRQL (disease-specific DEMQOL and generic EQ-5D-3 L), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and cost-effectiveness between baseline, and 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: Two years after referral to MAS, patients reported a higher DEMQOL score (mean gain 4.47, 95% confidence interval, 3.08-5.90) and EQ-5D-3 L (0.014, -0.011 to 0.039). Mean total costs and QALYs over 24 months was pound2411 ( pound1721- pound2873) and 0.027 (0.003-0.051), respectively. Assuming that patients'' HRQL would not have altered over the 2 years had they not attended MAS, these outcomes suggest an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound89 546 ( pound38 123- pound145 864) based on changes in EQ-5D-3 L. If we assumed that patients'' HRQL would have declined by about 10% over this period had they not attended MAS, the cost-effectiveness ratio would be pound25 056. The largest MAS (N = 32; 46%) with over 50 new patients a month were more likely to be cost-effective than smaller ones (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MAS are effective and can be cost-effective for diagnosing and treating people with suspected dementia.

SETTING: Two ophthalmology clinics in the Netherlands. DESIGN: Prospective cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: Resource-use data were collected over a 6-month postoperative period. Consecutive patients with bilateral age-related cataract and 1.25 diopters or more of corneal astigmatism were included in the economic evaluation. Patients were randomized to phacoemulsification with bilateral toric or monofocal IOL implantation. All relevant resources were included in the cost analysis. The base-case analysis was performed from a societal perspective based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 77 consecutive patients (33 toric IOL; 44 monofocal IOL). Societal costs were higher in the toric IOL group (euro3203 [$3864]) than in the monofocal IOL group (euro2796 [US$3373]). QALYs were slightly lower in the toric IOL group (0.30 versus 0.31; P = .75). Toric IOLs were therefore inferior to monofocal IOLs from a cost-effectiveness perspective. The cost-effectiveness probability ranged from 1% to 15%, assuming a ceiling ratio for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2500 to euro20 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, bilateral toric IOL implantation in cataract patients with corneal astigmatism was not cost-effective compared with monofocal IOL implantation.

20541,Cost-effectiveness analysis of hepatitis B vaccine booster in children born to HBsAg-positive mothers in rural China,"OBJECTIVE: In rural areas of China with highly endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, protective efficacy was observed in adulthood when a one-dose HBV vaccine booster was administered to high-risk children born to mothers who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an HBV vaccine booster in this specific group of children when given at 10 years of age. METHODS: Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was a one-dose booster given if the child was negative on HBsAg screening; strategy 2 was a one-dose booster given if the child was negative on both HBsAg plus anti-HBs screening. A decision tree combined with a Markov model was developed to simulate the booster intervention process and to simulate the natural history of HBV infection in a cohort of 10-year-old children who were born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The model was calibrated based on multiple selected outcomes. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) of the different strategies were compared in both base-case and one-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared to the current practice of ''no screening and no booster'', both strategy 1 and strategy 2 were cost-saving, with CERs estimated at US$ -6961 and US$ -6872 per QALY gained, respectively. In the one-way sensitivity analysis for strategy 1, all the CERs were found to be less than US$ -5000 per QALY gained after considering the uncertainty of all the variables, including vaccination protective efficacy, natural history, behavior, and various costs and utility weights. In a ''worst case'' scenario (all parameter values simultaneously being at the worst), the CER of strategy 1 increased to US$ 3263 per QALY gained, which was still less than the GDP per capita of China in 2016 (US$ 8126).

20543,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale versus medical management in patients with a cryptogenic stroke: from the UK payer perspective,"AIMS: Percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is known to lower the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a cryptogenic stroke. However, the economic implications of transcatheter PFO closure are less well known. From a UK payer perspective, a detailed economic appraisal of PFO closure was performed for prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a PFO who had experienced a cryptogenic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort model was constructed using a 5-year time-horizon with a patient mean age of 45.2 years, reflecting the characteristics reported in the REDUCE trial. Transition probabilities, clinical inputs, costs, and utility values were ascertained from published and national costing sources. Total costs, incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, utilizing a discount rate of 3.5%. A range of univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: When applying a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of pound20,000/QALY in accordance with NICE guidelines, PFO closure compared with antiplatelet therapy alone showed a beneficial cost/QALY of pound18,584, attained at 4 years. Applying discount rates of 0% and 6% had a negligible effect on the base-case model findings. PFO closure demonstrated a 76.9% probability of being cost-effective at a WTP threshold of pound20,000/QALY at a 5-year time-horizon. LIMITATIONS: This model focused specifically on UK stroke patients and typically enrolled young (mean age <65 years old) patients. Hence, caution should be taken when comparing data vs non-UK populations, and it remains unclear how older patients might have affected cost-effectiveness findings, as the risk of paradoxical embolism can persist as patients age.

In the absence of head-to-head trials, evaluations based on decision analytic modeling may be a suitable alternative to compare alemtuzumab and natalizumab in RRMS. PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alemtuzumab compared with natalizumab in RRMS in Iran, based on an indirect comparison of clinical trial data. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a cohort-based Markov model to analyze cost-utility in a cohort of 1,000 RRMS patients treated with alemtuzumab or natalizumab who had failed at least one previous DMT. Costs were measured in 2018 US Dollars, and were estimated from both the societal and National Healthcare Service (NHS) perspective over a 20-year time horizon in Iran. One-way deterministic sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the impact of individual variables on model results. RESULTS: Alemtuzumab dominated natalizumab in both NHS and societal perspective analyses. From the NHS perspective, the total discounted costs per patient were estimated at $147,417 and $150,579 for alemtuzumab and natalizumab, respectively, over 20 years. The discounted quality-adjusted life years were estimated to be 7.07 and 6.05, respectively. Results were similar for the societal perspective analysis. Results were most sensitive to acquisition costs and the time horizon, while no sensitivity was observed for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) health-states utility, relapse relative risk, adverse event or EDSS-related costs, and laboratory/monitoring costs. CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab was dominant in the treatment of RRMS compared with natalizumab due to lower total cost, greater efficacy and slowing of disease progression, and lower rate of relapses over a 20-year time horizon in Iran.

Patients undergoing ASCT were classified as refractory or relapsed based on timing of progression. Probabilities of progression/death with frontline therapy were based on parametric survival distributions fit to data on modified progression-free survival (mPFS) from ECHELON-1. Duration of frontline treatment and incidence of adverse events were from ECHELON-1. Utility values for patients in the frontline mPFS state were based on EQ-5D data from ECHELON-1. Other inputs were from published sources. A lifetime time horizon was used. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3%. Analyses were conducted alternately using data on mPFS for the overall and North American populations of ECHELON-1. RESULTS: The ICER for A + AVD vs ABVD was $172,074/QALY gained in the analysis using data on mPFS for the overall population and $69,442/QALY gained in the analysis using data on mPFS for the North American population of ECHELON-1. The ICER is sensitive to estimated costs of ASCT and frontline failure. CONCLUSION: The ICER for A + AVD vs ABVD based on ECHELON-1 is within the range of threshold values for cost-effectiveness in the US.

20548,Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide versus dulaglutide for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK,"AIMS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are appealing as glucose-lowering therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as they also reduce body weight and are associated with low rates of hypoglycaemia. This analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg (two once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists) from a UK healthcare payer perspective, based on the head-to-head SUSTAIN 7 trial, to inform healthcare decision making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Long-term outcomes were projected using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.0). Baseline cohort characteristics, changes in physiological parameters and adverse event rates were derived from the 40-week SUSTAIN 7 trial. Costs to a healthcare payer were assessed, and these captured pharmacy costs and costs of complications. Utilities were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg were associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 0.10 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Clinical benefits were achieved at reduced costs, with lifetime cost savings of GBP 35 with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and GBP 106 with the once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg, resulting from fewer diabetes-related complications due to better glycaemic control. Therefore, both doses of once-weekly semaglutide were considered dominant vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg (improving outcomes and reducing costs).

20550,Cost-Utility Analysis of Biologic and Biosynthetic Mesh in Ventral Hernia Repair: When Are They Worth It?,"BACKGROUND: Biologic and biosynthetic meshes typically cost more than synthetic meshes for use in ventral hernia repair (VHR), with unknown comparative effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis was performed from a limited societal perspective assessing direct medical costs and outcomes for open, elective, retromuscular VHR. Short-term and 5-year major complications and costs were modeled using best available evidence from published studies, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data, and Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative data. Costs were analyzed in 2017 US dollars, and utilities were assessed using quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine threshold probabilities of long-term complications favoring particular mesh types. RESULTS: Synthetic mesh was the preferred strategy, with a cost of $15,620 and QALYs of 18.85, assuming a baseline 5.6% rate of long-term complications for all meshes. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biosynthetic and biologic mesh became the better choice as long-term complication rates for synthetic mesh increased to 15.5% and 26.2%, respectively. Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biologic and biosynthetic meshes became favorable as the cost of biologic mesh decreased and long-term synthetic mesh complication rates increased. Biologic and biosynthetic meshes also became more cost-effective when their relative long-term complication rates decreased and long-term synthetic mesh complication rates increased. CONCLUSIONS: Using modeling techniques, synthetic mesh is the best option for retromuscular VHR given currently available evidence.

METHODS: A decision analytic model (semi-Markov) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in a biologic-naive population, over 60 years of time horizon (lifetime). The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI 50) response rate was used to assess treatment response at week 12. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic therapy were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (short-term and long-term changes in BASDAI and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI], withdrawal rates, adverse events, costs, resource use, utilities, and disutilities) were obtained from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and benefits were discounted with an annual discount rate of 1.5% for all treatments. RESULTS: In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab 150 mg dominated all comparators, as patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg achieved the highest QALYs (16.46) at the lowest cost (CAD 533,010) over a lifetime horizon vs comparators. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, results were most sensitive to changes in baseline BASFI non-responders, BASDAI 50 at 3 months and discount rates. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that secukinumab 150 mg demonstrated higher probability of achieving maximum net monetary benefit vs all comparators at various cost thresholds.

METHODS: A decision analytic model (semi-Markov) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in a biologic-naive population, over 60 years of time horizon (lifetime). The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI 50) response rate was used to assess treatment response at week 12. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic therapy were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (short-term and long-term changes in BASDAI and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI], withdrawal rates, adverse events, costs, resource use, utilities, and disutilities) were obtained from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and benefits were discounted with an annual discount rate of 1.5% for all treatments. RESULTS: In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab 150 mg dominated all comparators, as patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg achieved the highest QALYs (16.46) at the lowest cost (CAD 533,010) over a lifetime horizon vs comparators. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, results were most sensitive to changes in baseline BASFI non-responders, BASDAI 50 at 3 months and discount rates. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that secukinumab 150 mg demonstrated higher probability of achieving maximum net monetary benefit vs all comparators at various cost thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that secukinumab 150 mg is the most cost-effective treatment option for biologic-naive AS patients compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar for a lifetime horizon in Canada.

A decision analytic model was used to explore the effectiveness and cost burden of MSI-H/dMMR mCRC treatment. METHODS: The treatment of hypothetical patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC was simulated in 2 treatment scenarios: a third-line treatment and an exploratory first-line treatment. The treatments compared were nivolumab, ipilimumab and nivolumab, trifluridine and tipiracil (third-line treatment), and mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab (first-line treatment). Disease progression, drug toxicity, and survival rates were based on the CheckMate 142, study of TAS-102 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies (RECOURSE), and Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Southwest Oncology Group 80405 trials. The analyzed outcomes included survival (life-years), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Ipilimumab with nivolumab was the most effective strategy (10.69 life-years and 9.25 QALYs for the third line; 10.69 life-years and 9.44 QALYs for the first line) in comparison with nivolumab (8.21 life-years and 6.76 QALYs for the third line; 8.21 life-years and 7.00 QALYs for the first line), trifluridine and tipiracil (0.74 life-years and 0.07 QALYs), and mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab (2.72 life-years and 1.63 QALYs). However, neither checkpoint inhibitor therapy was cost-effective in comparison with trifluridine and tipiracil (nivolumab ICER, $153,000; ipilimumab and nivolumab ICER, $162,700) or mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab (nivolumab ICER, $150,700; ipilimumab and nivolumab ICER, $158,700). CONCLUSIONS: This modeling analysis found that both single and dual checkpoint blockade could be significantly more effective for MSI-H/dMMR mCRC than chemotherapy, but they were not cost-effective, largely because of drug costs.

20563,Ribociclib in hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer: Establishing a value-based cost in China,"BACKGROUND: The addition of ribociclib (RIB) to letrozole (LET) significantly increases progression free survival for patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC). We identified the range of drug costs for which RIB could be considered cost effective from a Chinese perspective. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to model the treatment sequences among patients with ABC. Life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) and lifetime costs were estimated. Costs were estimated for Chinese health care systems. Three times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of China 2016 ($24,360) and three times the per capita GDP of Beijing city 2016 ($53,384) were used as the willingness-to-pay threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, RIB + LET provided an incremental survival benefit of 0.631 LYs and 0.451 QALYs. When RIB costs less than $721 or $1170 per 4 weeks, there was a nearly 90% likelihood that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for RIB + LET would be less than $24,360 per QALY or $53,384 per QALY, respectively.

The cost-effectiveness of an increased access screening programme of PWID (increased screening using rapid antibody saliva tests and DBS tests [semi-quantitative viraemia and viral genotype]) was analysed through a decision tree screening model combined with the outputs of a Markov treatment model. Sensitivity and scenario analyses examined the uncertainty of results. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of CHF 100 000 (USD 105 000) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), the increased access screening programme was cost-effective compared to current screening, with a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 7 940 (USD 8337) per QALY. The net monetary benefit was CHF 959 802 668 (USD 1 007 792 801) for the PWID population and CHF 94 469 (USD 99 192) per person. The increased access screening programme had a 97.0% probability of being cost-effective compared to the current screening method at the WTP threshold of CHF 100 000 (USD 105 000). The results showed an increased access screening programme that uses tests which are better suited to the PWID population to be more cost-effective, due to the increased uptake that rapid antibody saliva and DBS tests generate.",2019-01-28710,30338887,J Viral Hepat,Francois Girardin,2019,26 / 2,236-245,No,30338887,"Francois Girardin; Natalie Hearmon; Francesco Negro; Lucy Eddowes; Philip Bruggmann; Erika Castro; Increasing hepatitis C virus screening in people who inject drugs in Switzerland using rapid antibody saliva and dried blood spot testing: A cost-effectiveness analysis, J Viral Hepat, 2019 Feb; 26(2):1352-0504; 236-245",QALY,Switzerland,Not Stated,Screening,Increased access screening program for Hepatitis C vs. Standard/Usual Care- Current screening (venepuncture),People who inject drugs,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7940,Switzerland,2016,8694.66
20568,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Adalimumab for the Treatment of Uveitis Associated with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,"PURPOSE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with methotrexate, compared with methotrexate alone, for the management of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis based on a clinical trial and decision analytic model. PARTICIPANTS: Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age with persistently active uveitis associated with JIA, despite optimized methotrexate treatment for at least 12 weeks. METHODS: The SYCAMORE (Randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness, SafetY and Cost effectiveness of Adalimumab in combination with MethOtRExate for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis) trial (identifier, ISRCTN10065623) of methotrexate (up to 25 mg weekly) with or without fortnightly administered adalimumab (20 or 40 mg, according to body weight) provided data on resource use (based on patient self-report and electronic records) and health utilities (from the Health Utilities Index questionnaire). Surgical event rates and long-term outcomes were based on data from a 10-year longitudinal cohort. A Markov model was used to extrapolate the effects of treatment based on visual impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical costs to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, utility of defined health states, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY. RESULTS: Adalimumab in combination with methotrexate resulted in additional costs of pound39 316, with a 0.30 QALY gain compared with methotrexate alone, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound129 025 per QALY gained. The probability of cost effectiveness at a threshold of pound30 000 per QALY was less than 1%. Based on a threshold analysis, a price reduction of 84% would be necessary for adalimumab to be cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is clinically effective in uveitis associated with JIA; however, its cost effectiveness is not demonstrated compared with methotrexate alone in the United Kingdom setting.",2019-01-28720,30336181,Ophthalmology,Dyfrig A Hughes,2019,126 / 3,415-424,No,30336181,"Dyfrig A Hughes; Giovanna Culeddu; Catrin O Plumpton; Eifiona Wood; Andrew D Dick; Ashley P Jones; Andrew McKay; Paula R Williamson; Sandrine Compeyrot Lacassagne; Ben Hardwick; Helen Hickey; Patricia Woo; Michael W Beresford; Athimalaipet V Ramanan; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Adalimumab for the Treatment of Uveitis Associated with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Ophthalmology, 2019 Mar; 126(3):0161-6420; 415-424",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Adalimumab in combination with methotrexate vs. Standard/Usual Care- Methotrexate monotherapy,Associated refractory uveitis,18 Years,2 Years,"Female, Male",Full,18 Months,3.50,3.50,129025,United Kingdom,2016,188598.32
20569,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects following homebirth and early discharge,"Pulse oximetry (PO) screening is used to screen newborns for critical congenital heart defects (CCHD). Analyses performed in hospital settings suggest that PO screening is cost-effective. We assessed the costs and cost-effectiveness of PO screening in the Dutch perinatal care setting, with home births and early postnatal discharge, compared to a situation without PO screening. Data from a prospective accuracy study with 23,959 infants in the Netherlands were combined with a time and motion study and supplemented data. Costs and effects of the situations with and without PO screening were compared for a cohort of 100,000 newborns. Mean screening time per newborn was 4.9 min per measurement and 3.8 min for informing parents. The additional costs of screening were in total euro14.71 per screened newborn (euro11.00 personnel, euro3.71 equipment costs). Total additional costs of screening and referral were euro1,670,000 per 100,000 infants. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro139,000 per additional newborn with CCHD detected with PO, when compared to a situation without PO screening. A willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000 per gained QALY for screening in the Netherlands makes the screening likely to be cost-effective.Conclusion: PO screening in the Dutch care setting is likely to be cost-effective. What is Known: * Pulse oximetry is increasingly implemented as a screening tool for critical congenital heart defects in newborns. * Previous studies suggest that the screening in cost-effective and in the USA a reduction in infant mortality from critical congenital heart defects was demonstrated. What is New: * This is the first cost-effectiveness analysis for pulse oximetry screening in a setting with screening after home births, with screening at two moments. * Costs of pulse oximetry screening in a setting with hospital and homebirth deliveries were euro14.71 and is likely to be cost-effective accordint to Dutch standards.",2019-01-28724,30334077,Eur J Pediatr,Ilona C Narayen,2019,178 / 1,97-103,No,30334077,"Ilona C Narayen; Arjan B Te Pas; Nico A Blom; M Elske van den Akker-van Marle; Cost-effectiveness analysis of pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects following homebirth and early discharge, Eur J Pediatr, 2019 Jan; 178(1):1432-1076; 97-103",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Screening,Pulse oximetry screening to detect critical congenital heart defects in newborns vs. Standard/Usual Care- Screening without pulse oximetry,Homebirth and early discharge newborns,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,139000,Euro,2017,165850.52
20570,Cost-effectiveness of liver transplantation in patients with colorectal metastases confined to the liver,"BACKGROUND: Patients with non-resectable colorectal metastases are currently treated with chemotherapy. However, liver transplantation can increase the 5-year survival rate from 9 to 56 per cent if the cancer is confined to the liver. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of liver transplantation for colorectal liver metastases. METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime perspective was developed to estimate the life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), direct healthcare costs and cost-effectiveness for patients with non-resectable colorectal liver metastases who received liver transplantation or chemotherapy alone. RESULTS: In non-selected cohorts, liver transplantation increased patients'' life expectancy by 3.12 life-years (2.47 QALYs), at an additional cost of euro209 143, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro67 140 per life-year (euro84 667 per QALY) gained. In selected cohorts (selection based on tumour diameter, time since primary cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen levels and response to chemotherapy), the effect of liver transplantation increased to 4.23 life-years (3.41 QALYs), at a higher additional cost (euro230 282), and the ICER decreased to euro54 467 per life-year (euro67 509 per QALY) gained. Given a willingness to pay of euro70 500, the likelihood of transplantation being cost-effective was 0.66 and 0.94 (0.23 and 0.67 QALYs) for non-selected and selected cohorts respectively.

20579,Septoplasty versus non-surgical management for nasal obstruction due to a deviated nasal septum in adults: A modelling study of cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to demonstrate how decision-analytic modelling can help to determine circumstances under which surgery may become cost-effective, using septoplasty as an example. DESIGN: We developed a decision-analytic model comparing septoplasty to non-surgical management for nasal obstruction in adults with a deviated septum. Based on the estimated cost difference between both treatments, we calculated the minimal (a) gain in quality-adjusted life-years, or (b) reduction in productivity losses needed for septoplasty to be cost-effective. Input was derived from literature and publicly available data sources. The time horizon of our model was one year, and the willingness-to-pay per quality-adjusted life-year was euro20 000, in accordance with current guidelines. RESULTS: The cost difference between septoplasty and non-surgical management for nasal obstruction due to a deviated nasal septum was euro2227 per patient from a healthcare perspective (including direct healthcare costs) and euro3288 per patient from an extended perspective (additionally including travel expenses and productivity losses due to poor health). In comparison with non-surgical management, septoplasty needed to gain 0.11 to 0.16 QALYs or save 13 sick days for nasal obstruction. The longer septoplasty''s effect lasts, the more time it will have to compensate its extra costs. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the known cost difference between treatments can be used as the starting point to determine beneficial effects needed for cost-effectiveness of surgical interventions.

20580,Septoplasty versus non-surgical management for nasal obstruction due to a deviated nasal septum in adults: A modelling study of cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to demonstrate how decision-analytic modelling can help to determine circumstances under which surgery may become cost-effective, using septoplasty as an example. DESIGN: We developed a decision-analytic model comparing septoplasty to non-surgical management for nasal obstruction in adults with a deviated septum. Based on the estimated cost difference between both treatments, we calculated the minimal (a) gain in quality-adjusted life-years, or (b) reduction in productivity losses needed for septoplasty to be cost-effective. Input was derived from literature and publicly available data sources. The time horizon of our model was one year, and the willingness-to-pay per quality-adjusted life-year was euro20 000, in accordance with current guidelines. RESULTS: The cost difference between septoplasty and non-surgical management for nasal obstruction due to a deviated nasal septum was euro2227 per patient from a healthcare perspective (including direct healthcare costs) and euro3288 per patient from an extended perspective (additionally including travel expenses and productivity losses due to poor health).

20581,Screening for Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Migrants With CKD: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: In countries with a low tuberculosis (TB) incidence, TB disproportionately affects populations born abroad. TB persists in these populations through reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. Those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for reactivation and may benefit from LTBI screening and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Health administrative data from British Columbia, Canada, were used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating LTBI screening in those diagnosed with stage 4 or 5 CKD not requiring dialysis (late-stage CKD) and those who began dialysis therapy. SETTING & POPULATION: Permanent residents establishing residency in British Columbia, Canada, between 1985 and 2012 who had late-stage CKD diagnosed or began dialysis therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Screening with the tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) compared to no LTBI screening at the time of late-stage CKD diagnosis and time of dialysis therapy initiation. Treatment for those who tested positive was isoniazid for 9 months. OUTCOMES: Costs (2016 Can $), TB cases, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QALYs gained was calculated. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Discrete event simulation model using a health care system perspective, 1.5% discount rate, and 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: Screening with IGRA was superior to the tuberculin skin test in all situations. Screening with IGRA was less expensive and resulted in better outcomes compared to no screening in those initiating dialysis therapy from countries with an elevated TB incidence. In individuals with late-stage CKD, screening with IGRA was only cost-effective in those 60 years or older (cost per QALY gained, <$48,000) from countries with an elevated TB incidence.
