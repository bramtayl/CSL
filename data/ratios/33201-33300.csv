33201,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of renal replacement therapy strategies in Guangzhou city, southern China","OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of three renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities as well as proposed changes of scheduled policies in RRT composition in Guangzhou city. METHODS: From a payer perspective, we designed Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analyses to compare the cost-effectiveness of three RRT modalities and four different scheduled policies to RRT modalities in Guangzhou over three time horizons (5, 10 and 15 years). The current situation (scenario 1: haemodialysis (HD), 73%; peritoneal dialysis (PD), 14%; kidney transplantation (TX), 13%) was compared with three different scenarios: an increased proportion of incident RRT patients on PD (scenario 2: HD, 47%; PD, 40%; TX, 13%); on TX (scenario 3: HD, 52%; PD, 14%; TX, 34%); on both PD and TX (Scenario 4: HD, 26%; PD, 40%; TX, 34%). RESULTS: Over 5-year time horizon, HD was dominated by PD. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$44 300, TX was cost-effective compared with PD with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$35?518 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The scenario 2 held a dominant position over the scenario 1, with a net saving of US$ 5.92?million and an additional gain of 6.24 QALYs. The scenarios 3 and 4 were cost-effective compared with scenario 1 at a WTP threshold of US$44?300. The above results were consistent across the three time horizons. CONCLUSIONS: TX is the most cost-effective RRT modality, followed in order by PD and HD. The strategy with an increased proportion of incident patients on PD and TX is cost-effective compared with the current practice pattern at the given WTP threshold.

33203,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy in Patients With Oligometastatic Cancer,"PURPOSE: The Stereotactic Ablative Radiation therapy for Comprehensive Treatment of Oligometastatic Tumors phase 2 randomized clinical trial found that stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) improved outcomes among cancer patients with oligometastatic disease. Yet, the cost of SABR along with the large number of patients with oligometastatic disease raises the important question of value. This study sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the addition of SABR compared with standard therapy alone among cancer patients with oligometastatic disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate treatment with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy or standard therapy among patients with oligometastatic cancers. The model derived transition probabilities from Stereotactic Ablative Radiation therapy for Comprehensive Treatment of Oligometastatic Tumors clinical trial data to estimate risks of toxicity, disease progression and survival. Health care costs and health utilities were estimated from the literature. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from both the health care sector and societal perspectives with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) defined as dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). An ICER less than $100,000/QALY was considered cost-effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to examine model uncertainty. RESULTS: The addition of SABR increased total costs by $54,260 (health care sector perspective) or $72,799 (societal perspective) and improved effectiveness by 1.88 QALYs compared with standard therapy, leading to an ICER of $28,906/QALY (health care sector perspective) or $38,783/QALY (societal perspective). The model was modestly sensitive to assumptions about tumor progression, although the model was not sensitive to assumptions about survival or cost of treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that SABR was the cost-effective treatment option 99.8% (health care sector perspective) or 98.7% (societal perspective) of the time.

33205,A Clinical Decision Analysis for Use of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Nonabsorbable Nasal Packing,"OBJECTIVE: Nonabsorbable nasal packing is often placed for the treatment of epistaxis or after sinonasal or skull base surgery. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a rare, potentially fatal occurrence. However, the risk of TSS must be balanced against the major risk of antibiotic use, specifically Clostridium difficile colitis (CDC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate in terms of cost-effectiveness whether antibiotics should be prescribed when nasal packing is placed. STUDY DESIGN: A clinical decision analysis was performed using a Markov model to evaluate whether antibiotics should be given. SETTING: Patients with nonabsorbable nasal packing placed. METHODS: Utility scores, probabilities, and costs were obtained from the literature. We assess the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic use when the risk of community-acquired CDC is balanced against the risk of TSS from nasal packing. Sensitivity analysis was performed for assumptions used in the model. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for antibiotic use was 334,493 US dollars (USD)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that not prescribing antibiotics was cost-effective in 98.0% of iterations at a willingness to pay of 50,000 USD/QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that when the risk of CDC from antibiotics was greater than 910/100,000 or when the incidence of TSS after nasal packing was less than 49/100,000 cases, the decision to withhold antibiotics was cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Routine antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of nasal packing is not cost-effective and should be reconsidered. Even if antibiotics are assumed to prevent TSS, the risk of complications from antibiotic use is of greater consequence.

33210,Secondary transfer of emergency stroke patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy by air in rural England: economic evaluation and considerations,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a time-sensitive emergency procedure for patients who had ischaemic stroke leading to improved health outcomes. Health systems need to ensure that MT is delivered to as many patients as quickly as possible. Using decision modelling, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of secondary transfer by helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) compared with ground emergency medical services (GEMS) of rural patients eligible for MT in England. METHODS: The model consisted of (1) a short-run decision tree with two branches, representing secondary transfer transportation strategies and (2) a long-run Markov model for a theoretical population of rural patients with a confirmed ischaemic stroke. Strategies were compared by lifetime costs: quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost per QALY gained and net monetary benefit. Sensitivity and scenario analyses explored uncertainty around parameter values. RESULTS: We used the base case of early-presenting (<6 hours to arterial puncture) patient aged 75 years who had stroke to compare HEMS and GEMS. This produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £28 027 when a 60 min reduction in travel time was assumed. Scenario analyses showed the importance of the reduction in travel time and futile transfers in lowering ICERs. For late presenting (>6 hours to arterial puncture), ground transportation is the dominant strategy. CONCLUSION: Our model indicates that using HEMS to transfer patients who had stroke eligible for MT from remote hospitals in England may be cost-effective when: travel time is reduced by at least 60 min compared with GEMS, and a £30?000/QALY threshold is used for decision-making. However, several other logistic considerations may impact on the use of air transportation.",2021-01-34702,33172878,Emerg Med J,Diarmuid Coughlan,2021,38 / 1,33-39,No,33172878,"Diarmuid Coughlan; Peter McMeekin; Darren Flynn; Gary A Ford; Hannah Lumley; David Burgess; Joyce Balami; Andrew Mawson; Dawn Craig; Stephen Rice; Phil White; Secondary transfer of emergency stroke patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy by air in rural England: economic evaluation and considerations, Emerg Med J, 2021 Jan; 38(1):1472-0213; 33-39",QALY,United Kingdom,Cerebrovascular diseases,Care Delivery,secondary transfer by helicopter emergency medical services vs. ground emergency medical services,"< 6 hours to arterial puncture, rural patients",92 Years,65 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Not Stated / None,3.50,3.50,28027,United Kingdom,2018,40413.58
33215,Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: the cost-effectiveness of delivering timely and adequate treatment in Germany,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a progressive, severe brain disorder, which mainly affects people above the age of 65 years. iNPH is characterized by the accumulation of excess cerebrospinal fluid in the brain''s ventricles. In most cases, iNPH patients can be effectively treated with shunt surgery, which involves placing a tube into the brain to drain the excess fluid. As part of the European Brain Council-led Value of Treatment project, this study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of delivering timely and adequate iNPH treatment in Germany. METHODS: The study identified treatment gaps that prevent iNPH patients from receiving adequate and timely treatment. The cost-effectiveness of delivering shunt surgery to iNPH-prevalent patients aged =65 years in Germany was calculated using decision-analytical modelling. The model compared two alternatives, current care (shunt surgery in 25% of iNPH cases) and target care (shunt surgery in 90% of iNPH cases), and looked at healthcare costs (diagnosis, shunt intervention and follow-up care) from the public health insurance perspective, as well as effectiveness outcomes in terms of lives saved and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Delivering timely and adequate iNPH treatment proved to be cost-effective. Cost per life saved varied between €27 921 at 5 years and €246 726 at 15 years. Cost-per-QALY estimates varied between €10 202 at 5 years and €35 128 at 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a treatable but often not-treated disease, resulting in unnecessary and avoidable disease burden for the healthcare system.

33218,Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C in Young Children Reduces Adverse Outcomes and Is Cost-Effective Compared with Deferring Treatment to Adulthood,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating young children with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) with new direct-acting antivirals. STUDY DESIGN: A state-transition model of chronic HCV was developed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing treatment at age 6 years vs delaying treatment until age 18 years. Model inputs were derived from recently conducted systematic reviews, published literature, and government statistics. Medical care costs were obtained from linked population level laboratory and administrative data (Ontario, Canada). Outcomes are expressed in expected quality-adjusted life-years and costs (CAD$). Analysis included a base-case to estimate the expected value and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of uncertainty of the model inputs. RESULTS: After 20 years, treating 10?000 children early would prevent 330 cases of cirrhosis, 18 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, and 48 liver-related deaths. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of early treatment compared to delayed treatment was approximately $12?690/quality-adjusted life-years gained and considered cost-effective. Model results were robust to variation in fibrosis progression rates, disease state-based costs, treatment costs, and utilities.

33220,The cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening using the Stockholm3 test,"OBJECTIVES: The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer found that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening reduced prostate cancer mortality, however the costs and harms from screening may outweigh any mortality reduction. Compared with screening using the PSA test alone, using the Stockholm3 Model (S3M) as a reflex test for PSA = 1 ng/mL has the same sensitivity for Gleason score = 7 cancers while the relative positive fractions for Gleason score 6 cancers and no cancer were 0.83 and 0.56, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of the S3M test has not previously been assessed. METHODS: We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis from a lifetime societal perspective. Using a microsimulation model, we simulated for: (i) no prostate cancer screening; (ii) screening using the PSA test; and (iii) screening using the S3M test as a reflex test for PSA values = 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL. Screening strategies included quadrennial re-testing for ages 55-69 years performed by a general practitioner. Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Comparing S3M with a reflex threshold of 2 ng/mL with screening using the PSA test, S3M had increased effectiveness, reduced lifetime biopsies by 30%, and increased societal costs by 0.4%. Relative to the PSA test, the S3M reflex thresholds of 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL had ICERs of 170,000, 60,000 and 6,000 EUR/QALY, respectively. The S3M test was more cost-effective at higher biopsy costs.

33223,The cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening using the Stockholm3 test,"OBJECTIVES: The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer found that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening reduced prostate cancer mortality, however the costs and harms from screening may outweigh any mortality reduction. Compared with screening using the PSA test alone, using the Stockholm3 Model (S3M) as a reflex test for PSA = 1 ng/mL has the same sensitivity for Gleason score = 7 cancers while the relative positive fractions for Gleason score 6 cancers and no cancer were 0.83 and 0.56, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of the S3M test has not previously been assessed. METHODS: We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis from a lifetime societal perspective. Using a microsimulation model, we simulated for: (i) no prostate cancer screening; (ii) screening using the PSA test; and (iii) screening using the S3M test as a reflex test for PSA values = 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL. Screening strategies included quadrennial re-testing for ages 55-69 years performed by a general practitioner. Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Comparing S3M with a reflex threshold of 2 ng/mL with screening using the PSA test, S3M had increased effectiveness, reduced lifetime biopsies by 30%, and increased societal costs by 0.4%. Relative to the PSA test, the S3M reflex thresholds of 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL had ICERs of 170,000, 60,000 and 6,000 EUR/QALY, respectively. The S3M test was more cost-effective at higher biopsy costs.

33224,Cost-Effectiveness of Routine Childhood Vaccination Against Seasonal Influenza in Germany,"OBJECTIVES: In Germany, routine influenza vaccination with quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) is recommended and reimbursed for individuals =60 years of age and individuals with underlying chronic conditions. The present study examines the cost-effectiveness of a possible extension of the recommendation to include strategies of childhood vaccination against seasonal influenza using QIV. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was used to examine the epidemiological impact of different childhood vaccination strategies. The outputs were used in a health economic decision tree to calculate the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a societal and a third-party payer (TPP) perspective. Strain-specific epidemiology, vaccine uptake, and vaccine efficacy data from the 10 non-pandemic seasons from 2003/2004 to 2013/2014 were used, and cost data were drawn mainly from a health insurance claims data analysis and supplemented by estimates from literature. Uncertainty is explored via scenario, deterministic, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Vaccinating 2- to 9-year-olds with QIV assuming a vaccine uptake of 40% is cost-saving with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.66 from a societal perspective and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €998/QALY from a TPP perspective. Lower and higher vaccine uptakes show marginal effects, while extending the target group to 2- to 17-year-olds further increases the health benefits while still being below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Assuming no vaccine-induced herd protection has a negative effect on the cost-effectiveness ratio, but childhood vaccination remains cost-effective.

33235,Cost-effectiveness of Empagliflozin Compared with Dapagliflozin for the Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Established Cardiovascular Disease in Greece,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for approximately 95% of all diabetes cases and is associated with a substantially elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is 2- to 4-times higher in patients with T2DM compared to those without. The aim of present study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of empagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of patients with T2DM and established CVD in Greece. METHODS: A published health economic model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes of T2DM patients receiving empagliflozin compared to those receiving dapagliflozin. Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for CV, renal, and adverse events over patients'' lifetimes. Hazard ratios for dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME trials'' data using an indirect treatment comparison. Following a public payer perspective, only direct medical costs related to drug acquisition, fatal/non-fatal diabetes-related complications and adverse events were considered (€2020). Model extrapolated outcomes included life years (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data. RESULTS: Over a patient''s lifetime, empagliflozin was associated with longer mean survival (17.23 LY with empagliflozin vs 16.07 LY with dapagliflozin) and reduced rate of CV mortality resulting in 0.48 more QALYs (9.27 vs 8.79), at additional costs of €462. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €965 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin''s cost-effective profile. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of empagliflozin being cost effective over dapagliflozin was 100%, at the defined threshold of €36,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin was estimated to be a highly cost-effective treatment option compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of T2DM patients with established CVD in Greece.",2021-01-34658,33687695,Clin Drug Investig,George Gourzoulidis,2021,/,,Yes,33687695,"George Gourzoulidis; Charalampos Tzanetakos; Ioannis Ioannidis; Vasilis Tsimihodimos; Viana Diogo; George Karpouzos; Giannis Papageorgiou; Georgia Kourlaba; Cost-effectiveness of Empagliflozin Compared with Dapagliflozin for the Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Established Cardiovascular Disease in Greece, Clin Drug Investig, 2021 Mar 5; ():1173-2563",QALY,Greece,"Diabetes mellitus, Other forms of heart disease",Pharmaceutical,empagliflozin vs. dapagliflozin,EMPA-REG OUTCOME clinical trial,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,965,Euro,2020,1154.01
33236,Cost-Effectiveness of Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring in People With a Family History of Coronary Disease,"BACKGROUND: The use of coronary artery calcium scoring (CAC) to guide primary prevention statin therapy in those with a family history of premature coronary artery disease (FHCAD) is inconsistently recommended in guidelines, and usually not reimbursed by insurance. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of CAC compared with traditional risk factor-based prediction alone in those with an FHCAD. METHODS: A microsimulation model was constructed in TreeAge Healthcare Pro using data from 1,083 participants in the CAUGHT-CAD (Coronary Artery Calcium Score: Use to Guide Management of HerediTary Coronary Artery Disease) trial. Outcomes assessed were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs): cost-effectiveness was assessed over a 15-year time horizon from the perspective of the US health care sector using real-world statin prescribing, accounting for the effect of knowledge of subclinical disease on adherence to guideline-directed therapies. Costs were assessed in 2020 USD, with discounting undertaken at 3%. RESULTS: Statins were indicated in 45% of the cohort using the CAC strategy and 27% using American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (2019) treatment strategies. Compared with applying a statin treatment threshold of 7.5%, the CAC strategy was more costly ($145) and more effective (0.0097 QALY) with an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of $15,014/QALY. CAC ICER was driven by CAC acquisition and statin prescription cost and improved with certain patient subgroups: male, age >60 years, and 10-year risk pooled cohort equation risk =7.5%.

33237,Cost-effectiveness of two screening strategies for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae as part of the PrEP programme in the Netherlands: a modelling study,"OBJECTIVES: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users are routinely tested four times a year (3?monthly) for asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections on three anatomical locations. Given the high costs of this testing to the PrEP programme, we assessed the impact of 3?monthly screening(current practice), compared with 6?monthly on the disease burden. We quantified the difference in impact of these two testing frequencies on the prevalence of CT and NG among all men who have sex with men (MSM) who are at risk of an STI, and explored the cost-effectiveness of 3-monthly screening compared with a baseline scenario of 6-monthly screening. METHODS: A dynamic infection model was developed to simulate the transmission of CT and NG among sexually active MSM (6500 MSM on PrEP and 29?531 MSM not on PrEP), and the impact of two different test frequencies over a 10-year period. The difference in number of averted infections was used to calculate incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) as well as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Compared with 6-monthly screening, 3-monthly screening of PrEP users for CT and NG cost an additional €46.8 million over a period of 10 years. Both screening frequencies would significantly reduce the prevalence of CT and NG, but 3-monthly screening would avert and extra ~18?250?CT and NG infections compared with 6-monthly screening, resulting in a gain of ~81 QALYs. The corresponding ICER was ~€430?000 per QALY gained, which exceeded the cost-effectiveness threshold of €20?000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Three-monthly screening for CT and NG among MSM on PrEP is not cost-effective compared with 6-monthly screening. The ICER becomes more favourable when a smaller fraction of all MSM at risk for an STI are screened. Reducing the screening frequency could be considered when the PrEP programme is established and the prevalence of CT and NG decline.",2021-01-34656,33431605,Sex Transm Infect,Francine van Wifferen,2021,/,,No,33431605,"Francine van Wifferen; Elske Hoornenborg; Maarten F Schim van der Loeff; Janneke Heijne; Albert Jan van Hoek; Cost-effectiveness of two screening strategies for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae as part of the PrEP programme in the Netherlands: a modelling study, Sex Transm Infect, 2021 Jan 11; ():1368-4973",QALY,Netherlands,"Other diseases caused by chlamydiae, Infections with a predominantly sexual mode of transmission",Screening,3-monthly screening for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea vs. 6-monthly screening for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea,"men who have sex with men, Dutch AMPrEP study, pre-exposure prophylaxis users or at risk of sexually transmitted infection",Not Stated,18 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,4.00,1.50,430000,Euro,2018,548322.81
33244,Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab versus Carboplatin-based Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment of PD-L1-positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma Ineligible for Cisplatin-based Therapy in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab has been approved in the United States (US) for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and with tumors expressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (Combined Positive Score = 10), or ineligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status. Long-term KEYNOTE-052 data continue to demonstrate pembrolizumab''s meaningful, durable, and well-tolerated antitumor activity. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine as first-line treatment for cisplatin-ineligible patients who have PD-L1-positive tumors from a US third-party healthcare payer''s perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model containing 3 health states (progression-free, progressed, and death) was developed. A simulated treatment comparison and a network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Overall survival, progression-free survival, time on treatment, adverse events, and utilities were modeled using the final analyses of the KEYNOTE-052 trial and 4 studies for carboplatin plus gemcitabine. Cost data were estimated using US standard sources and real-world data. Deterministic, probabilistic, and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Over 20 years, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 2.58 life-years, 2.01 quality-adjusted life-years, and additional costs of $158,561, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $78,925/quality-adjusted life-year compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine.

33245,Cost-Effectiveness of HRSA's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program?,"BACKGROUND: With an annual budget of more than $2 billion, the Health Resources and Services Administration''s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) is the third largest source of public funding for HIV care and treatment in the United States, yet little analysis has been done to quantify the long-term public health and economic impacts of the federal program. METHODS: Using an agent-based, stochastic model, we estimated health care costs and outcomes over a 50-year period in the presence of the RWHAP relative to those expected to prevail if the comprehensive and integrated system of medical and support services funded by the RWHAP were not available. We made a conservative assumption that, in the absence of the RWHAP, only uninsured clients would lose access to these medical and support services. RESULTS: The model predicts that the proportion of people with HIV who are virally suppressed would be 25.2 percentage points higher in the presence of the RWHAP (82.6 percent versus 57.4 percent without the RWHAP). The number of new HIV infections would be 18 percent (190,197) lower, the number of deaths among people with HIV would be 31 percent (267,886) lower, the number of quality-adjusted life years would be 2.7 percent (5.6 million) higher, and the cumulative health care costs would be 25 percent ($165 billion) higher in the presence of the RWHAP relative to the counterfactual. Based on these results, the RWHAP has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $29,573 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with the non-RWHAP scenario. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the probability of transmitting HIV via male-to-male sexual contact and the cost of antiretroviral medications have the largest effect on the cost-effectiveness of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The RWHAP would be considered very cost-effective when using standard guidelines of less than the per capita gross domestic product of the United States. The results suggest that the RWHAP plays a critical and cost-effective role in the United States'' public health response to the HIV epidemic.",2021-01-34643,33093330,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Ravi Goyal,2021,86 / 2,174-181,No,33093330,"Ravi Goyal; Dara Luca; Pamela W Klein; Eric Morris; Paul Mandsager; Stacy M Cohen; Cindy Hu; John Hotchkiss; Jessica Gao; Andrew Jones; West Addison; Margaret O'Brien-Strain; Laura W Cheever; Boyd Gilman; Cost-Effectiveness of HRSA's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program?, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2021 Feb 1; 86(2):1525-4135; 174-181",QALY,United States of America,Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Screening",Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program vs. services lost through Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program for uninsured population,"low income people with HIV, at non neglible risk of contracting or otherwise having HIV",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,29573,United States,2019,31344.32
33246,Cost-effectiveness of treatment of women aged 70 years and older with both osteopenia and microstructural deterioration,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment is usually withheld from women with osteopenia even though they are the source of over 70% of all women having fragility fractures. As microstructural deterioration increases fracture risk and zoledronate reduces it, we aimed to determine whether identifying and treating women with osteopenia and severe microstructural deterioration is cost-effective. We also compared the health economic outcomes of ''global'' versus ''targeted'' treatment using SFS of women aged =70 years with osteopenia. DESIGN: We assessed the cost-effectiveness from using a Markov model that simulated 10-year follow up of women with osteopenia. Decision analysis compared measurement of distal radial microstructure using high resolution peripheral computed tomography (at a cost of USD $210) to target women with severe microstructural deterioration for zoledronate treatment, compared to standard care defined as measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) with treatment recommended when femoral neck BMD T score is =-2.5 SD with or without a prevalent fracture. In the ''global'' treatment approach, high resolution peripheral quantitative tomography (HRpQCT) was not undertaken. SETTING: US healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 women aged =70 years with osteopenia and no previous fractures was studied. MEASURES: Fractures, deaths, years of life lived, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lived and costs. Data inputs were obtained from published sources. A 3% annual discount rate was applied to future health benefits and costs. RESULTS: Women in the standard care group incurred 327 fractures during 7341.0 years and 4914.2 QALYs lived. Women in the intervention group incurred 300 fractures (number needed to treat 37) during 7359.2 years and 4928.8 QALYs lived. Net costs were USD $4,862,669 and $4,952,004, respectively, equating to 18.1 years of life saved and 14.6 QALYs saved, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $4992 per year of life saved and $6135 per QALY saved. These ratios are well within the threshold considered to be cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses indicated the results were robust. Relative to standard of care, ''global'' and ''targeted'' treatment respectively resulted in 0.0364 vs. 0.0181 years of life (YoLS) saved per person, and 0.0292 and 0.0146 QALYs saved per person. The net costs per person for the respective approaches were $US 359 and $US 89. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $9864 per YoLS and $12,290 per QALY saved for the ''global'' approach and $4992 per YoLS and $6135 per QALY saved for the ''targeted'' approach. CONCLUSION: Identifying and treating women =70 years of age with osteopenia and microstructural deterioration with zoledronate cost-effectively reduces the morbidity and mortality imposed by fragility fractures. This ''targeted'' approach is more cost-effective than a ''global'' approach and incurs only 25% of total costs. IMPLICATION: Women with osteopenia with bone fragility due to microstructural deterioration should be identified and targeted for treatment. SUMMARY: Women with osteopenia have 70% of fractures. Treating those with microstructural deterioration conferred an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $4992/year of life saved and $6135 per QALY saved.",2021-01-34641,33039577,Bone,Danny Liew,2021,142 /,115682,No,33039577,"Danny Liew; R D Chapurlat; E Sornay-Rendu; Eric Lespessailles; Yu Peng; Ego Seeman; Cost-effectiveness of treatment of women aged 70 years and older with both osteopenia and microstructural deterioration, Bone, 2021 Jan; 142():8756-3282; 115682",QALY,French Republic,Disorders of bone density and structure,Pharmaceutical,high resolution peripheral quantitative tomography vs. do nothing,"bone mineral density T-score between −1 and −2.5 standard deviations, fracture free, OFELY clinical trial, QUALYOR clinical trial",85 Years,70 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,6135,United States,2020,6423.22
33247,A cost-effectiveness analysis of the prophylaxis versus on-demand regimens in severe hemophilia A patients under 12 years old in southern Iran,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of these two regimens in hemophilia A patients, under-12-years-old in southern Iran. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness study comparing prophylaxis versus on-demand was conducted on 34 hemophilia patients (24 and 10 patients were on the prophylaxis and on-demand regimens respectively) in 2017. The Markov model was used to estimate the economic and clinical outcomes. The costs were collected from the societal perspective, and the utility criterion was the ''quality adjusted life year (QALY)'' indicator. The required data were collected using a researcher-made cost checklist, the EQ5D standard questionnaire and Hemophilia Joint Health Score. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to determine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The means of costs, joint health score and QALY in the prophylaxis regimen were $478,963.1 purchasing power parity (PPP), 96.67, and 11.98 respectively, and in the on-demand regimen were $521,797.2 PPP, 93.46 and 10.99 respectively. The PSA confirmed the robustness of the model''s results. The results of the scatter plots and acceptability curves showed that the prophylaxis regimen in 97% of the simulations for the thresholds below $20950 PPP was more cost-effective than on-demand regimen. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis regimen showed the lower costs and higher effectiveness and utility in comparison with the on-demand regimen.

We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for Switzerland comparing these two options but also pembrolizumab to chemotherapy. METHODS: We constructed a 3-state Markov model with a time horizon of 10 years. Parametric functions were fitted to Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using 2-year follow-up data from the KN-024 and KN-189 registration trials. We included estimated costs for further treatment lines and costs for best supportive care. Costs were assessed from the Swiss healthcare payer perspective. We used published utility values. RESULTS: Combination therapy resulted in an expected gain of 0.17 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient and incremental costs of Swiss Francs (CHF) 81,085 as compared to pembrolizumab.

Projected outcomes included primary HIV transmissions, deaths and life-expectancy, lifetime HIV-related costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). Compared to SOC, AI would reduce HIV transmissions by 15% and deaths by 12% at 12 months. AI would improve discounted life expectancy/person by 8 months at an added lifetime cost/person of $5,300, resulting in an ICER of $7,900/QALY.

33252,Cost-effectiveness of different surgical treatment approaches for early breast cancer: a retrospective matched cohort study from China,"BACKGROUND: Both breast-conserving surgery and breast reconstruction surgery are less popular in China, although they can improve patients'' quality of life. The main reason comes from the economy. There is currently no economic evaluation of different surgical treatment options for early breast cancer. Our study aims to assess the economic impact and long-term cost-effectiveness of different surgical treatments for early breast cancer. The surgical approaches are including mastectomy (MAST), breast-conserving therapy (BCT), and mastectomy with reconstruction (MAST+RECON). METHODS: Based on demographic data, disease-related information and other treatments, we applied propensity score matching (PSM) to perform 1: 1 matching among patients who underwent these three types of surgery in the tertiary academic medical center from 2011 to 2017 to obtain a balanced sample of covariates between groups. A Markov model was established. Clinical data and cost data were obtained from the medical records. Health utility values were derived from clinical investigations. Strategies were compared using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: After PSM, there were 205 cases in each group. In the matched data set, the distribution of covariates was fully balanced. The total cost of MAST, MAST+RECON and BCT was $37,392.84, $70,556.03 and $82,330.97, respectively.

33253,Cost-effectiveness of different surgical treatment approaches for early breast cancer: a retrospective matched cohort study from China,"BACKGROUND: Both breast-conserving surgery and breast reconstruction surgery are less popular in China, although they can improve patients'' quality of life. The main reason comes from the economy. There is currently no economic evaluation of different surgical treatment options for early breast cancer. Our study aims to assess the economic impact and long-term cost-effectiveness of different surgical treatments for early breast cancer. The surgical approaches are including mastectomy (MAST), breast-conserving therapy (BCT), and mastectomy with reconstruction (MAST+RECON). METHODS: Based on demographic data, disease-related information and other treatments, we applied propensity score matching (PSM) to perform 1: 1 matching among patients who underwent these three types of surgery in the tertiary academic medical center from 2011 to 2017 to obtain a balanced sample of covariates between groups. A Markov model was established. Clinical data and cost data were obtained from the medical records. Health utility values were derived from clinical investigations. Strategies were compared using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: After PSM, there were 205 cases in each group. In the matched data set, the distribution of covariates was fully balanced. The total cost of MAST, MAST+RECON and BCT was $37,392.84, $70,556.03 and $82,330.97, respectively. The quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) were 17.11, 18.40 and 20.20, respectively. Compared with MAST, MAST+RECON and BCT have an ICER of $25,707.90/QALY and $14,543.08/QALY, respectively.

METHODS: Survey data from the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination were used to generate a national representative sample of individuals with diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the United States. Individuals with A1c <6.5% on antidiabetic medications are recommended to deintensify their A1c level to 7.0% to 8.0% (group 1); individuals with A1c 6.5% to 8.0% and a life expectancy of <10 years are recommended to deintensify their A1c level >8.0% (group 2); and individuals with A1c >8.0% and a life expectancy of >10 years are recommended to intensify their A1c level to 7.0% to 8.0% (group 3). We used a Markov-based simulation model to evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of following the ACP recommended A1c level. RESULTS: 14.41 million (58.1%) persons with diagnosed type 2 diabetes would be affected by the new guidance statements.

33257,"Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line Versus Second-Line Use of Daratumumab in Older, Transplant-Ineligible Patients With Multiple Myeloma","PURPOSE: The MAIA trial found that addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) significantly prolonged progression-free survival in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd). However, daratumumab is a costly treatment and is administered indefinitely until disease progression. Therefore, it is unclear whether it is cost-effective to use daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with reserving its use until later lines of therapy. METHODS: We created a Markov model to compare healthcare costs and clinical outcomes of transplant-ineligible patients treated with daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with a strategy of reserving daratumumab until the second-line. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for first-line daratumumab versus second-line daratumumab from a US payer perspective. RESULTS: First-line daratumumab was associated with an improvement of 0.52 QALYs and 0.66 discounted life-years compared with second-line daratumumab. While both treatment strategies were associated with considerable lifetime expenditures ($1,434,937 v $1,112,101 in US dollars), an incremental cost of $322,836 for first-line daratumumab led to an ICER of $618,018 per QALY. The cost of daratumumab would need to be decreased by 67% for first-line daratumumab to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Using daratumumab in the first-line setting for transplant-ineligible patients may not be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying daratumumab until subsequent lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit healthcare costs without significantly compromising clinical outcomes.

33258,A comparison of mixture cure fraction models to traditional parametric survival models in estimation of the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab for relapsed small cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: In August 2018, the US FDA granted accelerated approval for nivolumab in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other line of therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs. usual care as third-line (3?L) therapy for patients with recurrent SCLC (rSCLC) from the health payer perspective. Given the potential for a meaningful fraction of treated patients to achieve long-term response to nivolumab, we also assessed the impact of using mixture cure modeling (MCM) vs. parametric survival modeling on survival estimates and cost-effectiveness from the US Medicare payer perspective. METHODS: We created a partitioned survival decision model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 3?L nivolumab vs. usual care in rSCLC, based on observed US treatment patterns. Using this approach, we assessed the impact of extrapolating long-term survival from the CheckMate 032 trial, using both MCM and standard parametric curve fits. Nivolumab survival, resource use, and Grade 3/4 adverse event rates were derived from CheckMate 032. Usual care survival, resource use, and costs were derived from an analysis of patients receiving 3?L treatment for rSCLC in the SEER-Medicare registry. We applied 2020 Wholesale Acquisition Cost for drugs and 2020 CMS reimbursement for procedures. Utilities were derived from the literature. We estimated life years (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: MCM and parametric survival model extrapolations resulted in 0.43 versus 0.38 more LYs, 0.34 versus 0.30 more QALYs, and $69,308 versus $61,336 more expenditure for nivolumab vs. usual care, respectively.

33261,Behavioral Smoking Cessation Counseling During Pregnancy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost effectiveness of using behavioral smoking cessation counseling during pregnancy. METHODS: We designed a decision-analytic model using TreeAge Pro 2020 software to compare the cost effectiveness and outcomes among women who received behavioral smoking cessation counseling compared with women who received usual care during pregnancy. We used a theoretical cohort of 285,000 women, the approximate number of pregnant women who smoke each year in the United States. Outcomes included maternal abstinence from smoking, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, preterm delivery, neonatal death, and cerebral palsy, in addition to cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for both the woman and the neonate. All model inputs were derived from the literature, and a willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of baseline assumptions. RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort, behavioral smoking cessation counseling compared with usual care was associated with 9,019 additional women stopping smoking during pregnancy (34,604 vs 25,585). Smoking cessation counseling also resulted in 911 fewer cases of fetal growth restriction, 20 fewer stillbirths, 250 fewer preterm deliveries, 11 fewer neonatal deaths, and one less case of cerebral palsy. Using behavioral smoking cessation counseling interventions during pregnancy led to better outcomes despite higher costs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $71,658 per QALY, which was below our willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY, making the intervention cost effective. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the counseling intervention was cost effective at probabilities of smoking cessation greater than 11.6% (baseline input: 12.1%) or the cost of the behavioral intervention was less than $475.21 (baseline input: $368.78). CONCLUSION: Behavioral smoking cessation counseling during pregnancy was associated with fewer adverse neonatal outcomes and was cost effective. Increasing utilization of such interventions and increasing insurance coverage of this care are important initiatives to improve outcomes in this at-risk population.",2021-01-34603,33706341,Obstet Gynecol,Hannah L Bacheller,2021,/,,No,33706341,"Hannah L Bacheller; Alyssa R Hersh; Aaron B Caughey; Behavioral Smoking Cessation Counseling During Pregnancy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Obstet Gynecol, 2021 Mar 10; ():0029-7844",QALY,United States of America,Mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use,Health Education or Behavior,"behavioral smoking cessation counseling vs. usual care: information on smoking risks inpregnancy, recommendation to quit",pregnancy,Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,71658,United States,2020,75024.51
33262,Nationwide cost-effectiveness analysis of surgical stabilization of rib fractures by flail chest status and age groups,"BACKGROUND: Surgical stabilization of rib fracture (SSRF) is increasingly used to manage patients with rib fractures. Benefits of performing SSRF appear variable, and the procedure is costly, necessitating cost-effectiveness analysis for distinct subgroups. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SSRF versus nonoperative management among patients with rib fractures younger than 65 years versus 65 years or older, with versus without flail chest. We hypothesized that, compared with nonoperative management, SSRF is cost-effective only for patients with flail chest. METHODS: This economic evaluation used a decision-analytic Markov model with a lifetime time horizon incorporating US population-representative inputs to simulate benefits and risks of SSRF compared with nonoperative management. We report quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses accounted for most plausible clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Compared with nonoperative management, SSRF was cost-effective for patients with flail chest at willingness-to-pay threshold of US $150,000/QALY gained. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture costs US $25,338 and US $123,377/QALY gained for those with flail chest younger than 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture was not cost-effective for patients without flail chest, costing US $172,704 and US $243,758/QALY gained for those younger than 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that, under most plausible scenarios, SSRF remained cost-effective for subgroups with flail chest, and nonoperative management remained cost-effective for patients older than 65 years without flail chest. Probability that SSRF is cost-effective ranged from 98% among patients younger than 65 years with flail chest to 35% among patients 65 years or older without flail chest.

Benefits of performing SSRF appear variable, and the procedure is costly, necessitating cost-effectiveness analysis for distinct subgroups. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SSRF versus nonoperative management among patients with rib fractures younger than 65 years versus 65 years or older, with versus without flail chest. We hypothesized that, compared with nonoperative management, SSRF is cost-effective only for patients with flail chest. METHODS: This economic evaluation used a decision-analytic Markov model with a lifetime time horizon incorporating US population-representative inputs to simulate benefits and risks of SSRF compared with nonoperative management. We report quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses accounted for most plausible clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Compared with nonoperative management, SSRF was cost-effective for patients with flail chest at willingness-to-pay threshold of US $150,000/QALY gained. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture costs US $25,338 and US $123,377/QALY gained for those with flail chest younger than 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture was not cost-effective for patients without flail chest, costing US $172,704 and US $243,758/QALY gained for those younger than 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that, under most plausible scenarios, SSRF remained cost-effective for subgroups with flail chest, and nonoperative management remained cost-effective for patients older than 65 years without flail chest. Probability that SSRF is cost-effective ranged from 98% among patients younger than 65 years with flail chest to 35% among patients 65 years or older without flail chest.

33266,Vocational Rehabilitation for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain With or Without a Work Module: An Economic Evaluation,"Purpose Vocational rehabilitation (VR) is a widely used intervention aimed to optimize work participation for patients on sick leave due to chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). Economic evaluations of care as usual VR are scarce, and may provide relevant information to guide clinical, reimbursement and policy decisions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) of VR for patients on sick leave due to CMP with an additional work module (VR+) compared to VR without work module, from a societal and employers'' perspective. Methods A retrospective longitudinal cohort study within a Dutch care as usual context was applied. Participants with CMP and decreased work participation originating from seven Dutch rehabilitation centers were included in this study. Participants underwent VR or VR+. Main data sources at baseline and discharge: Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) based on EQ-5D, intervention costs, self-reported productivity and health care utilization. Main analyses cost-effectiveness, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC); and ROI analyses with use of the human capital method. Results N?=?324 participants were analyzed. The results show that VR+ was cost-effective compared to VR: mean cost savings of €820 per 0.012 QALY gained. CEAC suggests probability of VR+ being cost-effective is?>?0.91 for thresholds of €20.000 and higher. The mean ROI of VR+?for employers was 38%. Conclusion It was concluded that at discharge, VR+?was cost-effective compared to VR.

33267,The cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in treating high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: An economic evaluation using data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial,"AIM: To undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis of dapagliflozin in treating high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using both directly observed events in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and surrogate risk factors to predict endpoints not captured within the trial. METHODS: An established T2DM model was adapted to integrate survival curves derived from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, and extrapolated over a lifetime for all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, and end-stage kidney disease. The economic analysis considered the overall DECLARE trial population, as well as reported patient subgroups. Total and incremental costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years associated with dapagliflozin versus placebo were estimated from the perspective of the UK healthcare payer. RESULTS: In the UK setting, treatment with dapagliflozin compared to placebo was estimated to be dominant, with an expected increase in quality-adjusted life-years from 10.43 to 10.48 (+0.06) and a reduction in lifetime total costs from £39?451 to £36?899 (-£2552). Across all patient subgroups, dapagliflozin was estimated to be dominant, with the greatest absolute benefit in the prior heart failure subgroup (incremental lifetime costs -£4150 and quality-adjusted life-years +0.11). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that dapagliflozin compared to placebo appears to be cost-effective, when considering evidence reported from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, at established UK willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings highlight the potential of dapagliflozin to have a meaningful impact in reducing the economic burden of T2DM and its associated complications across a broad T2DM population.",2021-01-34597,33368855,Diabetes Obes Metab,Phil McEwan,2021,23 / 4,1020-1029,No,33368855,"Phil McEwan; Angharad R Morgan; Rebecca Boyce; Klas Bergenheim; Ingrid A M Gause-Nilsson; Deepak L Bhatt; Lawrence A Leiter; Peter A Johansson; Ofri Mosenzon; Avivit Cahn; John P H Wilding; Justin Yeh; Achuta Kumar Guddati; The cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in treating high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: An economic evaluation using data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, Diabetes Obes Metab, 2021 Apr; 23(4):1462-8902; 1020-1029",QALY,United Kingdom,Diabetes mellitus,Pharmaceutical,dapagliflozin vs. placebo,"average age is 63.8 years, DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial patients",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,-51040,United Kingdom,2019,-69078.4

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cost benefit analysis study where quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and the expenditure involved post unilateral and bilateral CI were calculated to assess the cost per QALY gained. SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary-care hospital in a city of a developing country. PATIENTS: A total of 59 patients were studied during the years 2015 to 2019 of which a study cohort of 29 patients underwent bilateral cochlear implantation and a control cohort of 30 patients received U/L CI but did not undergo B/L CI. MAIN OUTCOME: The QALY parameters HUI3 and VAS when patient had no implant, post unilateral and bilateral CI were calculated along with the total lifelong expenditure involved. The outcomes improvement post CI was compared in the study and control groups. The discounted net cost per QALY gained was assessed and compared with the PCGDP of the country for cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Significant QALY was gained post unilateral and bilateral CI and the expenditure for both was within the cost thresholds.

33272,The challenge of value-based pricing in combination therapy: the case of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Under current reimbursement (CR) practice even though an add-on drug in a combination therapy may produce marginal value in terms of health gain, the original therapy may also share in the reward for this additional value. We examine an alternative ""marginal value-based reimbursement"" (MVBR) model in which an original therapy would not share in the marginal value. METHODS: In a case study for treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, we computed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel (PHT) vs. trastuzumab and docetaxel (HT) under the CR and the MVBR models, respectively. We further estimated the revised cost of pertuzumab under three alternative willingness-to-pay thresholds based on (a) using the current ICER of PHT vs. HT, (b) the historical ICER of HT vs. docetaxel, and (c) applying the oft-used $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: If reimbursement were changed from CR to MVBR, at the current price of pertuzumab, the ICER would decline from $409,213 to $323,236/QALY gained. If the price were adjusted under the three thresholds, the payment for pertuzumab would be increased by between 32% and 93%.

33274,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses for the prioritisation of the four available rotavirus vaccines in the national immunisation programme in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhoea in children less than five years old in Thailand. Vaccination has been shown to be an effective intervention to prevent rotavirus infections but has yet to be enlisted in the national immunisation programme. This study aimed to assess the cost-utility of introducing rotavirus vaccines, taking all WHO-prequalified vaccines into consideration. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a transmission dynamic model to estimate, from a societal perspective, the costs and outcomes of four WHO-prequalified rotavirus vaccines: Rotarix®, RotaTeq®, ROTAVAC® and ROTASIIL®. The model was used to simulate the impact of introducing the vaccines among children aged < 1 year and compare this with no rotavirus vaccination. The vaccination programme was considered to be cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than a threshold of USD 5,110 per QALY gained. RESULTS: Overall, without the vaccine, the model predicted the average annual incidence of rotavirus to be 312,118 cases. With rotavirus vaccination at a coverage of more than 95%, the average number of rotavirus cases averted was estimated to be 144,299 per year. All rotavirus vaccines were cost-saving. ROTASIIL® was the most cost-saving option, followed by ROTAVAC®, Rotarix® and RotaTeq®, providing average cost-savings of USD 32, 31, 23 and 22 million per year, respectively, with 999 QALYs gained. All vaccines remained cost-saving with lower QALYs gained, even when ignoring indirect beneficial effects. The net saving to the healthcare system when implementing any one of these vaccines would be between USD 13 and 33 million per year. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus vaccines should be included in the national vaccination programme in Thailand. Implementing any one of these four WHO-prequalified vaccines would reduce government healthcare spending while yielding health benefits to the population.",2021-01-34879,33531197,Vaccine,Nantasit Luangasanatip,2021,39 / 9,1402-1414,Yes,33531197,"Nantasit Luangasanatip; Wiriya Mahikul; Kittiyod Poovorawan; Ben S Cooper; Yoel Lubell; Lisa J White; Yot Teerawattananon; Wirichada Pan-Ngum; Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses for the prioritisation of the four available rotavirus vaccines in the national immunisation programme in Thailand, Vaccine, 2021 Mar 1; 39(9):1873-2518; 1402-1414",QALY,Thailand,Intestinal infectious diseases,Immunization,rotavirus vaccination for children < 1 year old vs. no rotavirus vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,0 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-32032.03,United States,2019,-33950.64
33275,Economic Evaluation of Senshio(®) (Ospemifene) for the Treatment of Vulvovaginal Atrophy in Scotland,"BACKGROUND: Local oestrogens, the current treatment for vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), are not suitable for all women. Standard of care (SoC) consists of over-the-counter lubricants and moisturisers. Senshio(®) (ospemifene) provides a treatment option for postmenopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy who would otherwise have an unmet clinical need. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ospemifene, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, for the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic VVA in postmenopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy. METHODS: The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) recently evaluated the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence of ospemifene plus SoC compared with SoC alone. A cost-effectiveness study, from a National Health Service (NHS) Scotland perspective over a lifetime time horizon, was submitted to the SMC. The cohort-based Markov model used robust clinical evidence from two large pivotal phase III randomised controlled studies and included four health states classified by dyspareunia symptom severity: none, mild, moderate and severe. The movement of women between health states was dependent on the effectiveness of treatment in reducing dyspareunia. Extensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the level of confidence associated with the base-case results. RESULTS: Treatment with ospemifene was associated with an additional cost of £847 per patient and an increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of 0.06 per patient. Ospemifene had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £14,138 per QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a probability of 89% that ospemifene was cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. Ospemifene remained cost-effective under all scenario analyses. The SMC reviewed the clinical and economic evidence and judged that the evidence demonstrated a robust case to support prescribing ospemifene in NHS Scotland. CONCLUSION: Ospemifene is a cost-effective intervention that has recently been accepted by the SMC for the treatment of postmenopausal women with moderate to severe VVA who are not candidates for local oestrogen.",2021-01-34850,32390072,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Amy Dymond,2021,19 / 1,123-132,Yes,32390072,"Amy Dymond; Hayden Holmes; Jessica McMaster; Joyce Craig; Heather Davies; Stuart Mealing; Rodolphe Perard; Economic Evaluation of Senshio(®) (Ospemifene) for the Treatment of Vulvovaginal Atrophy in Scotland, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2021 Jan; 19(1):1179-1896; 123-132",QALY,Scotland,Other disorders of the genitourinary system,Pharmaceutical,Ospemifene + non-hormonal over-the-counter lubricants and moisturizers vs. Non-hormonal over-the-counter lubricants and moisturizers,"post-menopausal, not candidates for local vaginal estrogen therapy",Not Stated,50 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, 10 Years",3.50,3.50,14138,Euro,2018,18028.34
33276,Living with severe multiple sclerosis: Cost-effectiveness of a palliative care intervention and cost of illness study,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the economic consequences of living with severe multiple sclerosis (SMS). AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a home-based palliative approach (HPA) for people with SMS (pwSMS). To assess direct healthcare costs in this population. METHODS: PwSMS from three Italian centers received (2:1 ratio) HPA or usual care over six months. Direct healthcare costs were collected on a monthly basis. Incremental cost-effectiveness was gauged from a national healthcare system (NHS) and a personal perspective, considering the Palliative Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS (POS-S-MS) and the EuroQol five-dimension descriptive system quality-adjusted life years (EQ-5D-3L QALYs), both completed at baseline, after three and six months. RESULTS: Of 78 randomized pwSMS, 76 (50 HPA, 26 usual care) were analyzed. Mean QALYs were close to zero, and the mean group difference was -0.006 (95% CI -0.057 to 0.044). The mean baseline-adjusted cost difference was € -394 (95% confidence interval, CI -3,532 to 2,743). POS-S-MS cost-effectiveness showed a slight mean reduction of symptom burden (-1.9; 95% CI -1.1 to 5.0) with unchanged costs. Mean direct costs due to MS were € 23,195/year, almost equally distributed between NHS (€ 13,108) and pwSMS (€ 10,087). Personal care, medications and home rehabilitation accounted for 80% of total expenditures. Most personal care costs were covered by pwSMS, and these costs were 3/4 of pwSMS out-of-pocket. CONCLUSIONS: The slight reduction of symptom burden produced by the HPA was not associated with an increase in costs. NHS and pwSMS almost equally sustained these costs.

33277,Cost-Effectiveness of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is non-inferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for treatment of low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). However, the cost-effectiveness of TAVI in this population is unknown. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of both balloon-expandable and self-expanding TAVI compared to SAVR in patients with severe AS at low operative risk. METHODS: We developed a Markov model comparing TAVI to SAVR over a lifetime horizon. Key data inputs were drawn from the Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valve (PARTNER) 3 trial for balloon-expandable TAVI and the Evolut Low-Risk trial for self-expanding TAVI. Costs were obtained from Australian sources. The perspective was that of the Australian health care system. RESULTS: Although procedural costs were higher for TAVI compared to SAVR, these were offset by a shorter length of hospitalisation and lower acute complication costs in the TAVI group. Over a lifetime horizon, balloon-expandable TAVI was associated with increased costs of A$702 compared to SAVR, and increased quality-adjusted survival by 0.20 years, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$3,521 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Self-expanding TAVI was associated with lower lifetime costs compared to SAVR, and increased quality-adjusted survival by 0.08 years, and was therefore economically dominant. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, balloon-expandable TAVI was cost-effective in 78% of iterations (at a cost-effectiveness threshold of A$50,000 per QALY gained) and self-expanding TAVI was cost-effective in 70% of iterations.

33279,Comparative benefit and cost-effectiveness of mailed-out faecal immunochemical tests vs collection at the general practitioner,"BACKGROUND: Participation in the colorectal cancer screening programme in France has been well below the 45% considered acceptable by European guidelines, potentially attributable to the need to collect the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) at the general practitioner. AIM: To estimate the potential benefits and costs of including the FIT in the invitation letter. METHODS: A well-established microsimulation model was used to simulate the French population 35 years and older in 2018. We estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, costs and cost-effectiveness of the current screening programme, and compared it to a variation of the programme where the FIT was mailed to participants and adherence was assumed to increase to 45%. We also estimated the threshold increase in participation needed to make this intervention cost-effective. RESULTS: Under the current programme, 53.8 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 25.2 CRC deaths per 1000 individuals are expected to occur over a lifetime. If sending out the FIT increases screening participation to 45%, this intervention would result in 6% fewer CRC deaths and 3% fewer CRC cases, resulting in an estimated cost-effectiveness ratio of €2149 per QALY gained. Sending out the FIT would only need to increase participation by 0.7% point for this intervention to be considered cost-effective.

The cost-effectiveness of this strategy is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routinely prescribing all patients 2 EAI devices versus a risk-stratified approach (2 EAIs prescribed only for patients with a risk factor). METHODS: Markov models compared universal versus risk-stratified approaches on the basis of either a previous medical history of anaphylaxis (PMH-ana) or anaphylaxis requiring multiple epinephrine doses (multi-epi). Cohorts of children with peanut allergy were evaluated over an 80-year time horizon from both US and UK societal and health care perspectives. Models assumed prescribing a second EAI provided a baseline 10-fold risk reduction versus anaphylaxis-related fatality and hospitalization. Cost-effectiveness threshold was $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: From a US perspective, universal prescription of 2 EAIs to all patients with peanut allergy was not cost-effective in the base case versus risk stratification by PMH-ana. Universal prescription of 2 EAIs was associated with an incremental cost of $10,696,036/QALY versus the PMH-ana strategy, and $17,514,558/QALY versus the multi-epi strategy.

33285,(18)F FDG PET/MRI with hepatocyte-specific contrast agent for M staging of rectal cancer: a primary economic evaluation,"PURPOSE: Rectal cancer is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in the world. Correct identification of the TNM state in primary staging of rectal cancer has critical implications on patient management. Initial evaluations revealed a high sensitivity and specificity for whole-body PET/MRI in the detection of metastases allowing for metastasis-directed therapy regimens. Nevertheless, its cost-effectiveness compared with that of standard-of-care imaging (SCI) using pelvic MRI + chest and abdominopelvic CT is yet to be investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of whole-body (18)F FDG PET/MRI as an alternative imaging method to standard diagnostic workup for initial staging of rectal cancer. METHODS: For estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs of diagnostic modalities, a decision model including whole-body (18)F FDG PET/MRI with a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent and pelvic MRI + chest and abdominopelvic CT was created based on Markov simulations. For obtaining model input parameters, review of recent literature was performed. Willingness to pay (WTP) was set to $100,000/QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis of diagnostic parameters and costs was applied, and probabilistic sensitivity was determined using Monte Carlo modeling. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the strategy whole-body (18)F FDG PET/MRI resulted in total costs of $52,186 whereas total costs of SCI were at $51,672. Whole-body (18)F FDG PET/MRI resulted in an expected effectiveness of 3.542 QALYs versus 3.535 QALYs for SCI. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $70,291 per QALY for PET/MRI. Thus, from an economic point of view, whole-body (18)F FDG PET/MRI was identified as an adequate diagnostic alternative to SCI with high robustness of results to variation of input parameters. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the analysis, use of whole-body (18)F FDG PET/MRI was identified as a feasible diagnostic strategy for initial staging of rectal cancer from a cost-effectiveness perspective.",2021-01-34698,33686457,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,Felix G Gassert,2021,/,,No,33686457,"Felix G Gassert; Johannes Rübenthaler; Clemens C Cyran; Johann S Rink; Vincent Schwarze; Johanna Luitjens; Florian T Gassert; Marcus R Makowski; Stefan O Schoenberg; Marius E Mayerhoefer; Dietmar Tamandl; Matthias F Froelich; (18)F FDG PET/MRI with hepatocyte-specific contrast agent for M staging of rectal cancer: a primary economic evaluation, Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging, 2021 Mar 9; ():1619-7089",QALY,United States of America,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Diagnostic,Whole-body PET/MRI vs. standard of care imagine using pelvic MRI + chest and abdominopelvic CT,rectal cancer diagnosed in colonoscopy,67 Years,67 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"5 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,70291,United States,2019,74501.2
33286,Cost-effectiveness analysis of using innovative therapies for the management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in Spain,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib in comparison to vedolizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) after failure or intolerance to conventional therapy (bio-naive) or first-line biologic treatment (bio-experienced), from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with eight-week cycles was developed including five health states: remission, response, active UC, remission after surgery, and death. Response and remission probabilities (for induction and maintenance periods) were obtained from a multinomial network meta-analysis. Drug acquisition - biosimilar prices included - (ex-factory price with mandatory deductions), administration, surgery, patient management, and adverse event management costs (€, year 2019) were considered. A 3% discount rate (cost/outcomes) was applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: Tofacitinib was dominant versus vedolizumab (both in bio-naive and bio-experienced patients) entailing total cost savings of €23,816 (bio-naïve) and €11,438 (bio-experienced). Differences in quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were smaller than 0.1 for both populations. PSA results showed that tofacitinib has a high probability of being cost-effective (bio-naïve: 82.5%; bio-experienced: 90.6%) versus vedolizumab.

HCV screening and treatment of pregnant HCV carriers could reduce the burden of disease and limit vertical transmission from mother to child. We assessed the impact of HCV screening and subsequent treatment with new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among pregnant women in the Netherlands. METHODS: An HCV natural history Markov transition state model was developed, to evaluate the public-health and economic impact of HCV screening and treatment. Besides all 179,000 pregnant women in the Netherlands (cohort 1), we modelled 3 further cohorts: all 79,000 first-time pregnant women (cohort 2), 33,000 pregnant migrant women (cohort 3) and 16,000 first-time pregnant migrant women (cohort 4). Each cohort was analyzed in various scenarios: i no intervention, i.e., the current practice, ii screen-and-treat, i.e., the most extensive approach involving treatment of all individuals found HCV-positive, and iii screen-and-treat/monitor, i.e., a strategy involving treatment of symptomatic (F1-F4) patients and follow-up of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers with subsequent treatment only at progression. RESULTS: For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (ii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €9,306 and €10,173 per QALY gained and 5 year budget impacts varying between €6,283,830 and €19,220,405.

For all cohorts, the ICERs (scenario iii versus ii) involved in delayed treatment of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers varied between €56,607 and €56,892, well above the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained and even above a threshold of €50,000 per QALY gained.

33300,"Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C virus screening, and subsequent monitoring or treatment among pregnant women in the Netherlands","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diagnosed chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among pregnant women in the Netherlands is 0.26%, yet many cases remain undiagnosed. HCV screening and treatment of pregnant HCV carriers could reduce the burden of disease and limit vertical transmission from mother to child. We assessed the impact of HCV screening and subsequent treatment with new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among pregnant women in the Netherlands. METHODS: An HCV natural history Markov transition state model was developed, to evaluate the public-health and economic impact of HCV screening and treatment. Besides all 179,000 pregnant women in the Netherlands (cohort 1), we modelled 3 further cohorts: all 79,000 first-time pregnant women (cohort 2), 33,000 pregnant migrant women (cohort 3) and 16,000 first-time pregnant migrant women (cohort 4). Each cohort was analyzed in various scenarios: i no intervention, i.e., the current practice, ii screen-and-treat, i.e., the most extensive approach involving treatment of all individuals found HCV-positive, and iii screen-and-treat/monitor, i.e., a strategy involving treatment of symptomatic (F1-F4) patients and follow-up of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers with subsequent treatment only at progression. RESULTS: For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (ii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €9,306 and €10,173 per QALY gained and 5 year budget impacts varying between €6,283,830 and €19,220,405. For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (iii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €1,739 and €2,749 per QALY gained and budget impacts varying between €1,468,670 and €5,607,556.
