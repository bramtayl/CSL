19601,Cost Effectiveness of Secukinumab for the Treatment of Active Ankylosing Spondylitis in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of secukinumab, a fully human interleukin-17A inhibitor, for adults in the UK with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have not responded adequately to previous treatment with conventional care (CC; biologic-naive population) or previous biologic therapy (biologic-experienced population). PERSPECTIVE AND SETTING: UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: The model was structured as a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Comparators were licensed tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (including available biosimilars) and CC in the biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations, respectively. Clinical parameters captured treatment response, short-term disease activity and patient functioning, as well as long-term structural disease progression. Utilities were derived from secukinumab trial data. List prices were used for all drugs. The cost year was 2017 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab dominated adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus other comparators were either below pound10,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or south-west ICERs that implied cost effectiveness of secukinumab. In biologic-experienced patients, the ICER for secukinumab versus CC was pound4927 per QALY gained. Treatment response rates, short-term treatment effects, long-term radiographic progression and biologic acquisition costs were key model drivers. Scenario analysis found results to be robust to changes in model structural assumptions. Probabilistic analysis identified greater uncertainty in results in the biologic-naive population. CONCLUSIONS: Even at list price, secukinumab appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients with active AS. Further research on long-term radiographic progression outcomes would be valuable for future cost-effectiveness analyses in AS.",2018-01-27127,29797186,Pharmacoeconomics,Paul Emery,2018,36 / 8,1015-1027,Yes,29797186,"Paul Emery; Marjolijn van Keep; Steve Beard; Chris Graham; LaStella Miles; Steffen Marc Jugl; Praveen Gunda; Anna Halliday; Helena Marzo-Ortega; Cost Effectiveness of Secukinumab for the Treatment of Active Ankylosing Spondylitis in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2018 Aug; 36(8):1179-2027; 1015-1027",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Secukinumab vs. Etanercept biosimilar,Biologic-naive patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.50,3.50,7524,United Kingdom,2017,10240.35

19606,Health economic evaluation of a serum-based blood test for brain tumour diagnosis: exploration of two clinical scenarios,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential costs and health benefits of a serum-based spectroscopic triage tool for brain tumours, which could be developed to reduce diagnostic delays in the current clinical pathway. DESIGN: A model-based health pre-trial economic assessment. Decision tree models were constructed based on simplified diagnostic pathways. Models were populated with parameters identified from rapid reviews of the literature and clinical expert opinion. SETTING: Explored as a test in both primary and secondary care (neuroimaging) in the UK health service, as well as application to the USA. PARTICIPANTS: Calculations based on an initial cohort of 10 000 patients. In primary care, it is estimated that the volume of tests would approach 75 000 per annum. The volume of tests in secondary care is estimated at 53 000 per annum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), which were employed to derive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Results indicate that using a blood-based spectroscopic test in both scenarios has the potential to be highly cost-effective in a health technology assessment agency decision-making process, as ICERs were well below standard threshold values of pound20 000- pound30 000 per QALY. This test may be cost-effective in both scenarios with test sensitivities and specificities as low as 80%; however, the price of the test would need to be lower (less than approximately pound40). CONCLUSION: Use of this test as triage tool in primary care has the potential to be both more effective and cost saving for the health service.

RESULTS: Results indicate that using a blood-based spectroscopic test in both scenarios has the potential to be highly cost-effective in a health technology assessment agency decision-making process, as ICERs were well below standard threshold values of pound20 000- pound30 000 per QALY. This test may be cost-effective in both scenarios with test sensitivities and specificities as low as 80%; however, the price of the test would need to be lower (less than approximately pound40).

19613,Health economic evaluation of a serum-based blood test for brain tumour diagnosis: exploration of two clinical scenarios,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential costs and health benefits of a serum-based spectroscopic triage tool for brain tumours, which could be developed to reduce diagnostic delays in the current clinical pathway. DESIGN: A model-based health pre-trial economic assessment. Decision tree models were constructed based on simplified diagnostic pathways. Models were populated with parameters identified from rapid reviews of the literature and clinical expert opinion. SETTING: Explored as a test in both primary and secondary care (neuroimaging) in the UK health service, as well as application to the USA. PARTICIPANTS: Calculations based on an initial cohort of 10 000 patients. In primary care, it is estimated that the volume of tests would approach 75 000 per annum. The volume of tests in secondary care is estimated at 53 000 per annum.

19614,Cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (EarlyCDT-Lung) as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules,"OBJECTIVE: Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5-60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)-Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-LungTM)-as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT-because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer-are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed-on average-at more advanced stages. RESULTS: Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8-30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%). With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 41%/93% (stage shift = 10.8%), although expected costs would be higher by $949,442 ($949 per person), life years would be higher by 53 (0.05 per person), resulting in a cost per life-year gained of $18,029 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $24,330. With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 28%/98% (stage shift = 7.4%), corresponding cost-effectiveness ratios would be $18,454 and $24,833. CONCLUSIONS: Under our base-case assumptions, and reasonable variations thereof, using AABT as an aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules who are estimated to be at intermediate risk of lung cancer and are scheduled for CT surveillance alone is likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.",2018-01-27143,29787590,PLoS One,John Edelsberg,2018,13 / 5,e0197826,No,29787590,"John Edelsberg; Derek Weycker; Mark Atwood; Geoffrey Hamilton-Fairley; James R Jett; Cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (EarlyCDT-Lung) as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules, PLoS One , 2018; 13(5):1932-6203; e0197826",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Diagnostic,Autoantibody Test with Sensitivity/Specificity at 41% and 93% vs. Standard/Usual Care- Computed Tomography,Incidentally detected pulmonary nodules (8-30mm); intermediate risk of lung cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,24330,United States,2016,26236.2

19616,Vasa previa screening strategies: decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis comparing four screening strategies for the antenatal diagnosis of vasa previa in singleton pregnancies. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed comparing vasa previa screening strategies. Published probabilities and costs were applied to four transvaginal screening scenarios that were carried out at the time of mid-trimester ultrasound: no screening, ultrasound-indicated screening, screening only pregnancies conceived by in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and universal screening. Ultrasound-indicated screening was defined as performing transvaginal ultrasound at the time of the routine anatomy ultrasound scan in response to one of the following sonographic findings associated with an increased risk of vasa previa: low-lying placenta, marginal or velamentous cord insertion or bilobed or succenturiate lobed placenta. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in US$. The analysis was performed from a healthcare system perspective with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY selected. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analysis (Monte-Carlo simulation) was performed. RESULTS: This decision-analytic model demonstrated that screening pregnancies conceived by IVF was the most cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $29186.50/QALY. Ultrasound-indicated screening was the second most cost-effective, with an ICER of $56096.77/QALY. These data were robust to all one-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses performed. CONCLUSIONS: Within the baseline assumptions, transvaginal ultrasound screening for vasa previa appears to be most cost-effective when performed among IVF pregnancies. However, both IVF and ultrasound-indicated screening strategies fall within contemporary willingness-to-pay thresholds, suggesting that both strategies may be appropriate to apply in clinical practice.

19619,Short-term Resource Utilization and Cost-Effectiveness of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Acute Hospital Care for Severely Frail Elderly Patients,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the 3-month within-trial cost-effectiveness of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in acute medical care for frail elderly patients compared to usual medical care, by estimating health-related quality of life and costs from a societal perspective. DESIGN: Clinical, prospective, controlled, 1-center intervention trial with 2 parallel groups. INTERVENTION: Structured, systematic interdisciplinary CGA-based care in an acute elderly care unit. If the patient fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and there was a bed available at the CGA unit, the patient was included in the intervention group. If no bed was available at the CGA unit, the patient was included in the control group and admitted to a conventional acute medical care unit. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A large county hospital in western Sweden. The trial included 408 frail elderly patients, 75 years or older, in need of acute in-hospital treatment. The patients were allocated to the intervention group (n = 206) or control group (n = 202). Mean age of the patients was 85.7 years, and 56% were female. MEASURES: The primary outcome was the adjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with the intervention compared to the control at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: We undertook cost-effectiveness analysis, adjusted by regression analyses, including hospital, primary, and municipal care costs and effects. The difference in the mean adjusted quality-adjusted life years gained between groups at 3 months was 0.0252 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0082-0.0422]. The incremental cost, that is, the difference between the groups, was -3226 US dollars (95% CI: -6167 to -285).

Although gastric cancer screening is recommended in some regions of high prevalence, screening is not routinely performed in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether selected non-cardia gastric cancer screening for high-risk races and ethnicities within the United States is cost effective. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic Markov model with the base case of a 50-year-old person of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or Asian race or ethnicity. The cost effectiveness of a no-screening strategy (current standard) for non-cardia gastric cancer was compared with that of 2 endoscopic screening modalities initiated at the time of screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer: upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy examinations and continued surveillance only if intestinal metaplasia or more severe pathology is identified or esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy examinations continued every 2 years even in the absence of identified pathology. We used prevalence rates, transition probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from publications and public data sources.

19628,Cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare workers in middle-income hospital settings: a model-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: Multi-modal interventions are effective in increasing hand hygiene (HH) compliance among healthcare workers, but it is not known whether such interventions are cost-effective outside high-income countries. AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of multi-modal hospital interventions to improve HH compliance in a middle-income country. METHODS: Using a conservative approach, a model was developed to determine whether reductions in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA-BSIs) alone would make HH interventions cost-effective in intensive care units (ICUs). Transmission dynamic and decision analytic models were combined to determine the expected impact of HH interventions on MRSA-BSI incidence and evaluate their cost-effectiveness. A series of sensitivity analyses and hypothetical scenarios making different assumptions about transmissibility were explored to generalize the findings. FINDINGS: Interventions increasing HH compliance from a 10% baseline to >/=20% are likely to be cost-effective solely through reduced MRSA-BSI. Increasing compliance from 10% to 40% was estimated to cost US$2515 per 10,000 bed-days with 3.8 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained in a paediatric ICU (PICU) and US$1743 per 10,000 bed-days with 3.7 QALYs gained in an adult ICU. If baseline compliance is not >20%, the intervention is always cost-effective even with only a 10% compliance improvement. CONCLUSION: Effective multi-modal HH interventions are likely to be cost-effective due to preventing MRSA-BSI alone in ICU settings in middle-income countries where baseline compliance is typically low.

We demonstrated that osteoporosis screening by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with or without pre-screening by Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) or calcaneal ultrasound are more cost-effective than no screening in Chinese people aged 65 or over in Hong Kong. INTRODUCTION: To examine the cost-effective potential osteoporosis screening strategies for hip fracture prevention in Hong Kong. METHODS: Decision tree models were constructed to evaluate the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the different osteoporosis screening strategies followed by subsequent 5-year treatment with alendronate compared to no screening (but treat if a hip fracture occurs). The multiple osteoporosis screening strategies were composed of alternative tests and initiation age groups were evaluated with a 10-year horizon, and treatment were assigned if central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) T-score (at either the hip or spine) is - 2.5 or less. Strategies included DXA for all people and pre-screening with the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) at specific thresholds or by calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) before taking DXA examination. All the model inputs were based on the Mr. OS and Ms. OS Hong Kong cohort; data are obtained from the Social Welfare Department or the published literature. RESULTS: All of the screening strategies, including the universal screening with DXA and the pre-screening with FRAX or QUS before DXA, were consistently more cost-effective than no screening for people aged 65 years old or over.

Strategies included DXA for all people and pre-screening with the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) at specific thresholds or by calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) before taking DXA examination. All the model inputs were based on the Mr. OS and Ms. OS Hong Kong cohort; data are obtained from the Social Welfare Department or the published literature. RESULTS: All of the screening strategies, including the universal screening with DXA and the pre-screening with FRAX or QUS before DXA, were consistently more cost-effective than no screening for people aged 65 years old or over.

19648,Is adding maternal vaccination to prevent whooping cough cost-effective in Australia?,"Pertussis or whooping cough, a highly infectious respiratory infection, causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants. In adolescents and adults, pertussis presents with atypical symptoms often resulting in under-diagnosis and under-reporting, increasing the risk of transmission to more vulnerable groups. Maternal vaccination against pertussis protects mothers and newborns. This evaluation assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding maternal dTpa (reduced antigen diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular pertussis) vaccination to the 2016 nationally-funded pertussis program (DTPa [Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis] at 2, 4, 6, 18 months, 4 years and dTpa at 12-13 years) in Australia. A static cross-sectional population model was developed using a one-year period at steady-state. The model considered the total Australian population, stratified by age. Vaccine effectiveness against pertussis infection was assumed to be 92% in mothers and 91% in newborns, based on observational and case-control studies. The model included conservative assumptions around unreported cases. With 70% coverage, adding maternal vaccination to the existing pertussis program would prevent 8,847 pertussis cases, 422 outpatient cases, 146 hospitalizations and 0.54 deaths per year at the population level. With a 5% discount rate, 138.5 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) would be gained at an extra cost of AUS$ 4.44 million and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AUS$ 32,065 per QALY gained. Sensitivity and scenario analyses demonstrated that outcomes were most sensitive to assumptions around vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection in mothers, and disutility of unreported cases.

19649,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of an Adherence-Promotion Intervention for Children With Leukemia: A Markov Model-Based Simulation,"Objective: Improving medication adherence among children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has the potential to reduce relapse rates but requires an investment in resources. An economic evaluation is needed to understand the potential costs and benefits of delivering adherence-promotion interventions (APIs) as part of standard clinical care. Methods: A Markov decision analytic model was used to simulate the potential incremental cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to be gained from an API for children with B-ALL in first continuous remission compared with treatment as usual (TAU, no intervention). Model parameter estimates were informed by previously published studies. The primary outcome was incremental cost (2015 US$) per QALY gained for API compared with TAU. Results: The model predicts the API to result in superior health outcomes (4.87 vs. 4.86 QALYs) and cost savings ($43,540.73 vs. $46,675.71) as compared with TAU, and simulations indicate that, across a range of plausible parameter estimates, there is a 95% chance that the API is more effective and less costly than TAU. The API was estimated to remain more effective and less costly than TAU in situations where the prevalence of nonadherence exceeds 32% and when API improves baseline adherence in at least 3% of patients.

METHOD: A cluster randomised trial compared collaborative care (integrated physical and mental healthcare) with usual care for depression alongside diabetes and/or coronary heart disease. Depression symptoms were measured by the symptom checklist-depression scale (SCL-D13). The economic evaluation was from the perspective of the English National Health Service. RESULTS: 191 participants were allocated to collaborative care and 196 to usual care. At 24 months, the mean SCL-D13 score was 0.27 (95% CI, -0.48 to -0.06) lower in the collaborative care group alongside a gain of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.06-0.21) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

19655,Economic Evaluation of Stiripentol for Dravet Syndrome: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic form of pediatric treatment-resistant epilepsy with few effective treatment options. Stiripentol is approved for use in Canada for treatment of Dravet syndrome, but the associated long-term costs and benefits have not been well-studied and its cost effectiveness is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of stiripentol as an adjunctive treatment to clobazam and valproate for treatment of Dravet syndrome from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare payer. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with adjunctive stiripentol treatment compared with clobazam and valproate alone in children with Dravet syndrome. Transition probabilities, drug efficacy, utility weights, and costs were obtained from a review of the literature. Probabilistic analyses were conducted using a Markov model with health states related to seizure frequency. A 10-year horizon was used. The incremental cost per QALY gained (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) for adjunctive use of stiripentol was calculated, and assumptions were explored in scenario analyses. All costs are expressed in 2017 Canadian dollars ($Can). RESULTS: Compared with clobazam and valproate alone, the adjunctive use of stiripentol is associated with an ICER of $Can151,310. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can50,000, the probability that stiripentol was the optimal treatment was 5.2%. The cost of stiripentol would need to be reduced by 61.4% for stiripentol to be cost effective. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare payer, stiripentol is not cost effective at its current price at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can50,000.

19656,Cost-utility analysis of an intervention designed to reduce the critical handling error of insufficient inspiratory effort,"OBJECTIVES: Up to 70-80% of patients use inhalers incorrectly. Dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) require forceful inhalation for optimal delivery, and approximately 40% of Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)-defined Step-3+ patients inhale corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist through DPIs. The CRITIKAL study (Price et al. in J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract 5:1071-e9-1081-e9, 2017) found a statistically significant association between ''insufficient inspiratory effort'' error and increased risk of uncontrolled asthma and hospitalisation-requiring exacerbations. This paper explores the cost-effectiveness of an error-targeted intervention. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov cost-utility model simulated patients transitioning between controlled and uncontrolled health states over one year. Odds ratios (ORs, from the CRITIKAL study) of a patient having uncontrolled asthma conditional on making the error were applied to baseline transition probabilities sourced from the literature, both indirectly via an adjustment formula (Zhang et al. in JAMA 280:1690-1691, 1998) and directly by assuming OR approximates relative risk (RR). The analysis explored complete/partial eradication of the error when the intervention was priced to match comparators, as well as impact of indirect costs based on lost/reduced productivity. RESULTS: The intervention dominated both DPI comparators over one year, with direct cost savings of pound45/ pound86 with 0.0053/0.0102 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and had the highest probability of being cost-effective at a pound20,000/QALY threshold.

19668,Cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump therapy in two different patient populations with type 1 diabetes in Italy,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) combines real time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and provides additional benefits beyond those provided by CSII alone. SAP with automated insulin suspension provides early warning of the onset of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and has the functionality to suspend insulin delivery if sensor glucose levels are predicted to fall below a predefined threshold. Aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SAP with automated insulin suspension versus CSII alone in type 1 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the CORE Diabetes Model. The analysis was performed in two different cohorts: one with high baseline HbA1c and one at elevated risk for hypoglycemic events. Clinical input data were sourced from published data. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon; costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. In patients with poor glycemic control, SAP with automated insulin suspension resulted in improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) versus CSII (12.44 QALYs vs. 10.99 QALYs) but higher mean total lifetime costs (euro324,991 vs. euro259,852), resulting in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro44,982 per QALY gained. In patients at elevated risk for hypoglycemia, the ICER was euro33,692 per QALY gained for SAP versus CSII. CONCLUSION: In Italy, the use of SAP with automated insulin suspension is associated with projected improvements in outcomes as compared to CSII.

The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon; costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. In patients with poor glycemic control, SAP with automated insulin suspension resulted in improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) versus CSII (12.44 QALYs vs. 10.99 QALYs) but higher mean total lifetime costs (euro324,991 vs. euro259,852), resulting in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro44,982 per QALY gained. In patients at elevated risk for hypoglycemia, the ICER was euro33,692 per QALY gained for SAP versus CSII. CONCLUSION: In Italy, the use of SAP with automated insulin suspension is associated with projected improvements in outcomes as compared to CSII. These benefits translate into an ICER usually considered as good value for money, particularly in patients at elevated risk of hypoglycemia.",2018-01-27220,29753586,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,A Nicolucci,2018,28 / 7,707-715,No,29753586,"A Nicolucci; M C Rossi; D D'Ostilio; A Delbaere; S de Portu; S Roze; Cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump therapy in two different patient populations with type 1 diabetes in Italy, Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis, 2018 Jul; 28(7):1590-3729; 707-715",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Medical Procedure",Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy + Automated Insulin Suspension vs. Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Alone,At increased risk for hypoglycemia,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,33692,Euro,2014,48976.68
19670,Usefulness and Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Echocardiographic Contrast to Detect Left Ventricular Thrombus in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction,"Contrast is a recommended but frequently unused tool in transthoracic echocardiography to improve detection of left ventricular thrombus in patients with ejection fraction (EF) </=35%. The clinical and economic outcomes of a possible solution (i.e., universal contrast use) remain uncertain. To estimate clinical benefit, cost, and cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic strategy of universal use of contrast (vs no contrast) during echocardiography in patients with reduced EF, we created a decision analytic model using echocardiography sensitivity and specificity for left ventricular thrombus detection from a meta-analysis, as well as survival and cost estimates from published literature. Universal contrast use (vs nonuse) did not result in clinical or statistical improvement in estimated life years (8.509 vs 8.504) or quality-adjusted life years (5.620 vs 5.616). The cost of contrast was offset by reductions in subsequent health-care costs, resulting in similar total costs ($201,569 vs $201,573). In conclusion, although an intuitively attractive practice improvement strategy, universal contrast use strategy appears to offer no appreciable benefit to quality-adjusted survival or financial outcomes in patients with low EF.",2018-01-27222,29753394,Am J Cardiol,E Philip Lehman,2018,122 / 1,121-128,No,29753394,"E Philip Lehman; Patricia A Cowper; Tiffany C Randolph; Andrzej S Kosinski; Renato D Lopes; Pamela S Douglas; Usefulness and Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Echocardiographic Contrast to Detect Left Ventricular Thrombus in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction, Am J Cardiol, 2018 Jul 1; 122(1):0002-9149; 121-128",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Diagnostic,Echocardiographic with contrast vs. Echocardiographic without contrast,"Patients with presence of heart failure, reduced EF, and sinus rhythm",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1000,United States,2015,1091.95

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the health and economic benefits of pre-emptively injecting epinephrine for peanut ingestion in the absence of any symptoms, and to avoid products with peanut precautionary allergen labeling (PAL). METHODS: We used Markov modeling and simulations, assuming a base-case 10-fold fatality risk increase for less conservative management, with sensitivity analysis investigating 100- to 1000-fold increased fatality risk, incorporating risks of accidental exposures, reactions, fatality, and family costs of food allergy.

19680,An Economic Evaluation of Stopping Versus Continuing Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitor Treatment in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients With Disease Remission or Low Disease Activity: Results From a Pragmatic Open-Label Trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, from a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness of withdrawing tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) treatment compared to continuation of these drugs within a 1-year, randomized trial among rheumatoid arthritis patients with longstanding, stable disease activity or remission. METHODS: Data were collected from a pragmatic, open-label trial. Cost-utility analysis was performed using the nonparametric bootstrapping method, and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was constructed using the net-monetary benefit framework, where a willingness-to-accept threshold (WTA) was defined as the minimal cost saved that a patient accepted for each quality-adjusted life year (QALY) lost. RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were randomized to the stop group and 286 patients to the continuation group. Withdrawal of TNFi treatment resulted in a >60% reduction of the total drug cost, but led to an increase of approximately 30% in other health care expenditures. Compared to continuation, stopping TNFi resulted in a mean yearly cost saving of euro7,133 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] euro6,071, euro8,234]) and was associated with a mean loss of QALYs of 0.02 (95% CI 0.002, 0.040).

19681,Cost-effectiveness of lung volume reduction coil treatment in patients with severe emphysema: results from the 2-year follow-up crossover REVOLENS study (REVOLENS-2 study),"BACKGROUND: The REVOLENS study compared lung volume reduction coil treatment to usual care in patients with severe emphysema at 1 year, resulting in improved quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and higher costs. Durability of the coil treatment benefit and its cost-effectiveness at 2 years are now assessed. METHODS: After one year, the REVOLENS trial''s usual care group patients received coil treatment (second-line coil treatment group). Costs and QALYs were assessed in both arms at 2 years and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in cost per QALY gained was calculated. The uncertainty of the results was estimated by probabilistic bootstrapping. RESULTS: The average cost of coil treatment in both groups was estimated at euro24,356. The average total cost at 2 years was euro9655 higher in the first-line coil treatment group (p = 0.07) and the difference in QALY between the two groups was 0.127 (p = 0.12) in favor of first-line coil treatment group. The 2-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was euro75,978 / QALY. The scatter plot of the probabilistic bootstrapping had 92% of the replications in the top right-hand quadrant. CONCLUSION: First-line coil treatment was more expensive but also more effective than second-line coil treatment at 2 years, with a 2-year ICER of euro75,978 / QALY.

19682,Cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: an Australian payer perspective,"AIMS: The goal of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from an Australian payer perspective. METHODS: This study used a Markov model that employed a life-time time horizon, modeling patients from symptom onset of stroke until end of life. Clinical efficacy and safety data were taken from an individual patient level data (IPD) meta-analysis of clinical studies. The treatment effect of MT compared to usual care was measured by changes in modified Rankin Score (mRS). Post-treatment mRS scores were used to determine short- and long-term stroke care costs. Treatment costs were modeled, with health state utility values determined by literature review. All analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: In comparison to usual care, MT is associated with higher costs ($10,666 per patient) and additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.8281 per patient), resulting in an incremental cost per QALY of $12,880. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the reliability of the base case results across a range of assumptions. The higher cost associated with MT is, to an extent, offset by the cost savings resulting from lower stroke care costs due to improved patient outcomes. The life-time cost savings in terms of stroke care costs are estimated to be more than $8,000 per patient for patients who had received MT in combination with usual care. LIMITATIONS: Stroke care costs based on patient disability/functional level were not available and were derived. As a consequence, long-term care costs for patients with poorer outcomes may be under-estimated. Patient outcomes at 90 days were extrapolated to a lifetime horizon, but this approach was supported by long-term evidence on stroke survival. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy is a cost-effective treatment option for AIS, with clinical benefits translating to short- and long-term cost benefits. This analysis supports rapid update of stroke care pathways to incorporate this therapy as a treatment option.",2018-01-27244,29741126,J Med Econ,Nimita Arora,2018,21 / 8,799-809,Yes,29741126,"Nimita Arora; Koji Makino; Dominic Tilden; Kyriakos Lobotesis; Peter Mitchell; John Gillespie; Cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: an Australian payer perspective, J Med Econ, 2018 Aug; 21(8):1369-6998; 799-809",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Surgical",Mechanical Thrombectomy + Usual Care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Thrombolysis or medical management with anti-thrombotic therapy in patients ineligible for intravenous thrombolytic therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,12880,Australia,2016,10328.84

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of three behavioral economic interventions designed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs. DESIGN: Thirty-year Markov model from the US societal perspective with inputs derived from the literature and CDC surveillance data. SUBJECTS: Forty-five-year-old adults with signs and symptoms of ARI presenting to a healthcare provider. INTERVENTIONS: (1) Provider education on guidelines for the appropriate treatment of ARIs; (2) Suggested Alternatives, which utilizes computerized clinical decision support to suggest non-antibiotic treatment choices in lieu of antibiotics; (3) Accountable Justification, which mandates free-text justification into the patient''s electronic health record when antibiotics are prescribed; and (4) Peer Comparison, which sends a periodic email to prescribers about his/her rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing relative to clinician colleagues. MAIN MEASURES: Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. KEY RESULTS: Each intervention has lower costs but higher QALYs compared to provider education. Total costs for each intervention were $178.21, $173.22, $172.82, and $172.52, and total QALYs were 14.68, 14.73, 14.74, and 14.74 for the control, Suggested Alternatives, Accountable Justification, and Peer Comparison groups, respectively.

19686,Comparing the Cost Effectiveness of Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants with Well-Managed Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Patients at High Risk of Bleeding,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared the cost effectiveness of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin using results from clinical trials evaluating NOACs. However, the time in therapeutic range (TTR) of warfarin groups ranged across clinical trials, and all were below the therapeutic goal of 70%. We compared the cost effectiveness of edoxaban 60 mg, apixaban 5 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, and well-managed warfarin with a TTR of 70% in preventing stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of bleeding. METHODS: For the six treatments, we used a Markov state-transition model to quantify lifetime costs in $US and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We simulated relative risk ratios of clinical events with each NOAC versus warfarin with a TTR of 70% using published regression models that predict how the incidence of thrombotic or hemorrhagic events changes for each unit change in TTR. We re-ran our analysis for two other estimates of TTR: 65 and 75%. RESULTS: Treatment with edoxaban 60 mg cost $US127,520/QALY gained compared with warfarin with a TTR of 70% and cost $US41,860/QALY gained compared with warfarin with a TTR of 65%.

19691,Cost-Effectiveness of Left Atrial Appendage Closure With the WATCHMAN Device Compared With Warfarin or Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants for Secondary Prevention in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Once a patient with atrial fibrillation experiences an embolic event, the risk of a recurrent event increases 2.6-fold. New treatments have emerged as viable treatment alternatives to warfarin for stroke risk reduction in secondary prevention populations. This analysis sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) compared with warfarin and the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban and rivaroxaban in the prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using data from the secondary prevention subgroup analyses of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and LAAC pivotal trials. Costs were from 2016 US Medicare reimbursement rates and the literature. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a US Medicare perspective over a lifetime (20 years) horizon. The model was populated with a cohort of 10 000 patients aged 70 years with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 7 (annual stroke risk=9.60%) and HAS-BLED score of 3 (annual bleeding risk=3.74%). RESULTS: LAAC achieved cost-effectiveness relative to dabigatran at year 5 and warfarin and apixaban at year 6. At 10 years, LAAC had more quality-adjusted life years (4.986 versus 4.769, 4.869, 4.888, and 4.810) and lower costs ($42 616 versus $53 770, $58 774, $55 656, and $58 655) than warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban, respectively, making LAAC the dominant (more effective and less costly) stroke risk reduction strategy. LAAC remained the dominant strategy over the lifetime analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Upfront procedure costs initially make LAAC higher cost than warfarin and the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, but within 10 years, LAAC delivers more quality-adjusted life years and has lower total costs, making LAAC the most cost-effective treatment strategy for secondary prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation.",2018-01-27249,29739915,Stroke,Vivek Y Reddy,2018,49 / 6,1464-1470,No,29739915,"Vivek Y Reddy; Ronald L Akehurst; Stacey L Amorosi; Meghan B Gavaghan; Deanna S Hertz; David R Jr Holmes; Cost-Effectiveness of Left Atrial Appendage Closure With the WATCHMAN Device Compared With Warfarin or Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants for Secondary Prevention in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, 2018 Jun; 49(6):1524-4628; 1464-1470",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",Left Atrial Appendage Closure vs. Warfarin,CHA2DS2-VASc score of 7 (annual stroke risk=9.60%) and HAS-BLED score of 3 (annual bleeding risk=3.74%),70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-69529.14,United States,2016,-74976.59

New treatments have emerged as viable treatment alternatives to warfarin for stroke risk reduction in secondary prevention populations. This analysis sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) compared with warfarin and the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban and rivaroxaban in the prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using data from the secondary prevention subgroup analyses of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and LAAC pivotal trials. Costs were from 2016 US Medicare reimbursement rates and the literature. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a US Medicare perspective over a lifetime (20 years) horizon. The model was populated with a cohort of 10 000 patients aged 70 years with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 7 (annual stroke risk=9.60%) and HAS-BLED score of 3 (annual bleeding risk=3.74%).

19694,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stop Smoking Interventions in Substance Use Disorder Populations undergoing treatment,"Background: Tobacco smoking is highly prevalent among people attending treatment for a substance use disorder (SUD). In the UK, specialist support to stop smoking is largely delivered by a national network of Stop Smoking Services, and typically comprises of behavioural support delivered by trained practitioners on an individual (one-to-one) or group basis combined with a pharmacological smoking cessation aid. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions, and compare cost-effectiveness for interventions using group- and individual-based support, in populations under treatment for SUD. Methods: Economic modelling was used to evaluate the incremental cost-per-quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for smoking cessation interventions compared to alternative methods of quitting for the SUD treatment population. Allowance was made for potentially lower abstinence rates in the SUD population. Results: The incremental cost per QALY gained from quit attempts supported through more frequently provided interventions in England ranged from around pound4,700 to pound12,200. These values are below the maximum cost-effectiveness threshold adopted by policy makers in England for judging whether health programmes are a cost-effective use of resources. The estimated cost-per QALY gained for Interventions using group-based behavioural support were estimated to be at least half the magnitude of those using individual support due to lower intervention costs and higher reported quit rates. Conclusions reached regarding the cost-effectiveness of group-based interventions were also found to be more robust to changes in modelling assumptions. Conclusions: Smoking cessation interventions were found to be cost-effective when applied to the SUD population, particularly when grouped-based behavioural support is offered alongside pharmacological treatment. Implications: This analysis has shown that smoking cessation interventions combining pharmacological treatment with behavioural support can offer a cost-effective method for increasing rates of smoking cessation in populations being treated for a substance use disorder.

19700,Comparison of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intensive community supported discharge service versus treatment as usual for adolescents with psychiatric emergencies: a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Intensive community treatment to reduce dependency on adolescent psychiatric inpatient care is recommended in guidelines but has not been assessed in a randomised controlled trial in the UK. We designed a supported discharge service (SDS) provided by an intensive community treatment team and compared outcomes with usual care. METHODS: Eligible patients for this randomised controlled trial were younger than 18 years and had been admitted for psychiatric inpatient care in the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Patients were assigned 1:1 to either the SDS or to usual care by use of a computer-generated pseudorandom code with random permuted blocks of varying sizes. The primary outcome was number of inpatient bed-days, change in Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores, and change in Children''s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) scores at 6 months, assessed by intention to treat. Cost-effectiveness was explored with acceptability curves based on CGAS scores and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated from the three-level EuroQol measure of health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), taking a health and social care perspective. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN82129964. FINDINGS: Hospital use at 6 months was significantly lower in the SDS group than in the usual care group (unadjusted median 34 IQR 17-63 vs 50 days, 19-125, p=0.04). The ratio of mean total inpatient days for usual care to SDS was 1.67 (95% CI 1.02-2.81, p=0.04), which decreased to 1.65 (0.99-2.77, p=0.057) when adjusted for differences in hospital use before randomisation. Scores for SDQ and CGAS did not differ between groups. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve based on QALYs showed that the probability of SDS being cost-effective compared with usual care was around 60% with a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000-30 000 per QALY, and that based on CGAS showed at least 58% probability of SDS being cost-effective compared with usual care irrespective of willingness to pay. We recorded no adverse events attributable to SDS or usual care. INTERPRETATION: SDS provided by an intensive community treatment team reduced bed usage at 6 months'' follow-up but had no effect on functional status and symptoms of mental health disorders compared with usual care. The possibility of preventing admissions, particularly through features such as reduced self-harm and improved reintegration into school, with intensive community treatment should be investigated in future studies.
