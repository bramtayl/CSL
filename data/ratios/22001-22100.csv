22001,Cost-Effectiveness of Sequential Teriparatide/Alendronate Versus Alendronate-Alone Strategies in High-Risk Osteoporotic Women in the US: Analyzing the Impact of Generic/Biosimilar Teriparatide,"Teriparatide, currently only available in brand form in the United States, is a costly drug approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women who are at high risk of fracture. Because market exclusivity for brand teriparatide expired in August 2019 in the US, we sought to understand the potential health economic impact of the availability of generic or biosimilar (generic/biosimilar) teriparatide. We examined the cost-effectiveness of daily teriparatide for 2 years followed by weekly alendronate for 10 years (ie, sequential teriparatide/alendronate) compared with alendronate alone for 10 years in community-dwelling white osteoporotic women with prior vertebral fracture at ages 65, 70, 75, and 80. Using an updated version of previously validated Markov microsimulation models, we obtained incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (dollars [$] per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $150,000 per QALY from a societal perspective with a lifelong time horizon. In the base case, we estimated the annual cost of teriparatide to be $20,161, based on the assumption of 10% brand usage (at a cost of $27,618) and 90% generic/biosimilar usage (priced 30% lower than brand). The ICERs of sequential teriparatide/alendronate compared with alendronate alone were greater than $280,000 per QALY at all ages examined. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to teriparatide''s cost, with the cost of a generic/biosimilar product needing to be 65% to 85% lower than brand for sequential teriparatide/alendronate to be cost-effective. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, under the assumption that the annual cost of teriparatide was $20,161, the probabilities of sequential teriparatide/alendronate being cost-effective were less than 4% at a WTP of $150,000 per QALY. In conclusion, among community-dwelling older osteoporotic women with prior vertebral fracture in the US, even with the potential availability of generic/biosimilar teriparatide, sequential teriparatide/alendronate would not be cost-effective unless the cost of generic/biosimilar teriparatide were heavily discounted with respect to the current brand cost.

22009,Cost-Utility Analysis of Glaucoma Medication Adherence,"PURPOSE: The majority of patients with glaucoma do not take their medications as prescribed. Estimates of the cost-utility value of adherence to prescribed glaucoma medication are vital to implement potentially effective interventions. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using Monte Carlo microsimulations incorporating a series of Markov cycles (10 000 iterations per strategy). PARTICIPANTS: Patients with glaucoma aged >/=40 years with a full lifetime horizon (up to 60 years). METHODS: The analysis estimated glaucomatous progression on the basis of data from the United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study. Participants with glaucoma entered the model at age 40 years with a mean deviation in the better-seeing eye of -1.4+/--1.9 decibels (dB) and -4.3+/--3.4 dB in the worse-seeing eye. Participants whose glaucoma worsened each year accumulate -0.8 dB loss compared with -0.1 dB loss for those who remained stable. Data from the Glaucoma Laser Trial and the Tube versus Trabeculectomy Studies were used to assign probabilities of worsening disease among treated patients. Claims data estimating rates of glaucoma medication adherence over 4 years were used to assign probability of adherence. Those with poor adherence were modeled as having outcomes similar to the placebo arm of the clinical trials. As patients'' mean deviation deteriorated, they transitioned between health states from mild (>/=-6 dB), to moderate (<-6 to >/=-12 dB), to severe glaucoma (<-12 to >/=23 dB), to unilateral (<-20 dB) and bilateral blindness. At each health state, patients incurred the costs of treatment and established health utilities; ultimately, societal costs of low vision and blindness were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of glaucoma medication adherence. RESULTS: Beginning at an initial glaucoma diagnosis at age 40 years, patients proceeded to single-eye blindness as early as 19 years among those who were nonadherent and 23 years for those remaining adherent.

22010,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Surgical Management of Infants Less than One Year of Age with Feeding Difficulties,"BACKGROUND: We compared the cost-effectiveness of the common surgical strategies for the management of infants with feeding difficulty. METHODS: Infants with feeding difficulty undergoing gastrostomy alone (GT), GT and fundoplication, or gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tube were enrolled between 2/2017 and 2/2018. A validated GERD symptom severity questionnaire (GSQ) and visual analog scale (VAS) to assess quality of life (QOL) were administered at baseline, 1month, and every 6months. Data collected included demographics, resource utilization, diagnostic studies, and costs. VAS scores were converted to quality adjusted life months (QALMs), and costs per QALM were compared using a decision tree model. RESULTS: Fifty patients initially had a GT alone (71% laparoscopically), and one had a primary GJ. Median age was 4months (IQR 3-8months). Median follow-up was 11months (IQR 5-13months). Forty-three did well with GT alone. Six (12%) required conversion from GT to GJ tube, and one required a fundoplication. Of those with GT alone, six (14%) improved significantly so that their GT was removed after a mean of 7+/-3months. Overall, the median GSQ score improved from 173 at baseline to 18 after 1year (p<0.001). VAS scores also improved from 70/100 at baseline to 85/100 at 1year (p<0.001). ED visits (59%), readmissions (47%), and clinic visits (88%) cost $58,091, $1,442,139, and $216,739, respectively. GJ tube had significantly higher costs for diagnostic testing compared to GT (median $8768 vs. $1007, p<0.001). Conversion to GJ tube resulted in costs of $68,241 per QALM gained compared to GT only. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients improved with GT alone without needing GJ tube or fundoplication. GT and GJ tube were associated with improvement in symptoms and QOL. GJ tube patients reported greater gains in QALMS but incurred higher costs. Further analysis of willingness to pay for each additional QALM will help determine the value of care.

22012,Predicting the intervention threshold for initiating osteoporosis treatment among postmenopausal women in China: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on real-world data,"This study built a micro-simulation Markov model to determine the treatment threshold of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in Mainland China. Treatment with zoledronate is cost-effective when FRAX-based (Fracture risk assessment tool) fracture probability is over 7%. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to estimate FRAX-based fracture probabilities in Mainland China using real-world data, at which intervention could be cost-effective. METHODS: We developed a micro-simulation Markov model to capture osteoporosis states and relevant morbidities including hip fracture, vertebral fracture, and wrist fracture. Baseline characteristics including incidences of osteoporosis and distribution of risk factors were derived from the Peking Vertebral Fracture study, the largest prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women in Mainland China. We projected incidences of fractures and deaths by age groups under two treatment scenarios: 1) no treatment, and 2) zoledronate. We also projected total quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and total costs including fracture management and osteoporosis drugs for cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effective intervention thresholds were calculated based on the Chinese FRAX model. RESULTS: Treatment with zoledronate was cost-effective when the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture based on FRAX was above 7%. The FRAX threshold increased by age from 51 to 65 years old, and decreased in elder age groups, ranging from 4% to 9%. CONCLUSIONS: Using real-world data, our model indicated that widespread use of zoledronate was of both clinical and economic benefit among Chinese postmenopausal women. Using a FRAX-based intervention threshold of 7% with zoledronate should permit cost-effective access to therapy to patients and contribute to reducing the disease burden of osteoporosis in Mainland China.",2019-01-31274,31754756,Osteoporos Int,L Cui,2019,/,,No,31754756,"L Cui; David A Jones; Joel Smith; Xue W Mei; Maria A Hawkins; Tim Maughan; Frank van den Heuvel; Thomas Mee; Karen Kirkby; Norman Kirkby; Alastair Gray; Predicting the intervention threshold for initiating osteoporosis treatment among postmenopausal women in China: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on real-world data, Osteoporos Int, 2019 Dec 14; ():0937-941X",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"zoledronate 5 mg vs. No intervention, FRAX threshold of 1",postmenopausal women,Not Stated,51 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11229.73,United States,2019,11368.27
22013,Optimizing Value in the Evaluation of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) affects approximately 1% of the general population. The cost-effectiveness of routine laboratory testing for secondary causes of CSU has not been formally evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the cost-effectiveness of routine laboratory screening in adults with CSU. METHODS: A Markov model using cohort analysis and microsimulations was created for adult patients aged 20 years, over a 10-year time horizon, randomized to receive screening laboratory testing or a no-testing approach. Laboratory results were derived from a previously published retrospective analysis of adult patients with CSU. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in patients with untreated CSU, and patients treated with antihistamines, cyclosporine, or omalizumab. RESULTS: Average laboratory costs per simulated patient with CSU were $573 (standard deviation [SD], $41), with only 0.16% (SD, 3.99%) of tests resulting in improved clinical outcomes. Testing costs per laboratory-associated positive outcome were $358,052 (no therapy), $357,576 (antihistamine therapy), $354,115 (cyclosporine), and $262,121 (omalizumab). Screening tests were not cost-effective, with ICERs of $856,905 (no therapy), $855,764 (antihistamine therapy), $847,483 (cyclosporine), and $627,318 (omalizumab). In the omalizumab-treated subgroup, testing could be cost-effective below $220 or if it resulted in a 0.73% rate of CSU resolution. From a simulated US population perspective, nation-wide screening costs could reach $941,750,741 to $1,833,501,483.

Methods: The Markov model was used to simulate the medical cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients using crizotinib, ceritinib, or alectinib over a 10-year period by establishing three health states: progression-free, post-progression, and death. Randomized controlled clinical data were collected from the open-label, randomized phase 3 trials ALEX and ASCEND-4. Cost and utility values were derived from local charges and literature. Sensitivity analyses included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared with patients who used crizotinib as first-line treatment, patients in the ceritinib and alectinib groups yielded an additional 1.32 and 3.30 QALYs with an incremental cost of $84,728.20 and $339,114.36, respectively. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $64,398.83 and $102,675.74 per QALY in the ceritinib and alectinib groups, respectively. Alectinib was estimated to be more effective (4.68 QALY) and more costly ($432,063.06) with an ICER of $128,019.42 per QALY compared with ceritinib (2.69 QALY and $177,676.90). Results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: As a first-line treatment regimen, ceritinib and alectinib can extend the survival time of patients compared with crizotinib, but the medical cost also increases accordingly.

Patients and methods: Markov decision modeling and simulation were used to compare cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from the perspective of a US health insurer with care delivered by an integrated health system. Model assumptions and disease progression probabilities were derived from the literature. Performance metrics for the Assay were from an independent clinical validation study. Cost of the Assay was based on reimbursement rates from multiple payers. Other costs were derived from Geisinger payment data. Results: Base-case model results for a 5-year period comparing the Assay-directed care to the SOC estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $52,483/QALY in 2012 US dollars. Assay-directed care increased the use of endoscopic treatments by 58.4%, which reduced the progression to HGD, EAC and reduced EAC-related deaths by 51.7%, 47.1%, and 37.6%, respectively, over the 5-year period. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the probability of the Assay being cost-effective compared to the SOC was 57.3% at the $100,000/QALY acceptability threshold.

22025,Cost-effectiveness of chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy versus chemoradiation alone in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus,"BACKGROUND: Standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer usually includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), recent studies have indicated that esophagectomy after chemoradiation does not significantly improve survival but may reduce recurrence at the cost of treatment-related mortality. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of chemoradiation with and without esophagectomy. METHODS: We developed a decision tree and Markov model to compare chemoradiation therapy alone (CRT) versus chemoradiation plus surgery (CRT+S) in a cohort of 57-year-old male patients with esophageal SCC, over 25 years. We used information on survival, cancer recurrence, and side effects from a Cochrane meta-analysis of two randomized trials. Societal utility values and costs of cancer care (2017, USD) were from medical literature. To test robustness, we conducted deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: In our base scenario, CRT resulted in less cost for more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to CRT+S ($154 082 for 1.32 QALYs/patient versus $165 035 for 1.30 QALYs/patient, respectively). In DSA, changes resulted in scenarios where CRT+S is cost-effective at thresholds between $100 000-$150 000/QALY. In PSA, CRT+S was dominant 17.9% and cost-effective at willingness-to-pay of $150 000/QALY 38.9% of the time, and CRT was dominant 30.6% and cost-effective 61.1% of the time. This indicates that while CRT would be preferred most of the time, variation in parameters may change cost-effectiveness outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that more data is needed regarding the clinical benefits of CRT+S for treatment of localized esophageal SCC, although CRT should be cautiously preferred.",2019-01-31293,31749330,Cancer Med,Jonathan Salcedo,2019,/,,No,31749330,"Jonathan Salcedo; Gerd R Burmester; Kenneth B Gordon; James T Rosenbaum; Dilek Arikan; Winnie L Lau; Peigang Li; Freddy Faccin; Remo Panaccione; Cost-effectiveness of chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy versus chemoradiation alone in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, Cancer Med, 2019 Nov 20; ():2045-7634",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,chemoradiation plus surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- chemoradiation alone,Not Stated,57 Years,57 Years,Male,Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,-547650,United States,2017,-578238.59
22026,Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Screening for Colorectal Cancer Based on Polygenic Risk and Family History,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for personalizing colorectal cancer screening based on risk factors. We compared the cost-effectiveness of personalized colorectal cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history to uniform screening. METHODS: Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated a cohort of 100 million 40-year-olds, offering them uniform or personalized screening. Individuals were categorized based on polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer. We varied screening strategies by start age, interval and test and estimated costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In our analysis, we (i) assessed the cost-effectiveness of uniform screening; (ii) developed personalized screening scenarios based on optimal screening strategies by risk group; and (iii) compared the cost-effectiveness of both. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48. CONCLUSIONS: Uniform colorectal cancer screening currently appears more cost-effective than personalized screening based on polygenic risk and family history.

Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48. CONCLUSIONS: Uniform colorectal cancer screening currently appears more cost-effective than personalized screening based on polygenic risk and family history. However, cost-effectiveness is highly dependent on the cost of determining risk.
