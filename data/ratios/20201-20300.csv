20201,Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic hepatitis B and C among migrant populations in a low endemic country,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. In a low endemic country as the Netherlands, migrants are a key risk group and could benefit from early diagnosis and antiviral treatment. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening foreign-born migrants for chronic HBV and/or HCV using a societal perspective. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model. Estimates on prevalence, screening programme costs, participation and treatment uptake, transition probabilities, healthcare costs, productivity losses and utilities were derived from the literature. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was estimated and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For most migrant groups with an expected high number of chronically infected cases in the Netherlands combined screening is cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from euro4,962/QALY gained for migrants originating from the Former Soviet Union and Vietnam to euro9,375/QALY gained for Polish migrants. HBV and HCV screening proved to be cost-effective for migrants from countries with chronic HBV or HCV prevalence of >/=0.41% and >/=0.22%, with ICERs below the Dutch cost-effectiveness reference value of euro20,000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that treatment costs influenced the ICER for both infections. CONCLUSIONS: For most migrant populations in a low-endemic country offering combined HBV and HCV screening is cost-effective. Implementation of targeted HBV and HCV screening programmes to increase early diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B and C among migrants.",2018-01-28565,30408079,PLoS One,Anita W M Suijkerbuijk,2018,13 / 11,e0207037,No,30408079,"Anita W M Suijkerbuijk; Albert Jan van Hoek; Jelle Koopsen; Robert A de Man; Marie-Josee J Mangen; Hester E de Melker; Johan J Polder; G Ardine de Wit; Irene K Veldhuijzen; Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic hepatitis B and C among migrant populations in a low endemic country, PLoS One , 2018; 13(11):1932-6203; e0207037",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Screening,Screening for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C vs. None,Migrants from Turkey,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,6418.86,Euro,2016,7659.34

20214,Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic hepatitis B and C among migrant populations in a low endemic country,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. In a low endemic country as the Netherlands, migrants are a key risk group and could benefit from early diagnosis and antiviral treatment. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening foreign-born migrants for chronic HBV and/or HCV using a societal perspective. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model. Estimates on prevalence, screening programme costs, participation and treatment uptake, transition probabilities, healthcare costs, productivity losses and utilities were derived from the literature. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was estimated and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For most migrant groups with an expected high number of chronically infected cases in the Netherlands combined screening is cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from euro4,962/QALY gained for migrants originating from the Former Soviet Union and Vietnam to euro9,375/QALY gained for Polish migrants.

20239,Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic hepatitis B and C among migrant populations in a low endemic country,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. In a low endemic country as the Netherlands, migrants are a key risk group and could benefit from early diagnosis and antiviral treatment. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening foreign-born migrants for chronic HBV and/or HCV using a societal perspective. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model. Estimates on prevalence, screening programme costs, participation and treatment uptake, transition probabilities, healthcare costs, productivity losses and utilities were derived from the literature. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was estimated and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For most migrant groups with an expected high number of chronically infected cases in the Netherlands combined screening is cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from euro4,962/QALY gained for migrants originating from the Former Soviet Union and Vietnam to euro9,375/QALY gained for Polish migrants.

METHODS: A theoretical cohort of patients with cervical radiculopathy resistant to 6 weeks of noninvasive conservative management were simulated to treatment with either anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) or cervical epidural injections and continued physical therapy and analyzed with Markov chain decision tree Monte Carlo simulation.

DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that for the management of recalcitrant cervical radiculopathy, ACDF remains the dominant strategy compared with cervical epidural injections if the surgical avoidance rate of such injections is less than 50%.

20252,Cost-effectiveness of Initiating an Insulin Pump in T1D Adults Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring Compared with Multiple Daily Insulin Injections: The DIAMOND Randomized Trial,"BACKGROUND: The economic impact of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) have been evaluated separately. However, the cost-effectiveness of adding CSII to existing CGM users has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the societal cost-effectiveness of CSII versus continuing multiple daily injections (MDI) in adults with T1D already using CGM. METHODS: In the second phase of the DIAMOND trial, 75 adults using CGM were randomized to either CGM+CSII or CGM+MDI (control) and surveyed at baseline and 28 weeks. We performed within-trial and lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) via a modified Sheffield T1D model. RESULTS: Within the trial, the CGM+CSII group had a significant reduction in quality of life from baseline (-0.02 +/- 0.05 difference in difference [DiD]) compared with controls. Total per-person 28-week costs were $8,272 (CGM+CSII) versus $5,623 (CGM+MDI); the difference in costs was primarily attributable to pump use ($2,644). Pump users reduced insulin intake (-12.8 units DiD) but increased the use of daily number of test strips (+1.2 DiD). Pump users also increased time with glucose in range of 70 to 180 mg/dL but had a higher HbA1c (+0.13 DiD) and more nonsevere hypoglycemic events. In the lifetime CEA, CGM+CSII would increase total costs by $112,045 DiD, decrease QALYs by 0.71, and decrease life expectancy by 0.48 years. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this single trial, initiating an insulin pump in adults with T1D already using CGM was associated with higher costs and reduced quality of life.

20255,Economic and epidemiologic impact of guidelines for early ART initiation irrespective of CD4 count in Spain,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging data suggest that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) could reduce serious AIDS and non-AIDS events and deaths but could also increase costs. In January 2016, the Spanish guidelines were updated to recommend ART at any CD4 count. However, the epidemiologic and economic impacts of early ART initiation in Spain remain unclear. METHODS: The Johns Hopkins HIV Economic-Epidemiologic Mathematical Model (JHEEM) was utilized to estimate costs, transmissions, and outcomes in Spain over 20 years. We compared implementation of guidelines for early ART initiation to a counterfactual scenario deferring ART until CD4-counts fall below 350 cells/mm3. We additionally studied the impact of early ART initiation in combination with improvements to HIV screening, care linkage and engagement. RESULTS: Early ART initiation (irrespective of CD4-count) is expected to avert 20,100 [95% Uncertainty Range (UR) 11,100-83,000] new HIV cases over the next two decades compared to delayed ART (28% reduction), at an incremental health system cost of euro1.05 billion [euro0.66 - euro1.63] billion, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro29,700 [euro13,700 - euro41,200] per QALY gained. Projected ICERs declined further over longer time horizon; e.g., an ICER of euro12,691 over 30 years. Furthermore, the impact of early ART initiation was potentiated by improved HIV screening among high-risk individuals, averting an estimated 41,600 [23,200-172,200] HIV infections (a 58% decline) compared to delayed ART.

20257,Cost-Effectiveness of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt versus Large-Volume Paracentesis in Refractory Ascites: Results of a Markov Model Incorporating Individual Patient-Level Meta-Analysis and Nationally Representative Cost Data,"PURPOSE: To compare relative cost-effectiveness of serial large-volume paracentesis (LVP) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation for treatment of refractory ascites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decisional Markov model was developed to estimate payer cost and quality-adjusted life-ears (QALYs) associated with LVP and TIPS treatment strategies for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Survival estimates were derived from an individual patient-level meta-analysis of prospective randomized clinical trials. Health utilities for potential health states were derived from a prospective study of patients with cirrhosis. Cost data were derived from national representative claims databases (MarketScan and Medicare) and included reimbursement amounts for relevant procedures, hospitalizations, and outpatient pharmaceutical costs. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: LVP resulted in 1.72 QALYs gained at a cost of $41,391, whereas TIPS resulted in 2.76 QALYs gained at a cost of $100,538. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of TIPS versus LVP was $57,003/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay ratio of $100,000/QALY, TIPS has a 62% probability of being acceptable compared with LVP. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TIPS should be considered cost-effective in a country that places a relatively high value on health improvements but less so in countries with lower levels of health care resources.",2018-01-28597,30392803,J Vasc Interv Radiol,Sharon W Kwan,2018,29 / 12,1705-1712,No,30392803,"Sharon W Kwan; Stephen K Allison; Laura S Gold; David S Shin; Cost-Effectiveness of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt versus Large-Volume Paracentesis in Refractory Ascites: Results of a Markov Model Incorporating Individual Patient-Level Meta-Analysis and Nationally Representative Cost Data, J Vasc Interv Radiol, 2018 Dec; 29(12):1051-0443; 1705-1712",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt vs. Large-Volume Paracentesis,Not Stated,57 Years,57 Years,Male,Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,57003,United States,2017,60186.86
20258,Cost-Effectiveness of Primary Prevention with Statin Treatment for Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes,"INTRODUCTION: Statins can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether primary prevention with statin treatment is cost-effective for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in the Chinese context. METHODS: An economic analysis of primary prevention with statin treatment was conducted using the Chinese Outcomes Model for T2DM with a time horizon of a lifetime, which was developed and validated based on the Chinese population. Clinical costs and utility inputs were gathered from published sources. Lifetime discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were measured. The uncertainty was evaluated by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Statin treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg could add 0.08 QALYs with an additional $1676 compared with that of no statin management (control strategy) over a lifetime horizon, which led to an ICER of $21,924 per QALY gained. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $27,351 per QALY gained, there was an approximately 80% probability of statin treatment being cost-effective compared with the control strategy. The model outcomes were most sensitive to the length of the expected life and age at the T2DM diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment with atorvastatin is most likely cost-effective for primary prevention in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

20259,Endosheath ultrathin transnasal endoscopy is a cost-effective method for screening for Barrett's esophagus in patients with GERD symptoms,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Barrett''s esophagus (BE) screening is currently not considered to be cost effective in the general population but may be effective in high-risk subgroups, such as 50-year-old white men with chronic reflux disease (GERD). A new modality for screening is unsedated transnasal endoscopy using endosheath technology (uTNE), which has been shown to be safe and effective in clinical practice. In this study, we determined the cost-utility of uTNE in a high-risk subgroup compared with no screening or screening with standard endoscopy. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate screening of 50-year-old white men with symptoms of GERD with either uTNE or standard endoscopy compared with no screening, over a lifetime horizon. Input variables were based on the literature and recent data on uTNE screening for BE. The study was designed from a healthcare payer perspective by using direct costs. Primary outcome measures were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of uTNE and standard endoscopy compared with no screening. Sensitivity analysis was performed for several factors, such as prevalence of BE. RESULTS: Costs of uTNE, standard endoscopy, and no screening were estimated at, $2495, $2957, and $1436, respectively. Compared with no screening, uTNE screening resulted in an overall QALY increase of 0.039 (95% percentile 0.018; 0.063) and an ICUR of $29,446 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.516-53.091), whereas standard endoscopy compared with no screening resulted in a QALY increase of 0.034 (95% CI, 0.015-0.056) and an ICUR of $47,563 (95% CI, 31,036-82,970).

20262,Estimating costs and health outcomes of publicly funded tick-born encephalitis vaccination: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The number of notified cases of Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden has been increasing the past years despite the increased use of TBE-vaccine not subsidized by the healthcare system. Stockholm County is a high endemic area and an earlier study has shown that low-income households have lower vaccination coverage even when they are at high risk. This paper aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of a publicly funded TBE vaccination program in Stockholm. METHODS: In three different cohorts with individuals aged 3, 40 or 50years, long-term costs and health outcomes of an out-of-pocket strategy (53% of the cohort is vaccinated on their own expenses) and a structured vaccination program (full cohort is vaccinated covered by the publicly funded health care system), were estimated using a Markov model. The Markov model predicts the costs and effects in term of Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) over a lifetime horizon using a third-party healthcare payer perspective. The primary results are presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the additional cost required to achieve one additional QALY with the structured vaccination program. RESULTS: The results show that the structured vaccination program is associated with a gain in QALYs and increased costs compared with an out-of-pocket strategy. The calculated ICERs were 27 761, 99 527 and 160 827 SEK/QALY in cohorts of age 3, 40 and 50, respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed that the results are robust when varying different parameters.

The Markov model predicts the costs and effects in term of Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) over a lifetime horizon using a third-party healthcare payer perspective. The primary results are presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the additional cost required to achieve one additional QALY with the structured vaccination program. RESULTS: The results show that the structured vaccination program is associated with a gain in QALYs and increased costs compared with an out-of-pocket strategy. The calculated ICERs were 27 761, 99 527 and 160 827 SEK/QALY in cohorts of age 3, 40 and 50, respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed that the results are robust when varying different parameters. CONCLUSION: Given the setting of Stockholm county, this analysis shows a cost per QALY of a free vaccinations program, especially for children of 3years old, below generally acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds in Sweden.",2018-01-28609,30385058,Vaccine,Jad Shedrawy,2018,36 / 50,7659-7665,Yes,30385058,"Jad Shedrawy; Martin Henriksson; Maria-Pia Hergens; H Helena Askling; Estimating costs and health outcomes of publicly funded tick-born encephalitis vaccination: A cost-effectiveness analysis, Vaccine, 2018 Nov 29; 36(50):1873-2518; 7659-7665",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Immunization,Structured vaccination program for tick-born encephalitis vs. Out-of-pocket vaccination for tick-born encephalitis vaccine starting at age 40 (53% of cohort vaccinated on own expenses with no booster doses),Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,99527,Sweden,2017,12300.84
20264,Estimating costs and health outcomes of publicly funded tick-born encephalitis vaccination: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The number of notified cases of Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden has been increasing the past years despite the increased use of TBE-vaccine not subsidized by the healthcare system. Stockholm County is a high endemic area and an earlier study has shown that low-income households have lower vaccination coverage even when they are at high risk. This paper aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of a publicly funded TBE vaccination program in Stockholm. METHODS: In three different cohorts with individuals aged 3, 40 or 50years, long-term costs and health outcomes of an out-of-pocket strategy (53% of the cohort is vaccinated on their own expenses) and a structured vaccination program (full cohort is vaccinated covered by the publicly funded health care system), were estimated using a Markov model.

20265,"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Genotype-Guided Treatment Allocation in Patients with Alcohol Use Disorders Using Naltrexone or Acamprosate, Using a Modeling Approach","Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are a major contributor to the global burden of disease, and have huge societal impact. Some studies show that AUD patients carrying the G-allele of the OPRM1 variant c.118A>G respond better to naltrexone, resulting in reduced relapse rates compared to carriers of the AA genotype. Genotype-guided treatment allocation of these patients carrying a G-allele to naltrexone could potentially improve the treatment outcome. However, cost-effectiveness of this strategy should be investigated before considering clinical implementation. We, therefore, evaluated costs and Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), using a modelling approach, from an European perspective, of genotype-guided treatment allocation (G-allele carriers receiving naltrexone; AA homozygotes acamprosate or naltrexone) compared to standard care (random treatment allocation to acamprosate or naltrexone), by using a Markov model. Genotype-guided treatment allocation resulted in incremental costs of EUR 66 (95% CI -28 to 149) and incremental effects of 0.005 QALYs (95% CI 0.000-0.011) per patient (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 13,350 per QALY). Sensitivity analyses showed that the risk ratio to relapse after treatment allocation had the largest impact on the cost-effectiveness. Depending on the willingness to pay for a gain of one QALY, probabilities that the intervention is cost-effective varies between 6 and 79%. In conclusion, pharmacogenetic treatment allocation of AUD patients to naltrexone, based on OPRM1 genotype, can be a cost-effective strategy, and could have potential individual and societal benefits. However, more evidence on the impact of genotype-guided treatment allocation on relapse is needed to substantiate these conclusions, as there is contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of OPRM1 genotyping.",2018-01-28611,30384381,Eur Addict Res,Reinier L Sluiter,2018,24 / 5,245-254,No,30384381,"Reinier L Sluiter; Wietske Kievit; Gert Jan van der Wilt; Aart H Schene; Martina Teichert; Marieke J H Coenen; Arnt Schellekens; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Genotype-Guided Treatment Allocation in Patients with Alcohol Use Disorders Using Naltrexone or Acamprosate, Using a Modeling Approach, Eur Addict Res, 2018; 24(5):1421-9891; 245-254",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Screening","OPRM1 screening to guide alcohol use disorder treatment allocation vs. No OPRM1 screening, random assignment of naltrexone or acamprosate",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,13349.71,Euro,2015,16176.78
20266,The cost-effectiveness of systematic screening for age-related macular degeneration in South Korea,"BACKGROUND: Interventions that can facilitate early diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) will facilitate early treatment and improve clinical outcomes but there has been concerns about additional medical costs to the health care system. An examination through a retina fundus photography by a non-specialist has been suggested as a potential cost-effective alternative to a direct examination by a specialist, but limited scientific data exists on the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies for AMD. Our objective is to conduct an economic evaluation of various population-wide screening strategies for AMD among the South Korean population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a Markov cohort model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of four AMD screening strategies (opportunistic examination, opportunistic treatment, systematic photography, and systematic examination) in comparison with status quo (no screening) for South Korean adults. We projected a life time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100,00 persons of age 40 with and without AMD at baseline. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, cost from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each strategy. Interventions were evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30,000,000 KRW ($27,538) per QALY gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to address the model uncertainty. Opportunistic examination was strongly dominated because it generated fewer expected QALYs but incurred greater expected cost than the other screening strategies. The mean lifetime expected costs were 289,013 KRW, 363,692 KRW, 9,351,964 KRW, and 12,309,783 KRW, and the mean QALYs gained were 37.73, 37.75, 40.47, 40.68, for no screening, opportunistic treatment, systematic photography, and systematic examination, respectively. The results were most sensitive to the utility weight of mild AMD, the probability of complication from treatment, the cost of being in mild AMD, and the probability of recovery from complication. After eliminating the two weakly dominated strategies, systematic photography was cost-effective at the ICER of 3,310,448 KRW per QALY in comparison to status quo.

20270,Cost-effectiveness of alternative anticoagulation strategies for postoperative management of total knee arthroplasty patients,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prolonged (35-day) and standard (14-day) duration anticoagulation therapy following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Using Markov modeling, we assessed clinical and economic outcomes of 14-day and 35-day anticoagulation therapy following TKA with rivaroxaban, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, warfarin, and aspirin. Incidence of complications of TKA and anticoagulation - DVT, PE, prosthetic joint infection (PJI), and bleeding - were derived from published literature. Daily costs ranged from $1 (aspirin) to $43 (fondaparinux). Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at one-year post-TKA. The preferred regimen was the regimen with highest QALYs maintaining an ICER below the willingness-to-pay threshold ($100,000/QALY). We conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying complication incidence and anticoagulation efficacy, to evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty on model results. RESULTS: Aspirin resulted in the highest cumulative incidence of DVT and PE, while prolonged fondaparinux led to the largest reduction in DVT incidence (15% reduction compared to no prophylaxis). Despite differential bleeding rates (ranging from 3% to 6%), all strategies had similar incidence of PJI (1-2%). Prolonged rivaroxaban was the least costly strategy ($3,300 one year post-TKA) and the preferred regimen in the base case. In sensitivity analyses, prolonged rivaroxaban and warfarin had similar likelihoods of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Extending post-operative anticoagulation to 35 days increases QALYs compared to standard 14-day prophylaxis. Prolonged rivaroxaban and prolonged warfarin are most likely to be cost-effective post-TKA; the costs of fondaparinux and LMWH precluded their being preferred strategies.

Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at one-year post-TKA. The preferred regimen was the regimen with highest QALYs maintaining an ICER below the willingness-to-pay threshold ($100,000/QALY). We conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying complication incidence and anticoagulation efficacy, to evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty on model results. RESULTS: Aspirin resulted in the highest cumulative incidence of DVT and PE, while prolonged fondaparinux led to the largest reduction in DVT incidence (15% reduction compared to no prophylaxis). Despite differential bleeding rates (ranging from 3% to 6%), all strategies had similar incidence of PJI (1-2%). Prolonged rivaroxaban was the least costly strategy ($3,300 one year post-TKA) and the preferred regimen in the base case. In sensitivity analyses, prolonged rivaroxaban and warfarin had similar likelihoods of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Extending post-operative anticoagulation to 35 days increases QALYs compared to standard 14-day prophylaxis. Prolonged rivaroxaban and prolonged warfarin are most likely to be cost-effective post-TKA; the costs of fondaparinux and LMWH precluded their being preferred strategies.

20286,Cost-effectiveness of alternative anticoagulation strategies for postoperative management of total knee arthroplasty patients,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prolonged (35-day) and standard (14-day) duration anticoagulation therapy following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Using Markov modeling, we assessed clinical and economic outcomes of 14-day and 35-day anticoagulation therapy following TKA with rivaroxaban, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, warfarin, and aspirin. Incidence of complications of TKA and anticoagulation - DVT, PE, prosthetic joint infection (PJI), and bleeding - were derived from published literature. Daily costs ranged from $1 (aspirin) to $43 (fondaparinux). Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at one-year post-TKA. The preferred regimen was the regimen with highest QALYs maintaining an ICER below the willingness-to-pay threshold ($100,000/QALY). We conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying complication incidence and anticoagulation efficacy, to evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty on model results. RESULTS: Aspirin resulted in the highest cumulative incidence of DVT and PE, while prolonged fondaparinux led to the largest reduction in DVT incidence (15% reduction compared to no prophylaxis). Despite differential bleeding rates (ranging from 3% to 6%), all strategies had similar incidence of PJI (1-2%). Prolonged rivaroxaban was the least costly strategy ($3,300 one year post-TKA) and the preferred regimen in the base case. In sensitivity analyses, prolonged rivaroxaban and warfarin had similar likelihoods of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Extending post-operative anticoagulation to 35 days increases QALYs compared to standard 14-day prophylaxis. Prolonged rivaroxaban and prolonged warfarin are most likely to be cost-effective post-TKA; the costs of fondaparinux and LMWH precluded their being preferred strategies.

20290,Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening programme for women in rural China,"In low and middle-income countries mammographic breast cancer screening is prohibitively expensive and a cheaper alternative option is to use ultrasound as the primary screening test. In 2009, China launched a breast cancer screening programme for rural women aged 35-64 years with clinical breast examination coupled with ultrasound as the primary tool. Our study aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of breast screening compared to no screening among Chinese rural women. We developed a Markov model to estimate the lifetime costs and effects for rural women aged 35 years from a societal perspective. Asymptomatic women in the intervention arm were screened every 3 years before age 64 years. Breast cancer in the non-screening arm can only be diagnosed on presentation of symptoms. Parameter uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Compared to no screening, breast cancer screening cost $186.7 more and led to a loss of 0.20 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Breast screening was more expensive and did harm to health among rural women with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $-916/QALY. The sensitivity analysis identified utility loss from false positives as the factor that most influenced the results, but this did not affect the conclusions. In a rural setting with such low breast cancer incidence, screening for asymptomatic disease is not cost-effective with current screening tools. Priority should be given to ensure that symptomatic women have proper access to diagnosis and treatment at an early stage as this will lead to mortality reductions without the usual screening harms.",2018-01-28646,30367451,Int J Cancer,Li Sun,2018,/,,No,30367451,"Li Sun; Zia Sadique; Isabel Dos-Santos-Silva; Li Yang; Rosa Legood; Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening programme for women in rural China, Int J Cancer, 2018 Jan 19; ():0020-7136",QALY,China,Not Stated,Screening,Breast cancer screening every 3 years vs. No breast cancer screening,Rural,35 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-933.5,United States,2014,-1020.55
20291,Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is Cost-Effective for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance in High-Risk Patients With Cirrhosis,"Ultrasonography (US) is generally recommended for the surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients at risk. However, in patients with cirrhosis who have sufficiently high HCC incidence, surveillance using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with liver-specific contrast showed markedly higher sensitivity in detecting early-stage HCC than US. This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of semiannual surveillance using MRI versus US in patients with compensated cirrhosis and to identify the population that would gain optimal cost-effectiveness through MRI surveillance. We designed a Markov model to compare the expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), between MRI and US, with a 20-year time horizon, from the health care system perspective. The starting age of the cohort was 50 years, and 71% had hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. The cycle length was 6 months. Transition probabilities and costs were obtained mainly from a prospective cohort study (the PRIUS study, NCT01446666). Cost and effectiveness were discounted at 5%. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and tested using sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that the use of MRI incurred $5,562 incremental costs, 0.384 incremental life-years (LYs), and 0.221 incremental QALYs compared to US. The annual HCC incidence was the most influential factor on the ICER. The ICERs were $14,474/LY and $25,202/QALY at an annual HCC incidence of 3%. When the HCC incidence rate was >1.81%, the ICER was below $50,000/QALY. With increased HCC incidence, MRI surveillance was acceptable as a cost-effective option, even with an increased MRI/US cost ratio. Conclusion: Semiannual surveillance using MRI with liver-specific contrast may be more cost-effective than US in patients with virus-associated compensated cirrhosis at sufficiently high HCC risk despite the higher test cost of MRI.",2018-01-28651,30365164,Hepatology,Hye-Lin Kim,2018,/,,No,30365164,"Hye-Lin Kim; Jihyun An; Jae-A Park; Seung-Hoo Park; Young-Suk Lim; Eui-Kyung Lee; Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is Cost-Effective for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance in High-Risk Patients With Cirrhosis, Hepatology, 2018 Apr 7; ():0270-9139",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Screening,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma, 3% incidence vs. Ultrasonography surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma",Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,25202,United States,2018,25975.2
20292,Cost-effectiveness of revascularization in patients with intermittent claudication,"BACKGROUND: Revascularization is a treatment option for patients with intermittent claudication. However, there is a lack of evidence to support its long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of revascularization and best medical therapy (BMT) with that of BMT alone. METHODS: Data were used from the IRONIC (Invasive Revascularization Or Not in Intermittent Claudication) RCT where consecutive patients with mild-to-severe intermittent claudication owing to aortoiliac or femoropopliteal disease were allocated to either BMT alone (including a structured, non-supervised exercise programme) or to revascularization together with BMT. Inpatient and outpatient costs were obtained prospectively over 24 months of follow-up. Mean improvement in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was calculated based on responses to the EuroQol Five Dimensions EQ-5D-3 L questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as the cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients were randomized, 79 to each group. The mean cost per patient in the BMT group was euro1901, whereas it was euro8280 in the group treated with revascularization in addition to BMT, with a cost difference of euro6379 (95 per cent c.i. euro4229 to 8728) per patient. Revascularization in addition to BMT resulted in a mean gain in QALYs of 0.16 (95 per cent c.i. 0.06 to 0.24) per patient, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro42 881 per QALY. CONCLUSION: The costs associated with revascularization together with BMT in patients with intermittent claudication were about four times higher than those of BMT alone.

20294,Cost-effectiveness of ALK testing and first-line crizotinib therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer in China,"INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement gene testing is used increasingly to identify patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are most likely to benefit from crizotinib. This study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ALK tests followed by crizotinib compared to the standard chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A 10-year Markov model was constructed to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of crizotinib with standard chemotherapy, guided by the ALK rearrangement tests: next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel tests and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The health states included progression-free survival (PFS), progressed survival, and death. The costs examined included cost of drugs (pemetrexed, standard chemotherapy, salvage chemotherapy, and crizotinib), follow-up, palliative care, supportive care, severe adverse events, and ALK rearrangement testing. RESULTS: Under Patient Assistance Program (PAP), the model demonstrated that the patients using NGS panel tests spent US $31,388 and gained 0.780 QALYs, whereas patients using multiplex PCR spent US $31,362 and gained 0.780 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of crizotinib with PAP compared to the control strategy were projected at $14,384 (NGS) and $13,740 (multiplex PCR) per QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed the utility of PFS and the costs of crizotinib and pemetrexed were the most impactful factors on the model outcomes. The results were robust to changes in all parameters.

Sensitivity analyses showed the utility of PFS and the costs of crizotinib and pemetrexed were the most impactful factors on the model outcomes. The results were robust to changes in all parameters. CONCLUSION: ALK-rearrangement test positive followed by crizotinib may be cost-effective compared to standard chemotherapy from the Chinese healthcare system perspective when PAP was available.",2018-01-28677,30352060,PLoS One,Shun Lu,2018,13 / 10,e0205827,No,30352060,"Shun Lu; Yongfeng Yu; Shijun Fu; Hongye Ren; Cost-effectiveness of ALK testing and first-line crizotinib therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer in China, PLoS One , 2018; 13(10):1932-6203; e0205827",QALY,China,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Pharmaceutical","Multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing, Crizotinib without Patient Assistance Program vs. Pemetrexed plus cisplatin",Confirmed stage IIIB/IV,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,174327,United States,2016,187985.12
20298,The Cost-effectiveness of a Flash Glucose Monitoring System for Management of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Receiving Intensive Insulin Treatment in Sweden,"Flash glucose monitoring, an alternative to traditional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), prevents hypoglycaemic events without impacting glycated haemoglobin (REPLACE trial). Given the potential benefits, this study assessed the cost-effectiveness of using flash monitoring versus SMBG alone in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) receiving intensive insulin treatment in Sweden.Methods: This study used the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (IQVIA CDM, v8.5) to simulate the impact of flash monitoring versus SMBG over 40 years from the Swedish societal perspective. Baseline characteristics, intervention effects, and resource utilisation were derived from REPLACE; literature and Tandvards-Lakemedelformansverket (TLV) sources informed utilities and costs. Scenario analyses explored the effect of key base case assumptions. Results: In base case analysis, direct medical costs for flash monitoring use were SEK1,630,586 (euro158,523) versus SEK1,459,394 (euro141,902) for SMBG use. Flash monitoring led to 0.56 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 6.21 versus 5.65 SMBG) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SEK306,082/QALY (euro29,762/QALY). ICERs for all scenarios remained under SEK400,000/QALY (euro38,894/QALY). Conclusions: Hypoglycaemia and health utility benefits due to flash glucose monitoring may translate into economic value compared to SMBG.

20300,Is Less More? A Microsimulation Model Comparing Cost-effectiveness of the Revised American Thyroid Association's 2015 to 2009 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess relative clinical and economic performance of the revised American Thyroid Association (ATA) thyroid cancer guidelines compared to current standard of care. BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States has tripled whereas mortality has only marginally increased. Most patients present with small papillary carcinomas and have historically received at least a total thyroidectomy as a treatment. In 2015, the ATA released the revised guidelines recommending an option for active surveillance (AS) of small papillary thyroid carcinoma and thyroid lobectomy for larger unifocal tumors. METHODS: We created a Markov microsimulation model to evaluate the performance of the ATA''s 2015 guidelines compared to the ATA''s 2009 guidelines. We modeled a cohort of simulated patients with demographic and thyroid nodule characteristics representative of those presenting clinically in the United States. Outcome measures include life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and frequency of surgical adverse events. RESULTS: In our base case analysis, the ATA 2015 strategy dominates the ATA 2009 strategy. The ATA 2015 strategy delivers greater discounted average quality-adjusted life years (13.09 vs 12.43) at a lower discounted average cost ($14,752 vs $20,126). Deaths due to thyroid cancer under the 2015 strategy are higher than the 2009 strategy but this is offset by a reduction in surgical deaths, leading to greater average life expectancy under the ATA 2015 strategy. The optimal strategy is sensitive to patients who experience a greater decrement in quality of life while undergoing AS. CONCLUSIONS: The ATA 2015 Guidelines represent a cost-effective strategy regarding AS and extent of surgery.",2018-01-28708,30339630,Ann Surg,Craig White,2018,/,,No,30339630,"Craig White; Milton C Weinstein; Abbey L Fingeret; Gregory W Randolph; Akira Miyauchi; Yasuhiro Ito; Tiannan Zhan; Ayman Ali; G Scott Gazelle; Carrie C Lubitz; Is Less More?
