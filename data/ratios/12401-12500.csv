12401,Comparative outcomes and cost-utility following surgical treatment of focal lumbar spinal stenosis compared with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee: part 2--estimated lifetime incremental cost-utility ratios,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been widely accepted as highly cost-effective procedures, spine surgery for the treatment of degenerative conditions does not share the same perception among stakeholders. In particular, the sustainability of the outcome and cost-effectiveness following lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) surgery compared with THA/TKA remain uncertain. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to estimate the lifetime incremental cost-utility ratios for decompression and decompression with fusion for focal LSS versus THA and TKA for osteoarthritis (OA) from the perspective of the provincial health insurance system (predominantly from the hospital perspective) based on long-term health status data at a median of 5 years after surgical intervention. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: An incremental cost-utility analysis from a hospital perspective was based on a single-center, retrospective longitudinal matched cohort study of prospectively collected outcomes and retrospectively collected costs. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who had undergone primary one- to two-level spinal decompression with or without fusion for focal LSS were compared with a matched cohort of patients who had undergone elective THA or TKA for primary OA. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) ($/quality adjusted life year [QALY]) determined using perioperative costs (direct and indirect) and Short Form-6D (SF-6D) utility scores converted from the SF-36. METHODS: Patient outcomes were collected using the SF-36 survey preoperatively and annually for a minimum of 5 years. Utility was modeled over the lifetime and QALYs were determined using the median 5-year health status data. The primary outcome measure, cost per QALY gained, was calculated by estimating the mean incremental lifetime costs and QALYs for each diagnosis group after discounting costs and QALYs at 3%. Sensitivity analyses adjusting for +25% primary and revision surgery cost, +25% revision rate, upper and lower confidence interval utility score, variable inpatient rehabilitation rate for THA/TKA, and discounting at 5% were conducted to determine factors affecting the value of each type of surgery. RESULTS: At a median of 5 years (4-7 years), follow-up and revision surgery data was attained for 85%-FLSS, 80%-THA, and 75%-THA of the cohorts. The 5-year ICURs were $21,702/QALY for THA; $28,595/QALY for TKA; $12,271/QALY for spinal decompression; and $35,897/QALY for spinal decompression with fusion. The estimated lifetime ICURs using the median 5-year follow-up data were $5,682/QALY for THA; $6,489/QALY for TKA; $2,994/QALY for spinal decompression; and $10,806/QALY for spinal decompression with fusion. The overall spine (decompression alone and decompression and fusion) ICUR was $5,617/QALY. The estimated best- and worst-case lifetime ICURs varied from $1,126/QALY for the best-case (spinal decompression) to $39,323/QALY for the worst case (spinal decompression with fusion). CONCLUSION: Surgical management of primary OA of the spine, hip, and knee results in durable cost-utility ratios that are well below accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness. Despite a significantly higher revision rate, the overall surgical management of FLSS for those who have failed medical management results in similar median 5-year and lifetime cost-utility compared with those of THA and TKA for the treatment of OA from the limited perspective of a public health insurance system.",2014-01-14697,24239803,Spine J,Y Raja Rampersaud,2014,14 / 2,244-54,No,24239803,"Y Raja Rampersaud; Peggy Tso; Kevin R Walker; Stephen J Lewis; J Roderick Davey; Nizar N Mahomed; Peter C Coyte; Comparative outcomes and cost-utility following surgical treatment of focal lumbar spinal stenosis compared with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee: part 2--estimated lifetime incremental cost-utility ratios, Spine J, ; 14(2):1529-9430; 244-54",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Decompression with fusion vs. Failed medical management of focal lumbar spinal stenosis,Not Stated,84 Years,42 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,35897,Canada,2012,40474.38

12405,Improving quality of care in people with Type 2 diabetes through the Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative: a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIMS: The Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative is a physician-led quality-of-care improvement scheme that has been shown to improve HbA1c concentration, blood pressure, lipid profiles and BMI in enrolled people with Type 2 diabetes. The present analysis investigated the long-term cost-effectiveness of enrolling people with Type 2 diabetes in the Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative compared with conventional management. METHODS: Long-term projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (in 2010 Euros) were made using a published and validated model of Type 2 diabetes in people with Type 2 diabetes who were either enrolled in the Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative or who were receiving conventional management. Treatment effects were based on mean changes from baseline seen at 5 years after enrolment in the scheme. Costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: The Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative was associated with improvements in mean discounted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.55 years (95% CI 0.54-0.57) years and 0.48 quality-adjusted life years (95% CI 0.46-0.49), respectively, compared with conventional management. Whilst treatment costs were higher in the Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals arm, this was offset by savings as a result of the reduced incidence and treatment of diabetes-related complications. The Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative was found to be cost-saving over patient lifetimes compared with conventional management [euro 37,289 (95% CI 37,205-37,372) vs euro 41,075 (95% CI 40,956-41,155)].

12406,Decision analysis model of open repair versus endovascular treatment in patients with asymptomatic popliteal artery aneurysms,"OBJECTIVE: Repair is indicated of asymptomatic popliteal artery aneurysms (aPAAs) that are >2 cm. Endovascular PAA repair with covered stents (stenting) is increasingly used. It is, however, unclear when an endovascular approach is preferred to traditional open repair with great saphenous vein bypass (GSVB). The goal of this study was to assess the treatment options for aPAAs using decision analysis. METHODS: A Markov model was developed and a hypothetic cohort of patients with aPAAs was analyzed. GSVB, stenting, and nonoperative management with optimal medical treatment (OMT) were compared. Operative mortality, patency rates, quality-of-life values, and costs were determined by comprehensive review of the best available evidence. The main outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes were cost-effectiveness and number of reinterventions. RESULTS: For a 65-year-old male patient with a 2.0-cm aPAA and without significant comorbidities, probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that intervention is preferred over OMT (5.77 QALYs, 95% credibility interval [CI], 5.43-6.11; OMT). GSVB treatment for this patient results in slightly higher QALYs than stent placement, with a predicted 8.43 QALYs (GSVB: 95% CI, 8.21-8.64) vs 8.07 QALYs (stenting: 95% CI, 7.84-8.29), a difference of 0.36 QALYs (95% CI, 0.14-0.58). Furthermore, costs are higher for stenting ($40,464; 95% CI, $34,814-$46,242) vs GSVB ($21,618; 95% CI, $15,932-$28,070), and more reinterventions are required after stenting (1.03 per patient) vs GSVB (0.52 per patient), making GSVB the preferred strategy for all outcomes considered. Stenting is preferred in patients who are at high risk for open repair (>6% 30-day mortality) or if the 5-year primary patency rates of stenting increase to 80%. For very old patients (>95 years) and patients with a very short life expectancy (<1.5 years), OMT yields higher QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: GSVB is the preferred treatment in 65-year-old patients with aPAAs for all outcomes considered. However, patients at high risk for open repair or without suitable vein should be considered as candidates for endovascular repair. Very elderly patients and patients with a short life expectancy are best treated with OMT.

12408,Cost-effectiveness of blood donor screening for Babesia microti in endemic regions of the United States,"BACKGROUND: Babesia microti is the leading reported cause of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-transmitted infection in the United States. Donor screening assays are in development. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision analytic model estimated the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies for preventing transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB) in a hypothetical cohort of transfusion recipients in Babesia-endemic areas of the United States. Strategies included: 1) no screening; 2) Uniform Donor Health History Questionnaire (UDHQ), ""status quo""; 3) recipient risk targeting using donor antibody and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening; 4) universal endemic donor antibody screening; and 5) universal endemic donor antibody and PCR screening. Outcome measures were TTB cases averted, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; $/QALY). We assumed a societal willingness to pay of $1 million/QALY based on screening for other transfusion-transmitted infections. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, the UDHQ avoids 0.02 TTB cases per 100,000 RBC transfusions at an ICER of $160,000/QALY whereas recipient risk-targeted strategy using antibody/PCR avoids 1.62 TTB cases per 100,000 RBC transfusions at an ICER of $713,000/QALY compared to the UDHQ. Universal endemic antibody screening avoids 3.39 cases at an ICER of $760,000/QALY compared to the recipient risk-targeted strategy. Universal endemic antibody/PCR screening avoids 3.60 cases and has an ICER of $8.8 million/QALY compared to universal endemic antibody screening. Results are sensitive to blood donor Babesia prevalence, TTB transmission probability, screening test costs, risk and severity of TTB complications, and impact of babesiosis diagnosis on donor quality of life.

Outcome measures were TTB cases averted, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; $/QALY). We assumed a societal willingness to pay of $1 million/QALY based on screening for other transfusion-transmitted infections. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, the UDHQ avoids 0.02 TTB cases per 100,000 RBC transfusions at an ICER of $160,000/QALY whereas recipient risk-targeted strategy using antibody/PCR avoids 1.62 TTB cases per 100,000 RBC transfusions at an ICER of $713,000/QALY compared to the UDHQ. Universal endemic antibody screening avoids 3.39 cases at an ICER of $760,000/QALY compared to the recipient risk-targeted strategy. Universal endemic antibody/PCR screening avoids 3.60 cases and has an ICER of $8.8 million/QALY compared to universal endemic antibody screening. Results are sensitive to blood donor Babesia prevalence, TTB transmission probability, screening test costs, risk and severity of TTB complications, and impact of babesiosis diagnosis on donor quality of life.

12415,Acupuncture in patients suffering from allergic asthma: is it worth additional costs?,"OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture is increasingly used in patients with allergic asthma, but there is a lack of evidence on the cost-benefit relationship of this treatment. The aim of this study was to assess economic aspects of additional acupuncture treatment in patients with allergic bronchial asthma compared to patients receiving routine care alone. DESIGN, SUBJECTS, INTERVENTION, OUTCOME MEASURES: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with allergic bronchial asthma were either allocated to a group receiving acupuncture immediately or a waiting-list control group. Both groups were free to use routine care treatment. The resource consumption, costs, and health-related quality of life were evaluated at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months by using statutory health insurance information and standardized questionnaires. Main economic outcome parameters were direct and indirect cost differences during the study period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: Three hundred and six (306) patients (159 acupuncture; 147 controls) were included (mean age 46.5+/-13.11 years, female 57.2%) and were comparable at baseline. Acupuncture treatment was associated with significantly higher costs compared to control patients (overall costs: euro860.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 705.04-1016.47] versus euro518.80 [95% CI 356.66-680.93]; p=0.003; asthma-related costs: euro517.52 [95% CI 485.63-549.40] versus euro144.87 [95% CI 111.70-178.05]; p<0.001). These additional costs seem essentially driven by acupuncture costs themselves (euro378.40 [95% CI 367.10-389.69]). However, acupuncture was associated with superior effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Resulting ICER lay between euro23,231 (overall) and euro25,315 (diagnosis-specific) per additional QALY. When using German acupuncture prices of year 2012, the ICER would improve to euro12.810 (overall) versus euro14,911 (diagnosis-specific) per QALY gained.

12418,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in primary care: economic evaluation of the CoBalT Trial,"BACKGROUND: Depression is expensive to treat, but providing ineffective treatment is more expensive. Such is the case for many patients who do not respond to antidepressant medication. AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) plus usual care for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression compared with usual care alone. METHOD: Economic evaluation at 12 months alongside a randomised controlled trial. Cost-effectiveness assessed using a cost-consequences framework comparing cost to the health and social care provider, patients and society, with a range of outcomes. Cost-utility analysis comparing health and social care costs with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The mean cost of CBT per participant was pound910. The difference in QALY gain between the groups was 0.057, equivalent to 21 days a year of good health. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound14 911 (representing a 74% probability of the intervention being cost-effective at the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence threshold of pound20 000 per QALY). Loss of earnings and productivity costs were substantial but there was no evidence of a difference between intervention and control groups.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in primary care involving individuals without diagnosed diabetes aged 45-75 years (n=2054) screened using the questionnaire Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) and a subsequent oral glucose tolerance test. Where feasible, high-risk individuals who were identified (n=552) were allocated sequentially to standard care (n=219), a group-based (n=230) or an individual-level (n=103) intensive (structured programme of six hours using specific teaching techniques) lifestyle intervention (n=333). The primary outcome was the development of diabetes (WHO). We evaluated the cost of resources used with comparison of standard care and the intervention groups in terms of effectiveness and quality of life (15D questionnaire). RESULTS: After 4.2-year median follow-up, the cumulative incidences were 18.3% (14.3-22.9%) in the intensive intervention group and 28.8% (22.9-35.3%) in the standard care group (36.5% relative-risk-reduction). The corresponding 4-year HR was 0.64 (0.47-0.87; P<.004). The incremental cost induced by intensive intervention compared with the standard was 106euro per participant in the individual level and 10euro in the group-based intervention representing 746euro and 108euro per averted case of diabetes, respectively. The estimated incremental cost-utility ratio was 3243euro per quality-adjusted life-years gained.

12420,Impact of interferon free regimens on clinical and cost outcomes for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C (HCV) is a common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Current standard treatment for genotype-1 patients uses a triple combination of pegylated-interferon alpha (IFN), ribavirin (RBV) and a direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) with 75-80% sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. The aim is to determine cost-effectiveness of staging-guided vs. treat all HCV genotype-1 patients with interferon-based vs. interferon-free regimens. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model simulating patients until death compared four strategies for treating HCV genotype-1: Triple therapy (IFN, RBV, DAA) with staging-guidance or treat all, and oral IFN-free regimen with staging-guidance or treat all. Strategies with staging initiated treatment at fibrosis stages F2-F4, with staging repeated every 5 years until age 70. The reference case was a treatment-naive 50-year-old. Analysis was repeated for 50% increase in cost of oral therapy. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Treatment of all patients with oral IFN-free regimen was the most cost-effective strategy, with an ICER of $15,709/QALY at baseline cost of oral therapy. The ICER remained below $50,000/QALY in sensitivity analyses for baseline and +50% cost of oral therapy scenarios. The treat all strategy was also the most effective strategy; associated with the lowest risk of developing advanced liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Treating all HCV patients with oral IFN-free regimen reduced the number of patients developing advanced liver disease and increased life expectancy.

12421,Impact of interferon free regimens on clinical and cost outcomes for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C (HCV) is a common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Current standard treatment for genotype-1 patients uses a triple combination of pegylated-interferon alpha (IFN), ribavirin (RBV) and a direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) with 75-80% sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. The aim is to determine cost-effectiveness of staging-guided vs. treat all HCV genotype-1 patients with interferon-based vs. interferon-free regimens. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model simulating patients until death compared four strategies for treating HCV genotype-1: Triple therapy (IFN, RBV, DAA) with staging-guidance or treat all, and oral IFN-free regimen with staging-guidance or treat all. Strategies with staging initiated treatment at fibrosis stages F2-F4, with staging repeated every 5 years until age 70. The reference case was a treatment-naive 50-year-old. Analysis was repeated for 50% increase in cost of oral therapy. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Treatment of all patients with oral IFN-free regimen was the most cost-effective strategy, with an ICER of $15,709/QALY at baseline cost of oral therapy. The ICER remained below $50,000/QALY in sensitivity analyses for baseline and +50% cost of oral therapy scenarios. The treat all strategy was also the most effective strategy; associated with the lowest risk of developing advanced liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Treating all HCV patients with oral IFN-free regimen reduced the number of patients developing advanced liver disease and increased life expectancy. Additionally, IFN-free regimen without staging may be the most cost-effective approach for treating HCV genotype-1 patients.

12422,An early evaluation of clinical and economic costs and benefits of implementing point of care NAAT tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea in genitourinary medicine clinics in England,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the costs and benefits of clinical pathways incorporating a point of care (POC) nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea in genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics compared with standard off-site laboratory testing. METHOD: We simulated 1.2 million GUM clinic attendees in England. A simulation in Microsoft Excel was developed to compare existing standard pathways of management for chlamydia and gonorrhoea with a POC NAAT. We conducted scenario analyses to evaluate the robustness of the model findings. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes included the number of inappropriate treatments, complications and transmissions averted. RESULTS: The baseline cost of using the point of POC NAAT was pound103.9 million compared with pound115.6 million for standard care. The POC NAAT was also associated with a small increase of 46 quality adjusted life years, making the new test both more effective and cheaper. Over 95 000 inappropriate treatments might be avoided by using a POC NAAT. Patients receive diagnosis and treatment on the same day as testing, which may also prevent 189 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and 17 561 onward transmissions annually. DISCUSSION: Replacing standard laboratory tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea with a POC test could be cost saving and patients would benefit from more accurate diagnosis and less unnecessary treatment. Overtreatment currently accounts for about a tenth of the reported treatments for chlamydia and gonorrhoea and POC NAATs would effectively eliminate the need for presumptive treatment.",2014-01-14756,24273127,Sex Transm Infect,Katherine M E Turner,2014,90 / 2,104-11,No,24273127,"Katherine M E Turner; Jeff Round; Patrick Horner; John Macleod; Simon Goldenberg; Arminder Deol; Elisabeth J Adams; An early evaluation of clinical and economic costs and benefits of implementing point of care NAAT tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea in genitourinary medicine clinics in England, Sex Transm Infect, ; 90(2):1368-4973; 104-11",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Point of care nucleic acid amplification test for chlamydia and gonorrhoea vs. Standard/Usual Care- off-site laboratory testing,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,4 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-254347.83,United Kingdom,2011,-469496.25

METHODS: A 1-year decision tree was developed for Sweden using published data and expert opinion. Five treatment strategies lasting 1 year were compared: paliperidone palmitate (PP-LAI), olanzapine pamoate (OLZ-LAI), risperidone (RIS-LAI), haloperidol decanoate (HAL-LAI) and olanzapine tablets (oral-OLZ).

12427,A cost-utility analysis for prophylactic central neck dissection in clinically nodal-negative papillary thyroid carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Although prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) may reduce future locoregional recurrence after total thyroidectomy (TT) for low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), it is associated with a higher initial morbidity. We aimed to compare the long-term cost-effectiveness between TT with pCND (TT+pCND) and TT alone in the institution''s perspective. METHODS: Our case definition was a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 nonpregnant female patients aged 50 years with a 1.5-cm cN0 PTC within one lobe. A Markov decision tree model was constructed to compare the estimated cost-effectiveness between TT+pCND and TT alone after a 20-year period. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were estimated from the literature. The threshold for cost-effectiveness was set at US$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity and threshold analyses were used to examine model uncertainty. RESULTS: Each patient who underwent TT+pCND instead of TT alone cost an extra US$34.52 but gained an additional 0.323 QALY. In fact, in the sensitivity analysis, TT+pCND became cost-effective 9 years after the initial operation. In the threshold analysis, none of the scenarios that could change this conclusion appeared clinically possible or likely. However, TT+pCND became cost-saving (i.e., less costly and more cost-effective) at 20 years if associated permanent vocal cord palsy was kept </= 1.37 %, permanent hypoparathyroidism was </= 1.20 %, and/or postoperative radioiodine ablation use was </= 73.64 %.

DESIGN. Indirect treatment comparison and a cost-effectiveness assessment. SETTING: Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Those having epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Erlotinib versus gefitinib use was compared on the basis of four relevant Asian phase-III randomised controlled trials: one for erlotinib (OPTIMAL) and three for gefitinib (IPASS; NEJGSG; WJTOG). The cost-effectiveness assessment model simulates the transition between the health states: progression-free survival, progression, and death over a lifetime horizon. The World Health Organization criterion (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <3 times of gross domestic product/capita: <US$102 582; approximately <HK$798 078) was used to rate cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The best fit of study characteristics and prognostic patient characteristics were found between the OPTIMAL and IPASS trials. Comparing progression-free survival hazard ratios of erlotinib versus gefitinib using only these randomised controlled trials in an indirect treatment comparison resulted in a statistically significant progression-free survival difference in favour of erlotinib (indirect treatment comparison hazard ratio=0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.58; P=0.0001). The cost-effectiveness assessment model showed that the cost per progression-free life year gained and per quality-adjusted life year gained was at acceptable values of US$39 431 (approximately HK$306 773) and US$62 419 (approximately HK$485 619) for erlotinib versus gefitinib, respectively. CONCLUSION: The indirect treatment comparison of OPTIMAL versus IPASS shows that erlotinib is significantly more efficacious than gefitinib. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness assessment indicates that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are well within an acceptable range in relation to the survival benefits obtained.

12429,Is dietetic treatment for undernutrition in older individuals in primary care cost-effective?,"OBJECTIVES: Undernutrition in older age is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and high health care costs. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a dietetic treatment in primary care compared with usual care in older, undernourished, community-dwelling individuals. DESIGN: A parallel randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 146 undernourished, independently living older (>/=65 years) individuals. INTERVENTION: Dietetic treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcomes were change in kilogram body weight compared with baseline and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) after 6 months. Costs were measured from a societal perspective. The main analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data and bootstrapping was used to estimate uncertainty surrounding cost differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. RESULTS: The participants were randomized to receive either dietetic treatment (n = 72) or usual care (n = 74). After 6 months, no statistically significant differences were found between the dietetic treatment and usual care group in body weight change (mean difference 0.78 kg, 95% CI -0.26-1.82), QALYs (mean difference 0.001, 95% CI -0.04-0.04) and total costs (mean difference euro1645, 95% CI -525-3547). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) for QALYs was not interpretable. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for body weight gain was 2111. The probability that dietetic treatment is cost-effective compared with usual care was 0.78 for a ceiling ratio of euro5000 for body weight and 0.06 for a ceiling ratio of euro20.000 for QALY.

12430,Evaluating radiotherapy options in breast cancer: does intraoperative radiotherapy represent the most cost-efficacious option?,"INTRODUCTION: This study analyzed the cost-efficacy of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) compared with whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) for early-stage breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for this analysis came from 2 phase III trials: the TARGIT (Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial and the ELIOT (Electron Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial. Cost analyses included a cost-minimization analysis and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis including a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analysis. Cost analyses were performed comparing IORT with WBI delivered using 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), APBI 3D-CRT, APBI delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), APBI single-lumen (SL), APBI multilumen (ML), and APBI interstitial (I). RESULTS: Per 1000 patients treated, the cost savings with IORT were $3.6-$4.3 million, $1.6-$2.4 million, $3.6-$4.4 million, $7.5-$8.2 million, and $2.8-$3.6 million compared with WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I, respectively, with a cost decrement of $1.6-$2.4 million compared with APBI 3D-CRT based on data from the TARGIT trial. The costs per QALY for WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I compared with IORT were $47,990-$60,002; $17,335-$29,347; $49,019-$61,031; $108,162-$120,173; and $36,129-$48,141, respectively, based on data from the ELIOT trial. These results are consistent with APBI and WBI being cost-effective compared with IORT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for this analysis came from 2 phase III trials: the TARGIT (Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial and the ELIOT (Electron Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial. Cost analyses included a cost-minimization analysis and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis including a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analysis. Cost analyses were performed comparing IORT with WBI delivered using 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), APBI 3D-CRT, APBI delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), APBI single-lumen (SL), APBI multilumen (ML), and APBI interstitial (I). RESULTS: Per 1000 patients treated, the cost savings with IORT were $3.6-$4.3 million, $1.6-$2.4 million, $3.6-$4.4 million, $7.5-$8.2 million, and $2.8-$3.6 million compared with WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I, respectively, with a cost decrement of $1.6-$2.4 million compared with APBI 3D-CRT based on data from the TARGIT trial. The costs per QALY for WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I compared with IORT were $47,990-$60,002; $17,335-$29,347; $49,019-$61,031; $108,162-$120,173; and $36,129-$48,141, respectively, based on data from the ELIOT trial.

12436,Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) by lateral DXA scanning may be cost-effective when used as part of fracture liaison services or primary care screening,"SUMMARY: We identified that use of VFA may be cost-effective in either selected women from primary care or women attending after a low trauma fracture. INTRODUCTION: Lateral DXA scanning of the spine for vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) is used for research, but its wider role is unclear. We aimed to establish whether VFA is cost-effective in women based on two different scenarios: following a low-trauma fracture, and after screening of high-risk women identified in primary care. METHODS: The fracture cohort (FC) consisted of 377 women and the primary care cohort (PCC) of 251. Vertebral fractures were identified on VFA images by quantitative morphometry (QM). Outcome was cost-effectiveness of VFA, based on predicted change in clinical management defined as the identification of a vertebral fracture in a patient who otherwise falls below the threshold for treatment. FRAX treatment thresholds assessed were (1) 20/3 % thresholds and (2) National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group (NOGG) thresholds. RESULTS: As a result, 9.8 % from FC and 13.9 % from PCC were identified with vertebral fractures. Management was changed in 21 to 22/377 (5.6-5.8 %) in FC and 12 to 26/251 (4.8-10.4 %) from PCC depending on which thresholds were used. Sensitivity analyses identified medication adherence as the assumption which most influenced the model. The best-estimate cost-per-QALY for use of VFA in FC was pound3,243 for 20/3 threshold and pound2,130 for NOGG; for PCC, this was pound7,831 for 20/3 and was cost-saving for NOGG. Further analyses to adjust for potential false-positive vertebral fracture identification with QM showed VFA was no longer cost-effective.

12438,Evaluating PET-CT in routine surveillance and follow-up after treatment for cervical cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis that compares positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging plus standard practice with standard practice alone in the diagnosis of recurrent or persistent cervical cancer during routine surveillance and follow-up of women who have previously been diagnosed and treated. DESIGN: Model-based economic evaluation using data from a systematic review, supplemented with data from other sources, and taking a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. SETTING: Secondary Care in England. POPULATION: Women at least 3 months after the completion of treatment, with either recurrent or persistent cervical cancer. METHODS: A state transition (Markov) model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2011. The structure of the model was informed by the reviews of the trials and clinical input. In the model, two diagnostic strategies were examined. A one-way sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and a value of information analysis were also carried out. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness based on incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Adding PET-CT to the current treatment strategy of clinical examination and scanning [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or CT scan] during the routine surveillance and follow-up of women with recurrent or persistent cervical cancer is significantly more costly, with only a minimal increase in effectiveness. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the strategy of PET-CT as an adjunct to the standard treatment strategy that included clinical examination, MRI, and/or CT scan, compared with the usual treatment alone, was over pound1 million per QALY. CONCLUSION: The results of the current analysis suggest that use of PET-CT in the diagnosis of recurrent or persistent cervical cancer is not cost-effective.

DESIGN: Model-based economic evaluation using data from a systematic review, supplemented with data from other sources, and taking a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. SETTING: Secondary Care in England. POPULATION: Women at least 3 months after the completion of treatment, with either recurrent or persistent cervical cancer. METHODS: A state transition (Markov) model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2011. The structure of the model was informed by the reviews of the trials and clinical input. In the model, two diagnostic strategies were examined. A one-way sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and a value of information analysis were also carried out. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness based on incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Adding PET-CT to the current treatment strategy of clinical examination and scanning [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or CT scan] during the routine surveillance and follow-up of women with recurrent or persistent cervical cancer is significantly more costly, with only a minimal increase in effectiveness. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the strategy of PET-CT as an adjunct to the standard treatment strategy that included clinical examination, MRI, and/or CT scan, compared with the usual treatment alone, was over pound1 million per QALY. CONCLUSION: The results of the current analysis suggest that use of PET-CT in the diagnosis of recurrent or persistent cervical cancer is not cost-effective. Current guidelines recommending imaging using PET-CT as a diagnostic or surveillance tool need to be reconsidered in light of these results. This study did not specifically investigate the use of PET-CT in women with symptoms and radiological suspicion of recurrence where exenteration was considered.

12442,Cost-effectiveness analysis at 2 years of surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia by photoselective vaporization of the prostate with GreenLight-Photo vaporization 120 W versus transurethral resection of the prostate,"INTRODUCTION: Transurethral resection of the prostate is the gold standard of surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated to benign prostate hyperplasia. The new Green Light Photovaporization has been shown to be an alternative that is as effective for this condition as the transurethral resection of the prostate. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficiency of Green Light Photovaporization 120 W versus transurethral resection of the prostate in the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in a 2-year time horizon from the perspective of the Spanish health service perspective. METHODS: A cost utility analysis was performed retrospectively with the data from 98 patients treated sequentially with transurethral resection of the prostate (n: 50) and Green Light Photovaporization 120 W (n: 48). A Markov model was designed to estimate the cost (2012euro) and results (quality adjusted life years) in a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS: The total cost associated to Green Light Photovaporization 120 W treatment was less (3,377euro; 95% CI: 3,228; 3,537) than that of the transurethral resection of the prostate (3,770euro; 95% CI: 3,579; 3,945). The determining factor of the cost was the surgical phase (difference: -450euro; 95% CI: -625; -158) because admission to hospital after surgery was not necessary with the GreenLight-PhotoVaporization. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of BPH patients with GreenLight-PhotoVaporization 120 W is more efficient than transurethral resection of the prostate in the surgical treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia as it has similar effectiveness and lower cost (-393euro; 95% CI: -625; -158).",2014-01-14810,24300307,Actas Urol Esp,J M Benejam-Gual,2014,38 / 4,238-43,No,24300307,"J M Benejam-Gual; A Sanz-Granda; R Garcia-Miralles Gravalos; A Severa-Ruiz de Velasco; J Pons-Viver; Cost-effectiveness analysis at 2 years of surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia by photoselective vaporization of the prostate with GreenLight-Photo vaporization 120 W versus transurethral resection of the prostate, Actas Urol Esp, ; 38(4):1699-7980; 238-43",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,120 W GreenLight PhotoVaporization vs. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-5240,Euro,2012,-7595.42
12443,"Cost effectiveness of primary care referral to a commercial provider for weight loss treatment, relative to standard care: a modelled lifetime analysis","BACKGROUND: Because of the high prevalence of overweight and obesity, there is a need to identify cost-effective approaches for weight loss in primary care and community settings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term cost effectiveness of a commercial weight loss programme (Weight Watchers) (CP) compared with standard care (SC), as defined by national guidelines. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over the lifetime. The probabilities and quality-of-life utilities of outcomes were extrapolated from trial data using estimates from the published literature. A health sector perspective was adopted. RESULTS: Over a patient''s lifetime, the CP resulted in an incremental cost saving of AUD 70 per patient, and an incremental 0.03 QALYs gained per patient. As such, the CP was found to be the dominant treatment, being more effective and less costly than SC (95% confidence interval: dominant to 6225 per QALY). Despite the CP delaying the onset of diabetes by approximately 10 months, there was no significant difference in the incidence of type 2 diabetes, with the CP achieving <0.1% fewer cases than SC over the lifetime. CONCLUSION: The modelled results suggest that referral to community-based interventions may provide a highly cost-effective approach for those at high risk of weight-related comorbidities.",2014-01-14814,24301133,Int J Obes (Lond),N R Fuller,2014,38 / 8,1104-9,No,24301133,"N R Fuller; H Carter; D Schofield; H Hauner; S A Jebb; S Colagiuri; I D Caterson; Cost effectiveness of primary care referral to a commercial provider for weight loss treatment, relative to standard care: a modelled lifetime analysis, Int J Obes (Lond), ; 38(8):0307-0565; 1104-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Commercial weight loss program (Weight Watchers) vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard care (SC), as defined by national guidelines",Overweight or obese population,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, Lifetime",3.50,3.50,11260,Australia,2011,13386.25
12444,Treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with the addition of co-trimoxazole: an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic disease of the lungs of unknown origin with a poor prognosis. A small trial of co-trimoxazole demonstrated improvements in symptoms and functional parameters over a 3-month period. We therefore conducted a larger trial with a concurrent economic evaluation to investigate this antibiotic further. METHODS: We report an economic evaluation alongside a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 12 months therapy with 960 mg co-trimoxazole daily in 181 patients with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Patients were recruited from 28 university and district hospitals in the UK and were aged over 40 years with fibrotic IIP. We report costs to the National Health Service (NHS) and society, change in forced vital capacity (primary endpoint) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, incremental cost effectiveness and cost utility ratios over 12 months. RESULTS: From the perspective of society, mean cost per patient in the co-trimoxazole arm was approximately pound1177 higher than in the placebo arm, but mean QALYs were 0.053 higher yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound22,012 per QALY gained with a 54.44 % probability of being below pound30,000. The cost of IPF to UK society in 2011 is tentatively estimated at pound124 million, of which 13 % is NHS costs, 1 % social services, 2 % patient out-of-pocket costs and 84 % lost productivity. CONCLUSIONS: Given commonly employed thresholds in the UK NHS, on balance co-trimoxazole may be a cost-effective treatment for IPF, although there is substantial decision uncertainty. However, recent guidance on the use of immunosuppressive therapy in IPF patients should be taken into account prior to any policy decision.",2014-01-14826,24307539,Pharmacoeconomics,Edward C F Wilson,2014,32 / 1,87-99,Yes,24307539,"Edward C F Wilson; Ludmila Shulgina; Anthony P Cahn; Edwin R Chilvers; Helen Parfrey; Allan B Clark; Orion P Twentyman; Andrew M Wilson; Treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with the addition of co-trimoxazole: an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 32(1):1179-2027; 87-99",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Co-trimoxazole vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,22012,United Kingdom,2011,40631.57
12445,Bendamustine-rituximab: a cost-utility analysis in first-line treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in England and Wales,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bendamustine-rituximab (B-R) compared with CHOP-R (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, rituximab) and CVP-R (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, rituximab) as first-line treatment for patients with advanced indolent non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: A patient-level simulation was adapted from the model used by the University of Sheffield School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) in a health technology appraisal of rituximab for first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma. This approach allowed modelling of the complex treatment pathways in indolent NHL. Data from a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial were used to compare B-R with CHOP-R. The relative efficacy of CHOP-R and CVP-R was estimated using an indirect treatment comparison similar to the original ScHARR approach. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales, using a lifetime time horizon. A number of one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted, including one using recently published data comparing CVP-R with CHOP-R. RESULTS: The deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound5249 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for B-R vs CHOP-R, and pound8092 per QALY for B-R vs CVP-R. The alternative scenario using direct data comparing CVP-R with CHOP-R approximately halved the ICER for B-R vs CVP-R to pound4733. Owing to its better toxicity profile, B-R reduced the cost of treating adverse events by over pound1000 per patient vs CHOP-R. LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were: immaturity of overall survival data from the Phase 3 trial; reliance on quality-of-life data from previous health technology appraisals (as this was not collected in the trial); and a lack of direct evidence or a network of connected evidence comparing B-R with CVP-R.

12447,"Clinical and cost-effectiveness of compression hosiery versus compression bandages in treatment of venous leg ulcers (Venous leg Ulcer Study IV, VenUS IV): a randomised controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Drawbacks exist with the standard treatment (four-layer compression bandages) for venous leg ulcers. We have therefore compared the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two-layer compression hosiery with the four-layer bandage for the treatment of such ulcers. METHODS: We undertook this pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups in 34 centres in England and Northern Ireland. The centres were community nurse teams or services, family doctor practices, leg ulcer clinics, tissue viability clinics or services, and wound clinics. Participants were aged 18 years or older with a venous leg ulcer and an ankle brachial pressure index of at least 0.8, and were tolerant of high compression. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive two-layer compression hosiery or a four-layer bandage, using a remote randomisation service and prevalidated computer randomisation program. Participants were stratified by ulcer duration and ulcer area with permuted blocks (block sizes four and six). The primary endpoint was time to ulcer healing, with a maximum follow-up of 12 months. Although participants and health-care providers were not masked to treatment allocation, the primary endpoint was measured by masked assessment of photographs. Primary analysis was intention to treat with Cox regression, with adjustment for ulcer area, ulcer duration, physical mobility, and centre. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN register, number ISRCTN49373072. FINDINGS: We randomly allocated 457 participants to the two treatment groups: 230 to two-layer hosiery and 227 to the four-layer bandage, of whom 453 (230 hosiery and 223 bandage) contributed data for analysis. Median time to ulcer healing was 99 days (95% CI 84-126) in the hosiery group and 98 days (85-112) in the bandage group, and the proportion of ulcers healing was much the same in the two groups (70.9% hosiery and 70.4% bandage). More hosiery participants changed their allocated treatment (38.3% hosiery vs 27.0% bandage; p=0.02). 300 participants had 895 adverse events, of which 85 (9.5%) were classed as serious but unrelated to trial treatment. INTERPRETATION: Two-layer compression hosiery is a viable alternative to the four-layer bandage-it is equally as effective at healing venous leg ulcers. However, a higher rate of treatment changes in participants in the hosiery group than in the bandage group suggests that hosiery might not be suitable for all patients.

12448,Cost effectiveness of a survivorship care plan for breast cancer survivors,"PURPOSE: Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are recommended for patients who have completed primary treatment and are transitioning to routine follow-up care. However, SCPs may be costly, and their effectiveness is unproven. The study objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of an SCP for breast cancer survivors transitioning to routine follow-up care with their own primary care physician (PCP) using data from a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Resource use and utility data for 408 patients with breast cancer enrolled in the RCT comparing an SCP with standard care (no SCP) were used. The intervention group received a 30-minute educational session with a nurse and their SCP, and their PCPs received the SCP plus a full guideline on follow-up. Analysis assessed the societal costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the intervention group and the control group over the 2-year follow-up of the RCT. Uncertainty concerning cost effectiveness was assessed through nonparametric bootstrapping and deterministic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The no-SCP group had better outcomes than the SCP group: total costs per patient were lower for standard care (Canadian $698 v $765), and total QALYs were almost equivalent (1.42 for standard care v 1.41 for the SCP). The probability that the SCP was cost effective was 0.26 at a threshold value of a QALY of $50,000. A variety of sensitivity analyses did not change the conclusions of the analysis.

STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was employed with simulated subjects based on the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This study evaluated three treatment strategies: (i) practice at MESA enrollment, (ii) current guidelines, and (iii) MIRISK VP in MESA. METHODS: The model assessed patient healthcare costs and outcomes, expressed in terms of life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), over the lifetime of the cohort from the provider and payer perspective. A total of 50,000 hypothetical individuals were used in the model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted (based on the various input parameters) for the entire cohort and also for individuals aged 65 and older. RESULTS: Guiding treatment with MIRISK VP leads to the highest net monetary benefits when compared to the ''Practice at MESA Enrollment'' or to the ''Current Guidelines'' strategies. MIRISK VP resulted in a lower mortality rate from any CHD event and a modest increase in QALY of 0.12-0.17 years compared to the other two approaches. LIMITATIONS: This study has limitations of not comparing performance against strategies other than the FRS, the results are simulated as with all models, the model does not incorporate indirect healthcare costs, and the impact of patient or physician behaviors on outcomes were not taken into account.

Here, a cost-effectiveness analysis based on evidence from that trial is presented. A decision-analytic model is used to incorporate long-term consequences of transfusions and acute chest syndrome. Costs and health benefits, expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), are reported from the ''within-trial'' analysis and for the decision-analytic model. The probability of cost-effectiveness for each form of management is calculated taking into account the small sample size and other sources of uncertainty. In the range of scenarios considered in the analysis, preoperative transfusion was more effective, with the mean improvement in QALYs ranging from 0.018 to 0.206 per patient, and also less costly in all but one scenario, with the mean cost difference ranging from - pound813 to pound26. All scenarios suggested preoperative transfusion had a probability of cost-effectiveness >0.79 at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000 per QALY.",2014-01-14857,24329965,Eur J Haematol,Eldon Spackman,2014,92 / 3,249-55,No,24329965,"Eldon Spackman; Mark Sculpher; Jo Howard; Moira Malfroy; Charlotte Llewelyn; Louise Choo; Renate Hodge; Tony Johnson; David C Rees; Karin Fijnvandraat; Melanie Kirby-Allen; Sally Davies; Lorna Williamson; Cost-effectiveness analysis of preoperative transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease using evidence from the TAPS trial, Eur J Haematol, ; 92(3):0902-4441; 249-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Preoperative transfusion vs. No preoperative transfusion,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,47700,United Kingdom,2011,88048.6
12453,Cost-effectiveness of extended cessation treatment for older smokers,"AIMS: We examined the cost-effectiveness of extended smoking cessation treatment in older smokers. DESIGN: Participants who completed a 12-week smoking cessation program were factorial randomized to extended cognitive behavioral treatment and extended nicotine replacement therapy. SETTING: A free-standing smoking cessation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 402 smokers aged 50 years and older were recruited from the community. MEASUREMENTS: The trial measured biochemically verified abstinence from cigarettes after 2 years and the quantity of smoking cessation services utilized. Trial findings were combined with literature on changes in smoking status and the age- and gender-adjusted effect of smoking on health-care cost, mortality and quality of life over the long term in a Markov model of cost-effectiveness over a lifetime horizon. FINDINGS: The addition of extended cognitive behavioral therapy added $83 in smoking cessation services cost [P = 0.012, confidence interval (CI) = $22-212]. At the end of follow-up, cigarette abstinence rates were 50.0% with extended cognitive behavioral therapy and 37.2% without this therapy (P < 0.05, odds ratio 1.69, CI 1.18-2.54). The model-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $6324 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that the additional $947 in lifetime cost of the intervention had a 95% confidence interval of -$331 to 2081; the 0.15 additional QALYs had a confidence interval of 0.035-0.280, and that the intervention was cost-effective against a $50 000/QALY acceptance criterion in 99.6% of the replicates. Extended nicotine replacement therapy was not cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Adding extended cognitive behavior therapy to standard cessation treatment was cost-effective.

12454,The long term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of initiating treatment for ocular hypertension,"PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term health and economic consequences of direct treatment initiation in ocular hypertension patients. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis with a societal perspective and a lifelong horizon was performed. The primary outcomes were the incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of direct pressure-lowering treatment for ocular hypertension, compared to a strategy where treatment is postponed until conversion to glaucoma has been observed. We used a decision analytic model based on individual patient simulation to forecast disease progression and treatment decisions in both strategies in a representative heterogeneous patient population and in 18 patient subgroups stratified by initial intraocular pressure and additional risk factors for conversion. RESULTS: The incremental discounted health gain of direct treatment was 0.27 QALYs, whereas the incremental discounted costs were -euro 649 during an average lifetime of 26 years. In the simulations of patient subgroups, the model outcomes moved towards higher health gains and lower incremental costs with increasing risk of conversion in the patient population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of direct treatment ranged from euro 15,425 per QALY gained in the lowest-risk subgroup to dominance in the highest-risk subgroup. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that uncertainty surrounding the model input parameters did not affect the conclusions. CONCLUSION: Direct, early, pressure-lowering treatment is a dominant cost-effective treatment strategy over a strategy to start the same treatment approach later, after glaucoma has occurred for patients with ocular hypertension. Its implementation and consequences should be discussed with ophthalmologists and individual patients.",2014-01-14862,24330516,Acta Ophthalmol,Aukje van Gestel,2014,92 / 6,513-23,No,24330516,"Aukje van Gestel; Jan S A G Schouten; Henny J M Beckers; Johan L Severens; Fred Hendrikse; Carroll A B Webers; The long term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of initiating treatment for ocular hypertension, Acta Ophthalmol , ; 92(6):1755-3768; 513-23",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Direct pressure lowering treatment vs. Ocular hypertension patients did not receive treatment until conversion to POAG was seen at a follow-up visit, in which case treatment was initiated with a target pressure of 21 mmHg",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 10 years",4.00,1.50,-2403.7,Euro,2006,-3876.72
12455,Is brief advice in primary care a cost-effective way to promote physical activity?,"AIM: This study models the cost-effectiveness of brief advice (BA) in primary care for physical activity (PA) addressing the limitations in the current limited economic literature through the use of a time-based modelling approach. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the lifetime costs and outcomes of a cohort of 100 000 people exposed to BA versus usual care. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective ( pound2010/11 prices). Data to populate the model were derived from systematic literature reviews and the literature searches of economic evaluations that were conducted for national guidelines. Deterministic and probability sensitivity analyses explored the uncertainty in parameter estimates including short-term mental health gains associated with PA. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, BA is more expensive, incurring additional costs of pound806 809 but it is more effective leading to 466 QALYs gained in the total cohort, a QALY gain of 0.0047/person. The incremental cost per QALY of BA is pound1730 (including mental health gains) and thus can be considered cost-effective at a threshold of pound20 000/QALY. Most changes in assumptions resulted in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) falling at or below pound12 000/QALY gained. However, when short-term mental health gains were excluded the ICER was pound27 000/QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that, at a threshold of pound20 000/QALY, there was a 99.9% chance that BA would be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: BA is a cost-effective way to improve PA among adults, provided short-term mental health gains are considered. Further research is required to provide more accurate evidence on factors contributing to the cost-effectiveness of BA.",2014-01-14906,24352807,Br J Sports Med,Nana K Anokye,2014,48 / 3,202-6,No,24352807,"Nana K Anokye; Joanne Lord; Julia Fox-Rushby; Is brief advice in primary care a cost-effective way to promote physical activity?, Br J Sports Med, ; 48(3):0306-3674; 202-6",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Brief advice in primary care for physical activity vs. None,"Physically inactive, but healthy",Not Stated,33 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,1730,United Kingdom,2011,3193.38
12456,Optimal timing of influenza vaccination in patients with human immunodeficiency virus: a Markov cohort model based on serial study participant hemoagglutination inhibition titers,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza vaccination offers one of the best population-level protections against influenza-like illness (ILI). For most people, a single dose prior to the flu season offers adequate immunogenicity. HIV+ patients, however, tend to exhibit a shorter period of clinical protection, and therefore may not retain immunogenicity for the entire season. Building on the work of Nosyk et al. (2011) that determined a single dose is the optimal dosing strategy for HIV+ patients, we investigate the optimal time to administer this vaccination. METHODS: Using data from the ""single dose"" treatment arm of an RCT conducted at 12 CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network sites we estimated semimonthly clinical seroprotection levels for a cohort (N=93) based on HAI titer levels. These estimates were combined with CDC attack rate data for the three main strains of seasonal influenza to estimate instances of ILI over different vaccination timing strategies. Using bootstrap resampling of the cohort, nine years of CDC data, and parameter distributions, we developed a Markov cohort model that included probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Cost, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), and net monetary benefits are presented for each timing strategy. RESULTS: The beginning of December is the optimal time for HIV+ patients to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, the net monetary benefit associated with a Dec 1 vaccination date is $19,501.49 and the annual QALY was 0.833744. INTERPRETATION: Our results support a policy of administering the seasonal influenza vaccination for this population in the middle of November or beginning of December, assuming nothing is know about the upcoming flu season. But because the difference in between this strategy and the CDC guideline is small-12 deaths averted per year and a savings of $60 million across the HIV+ population in the US-more research is needed concerning strategies for subpopulations.",2014-01-14909,24355089,Vaccine,Gregory R Werker,2014,32 / 6,677-84,Yes,24355089,"Gregory R Werker; Behnam Sharif; Huiying Sun; Curtis Cooper; Nick Bansback; Aslam H Anis; Optimal timing of influenza vaccination in patients with human immunodeficiency virus: a Markov cohort model based on serial study participant hemoagglutination inhibition titers, Vaccine, ; 32(6):1873-2518; 677-84",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Seasonal influenza vaccination for an HIV positive (+) population on December 1 vs. Seasonal influenza vaccination for an HIV positive (+) population on Septmeber 15,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2012,Not Stated
12457,Budget impact and cost-utility analysis of universal infant rotavirus vaccination in Spain,"Rotavirus is not included in the Spanish mass infant vaccination schedule but has also not been economically evaluated for its inclusion. We analysed cost-utility of the universal infant rotavirus vaccination using RotaTeq(R) versus no vaccination in Spain. We also carried out a budget impact analysis and determined the effect on results of different variables introduced in the model. A deterministic Markov model was built considering loss of quality of life for children and their parents, and introducing direct and indirect costs updated to 2011. The introduction of the vaccination using RotaTeq(R) as a universal infant vaccination would increase the annual health care budget in 10.43 million euro and would result in a gain of an additional Quality Adjusted Life Year at a cost of 280,338euro from the healthcare system perspective and 210,167euro from the societal perspective. The model was stable to variable modifications. To sum up, according to our model and estimates, the introduction of a universal infant rotavirus vaccination with RotaTeq(R) in Spain would cause a large impact on the health care budget and would not be efficient unless significant variations in vaccine price, vaccine efficacy and/or utilities took place.",2014-01-14918,24360847,Prev Med,Inaki Imaz,2014,61 /,116-21,No,24360847,"Inaki Imaz; Beltran Rubio; Ana M Cornejo; Jesus Gonzalez-Enriquez; Budget impact and cost-utility analysis of universal infant rotavirus vaccination in Spain, Prev Med, ; 61():0091-7435; 116-21",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rotavirus vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,4 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,210167,Euro,2011,336503.84
12458,Cost-effectiveness of early-initiated treatment for advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer patients: a modeling study,"OBJECTIVE: Between diagnosis and primary treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), gaps of several weeks exist. Reducing these time intervals may benefit the patient and may lead to a reduction of costs. We explored the cost-effectiveness of early-initiated treatment of patients with suspected advanced-stage EOC compared with that of current treatment. METHODS: A discrete event simulation was used to synthesize all available evidences and to evaluate the health care costs and effects (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of the 2 treatment strategies over lifetime. Overall survival, progression-free survival, health-related quality of life, and costs of the separate events were assumed to remain equal. Other uncertainties were addressed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The treatment times of current and early-initiated treatment were 27 and 24 weeks, respectively. Early-initiated treatment yielded 3.42 QALYs per patient, for a total expected health care cost of euro25,654. Current treatment yielded 3.40 QALYs per patient, for a total expected health care cost of euro25,607. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2592 per QALY gained for early-initiated treatment compared with that for current treatment. For the willingness to pay for euro30,000 or more per QALY, early-initiated treatment had a 100% probability of being cost-effective compared with current treatment under the previously mentioned assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current evidence, early-initiated treatment of patients with suspected advanced-stage EOC leads to additional QALYs and seems to be cost-effective compared with current treatment.",2014-01-14921,24362714,Int J Gynecol Cancer,Tom Hoyer,2014,24 / 1,75-84,No,24362714,"Tom Hoyer; Ruud Bekkers; Hein Gooszen; Leon Massuger; Maroeska Rovers; Janneke P C Grutters; Cost-effectiveness of early-initiated treatment for advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer patients: a modeling study, Int J Gynecol Cancer, ; 24(1):1048-891X; 75-84",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early-inititated Treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,2592,Euro,2012,3757.12
12459,Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine for patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin - from the UK health care cost perspective,"AIMS: The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec (IDeg) versus insulin glargine (IGlar) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are considered appropriate for treatment with a basal insulin analogue, using a short-term economic model. METHODS: Meta-analysis data from three phase III clinical studies were used to populate a simple and transparent short-term model. The costs and effects of treatment with IDeg versus IGlar were calculated over a 12-month period. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. RESULTS: IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option versus IGlar in patients with T2DM using basal insulin. Base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated at pound15,795 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and pound13,078 per QALY, which are below commonly accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that hypoglycaemia event rates had an important effect on the results. With higher event rates for non-severe hypoglycaemia IDeg was less costly and more effective than IGlar (dominant). Conversely, using lower event rates for severe hypoglycaemia generated higher ICERs. Using hypoglycaemia rates from a subgroup of patients who experienced >/=1 hypoglycaemic event per year IDeg was highly cost-effective versus IGlar; with estimated ICERS of pound4887 and pound2625 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: This short-term modelling approach allows the economic evaluation of newer insulin analogues when advanced long-term modelling based on HbA1c differences is inappropriate. For patients with T2DM who are considered appropriate for treatment with a basal insulin analogue, IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option compared with IGlar and offers additional benefits to subgroups of patients, such as those suffering from recurrent hypoglycaemia.",2014-01-14934,24373113,Diabetes Obes Metab,M Evans,2014,16 / 4,366-75,No,24373113,"M Evans; M Wolden; J Gundgaard; B Chubb; T Christensen; Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine for patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin - from the UK health care cost perspective, Diabetes Obes Metab, ; 16(4):1462-8902; 366-75",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin degludec vs. Insulin glargine (IGlar) 51.70 units/day,Insulin naiive,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,15795.28,United Kingdom,2013,27448.45
12460,Complex ventral hernia repair using components separation with or without synthetic mesh: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Components separation provides a useful option among closure choices for complex ventral hernia repairs. The use of synthetic mesh in addition to performing a components separation is controversial. The authors'' goal was to perform the first cost-utility analysis on the use of synthetic mesh in addition to performing components separation when performing a complex ventral hernia repair in a noncontaminated field. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify published complication and recurrence rates for ventral hernia repairs (Ventral Hernia Workgroup I and II) requiring components separation with or without synthetic mesh. The probabilities of the most common complications were combined with Medicare Current Procedural Terminology reimbursement codes, Diagnosis-Related Group reimbursement codes, and expert utility estimates to fit into a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of components separation with and without synthetic mesh in reconstructing ventral hernias. RESULTS: At average retail costs, the decision model revealed a cost increase of $541.69 and a 0.0357 increase in quality-adjusted life-years when using synthetic mesh, yielding a cost-effective incremental cost-utility ratio of $15,173.39 per quality-adjusted life-year. Univariate sensitivity analysis revealed that synthetic mesh is cost-effective when it costs less than $2049.97. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of synthetic mesh when performing components separation in repairing complex ventral hernias is cost-effective when using average retail prices.

12461,Efficiency of naproxen/esomeprazole in association for osteoarthrosis treatment in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To assess, from the perspective of the National Healthcare System, the efficiency of a fixed-dose combination of naproxen and esomeprazole (naproxen/esomeprazole) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) compared to other NSAID, alone or in combination with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). METHODS: A Markov model was used; it included different health states defined by gastrointestinal (GI) events: dyspepsia, symptomatic or complicated ulcer; or cardiovascular (CV) events: myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure. The model is similar to the one used by NICE in its NSAID evaluation of OA published in 2008. The total costs (euro, 2012), including drug and event-related costs, and the health outcomes expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated in patients with increased GI risk, aged 65 or over, for a 1-year time horizon and a 6-month treatment with celecoxib (200mg/day), celecoxib+PPI, diclofenac (150mg/day)+PPI, etoricoxib (60mg/day), etoricoxib+PPI, ibuprofen (1,800mg/day)+PPI, naproxen (1,000mg/day)+PPI or naproxen/esomeprazole (naproxen 1,000mg/esomeprazole 40mg/day). The selected PPI was omeprazole (20mg/day). RESULTS: Naproxen/esomeprazole was a dominant strategy (more effective and less costly) compared to celecoxib, etoricoxib and diclofenac+PPI.

The total costs (euro, 2012), including drug and event-related costs, and the health outcomes expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated in patients with increased GI risk, aged 65 or over, for a 1-year time horizon and a 6-month treatment with celecoxib (200mg/day), celecoxib+PPI, diclofenac (150mg/day)+PPI, etoricoxib (60mg/day), etoricoxib+PPI, ibuprofen (1,800mg/day)+PPI, naproxen (1,000mg/day)+PPI or naproxen/esomeprazole (naproxen 1,000mg/esomeprazole 40mg/day). The selected PPI was omeprazole (20mg/day). RESULTS: Naproxen/esomeprazole was a dominant strategy (more effective and less costly) compared to celecoxib, etoricoxib and diclofenac+PPI. Celecoxib+PPI and etoricoxib+PPI were more effective. Considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of euro30,000 per additional QALY, naproxen/esomeprazole was cost-effective compared to ibuprofen+PPI and naproxen+PPI with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of euro15,154 and euro5,202 per additional QALY, respectively.

12474,How does accounting for worker productivity affect the measured cost-effectiveness of lumbar discectomy?,"BACKGROUND: Back pain attributable to lumbar disc herniation is a substantial cause of reduced workplace productivity. Disc herniation surgery is effective in reducing pain and improving function. However, few studies have examined the effects of surgery on worker productivity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We wished to determine the effect of disc herniation surgery on workers'' earnings and missed workdays and how accounting for this effect influences the cost-effectiveness of surgery? METHODS: Regression models were estimated using data from the National Health Interview Survey to assess the effects of lower back pain caused by disc herniation on earnings and missed workdays. The results were incorporated into Markov models to compare societal costs associated with surgical and nonsurgical treatments for privately insured, working patients. Clinical outcomes and utilities were based on results from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial and additional clinical literature. RESULTS: We estimate average annual earnings of $47,619 with surgery and $45,694 with nonsurgical treatment. The increased earnings for patients receiving surgery as compared with nonsurgical treatment is equal to $1925 (95% CI, $1121-$2728). After surgery, we also estimate that workers receiving surgery miss, on average, 3 fewer days per year than if workers had received nonsurgical treatment (95% CI, 2.4-3.7 days). However, these fewer missed work days only partially offset the assumed 20 workdays missed to recover from surgery. More fully accounting for the effects of disc herniation surgery on productivity reduced the cost of surgery per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from $52,416 to $35,146 using a 4-year time horizon and from $27,359 to $4186 using an 8-year time horizon. According to a sensitivity analysis, the 4-year cost per QALY varies between $27,921 and $49,787 depending on model assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Increased worker earnings resulting from disc herniation surgery may offset the increased direct medical costs associated with surgery. After accounting for the effects on productivity, disc herniation surgery was found to be a highly cost-effective surgery and may yield net societal savings if the benefits of outpatient and inpatient surgery persist beyond 6 and 12 years, respectively.

12475,Cost-effectiveness of optimizing acute stroke care services for thrombolysis,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombolysis in acute stroke is effective up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset but relies on early recognition, prompt arrival in hospital, and timely brain scanning. This study aimed to establish the cost-effectiveness of increasing thrombolysis rates through a series of hypothetical change strategies designed to optimize the acute care pathway for stroke. METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed, which relates the acute management of patients with suspected stroke from symptom onset to outcome. Current practice was modeled and compared with 7 change strategies designed to facilitate wider eligibility for thrombolysis. The model basecase consisted of data from consenting patients following the acute stroke pathway recruited in participating hospitals with data on effectiveness of treatment and costs from published sources. RESULTS: All change strategies were cost saving while increasing quality-adjusted life years gained. Using realistic estimates of effectiveness, the change strategy with the largest potential benefit was that of better recording of onset time, which resulted in 3.3 additional quality-adjusted life years and a cost saving of US $46,000 per 100,000 population. All strategies increased the number of thrombolysed patients and the number requiring urgent brain imaging (by 9% to 21% dependent on the scenario).

This study aimed to establish the cost-effectiveness of increasing thrombolysis rates through a series of hypothetical change strategies designed to optimize the acute care pathway for stroke. METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed, which relates the acute management of patients with suspected stroke from symptom onset to outcome. Current practice was modeled and compared with 7 change strategies designed to facilitate wider eligibility for thrombolysis.

RESULTS: All change strategies were cost saving while increasing quality-adjusted life years gained. Using realistic estimates of effectiveness, the change strategy with the largest potential benefit was that of better recording of onset time, which resulted in 3.3 additional quality-adjusted life years and a cost saving of US $46,000 per 100,000 population.

12482,A cost-effectiveness analysis of HIV preexposure prophylaxis for men who have sex with men in Australia,"BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) used as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative individuals reduces the risk of acquiring HIV. However, the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of using PrEP as a public health intervention remains debated. METHODS: We used a stochastic agent-based model of HIV transmission and progression to simulate the clinical and cost outcomes of different strategies of providing PrEP to men who have sex with men (MSM) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Model outcomes were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2013 Australian dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALYG). RESULTS: The use of PrEP in 10%-30% of the entire NSW MSM population was projected to cost an additional $316-$952 million over the course of 10 years, and cost >$400 000 per QALYG compared with the status quo. Targeting MSM with sexual partners ranging between >10 to >50 partners within 6 months cost an additional $31-$331 million dollars, and cost >$110 000 per QALYG compared with the status quo. We found that preexposure prophylaxis is most cost-effective when targeted for HIV-negative MSM in a discordant regular partnership. The ICERs ranged between $8399 and $11 575, for coverage ranging between 15% and 30%, respectively.

12485,Tobacco control policies specified according to socioeconomic status: health disparities and cost-effectiveness,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of tobacco control policy for different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We aimed to evaluate SES-specific cost-effectiveness ratios of policies with known favorable effect in low-SES groups: a tobacco tax increase and reimbursement of cessation support. METHODS: A computer model of the adult population specified by smoking behavior (never/current/former smoker), age, gender, and SES simulated policy scenarios reflecting the implementation of a euro0.22 tobacco tax increase or full reimbursement of cessation support, which were compared. Relating differences in costs to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained generated cost-effectiveness ratios for each SES group. RESULTS: In a cohort of 11 million people, the tobacco tax increase resulted in 27,000 additional quitters after 5 years, who were proportionally divided among the SES groups. Reimbursement led to 59,000 additional quitters, with relatively more quitters in higher-SES groups. The number of QALYs gained were 3,400-6,200 among the various SES groups for the tax increase and 6,300-14,000 for the reimbursement scenario. For both interventions, favorability of the cost-effectiveness ratios increased with SES: costs per QALY decreased from euro6,100 to euro4,500 for the tax increase and from euro21,000 to euro11,000 for reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS: The reimbursement policy produced the greatest overall health gain. Surprisingly, neither tax increase nor reimbursement reduced health disparities.

12487,Cost-effectiveness of cryoballoon ablation for the management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"AIMS: Cryoballoon ablation is an established treatment option for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cryoablation, compared with second-line anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), from a UK payer perspective. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a state-transition (Markov) model to calculate the total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with cryoablation and AAD therapy in patients with PAF. A 5-year horizon was used for the base-case. Data from a recent study of cryoballoon ablation in patients with PAF were used to model short-term health outcomes and costs, together with longer term external evidence to populate subsequent time periods. Total discounted costs were pound21 162 and pound17 627 for the cryoballoon ablation and AAD arms, respectively. Total QALYs of 3.565 and 3.404 therefore led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound21 957 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the key drivers of the results were the model time horizon, the costs of follow-up care in patients with recurrent AF, and the costs of the ablation procedure. CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation provides increased quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with AAD at reasonable additional cost, representing good value for money in patients with PAF.",2014-01-14962,24390386,Europace,Matthew R Reynolds,2014,16 / 5,652-9,No,24390386,"Matthew R Reynolds; Mark Lamotte; Derick Todd; Yaariv Khaykin; Simon Eggington; Stelios Tsintzos; Gunnar Klein; Cost-effectiveness of cryoballoon ablation for the management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Europace, ; 16(5):1099-5129; 652-9",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cryoballoon ablation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy,One or more second -line anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy failures,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,21957,United Kingdom,2011,40530.05
12488,Comparative cost-effectiveness of alternative empiric antimicrobial treatment options for suspected enterococcal bacteremia,"OBJECTIVES: Enterococcus species are the fourth leading cause of bacteremia. Resistance rates are rising and delays in appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy have been associated with increased mortality. Empiric treatment of patients with suspected enterococcal bacteremia varies and significant cost differences exist between alternatives. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of various empiric treatments for patients with suspected enterococcal bacteremia. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed from the hospital perspective to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative empiric treatment options for enterococcal bacteremia, including antimicrobials active against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). The model was populated from available literature sources and included resistance patterns, associated mortality with early versus delayed effective treatment, and the cost of treatment.

12491,Economic evaluation of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood,"Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) consortia''s treatment strategies for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children are widely used. We compared the health effects and monetary costs of hospital treatments for these two strategies. Parents of children treated at seven centres in Canada, Italy and the USA completed health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessments during four active treatment phases and at 2 years after treatment. Mean HRQL scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a period of 5 years following diagnosis. Total costs of treatment were determined from variables in administrative databases in a universally accessible and publicly funded healthcare system. Valid HRQL assessments (n = 1200) were collected for 307 BFM and 317 DFCI patients, with costs measured for 66 BFM and 28 DFCI patients. QALYs per patient were <1.0% greater for BFM than DFCI. Median HRQL scores revealed no difference in QALYs. The difference in mean total costs for BFM (US$88 480) and DFCI (US$93 026) was not significant (P = 0.600). This study provides no evidence of superiority for one treatment strategy over the other.

12492,The 2-year cost-effectiveness of 3 options to treat lumbar spinal stenosis patients,"Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) may result from degenerative changes of the spine, which lead to neural ischemia, neurogenic claudication, and a significant decrease in quality of life. Treatments for LSS range from conservative management including epidural steroid injections (ESI) to laminectomy surgery. Treatments vary greatly in cost and success. ESI is the least costly treatment may be successful for early stages of LSS but often must be repeated frequently. Laminectomy surgery is more costly and has higher complication rates. Minimally invasive lumbar decompression (mild((R)) ) is an alternative. Using a decision-analytic model from the Medicare perspective, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing mild((R)) to ESI or laminectomy surgery.

12494,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the national Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of the national Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) over the lifetime of the 2009 US birth cohort and compare the costs and outcomes of the program to a scenario without PHBPP support. PHBPP''s goals are to ensure all infants born to hepatitis B (HepB) surface antigen-positive women receive timely postexposure prophylaxis, complete HepB vaccine series, and obtain serologic testing after series completion. METHODS: A decision analytic tree and a long-term Markov model represented the risk of perinatal and childhood infections under different prevention alternatives, and the long-term health and economic consequences of HepB infection. Outcome measures were the number of perinatal infections and childhood infections from infants born to HepB surface antigen-positive women, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost per QALY gained. The health outcomes and total costs of each strategy were compared incrementally. Costs were evaluated from the health care system perspective and expressed in US dollars at a 2010 price base. RESULTS: In all analyses, the PHBPP increased QALYs and led to higher reductions in the number of perinatal and childhood infections than no PHBPP, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $2602 per QALY. In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness ratio was robust to variations in model inputs, and there were instances where the program was both more effective and cost saving.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of 80-year-old patients with newly diagnosed neovascular macular degeneration. METHODS: Using a mathematical model with a 20-year time horizon, we compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of treating a hypothetical cohort of 80-year-old patients with newly diagnosed neovascular macular degeneration using monthly bevacizumab, as-needed bevacizumab, monthly ranibizumab, or as-needed ranibizumab. Data came from the Comparison of Age-related macular degeneration Treatment Trial (CATT), the Medicare Fee Schedule, and the medical literature.

12499,Cost-effectiveness of Tdap vaccination of adults aged >/=65 years in the prevention of pertussis in the US: a dynamic model of disease transmission,"OBJECTIVES: In February 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) advised that all adults aged >/=65 years receive a single dose of reduced-antigen-content tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), expanding on a 2010 recommendation for adults >65 that was limited to those with close contact with infants. We evaluated clinical and economic outcomes of adding Tdap booster of adults aged >/=65 to ""baseline"" practice [full-strength DTaP administered from 2 months to 4-6 years, and one dose of Tdap at 11-64 years replacing decennial Td booster], using a dynamic model. METHODS: We constructed a population-level disease transmission model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of supplementing baseline practice by vaccinating 10% of eligible adults aged >/=65 with Tdap replacing the decennial Td booster. US population effects, including indirect benefits accrued by unvaccinated persons, were estimated during a 1-year period after disease incidence reached a new steady state, with consequences of deaths and long-term pertussis sequelae projected over remaining lifetimes. Model outputs include: cases by severity, encephalopathy, deaths, costs (of vaccination and pertussis care) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with each strategy. Results in terms of incremental cost/QALY gained are presented from payer and societal perspectives. Sensitivity analyses vary key parameters within plausible ranges. RESULTS: For the US population, the intervention is expected to prevent >97,000 cases (>4,000 severe and >5,000 among infants) of pertussis annually at steady state. Additional vaccination costs are $4.7 million. Net cost savings, including vaccination costs, are $47.7 million (societal perspective) and $44.8 million (payer perspective). From both perspectives, the intervention strategy is dominant (less costly, and more effective by >3,000 QALYs) versus baseline. Results are robust to sensitivity analyses and alternative scenarios.

12500,Cost-effectiveness of endovascular versus open repair of acute complicated type B aortic dissections,"OBJECTIVE: This study weighed the cost and benefit of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) vs open repair (OR) in the treatment of an acute complicated type B aortic dissection by (TBAD) estimating the cost-effectiveness to determine an optimal treatment strategy based on the best currently available evidence. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the health system payer was performed using a decision analytic model. Within this model, the 1-year survival, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients with an acute complicated TBAD managed with TEVAR or OR were evaluated. Clinical effectiveness data, cost data, and transitional probabilities of different health states were derived from previously published high-quality studies or meta-analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on uncertain model parameters. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed, in terms of QALYs, that OR appeared to be more expensive (incremental cost of euro17,252.60) and less effective (-0.19 QALYs) compared with TEVAR; hence, in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, OR was dominated by TEVAR. As a result, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ie, the cost per life-year saved) was not calculated. The average cost-effectiveness ratio of TEVAR and OR per QALY gained was euro56,316.79 and euro108,421.91, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, TEVAR was economically dominant in 100% of cases. The probability that TEVAR was economically attractive at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro50,000/QALY gained was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that TEVAR yielded more QALYs and was associated with lower 1-year costs compared with OR in patients with an acute complicated TBAD. As a result, from the cost-effectiveness point of view, TEVAR is the dominant therapy over OR for this disease under the predefined conditions.",2014-01-14999,24418638,J Vasc Surg,Thomas Luebke,2014,59 / 5,1247-55,No,24418638,"Thomas Luebke; Jan Brunkwall; Cost-effectiveness of endovascular versus open repair of acute complicated type B aortic dissections, J Vasc Surg, ; 59(5):0741-5214; 1247-55",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prosthetic graft interposition open repair vs. T horacic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,3.00,3.00,-90803.16,Euro,2012,-131619.91
