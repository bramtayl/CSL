12001,"Economic analysis of bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)","OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor. A sub-study confirmed its effectiveness in KRAS wild-type patients. Recent evidence has shown clinical benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor treatments cetuximab and panitumumab in these patients. The cost-effectiveness, to the Canadian healthcare system, of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (FBC) in combination with bevacizumab, cetuximab, or panitumumab was assessed for first-line treatment of KRAS wild-type mCRC patients. METHODS: A Markov model was developed and calibrated to progression-free/overall survival, using separately reported trial survival and adverse event results for each comparator. Health-state resource utilization was derived from published data and oncologist input. Utilities and unit prices were obtained from published literature and standard Canadian sources. RESULTS: Results per patient are over a lifetime horizon, to a maximum of 10 years, with 5% annual discounting. Comparators are ordered by total cost and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each is determined against the previous non-dominated therapy. Compared to FBC alone, bevacizumab + FBC has an ICER of $131,600 per QALY gained. Compared to bevacizumab + FBC, panitumumab + FBC is dominated and cetuximab + FBC has an ICER of $3.8 million per QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, bevacizumab + FBC had approximately 100%, approximately 100%, and 98.9% probabilities of being more cost-effective than both of the other combination treatments at thresholds of $50,000/QALY, $100,000/QALY, and $200,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSION: For first-line treatment of KRAS-WT mCRC, bevacizumab + FBC is associated with substantially lower costs as compared to panitumumab + FBC or cetuximab + FBC. Key limitations were that survival curves and adverse event rates were taken from separate clinical trials and that an indirect comparison was not included.

12004,Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with peginterferon-alfa-2a versus peginterferon-alfa-2b for patients with chronic hepatitis C under the public payer perspective in Brazil,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C affects approximately 170 million people worldwide, and thus being one of the main causes of chronic liver disease. About 20% of patients with chronic hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis over 20 years, and present an increased risk of developing hepatic complications. Sustained virological response (SVR) is associated with a better prognosis compared to untreated patients and treatment failures.The objective of this analysis was to compare treatment costs and outcomes of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a versus pegylated interferon-alfa-2b, both associated with ribavirin, in the therapeutic scheme of 24 weeks and 48 week for hepatitis C genotypes 2/3 and genotype 1, respectively, under the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) scenario. METHODS: To project disease progression, a Markov model was built based on clinical stages of chronic disease. A Delphi panel was conducted to evaluate medical resources related to each stage, followed by costing of related materials, services, procedures and pharmaceutical products. The evaluation was made from a public payer perspective. The source used for costing was government reimbursement procedures list (SAI/SIH-SUS). Drug acquisition costs were obtained from the Brazilian Official Gazette and ""Banco de Precos em Saude"" (government official source). It was assumed a mean patient weight of 70 kg. Costs were reported in 2011 Brazilian Reais (US$1 approximately $Brz1.80). A systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of the 7 identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared pegylated interferons, was conducted for obtaining relative efficacy of both drugs: for genotype 2/3, mean rate of SVR was 79.2% for peginterferon-alfa-2a and 73.8% for peginterferon-alfa-2b. For genotype 1, SVR mean rate was 42.09% versus 33.44% (peginterferon-alfa-2a and peginterferon-alfa-2b respectively). Time horizon considered was lifetime. Discount rate for costs and outcomes was 5%, according to Brazilian guidelines for Health Technology Assessment (HTA). RESULTS: Analysis showed that peginterferon-alfa-2a is a dominant therapy compared to peginterferon-alfa-2b for genotype 1 ($Brz 4,345 savings and 0.10 LY/0.25 QALY gains) as well for genotype 2/3 ($Brz 8,001 savings and 0.16 LY/0.39 QALY gains). Projections indicated that for each 1000 patients treated with peginterferon-alfa-2a instead of peginterferon-alfa-2b, the amount of resources saved would be of $Brz 4.3 million for genotypes 2/3 and up to $Brz 8 million for genotype 1.

12006,The cost-effectiveness of supervised exercise for the treatment of intermittent claudication,"BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise (SE) is thought to result in improvements in walking distance and quality of life compared with unsupervised exercise (USE) in people with intermittent claudication. However, the cost-effectiveness of SE is unclear. As a result, many patients are currently unable to access supervised programmes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Cinahl databases to identify randomised controlled trials comparing USE with SE in adults with intermittent claudication. A Markov model was developed to estimate costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) from an NHS and personal social services perspective. Quality of life was obtained from the included clinical trials. Resource use was modelled on current programmes and unit costs were based on published sources. RESULTS: Depending on estimated rates of compliance, SE was cost-effective in over 75% of model simulations, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound711 to pound1,608 per QALY gained. The model was sensitive to long-term effects of exercise on cardiovascular risk and quality of life.

12008,Cost effectiveness of proton therapy compared with photon therapy in the management of pediatric medulloblastoma,"BACKGROUND: Proton therapy has been a hotly contested issue in both scientific publications and lay media. Proponents cite the modality''s ability to spare healthy tissue, but critics claim the benefit gained from its use does not validate its cost compared with photon therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of proton therapy versus photon therapy in the management of pediatric medulloblastoma. METHODS: A cost-effective analysis was performed from the societal perspective using a Monte Carlo simulation model. A population of pediatric medulloblastoma survivors aged 18 years was studied who had received treatment at age 5 years and who were at risk of developing 10 adverse events, such as growth hormone deficiency, coronary artery disease, ototoxicity, secondary malignant neoplasm, and death. Costing data included the cost of investment and the costs of diagnosis and management of adverse health states from institutional and Medicare data. Longitudinal outcomes data and recent modeling studies informed risk parameters for the model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to measure outcomes. RESULTS: Results from the base case demonstrated that proton therapy was associated with higher quality-adjusted life years and lower costs; therefore, it dominated photon therapy. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, proton therapy remained the more attractive strategy, either dominating photon therapy or having a very low cost per quality-adjust life year gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis illustrated the domination of proton therapy over photon therapy in 96.4% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: By using current risk estimates and data on required capital investments, the current study indicated that proton therapy is a cost-effective strategy for the management of pediatric patients with medulloblastoma compared with standard of care photon therapy.",2013-01-14483,24105630,Cancer,Raymond B Mailhot Vega,2013,119 / 24,4299-307,No,24105630,"Raymond B Mailhot Vega; Jane Kim; Marc Bussiere; Jona Hattangadi; Abby Hollander; Jeff Michalski; Nancy J Tarbell; Torunn Yock; Shannon M MacDonald; Cost effectiveness of proton therapy compared with photon therapy in the management of pediatric medulloblastoma, Cancer, ; 119(24):0008-543X; 4299-307",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Proton therapy vs. Photon therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-9415.92,United States,2011,-10833.8
12009,A lesson in business: cost-effectiveness analysis of a novel financial incentive intervention for increasing physical activity in the workplace,"BACKGROUND: Recently both the UK and US governments have advocated the use of financial incentives to encourage healthier lifestyle choices but evidence for the cost-effectiveness of such interventions is lacking. Our aim was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of a quasi-experimental trial, exploring the use of financial incentives to increase employee physical activity levels, from a healthcare and employer''s perspective. METHODS: Employees used a ''loyalty card'' to objectively monitor their physical activity at work over 12 weeks. The Incentive Group (n=199) collected points and received rewards for minutes of physical activity completed. The No Incentive Group (n=207) self-monitored their physical activity only. Quality of life (QOL) and absenteeism were assessed at baseline and 6 months follow-up. QOL scores were also converted into productivity estimates using a validated algorithm. The additional costs of the Incentive Group were divided by the additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) or productivity gained to calculate incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) and population expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was used to characterize and value the uncertainty in our estimates. RESULTS: The Incentive Group performed more physical activity over 12 weeks and by 6 months had achieved greater gains in QOL and productivity, although these mean differences were not statistically significant. The ICERs were pound2,900/QALY and pound2,700 per percentage increase in overall employee productivity. Whilst the confidence intervals surrounding these ICERs were wide, CEACs showed a high chance of the intervention being cost-effective at low willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: The Physical Activity Loyalty card (PAL) scheme is potentially cost-effective from both a healthcare and employer''s perspective but further research is warranted to reduce uncertainty in our results. It is based on a sustainable ""business model"" which should become more cost-effective as it is delivered to more participants and can be adapted to suit other health behaviors and settings.

12010,Vemurafenib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma: a NICE single technology appraisal,"Vemurafenib is an oral BRAF inhibitor licenced for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600-mutation positive malignant melanoma. The manufacturer of vemurafenib, Roche Products Limited, was invited by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to submit evidence of the drug''s clinical- and cost-effectiveness for its licenced indication, to inform the Institute''s Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this appraisal. This article summarises the ERG''s review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and also includes a summary of the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) decision. The ERG reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The ERG''s analysis of the submitted economic model assessed the appropriateness of the approach taken by the manufacturer in modelling the decision problem. It also included an assessment of the reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to impact substantially on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. The clinical evidence was derived from BRIM 3 (BRAF Inhibitor in Melanoma 3), a well-designed, multi-centre, multi-national, phase III, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Clinical outcome results from the October 2011 data cut showed that median overall survival for patients treated with vemurafenib was 13.2 months compared with 9.6 months for those treated with dacarbazine. The ERG''s main concern with the trial was the potential for confounding because of the early introduction of the crossover from the comparator drug to vemurafenib or another BRAF inhibitor. The submitted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was considered above the NICE threshold, even when end-of-life criteria were taken into account. The ERG questioned the submitted economic model on a number of grounds, particularly the approach used to project trial results. After the ERG had made appropriate corrections to the model and employed an alternative form of projective modelling, the ICER per quality-adjusted life year more than doubled. Additional evidence was submitted by the manufacturer for consideration at a second AC meeting and at their third meeting the AC concluded that vemurafenib could be recommended as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma.",2013-01-14498,24114739,Pharmacoeconomics,Sophie Beale,2013,31 / 12,1121-9,Yes,24114739,"Sophie Beale; Rumona Dickson; Adrian Bagust; Michaela Blundell; Yenal Dundar; Angela Boland; Ernie Marshall; Ruth Plummer; Chris Proudlove; Vemurafenib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma: a NICE single technology appraisal, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 31(12):1179-2027; 1121-9",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vemurafenib vs. dacarbazine,locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,56410,United Kingdom,2010,103361.26
12011,Can donors with high donor risk indices be used cost-effectively in liver transplantation in US Transplant Centers?,"In an effort to quantify the impact of donor risk factors on recipient outcomes, the donor risk index (DRI) was developed. A high DRI correlates with poorer post-transplant survival. In this study, high-DRI donors are classified as those having DRIs >2.0, while low-DRI donors have DRIs <2.0. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of high-DRI donor use in US Transplant Centers. A Markov-based decision analytic model was created to simulate outcomes for an allocation scheme using only low-DRI donors versus a scheme using both low- and high-DRI donors. Baseline values and ranges were determined from published data and Medicare cost data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test model strength and parameter variability. An allocation scheme in which only low-DRI donors were used generated 5.2 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of $83 000/QALY.

12012,Pharmacoeconomic analysis of the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon alfa-2a or peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in Spain,"BACKGROUND: An independent meta-analysis of randomized comparative trials of peginterferons alfa-2a and alfa-2b, both combined with ribavirin, analyzed the probability of achieving a sustained virological response (SVR). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon alfa-2a (180mug/week) plus ribavirin (800-1200mg/day) vs. alfa-2b (1.5mug/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800-1400mg/day), from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. METHODS: A Markov model was developed with 7 health states to simulate lifetime disease progression. SVR was calculated from the meta-analysis data. Transition probabilities and health state utilities were obtained from published literature. Direct healthcare costs were obtained from the drug catalog, while costs of disease-related complications were obtained from published studies and healthcare cost database. Costs were expressed in 2010euro. The annual discount rate applied was 3.5% for both costs and benefits. RESULTS: SVR rate for treatment with alfa-2a was higher than with alfa-2b; the differences were 6.0%, 7.6% and 8.7% for all genotypes, genotypes 1/4 and genotypes 2/3, respectively. Each patient would gain 0.469, 0.600 and 0.685 life-years and 0.155, 0.198 and 0.227 quality-adjusted life-years with alfa-2a vs. alfa-2b, for the respective genotypes. The cost saving per patient treated with alfa-2a would be euro705, euro672 and euro1900, for all genotypes and for genotypes 1/4 and 2/3, respectively, alfa-2a being dominant.

12013,Cost-utility of ranolazine for the symptomatic treatment of patients with chronic angina pectoris in Spain,"BACKGROUND: Ranolazine is an antianginal agent that was approved in the EU in 2008 as an add-on therapy for symptomatic chronic angina pectoris treatment in patients who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, first-line antianginal therapies. These patients'' quality of life is significantly affected by more frequent angina events, which increase the risk of revascularization. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility of ranolazine versus placebo as an add-on therapy for the symptomatic treatment of patients with chronic angina pectoris in Spain. METHODS: A decision tree model with 1-year time horizon was designed. Transition probabilities and utility values for different angina frequencies were obtained from the literature. Costs were obtained from Spanish official DRGs for patients with chronic angina pectoris. We calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio of using ranolazine compared with a placebo. Sensitivity analyses, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, were performed. Acceptability curves and expected value of perfect information were calculated. RESULTS: The incremental cost-utility ratio was euro8,455 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) per patient in Spain. Sensitivity analyses showed that if the decision makers'' willingness to pay is euro15,000 per QALY, the treatment with ranolazine will be cost effective at a 95 % level of confidence. The incremental cost-utility ratio is particularly sensitive to changes in utility values of those non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate angina frequency.

12014,Economic evaluation of initial antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients: an update of Italian guidelines,"INTRODUCTION: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has allowed many HIV-infected patients to enjoy longer survival and a better quality of life. We performed an economic analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HAART regimens in Italy for managing HIV-naive infected patients with a viral load below 100,000 copies/mL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The population considered in the model consisted of adult subjects with an HIV viral load below 100,000 copies/mL who received antiretroviral HAART treatment for the first time, according to the Italian National Guidelines with recommendation grade A1. The incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was carried out by means of a Markov model. Both the outcomes (QALYs) and the costs were discounted by 3.5%. The time horizon adopted in the model was 10 years. The point of view of the analysis was that of the Italian national health service. RESULTS: The tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/rilpivirine (RPV) single-tablet regimen (STR) (euro7,417.00) revealed the lowest mean treatment cost. TDF/FTC + raltegravir (RAL) showed a better quality of life (0.906 QALY/year), followed by TDF/FTC/RPV (STR; 0.900 QALY/year), TDF/FTC + RPV (multipill regimen) (0.889 QALY/year), and TDF/FTC + atazanavir (ATV/r) (0.886 QALY/year).

12022,Medicare long-term CPAP coverage policy: a cost-utility analysis,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: CPAP is an effective treatment for OSA that may reduce health care utilization and costs. Medicare currently reimburses the costs of long-term CPAP therapy only if the patient is adherent during a 90-day trial. If not, Medicare requires a repeat polysomnogram (PSG) and another trial which seems empirically not cost-effective. We modeled the cost-effectiveness of current Medicare policy compared to an alternative policy (clinic-only) without the adherence criterion and repeat PSG. DESIGN: Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: U.S. Medicare Population. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: N/A. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We created a decision tree modeling (1) clinic only follow-up vs. (2) current Medicare policy. Costs were assigned based on Medicare reimbursement rates in 2012. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test our assumptions. We estimated cumulative costs, overall adherence, and QALY gained for a 5-year time horizon from the perspective of Medicare as the payer. Current Medicare policy is more costly than the clinic-only policy but has higher net adherence and improved utility. Current Medicare policy compared to clinic-only policy costs $30,544 more per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Current CMS policy promotes early identification of those more likely to adhere to CPAP therapy by requiring strict adherence standards. The policy effect is to deny coverage to those unlikely to use CPAP long-term and prevent wasted resources. Future studies are needed to measure long-term adherence in an elderly population with and without current adherence requirements to verify the cost-effectiveness of a policy change.",2013-01-14515,24127146,J Clin Sleep Med,Martha E Billings,2013,9 / 10,1023-9,No,24127146,"Martha E Billings; Vishesh K Kapur; Medicare long-term CPAP coverage policy: a cost-utility analysis, J Clin Sleep Med, ; 9(10):1550-9389; 1023-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) coverage with only clinic visits and not a repeat polysomnogram (PSG) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Current Medicare's CPAP policy with repeat polysomnogram (PSG),Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,30544,United States,2012,34430.88
12023,Cost-effectiveness of newer antiretroviral drugs in treatment-experienced patients with multidrug-resistant HIV disease,"OBJECTIVE: Newer antiretroviral drugs provide substantial benefits but are expensive. The cost-effectiveness of using antiretroviral drugs in combination for patients with multidrug-resistant HIV disease was determined. DESIGN: A cohort state-transition model was built representing treatment-experienced patients with low CD4 counts, high viral load levels, and multidrug-resistant virus. The effectiveness of newer drugs (those approved in 2005 or later) was estimated from published randomized trials. Other parameters were estimated from a randomized trial and from the literature. The model had a lifetime time horizon and used the perspective of an ideal insurer in the United States. The interventions were combination antiretroviral therapy, consisting of 2 newer drugs and 1 conventional drug, compared with 3 conventional drugs. Outcome measures were life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Substituting newer antiretroviral drugs increased expected survival by 3.9 years in advanced HIV disease. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of newer, compared with conventional, antiretroviral drugs was $75,556/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that substituting only one newer antiretroviral drug cost $54,559 to $68,732/QALY, depending on assumptions about efficacy. Substituting 3 newer drugs cost $105,956 to $117,477/QALY. Cost-effectiveness ratios were higher if conventional drugs were not discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: In treatment-experienced patients with advanced HIV disease, use of newer antiretroviral agents can be cost-effective, given a cost-effectiveness threshold in the range of $50,000 to $75,000 per QALY gained. Newer antiretroviral agents should be used in carefully selected patients for whom less expensive options are clearly inferior.",2013-01-14519,24129369,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Ahmed M Bayoumi,2013,64 / 4,382-91,No,24129369,"Ahmed M Bayoumi; Paul G Barnett; Vilija R Joyce; Susan C Griffin; Huiying Sun; Nick J Bansback; Mark Holodniy; Gillian Sanders; Sheldon T Brown; Tassos C Kyriakides; Brian Angus; D William Cameron; Aslam H Anis; Mark Sculpher; Douglas K Owens; Cost-effectiveness of newer antiretroviral drugs in treatment-experienced patients with multidrug-resistant HIV disease, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, ; 64(4):1525-4135; 382-91",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Newer antiretroviral drugs in treatment-experienced patients vs. Standard/Usual Care- conventional antiretroviral drugs,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,75556,United States,2011,86933.45
12024,Incretin therapy for type 2 diabetes in Spain: a cost-effectiveness analysis of liraglutide versus sitagliptin,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, which target the incretin axis, has the potential to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients without the weight gain associated with traditional therapies. To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of incretin therapies, the present study aimed to compare the long-term clinical and cost implications associated with liraglutide and sitagliptin in type 2 diabetes patients in Spain. METHODS: Data were taken from a randomized, controlled trial (NCT00700817) in which adults with type 2 diabetes failing metformin monotherapy were randomly allocated to receive either liraglutide 1.2 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg daily in addition to metformin. Long-term projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2012 EUR) based on observed treatment effects were made using a published and validated type 2 diabetes model. Costs were taken from published sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Liraglutide was associated with improved discounted life expectancy (14.05 versus 13.91 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy [9.04 versus 8.87 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] compared to sitagliptin. Improved clinical outcomes were driven by improved glycemic control, leading to reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications, including renal disease, cardiovascular disease, ophthalmic and diabetic foot complications. Liraglutide was associated with increased direct costs of EUR 2,297, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 13,266 per QALY gained versus sitagliptin. CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide was projected to improve life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and reduce incidence of diabetes-related complication. Liraglutide is likely to be cost-effective versus sitagliptin from a healthcare payer perspective in Spain.",2013-01-14524,24132613,Diabetes Ther,Pedro Mezquita Raya,2013,4 / 2,417-30,No,24132613,"Pedro Mezquita Raya; Antonio Perez; Antonio Ramirez de Arellano; Teresa Briones; Barnaby Hunt; William J Valentine; Incretin therapy for type 2 diabetes in Spain: a cost-effectiveness analysis of liraglutide versus sitagliptin, Diabetes Ther, ; 4(2):1869-6953; 417-30",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Liraglutide vs. sitagliptin,Not Stated,80 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,13266,Euro,2012,19229.17
12025,Cost-effectiveness of alternative thresholds of the fasting plasma glucose test to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention in adults aged >/=45 years,"OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative fasting plasma glucose (FPG) thresholds to identify adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes for diabetes preventive intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a validated simulation model to examine the change in lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and medical costs when the FPG threshold was progressively lowered in 5-mg/dL decrements from 120 to 90 mg/dL. The study sample includes nondiabetic adults aged >/=45 years in the United States using 2006-2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. High-risk individuals were assumed to receive a lifestyle intervention, as that used in the Diabetes Prevention Program. We calculated cost per QALY by dividing the incremental cost by incremental QALY when lowering the threshold to the next consecutive level. Medical costs were assessed from a health care system perspective. We conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results using different simulation scenarios and parameters. RESULTS: Progressively lowering the FPG threshold would monotonically increase QALYs, cost, and cost per QALY. Reducing (in 5-mg/dL decrements) the threshold from 120 to 90 mg/dL cost $30,100, $32,900, $42,300, $60,700, $81,800, and $115,800 per QALY gained, respectively. The costs per QALY gained were lower for all thresholds under a lower-cost and less-effective intervention scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Lowering the FPG threshold leads to a greater health benefit of diabetes prevention but reduces the cost-effectiveness. Using the conventional benchmark of $50,000 per QALY, a threshold of 105 mg/dL or higher would be cost effective. A lower threshold could be selected if the intervention cost could be lowered.",2013-01-14527,24135386,Diabetes Care,Xiaohui Zhuo,2013,36 / 12,3992-8,No,24135386,"Xiaohui Zhuo; Ping Zhang; Henry S Kahn; Edward W Gregg; Cost-effectiveness of alternative thresholds of the fasting plasma glucose test to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention in adults aged >/=45 years, Diabetes Care, ; 36(12):0149-5992; 3992-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Decreasing threshold of fasting plasma glucose to 115 (mg/dL) to identify target population vs. Threshold of fasting plasma glucose= 120 (mg/dL),Not Stated,Not Stated,46 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,30100,United States,2012,33930.38
12026,Cost utility analysis of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty provides satisfactory outcomes, but its cost-effectiveness is unproven. We prospectively analyzed outcomes and costs for primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: Thirty serial patients (16 women and 14 men; mean age, 74.1 years [range, 61.1-87.3 years]) with rotator cuff arthropathy had active motion recorded and completed function tests (visual pain analog scale; Simple Shoulder Test; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Outcome score; EuroQol; and Short Form-36 Health Survey) preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 and 2 years. Costs included professional fees, operating room and supply costs, and hospital care. Changes were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and quality-adjusted life-years were calculated preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed the study. Clinical and functional outcomes demonstrated significant improvement (P < .05). Significantly improved (P < .05) Short Form-36 subgroups included physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, vitality, and physical composite score. EuroQol dimensions of usual activities and pain/discomfort improved significantly (P < .05). Calculations with the SF-6D showed that median QALYs improved from 6.56 preoperatively to 7.43 at 1-year follow-up (P <.09) and from 6.56 preoperatively to 7.58 at 2-year follow-up (P <.003). The increase in QALYs calculated from the EQ-5D was somewhat greater, changing from 6.21 preoperatively to 7.69 at 1-year follow-up (P <.0001) and from 6.13 to 8.10 at 2-year follow-up (P <.04). Mean cost was $21,536. Cost utility at 2 years was $26,920/quality-adjusted life-year by the Short Form 6 Dimensions and $16,747/quality-adjusted life-year by the EuroQol.

12027,Two-year and lifetime cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the treatment of head-and neck-cancer (HNC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used a Markov model to simulate radiation therapy-induced xerostomia and dysphagia in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old HNC patients. Model input parameters were derived from PARSPORT (CRUK/03/005) patient-level trial data and quality-of-life and Medicare cost data from published literature. We calculated average incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the US health care perspective as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and compared our ICERs with current cost-effectiveness standards whereby treatment comparators less than $50,000 per QALY gained are considered cost-effective. RESULTS: In the first 2 years after initial treatment, IMRT is not cost-effective compared with 3D-CRT, given an average ICER of $101,100 per QALY gained. However, over 15 years (remaining lifetime on the basis of average life expectancy of a 65-year-old), IMRT is more cost-effective at $34,523 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Although HNC patients receiving IMRT will likely experience reduced xerostomia and dysphagia symptoms, the small quality-of-life benefit associated with IMRT is not cost-effective in the short term but may be cost-effective over a patient''s lifetime, assuming benefits persist over time and patients are healthy and likely to live for a sustained period.

12028,Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: a U.S. perspective,"INTRODUCTION: Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that is noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). Whether rivaroxaban is cost-effective in the prevention of recurrent VTE, however, is not known. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To assess the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE, we built a Markov state-transition model over a 10-year time horizon. The base case analysis consisted of a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old patients with an initial VTE who received secondary prophylaxis with either rivaroxaban or warfarin for 3 to 12months. Cost estimates were derived from the Healthcare and Utilization Project and other sources. Probabilities were based on literature values. Outcomes included costs in 2011 United States dollars, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over 10years from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Compared with warfarin, the rivaroxaban strategy cost less ($3,195 vs. $6,188) and was more effective (9.29 QALYs vs 9.14 QALYs). Our results were highly robust in sensitivity analyses. Warfarin was no longer dominated by rivaroxaban when the risk of major bleeding with rivaroxaban exceeds 3.8% (base case estimate: 0.96%). CONCLUSION: In summary, prophylactic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban appears to be a cost effective, and perhaps cost saving, alternative to warfarin for the prevention of recurrent VTE.",2013-01-14539,24139508,Thromb Res,Craig D Seaman,2013,132 / 6,647-51,No,24139508,"Craig D Seaman; Kenneth J Smith; Margaret V Ragni; Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: a U.S. perspective, Thromb Res, ; 132(6):1879-2472; 647-51",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban for prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism vs. warfarin,Not Stated,60 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-19953.33,United States,2011,-22957.97
12029,Evaluation of the cost-utility of insulin degludec vs insulin glargine in Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the annual cost-utility of insulin degludec compared with glargine in patients with: type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes receiving basal-only therapy (T2D-BOT), and type 2 diabetes receiving basal-bolus therapy (T2B-BB) in Sweden. METHODS: A cost-utility model was programmed in Microsoft Excel to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes. The clinical trials were designed as treat-to-target, with insulin doses adjusted in order to achieve similar glycemic control between treatments, thus long-term modeling is not meaningful. Basal and bolus insulin doses, incidence of hypoglycemic events, frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose, and possibility for flexibility in timing of dose administration were specified for each insulin in three diabetes populations, based on data collected in Swedish patients with diabetes and a meta-analysis of clinical trials with degludec. Using these characteristics, the model estimated costs from a societal perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the two scenarios. RESULTS: Use of degludec was associated with a QALY gain compared with glargine in T1D (0.31 vs 0.26 QALYs), T2D-BOT (0.76 vs 0.69 QALYs), and T2D-BB (0.56 vs 0.47 QALYs), driven by reduced incidence of hypoglycemia and possibility for flexibility around timing of dose administration. Therapy regimens containing degludec were associated with increased costs compared to glargine-based regimens, driven by the increased pharmacy cost of basal insulin, but partially offset by other cost savings. Based on estimates of cost and clinical outcomes, degludec was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of SEK 19,766 per QALY gained, SEK 10,082 per QALY gained, and SEK 36,074 per QALY gained in T1D, T2-BOT, and T2-BB, respectively. LIMITATIONS: The hypoglycemic event rates in the base case analysis were derived from a questionnaire-based study that relied on patient interpretation and recall of hypoglycemic symptoms. The relative rates of hypoglycemia with degludec compared to glargine were derived from a meta-analysis of phase III trials, which may not reflect the relative rates observed in real-world clinical practice. Both of these key limitations were explored in one-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Based on reduced incidence of hypoglycemia and possibility for flexibility around timing of dose administration, use of degludec is likely to be cost-effective compared to glargine from a societal perspective in T1D, T2-BOT, and T2-BB in Sweden over a 1-year time horizon.",2013-01-14553,24147661,J Med Econ,A Ericsson,2013,16 / 12,1442-52,Yes,24147661,"A Ericsson; R F Pollock; B Hunt; W J Valentine; Evaluation of the cost-utility of insulin degludec vs insulin glargine in Sweden, J Med Econ, ; 16(12):1369-6998; 1442-52",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine,receiving basal-only therapy (T2D-BOT) for diabetes type 1 and basal-bolus therapy (T2B-BB) for 2 diabetes type 2,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,19766,Sweden,2012,3292.4
12030,Cost-effectiveness of administering 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in addition to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to adults with immunocompromising conditions,"BACKGROUND: In June, 2012 a single dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was added to the recommendation for immunocompromised adults who were previously recommended to receive only 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). PCV13 may be more effective, though it covers fewer disease-causing strains. OBJECTIVE: We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding one dose of PCV13 to the pre-2012 recommendation of PPSV23 for adults with 4 immunocompromising conditions who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease: HIV/AIDS, hematologic cancer, solid organ transplants, and end stage renal disease. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model following a single cohort of 302,397 immunocompromised adults. We used vaccination coverage and disease incidence data specific to each immunocompromising condition. Assumptions about PPSV23 and PCV13 vaccine effectiveness were based on two randomized controlled trials and several observational studies conducted among HIV-infected adults. Because no such studies have been conducted among other immunocompromised populations, we made further assumptions about the relative vaccine effectiveness in those groups. Cost-effectiveness ratios were determined for each condition and for all 4 groups in total. RESULTS: Our model indicated that adding one dose of PCV13 to adults in the United States with 4 immunocompromising conditions would cost $16 million (in 2009$) but provide off-setting savings of $21 million per cohort from the societal perspective. These savings come largely from decreased medical costs among adults with end stage renal disease. This dose of PCV13 would prevent 57 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, 619 cases of hospitalized all-cause pneumonia, avert 93 deaths, and save 1360 quality adjusted life years per cohort.

12033,Cost-effectiveness of administering 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in addition to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to adults with immunocompromising conditions,"BACKGROUND: In June, 2012 a single dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was added to the recommendation for immunocompromised adults who were previously recommended to receive only 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). PCV13 may be more effective, though it covers fewer disease-causing strains. OBJECTIVE: We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding one dose of PCV13 to the pre-2012 recommendation of PPSV23 for adults with 4 immunocompromising conditions who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease: HIV/AIDS, hematologic cancer, solid organ transplants, and end stage renal disease. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model following a single cohort of 302,397 immunocompromised adults. We used vaccination coverage and disease incidence data specific to each immunocompromising condition. Assumptions about PPSV23 and PCV13 vaccine effectiveness were based on two randomized controlled trials and several observational studies conducted among HIV-infected adults. Because no such studies have been conducted among other immunocompromised populations, we made further assumptions about the relative vaccine effectiveness in those groups. Cost-effectiveness ratios were determined for each condition and for all 4 groups in total. RESULTS: Our model indicated that adding one dose of PCV13 to adults in the United States with 4 immunocompromising conditions would cost $16 million (in 2009$) but provide off-setting savings of $21 million per cohort from the societal perspective. These savings come largely from decreased medical costs among adults with end stage renal disease.

12035,RSV vaccine in development: assessing the potential cost-effectiveness in the Dutch elderly population,"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity, mortality and health-care utilization in the elderly population. A theoretical model was built to assess the levels of vaccine effectiveness and vaccine costs for which a hypothetical RSV-vaccine for Dutch elderly could be cost-effective. METHODS: Different vaccination strategies were evaluated by changing the levels of vaccine effectiveness and the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY). Outcome measures included direct medical costs, QALYs, life years gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and the maximum total vaccination costs per individual (i.e. (vaccine price+administration costs)xnr of doses) while remaining cost-effective. RESULTS: Using base-case assumptions, it was estimated that vaccination of all persons 60 years and older would prevent 3402GP visits, 2989 antibiotic prescriptions, 535 hospitalizations and 249 deaths and would cost euro73,261 per QALY, for a vaccine effectiveness of 70%. Vaccinating only the high risk population of 60 years and older would reduce the estimates to 2042GP visits, 2009 antibiotic prescriptions, 179 hospitalizations and 209 deaths and this reduced the cost per QALY to euro34,796 per QALY. Using the same assumptions, the maximum total vaccination costs per individual ranged from euro26 when vaccinating all persons 60 and older to euro68 when vaccinating only persons aged 85 and above, using a willingness to pay threshold of euro50,000 per QALY. For the high risk population aged 60 years and older the estimated maximum total vaccination costs ranged from euro52 to euro99. CONCLUSION: Vaccination of Dutch elderly against RSV was found cost-effective for several scenarios. As expected, vaccination is more likely to be cost-effective when only including persons who are at increased risk for contracting RSV or the potential complications of RSV.

METHODS: A partitioned survival analysis model with 3 health states (alive, pre-progression; alive, post-progression; dead) was developed to estimate direct and indirect costs and quality-adjusted life years (qalys) with lapatinib-letrozole, letrozole, anastrozole, or trastuzumab-anastrozole as first-line treatment. Clinical inputs for lapatinib-letrozole and letrozole were taken from the EGF30008 trial (NCT00073528). Clinical inputs for anastrozole and trastuzumab-anastrozole were taken from a network meta-analysis of published studies. Drug costs were obtained from the manufacturer''s price list, the Quebec list of medications, and imsBrogan. Other costs were taken from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan''s Schedule of Benefits and Fees and published studies. A 10-year time horizon was used. Costs and qalys were discounted at 5% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effects of changes in model parameters. RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life years gained with lapatinib-letrozole were 0.236 compared with trastuzumab-anastrozole, 0.440 compared with letrozole, and 0.568 compared with anastrozole.

METHODS: Between January 2006 and July 2011, we treated 47 patients with an isolated fracture and 18 patients with a dislocation of the sternum surgically. In case of sternal fracture, the titanium plate was used in 30 (64%), steel plate in 12 (25%), and steel wire in 5 patients (11%). The stabilization after traumatic luxation was obtained with steel wire in 4 patients (22%) and titanium plate associated with demineralized bone matrix in 14 patients (78%). The quality adjusted life years (QALYs) was analyzed, as well as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on QALYs. RESULTS: In the sternal fractures, titanium plate showed a decreased time of intervention (30 [2] minutes), length of stay (3 [1] days), and total cost (&OV0556;2,277.10) compared with steel plate (&OV0556;2,667.70) and steel wire (&OV0556;2,801.60) procedures, displaying an excellent difference in QALYs (0.825 and 1.615, respectively).

The quality adjusted life years (QALYs) was analyzed, as well as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on QALYs. RESULTS: In the sternal fractures, titanium plate showed a decreased time of intervention (30 [2] minutes), length of stay (3 [1] days), and total cost (&OV0556;2,277.10) compared with steel plate (&OV0556;2,667.70) and steel wire (&OV0556;2,801.60) procedures, displaying an excellent difference in QALYs (0.825 and 1.615, respectively). In the sternal dislocation, steel wire technique highlighted a poor QALYs, although this approach was less expensive than titanium plate with demineralized bone matrix (&OV0556;3,553.60 vs. &OV0556;6,047.80). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio revealed that the titanium plate costs were &OV0556;623.55 more than the steel wire per QALYs gained. CONCLUSION: The rigid titanium plate application ensured a safe and easy management of traumatic sternal lesions with a good prognosis of patients, justified by the improved QALYs compared with other methods.

12044,The cost-effectiveness of using payment to increase living donor kidneys for transplantation,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: For eligible candidates, transplantation is considered the optimal treatment compared with dialysis for patients with ESRD. The growing number of patients with ESRD requires new strategies to increase the pool of potential donors. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using decision analysis modeling, this study compared a strategy of paying living kidney donors to waitlisted recipients on dialysis with the current organ donation system. In the base case estimate, this study assumed that the number of donors would increase by 5% with a payment of $10,000. Quality of life estimates, resource use, and costs (2010 Canadian dollars) were based on the best available published data. RESULTS: Compared with the current organ donation system, a strategy of increasing the number of kidneys for transplantation by 5% by paying living donors $10,000 has an incremental cost-savings of $340 and a gain of 0.11 quality-adjusted life years. Increasing the number of kidneys for transplantation by 10% and 20% would translate into incremental cost-savings of $1640 and $4030 and incremental quality-adjusted life years gain of 0.21 and 0.39, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the impact is uncertain, this model suggests that a strategy of paying living donors to increase the number of kidneys available for transplantation could be cost-effective, even with a transplant rate increase of only 5%. Future work needs to examine the feasibility, legal policy, ethics, and public perception of a strategy to pay living donors.",2013-01-14573,24158797,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,Lianne Barnieh,2013,8 / 12,2165-73,No,24158797,"Lianne Barnieh; John S Gill; Scott Klarenbach; Braden J Manns; The cost-effectiveness of using payment to increase living donor kidneys for transplantation, Clin J Am Soc Nephrol, ; 8(12):1555-905X; 2165-73",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Third-party remuneration of 10,000 to living kidney donors, increasing the number of kidney transplantation by 5% vs. Standard/Usual Care- Current organ donation system",patients on dialysis waitlisted for a kidney transplant,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-3090.91,Canada,2010,-3563.68
12045,Cost effectiveness of a manual based coping strategy programme in promoting the mental health of family carers of people with dementia (the START (STrAtegies for RelaTives) study): a pragmatic randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the START (STrAtegies for RelatTives) intervention added to treatment as usual is cost effective compared with usual treatment alone. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis nested within a pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Three mental health and one neurological outpatient dementia service in London and Essex, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Family carers of people with dementia. INTERVENTION: Eight session, manual based, coping intervention delivered by supervised psychology graduates to family carers of people with dementia added to usual treatment, compared with usual treatment alone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs measured from a health and social care perspective were analysed alongside the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score (HADS-T) of affective symptoms and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in cost effectiveness analyses over eight months from baseline. RESULTS: Of the 260 participants recruited to the study, 173 were randomised to the START intervention, and 87 to usual treatment alone. Mean HADS-T scores were lower in the intervention group than the usual treatment group over the 8 month evaluation period (mean difference -1.79 (95% CI -3.32 to -0.33)), indicating better outcomes associated with the START intervention. There was a small improvement in health related quality of life as measured by QALYs (0.03 (-0.01 to 0.08)). Costs were no different between the intervention and usual treatment groups ( pound252 (-28 to 565) higher for START group). The cost effectiveness calculations suggested that START had a greater than 99% chance of being cost effective compared with usual treatment alone at a willingness to pay threshold of pound30,000 per QALY gained, and a high probability of cost effectiveness on the HADS-T measure. CONCLUSIONS: The manual based coping intervention START, when added to treatment as usual, was cost effective compared with treatment as usual alone by reference to both outcome measures (affective symptoms for family carers, and carer based QALYs).

12046,Cost-effectiveness analysis of telemonitoring versus usual care in patients with heart failure: the TEHAF-study,"We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring (TM) versus usual care (UC) in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In one university and two general hospitals, 382 patients were randomised to usual care or telemonitoring and followed for 1 year. Hospital-related and home costs were estimated, based on resource use multiplied by the appropriate unit prices. Effectiveness was expressed as QALYs gained. Information was gathered, using 3 monthly costs diaries and questionnaires. The mean age of the patients was 71 years (range 32-93), 59% were male and 64% lived with a partner. Health related quality of life improved by 0.07 points for the usual care and 0.1 points for the telemonitoring group, but the difference between groups was not significant. There were no significant differences in annual costs per patient between groups. At a threshold of euro50,000 the probability of telemonitoring being cost-effective was 48%. The cost effectiveness analysis showed a high level of decision uncertainty, probably caused by the divergence between the participating institutions.

12047,Cost-effectiveness of a helpline for suicide prevention,"We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of a suicide helpline in Belgium, consisting of a telephone- and a chat service. An age- and gender-dependent Markov model with a ten-year time horizon and a one-year cycle length was developed, assuming a societal perspective, to predict cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the helpline users. The model included six transition states: the initial state (at risk), first attempt, re-attempt, follow-up, suicide and death from other causes. Data on the effect of the helpline and costs associated with model states were obtained from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to capture uncertainty. In addition, the budget impact of the helpline was analysed. Over ten years, the telephone- as well as the chat service could avoid about 36% of suicides and attempts in this high-risk population. In males, 0.063 QALYs (95% confidence interval, CI 0.030-0.097) and 0.035 QALYs (95%CI -0.026-0.096) were gained by users of the telephone- and chat service respectively.

12051,Cost-effectiveness of a national exercise referral programme for primary care patients in Wales: results of a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: A recent HTA review concluded that there was a need for RCTs of exercise referral schemes (ERS) for people with a medical diagnosis who might benefit from exercise. Overall, there is still uncertainty as to the cost-effectiveness of ERS. Evaluation of public health interventions places challenges on conventional health economics approaches. This economic evaluation of a national public health intervention addresses this issue of where ERS may be most cost effective through subgroup analysis, particularly important at a time of financial constraint. METHOD: This economic analysis included 798 individuals aged 16 and over (55% of the randomised controlled trial (RCT) sample) with coronary heart disease risk factors and/or mild to moderate anxiety, depression or stress. Individuals were referred by health professionals in a primary care setting to a 16 week national exercise referral scheme (NERS) delivered by qualified exercise professionals in local leisure centres in Wales, UK. Health-related quality of life, health care services use, costs per participant in NERS, and willingness to pay for NERS were measured at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The base case analysis assumed a participation cost of pound385 per person per year, with a mean difference in QALYs between the two groups of 0.027. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound12,111 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated an 89% probability of NERS being cost-effective at a payer threshold of pound30,000 per QALY. When participant payments of pound1 and pound2 per session were considered, the cost per QALY fell from pound12,111 (base case) to pound10,926 and pound9,741, respectively. Participants with a mental health risk factor alone or in combination with a risk of chronic heart disease generated a lower ICER ( pound10,276) compared to participants at risk of chronic heart disease only ( pound13,060).

METHOD: This economic analysis included 798 individuals aged 16 and over (55% of the randomised controlled trial (RCT) sample) with coronary heart disease risk factors and/or mild to moderate anxiety, depression or stress. Individuals were referred by health professionals in a primary care setting to a 16 week national exercise referral scheme (NERS) delivered by qualified exercise professionals in local leisure centres in Wales, UK. Health-related quality of life, health care services use, costs per participant in NERS, and willingness to pay for NERS were measured at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The base case analysis assumed a participation cost of pound385 per person per year, with a mean difference in QALYs between the two groups of 0.027. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound12,111 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated an 89% probability of NERS being cost-effective at a payer threshold of pound30,000 per QALY. When participant payments of pound1 and pound2 per session were considered, the cost per QALY fell from pound12,111 (base case) to pound10,926 and pound9,741, respectively. Participants with a mental health risk factor alone or in combination with a risk of chronic heart disease generated a lower ICER ( pound10,276) compared to participants at risk of chronic heart disease only ( pound13,060). CONCLUSIONS: Results of cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that NERS is cost saving in fully adherent participants. Though full adherence to NERS (62%) was higher for the economics sample than the main sample (44%), results still suggest that NERS can be cost-effective in Wales with respect to existing payer thresholds particularly for participants with mental health and CHD risk factors.

12059,Cost-effectiveness of test phase implantation strategies for InterStim(R) sacral neuromodulation,"OBJECTIVE: Sacral neuromodulation with InterStim can be performed with staged implants or peripheral nerve evaluation followed by a combined stage I/II procedure. In both, unilateral or bilateral leads can be placed for the testing phase. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of these strategies in patients with refractory overactive bladder. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model compared 6 strategies, namely, unilateral and bilateral testing for both stage I and peripheral nerve evaluation, combined stage I/II, and no treatment. Costs were derived from a societal perspective using Medicare physician fee schedules and published studies. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assigned using utility values. Results were reported using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Model robustness was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Monte Carlo analysis sampled statistical distributions for each variable to examine the effects of varying all values simultaneously. RESULTS: No InterStim treatment was the least expensive but also the least effective option. Unilateral and bilateral stage I were the only cost-effective options with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $3533 and $7600, respectively. Because bilateral stage I was more effective, it is preferred. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed bilateral stage I was most likely to be cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds greater than $6000 per QALY. At lower thresholds, no treatment was more economically acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral and unilateral stage I lead placement were the only cost-effective strategies.

12061,Comparing five alternative methods of breast reconstruction surgery: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of five standardized procedures for breast reconstruction to delineate the best reconstructive approach in postmastectomy patients in the settings of nonirradiated and irradiated chest walls. METHODS: A decision tree was used to model five breast reconstruction procedures from the provider perspective to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Procedures included autologous flaps with pedicled tissue, autologous flaps with free tissue, latissimus dorsi flaps with breast implants, expanders with implant exchange, and immediate implant placement. All methods were compared with a ""do-nothing"" alternative. Data for model parameters were collected through a systematic review, and patient health utilities were calculated from an ad hoc survey of reconstructive surgeons. Results were measured in cost (2011 U.S. dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year. Univariate sensitivity analyses and Bayesian multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Pedicled autologous tissue and free autologous tissue reconstruction were cost-effective compared with the do-nothing alternative. Pedicled autologous tissue was the slightly more cost-effective of the two. The other procedures were not found to be cost-effective. The results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses, although the margin between pedicled and free autologous tissue reconstruction is small and affected by some parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous pedicled tissue was slightly more cost-effective than free tissue reconstruction in irradiated and nonirradiated patients. Implant-based techniques were not cost-effective.

12071,Cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab and ranibizumab for newly diagnosed neovascular macular degeneration (an American Ophthalmological Society thesis),"PURPOSE: To determine the most cost-effective treatment for patients with newly diagnosed neovascular macular degeneration: monthly or as-needed bevacizumab injections, or monthly or as-needed ranibizumab injections. METHODS: Using a Markov model with a 20-year time horizon, we compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of treating a hypothetical cohort of 80-year-old patients with newly diagnosed neovascular macular degeneration using monthly bevacizumab, as-needed bevacizumab, monthly ranibizumab, or as-needed ranibizumab. Data came from the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatment Trial (CATT), the Medicare Fee Schedules, and the medical literature. RESULTS: Compared with as-needed bevacizumab, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of monthly bevacizumab is $242,357 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Monthly ranibizumab gains an additional 0.02 QALYs vs monthly bevacizumab at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of more than $10 million per QALY. As-needed ranibizumab was dominated by monthly bevacizumab. In sensitivity analyses assuming a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY, the annual risk of serious vascular events would have to be at least 2.5 times higher with bevacizumab than that observed in the CATT trial for as-needed ranibizumab to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <$100,000 per QALY. In another sensitivity analysis, even if every patient receiving bevacizumab experienced declining vision by one category (eg, from 20/25-20/40 to 20/50-20/80) after 2 years but all patients receiving ranibizumab retained their vision level, as-needed ranibizumab would have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $97,340 per QALY.

12074,Cost-effectiveness and cost utility analysis of three pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children of Peru,"BACKGROUND: The clinical and economic burden associated with invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) diseases is substantial in the Latin America and Caribbean region, where pneumococcal vaccines have only been introduced to a few countries. This study analyzed the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of three different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) for Peru. METHODS: A Markov model that simulated the disease processes in a birth cohort over a lifetime, within 1,128 month cycles was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal NTHi protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and 7- and 13-valent PCVs (PCV-7 and PCV-13). Expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost-savings and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Without vaccination, pneumonia was associated with the greatest health economic burden (90% of QALYs lost and 63% of lifetime direct medical costs); while acute otitis media (AOM) was responsible for 1% of QALYs lost and 25% of direct medical costs. All vaccines were predicted to be cost-effective for Peru, with PHiD-CV being most cost-effective. PHiD-CV was predicted to generate 50 more QALYs gained and required a reduced investment (-US$ 3.4 million) versus PCV-13 (discounted data), and was therefore dominant and cost saving. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that PHiD-CV generated more QALYs gained at a reduced cost than PCV-13 in 84% of the simulations and less QALYs gains at a reduced cost in 16%. Additional scenarios using different assumptions on vaccine efficacies based on previous evidence were explored, but no significant change in the overall cost-effective results were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this modeling study predict that PCVs are likely to be a cost-effective strategy to help relieve the epidemiological and economic burden associated with pediatric pneumococcal and NTHi diseases for Peru. PHiD-CV is likely to be a dominant (better health gains at a reduced net cost) intervention compared to PCV-13 or PCV-7.

The most significant drivers for these results are the better health and economic profile of PHiD-CV against AOM and its reduced cost per dose available through the PAHO Revolving Fund in the LAC region.",2013-01-14601,24171921,BMC Public Health,Jorge Alberto Gomez,2013,13 /,1025,No,24171921,"Jorge Alberto Gomez; Juan Carlos Tirado; Aldo Amador Navarro Rojas; Maria Mercedes Castrejon Alba; Oleksandr Topachevskyi; Cost-effectiveness and cost utility analysis of three pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children of Peru, BMC Public Health, ; 13():1471-2458; 1025",QALY,Peru,Not Stated,Not Stated,13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vs. 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,Newborn cohort in Peru (2007),18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,1823.3,United States,2009,2199.58
12078,Cost-effectiveness and cost utility analysis of three pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children of Peru,"BACKGROUND: The clinical and economic burden associated with invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) diseases is substantial in the Latin America and Caribbean region, where pneumococcal vaccines have only been introduced to a few countries. This study analyzed the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of three different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) for Peru. METHODS: A Markov model that simulated the disease processes in a birth cohort over a lifetime, within 1,128 month cycles was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal NTHi protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and 7- and 13-valent PCVs (PCV-7 and PCV-13). Expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost-savings and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Without vaccination, pneumonia was associated with the greatest health economic burden (90% of QALYs lost and 63% of lifetime direct medical costs); while acute otitis media (AOM) was responsible for 1% of QALYs lost and 25% of direct medical costs. All vaccines were predicted to be cost-effective for Peru, with PHiD-CV being most cost-effective. PHiD-CV was predicted to generate 50 more QALYs gained and required a reduced investment (-US$ 3.4 million) versus PCV-13 (discounted data), and was therefore dominant and cost saving. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that PHiD-CV generated more QALYs gained at a reduced cost than PCV-13 in 84% of the simulations and less QALYs gains at a reduced cost in 16%. Additional scenarios using different assumptions on vaccine efficacies based on previous evidence were explored, but no significant change in the overall cost-effective results were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this modeling study predict that PCVs are likely to be a cost-effective strategy to help relieve the epidemiological and economic burden associated with pediatric pneumococcal and NTHi diseases for Peru. PHiD-CV is likely to be a dominant (better health gains at a reduced net cost) intervention compared to PCV-13 or PCV-7.

12079,Cost-effectiveness of nonmelanoma skin cancer screening in Crohn's disease patients,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, with the greatest risk in patients with Crohn''s disease (CD). We investigated the cost-effectiveness of NMSC screening in patients with CD. METHODS: A mathematical model was used to compare lifetime costs, life expectancies, and benefits of NMSC screening in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients with CD. Strategies studied include: (1) Treat NMSC cases as they present and follow affected patients annually; (2) Screen patients with CD annually once they turn 50 years old, treat NMSC cases as they present and follow affected patients annually; (3) Screen patients with CD annually once they start receiving thiopurines, treat NMSC cases as they present and follow affected patients annually; (4) Screen patients with CD annually when they turn 50 years old or start receiving thiopurines, treat NMSC cases as they present, and follow affected patients annually; (5) Screen all patients with CD annually. These strategies were then studied on a biennial basis, accounting for 10 competing strategies. RESULTS: Screening all patients with CD annually proved the most cost-effective strategy with an average lifetime cost of more than $333,000, a quality-adjusted life expectancy of about 26 QALYs (95% confidence interval: 22-29), ICER of $3263/QALY, and led to early detection of about 94% of incident NMSC cases. The next best strategy was screening all CD patients biennially with an average lifetime cost of more than $328,000 with 24.5 QALYs (95% confidence interval: 21-25).

12081,Challenges with cost-utility analyses of behavioural interventions among older adults at risk for dementia,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is one of the most prominent healthcare issues of the 21st century. Within the context of combating cognitive decline through behavioural interventions, physical activity is a promising approach. There is a dearth of health economic data in the area of behavioural interventions for dementia prevention. Yet, economic evaluations are essential for providing information to policy makers for resource allocation. It is essential we first address population and intervention-specific methodological challenges prior to building a larger evidence base. We use a cost-utility analysis conducted alongside the exercise for cognition and everyday living (EXCEL) study to illustrate methodological challenges specific to assessing the cost-effectiveness of behavioural interventions aimed at older adults at risk of cognitive decline. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis conducted concurrently with a 6-month, three-arm randomised controlled trial (ie, the EXCEL study) was used as an example to identify and discuss methodological challenges. RESULTS: Both the aerobic training and resistance training interventions were less costly than twice weekly balance and tone classes. In critically evaluating the economic evaluation of the EXCEL study we identified four category-specific challenges: (1) analysing costs; (2) assessing quality-adjusted life-years; (3) Incomplete data; and (4) ''Intervention'' activities of the control group.

12083,Cost-effectiveness of a 12-dose regimen for treating latent tuberculous infection in the United States,"SETTING: A large randomized controlled trial recently showed that for treating latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) in persons at high risk of progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease, a 12-dose regimen of weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) administered as directly observed treatment (DOT) can be as effective as 9 months of daily self-administered isoniazid (9H). OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 3HP compared to 9H. DESIGN: A computational model was designed to simulate individuals with LTBI treated with 9H or 3HP. Costs and health outcomes were estimated to determine the incremental costs per active TB case prevented and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by 3HP compared to 9H. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, treatment of LTBI with 3HP rather than 9H resulted in 5.2 fewer cases of TB and 25 fewer lost QALYs per 1000 individuals treated. From the health system and societal perspectives, 3HP would cost respectively US$21,525 and $4294 more per TB case prevented, and respectively $4565 and $911 more per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: 3HP may be a cost-effective alternative to 9H, particularly if the cost of rifapentine decreases, the effectiveness of 3HP can be maintained without DOT, and 3HP treatment is limited to those with a high risk of progression to TB disease.",2013-01-14643,24200264,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,D Shepardson,2013,17 / 12,1531-7,No,24200264,"D Shepardson; S M Marks; H Chesson; A Kerrigan; D P Holland; N Scott; X Tian; A S Borisov; N Shang; C M Heilig; T R Sterling; M E Villarino; W R Mac Kenzie; Cost-effectiveness of a 12-dose regimen for treating latent tuberculous infection in the United States, Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, ; 17(12):1027-3719; 1531-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"12-dose combination regiment of weekly rifapentine (RPT) plus isoniazid (INH; 900mg each, 3HP) administered as directly observed treatment (DOT) vs. Standard/Usual Care- 9 month-regimen of daily isoniazid (300mg) self-administered",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,911,United States,2010,1081.27
12084,Cost-effectiveness of modified-release prednisone in the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with morning stiffness based on directly elicited public preference values,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the cost-effectiveness of treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is of growing importance due to the chronic nature of the disease, rising treatment costs, and budget-constrained health care systems. This analysis assesses the cost-effectiveness of modified-release (MR) prednisone compared with immediate-release (IR) prednisone for the treatment of morning stiffness due to RA. METHODS: A health state transition model was used to categorize RA patients into four health states, defined by duration of morning stiffness. The model applied a 1-year time horizon and adopted a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Health benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the final output was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Efficacy data were derived from the CAPRA-1 (Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis) study, drug costs from the British National Formulary (BNF), and utility data from a direct elicitation time-trade-off (TTO) study in the general population. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Mean treatment costs per patient were higher for MR-prednisone ( pound649.70) than for IR-prednisone ( pound46.54) for the duration of the model. However, the model generated an incremental QALY of 0.044 in favor of MR-prednisone which resulted in an ICER of pound13,577. Deterministic sensitivity analyses did not lead to significant changes in the ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis reported that MR-prednisone had an 84% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30,000 per QALY. The model only considers drug costs and there was a lack of comparative long-term data for IR-prednisone. Furthermore, utility benefits were not captured in the clinical setting. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates that, based on the CAPRA-1 trial and directly elicited public preference values, MR-prednisone is a cost-effective treatment option when compared with IR-prednisone for RA patients with morning stiffness over one year, according to commonly applied UK thresholds ( pound20,000- pound30,000 per QALY).

Despite this, there are no systematic programs in most immigrant-receiving countries to screen for chronic HBV infection and immigrants are not routinely offered HBV vaccination outside of the universal childhood vaccination program. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-effective analysis was performed to compare four HBV screening and vaccination strategies with no intervention in a hypothetical cohort of newly-arriving adult Canadian immigrants. The strategies considered were a) universal vaccination, b) screening for prior immunity and vaccination, c) chronic HBV screening and treatment, and d) combined screening for chronic HBV and prior immunity, treatment and vaccination.

12089,Potential gains and costs from increasing access to thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke patients in New Zealand hospitals,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Treatment of ischemic stroke patients with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is known to be effective and cost-effective, yet the percentage of patients treated with thrombolysis in hospitals remains low. The purpose of this study is to examine whether providing thrombolysis in New Zealand hospitals is currently cost-effective and to estimate the amount that might be spent on campaigns aimed at increasing thrombolysis receipt rates. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed and populated using health services data from the literature and the Auckland Regional Community Stroke Outcome Study. The cost-utilities of providing thrombolysis over one-year and patient lifetime were estimated. Using a threshold of NZ$20 000 (US$15 337) per quality-adjusted life year, the analysis identified the maximum amount that might be spent on campaigns aiming to increase rates of receipt of thrombolysis above their current levels. Monte Carlo simulations and probabilistic sensitivity analysis explored the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: Providing thrombolysis was cost-effective, especially when long-term costs and effects were considered (NZ$6641 or US$5093 per quality-adjusted life year). The results suggest that better management within hospitals would be more effective in increasing thrombolysis receipt rates (up to 17%) than campaigns aiming at higher awareness of stroke symptoms in the community. The amount that might be spent on a national campaign to increase rate of receipt of thrombolysis from its current level (3% of eligible patients) depended upon the effectiveness of the campaign, ranging from under NZ$6 million for New Zealand for an increase in rate to 30% to over $9 million for an increase in rate to 50%.

12090,Cost-effectiveness of oral anticoagulants for treatment of atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: New anticoagulants may improve health outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it is unclear whether their use is cost-effective. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov state transition was created to compare 4 therapies: dabigatran 150 mg BID, apixaban 5 mg BID, rivaroxaban 20 mg QD, and warfarin therapy. The population included those with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation who were eligible for treatment with warfarin. Compared with warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, costs were $93 063, $111 465, and $140 557 per additional quality-adjusted life year gained, respectively. At a threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year, apixaban provided the greatest absolute benefit while still being cost-effective, although warfarin would be superior if apixaban was 2% less effective than expected. Although apixaban was the optimal strategy in our base case, in probabilistic sensitivity analysis, warfarin was optimal in an equal number of iterations at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS: While at a standard cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year, apixaban seems to be the optimal anticoagulation strategy; this finding is sensitive to assumptions about its efficacy and cost.

12094,"Cost analysis of thyroid lobectomy and intraoperative frozen section versus total thyroidectomy in patients with a cytologic diagnosis of ""suspicious for papillary thyroid cancer""","BACKGROUND: The optimal operation for a patient with a thyroid nodule ""suspicious for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)"" on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is unclear. This study examines the incremental cost-utility of thyroid lobectomy with intraoperative frozen section (thyroid lobectomy) versus total thyroidectomy. METHODS: Cost-utility analysis was performed for patients with a cytologic diagnosis of ""suspicious for PTC"" on FNA. Patients underwent either initial total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy and, if needed, completion thyroidectomy. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR; US$/quality-adjusted-life-year [QALY]), was determined from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The base-case ICUR of thyroid lobectomy is $90,776/QALY, strongly favoring total thyroidectomy as a more cost-effective modality. On sensitivity analyses, the model is sensitive to the accuracy of frozen section and to the rate of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). Thyroid lobectomy is more cost-effective only if both frozen section and final pathology are benign in >/=92% of patients (ICUR $47,959/QALY at 92%). With increasing rates of unilateral (>5%) or bilateral (>2%) RLN injury associated with total thyroidectomy, there is a trend toward thyroid lobectomy being more cost effective ($53,127 and $51,325/QALY, respectively).

12095,Cost-effectiveness of everolimus for second-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Serbia,"BACKGROUND: New targeted therapeutics for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) enable an increment in progression-free survival (PFS) ranging from 2 to 6 months. Compared with best supportive care, everolimus demonstrated an additional PFS of 3 months in patients with mRCC whose disease had progressed on sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The only targeted therapy for mRCC currently reimbursed in Serbia is sunitinib. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of the introduction of everolimus in Serbia in comparison to best supportive care, for mRCC patients refractory to sunitinib. METHODS: A Markov model was designed corresponding with Serbian treatment protocols. A health care payer perspective was taken, including direct costs only. Treated and untreated cohorts were followed up over 18 cycles, each cycle lasting 8 weeks, which covered the lifetime horizon of mRCC patients refractory to the first-line treatment. Annual discounted rates of 1.5% for effectiveness and 3% for costs were applied. Transitions between health states were modeled by time-dependent probabilities extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS and overall survival (OS). Utility values were obtained from the appraisals of other mRCC treatments. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to test the robustness and uncertainty of the base-case estimate. Lastly, the potential impacts of everolimus on the overall health care expenditures on annual and 4-year bases were estimated in the budget-impact analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for everolimus was estimated at euro86,978 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analysis identified the hazard multiplier, a statistical approximator of OS gain, as the main driver of everolimus cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed a wide 95% CI around the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimate (euro32,594-euro425,258 per quality-adjusted life-year). Finally, an average annual budgetary impact of everolimus in first 4 years after its potential reimbursement would be around euro270,000, contributing to <1% of the total budget in Serbian oncology. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus as a second-line treatment of mRCC is not likely to be a cost-effective option under the present conditions in Serbia, with a relatively limited impact on its budget in oncology. A major constraint on the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of everolimus relates to the uncertainty around the everolimus effect on extending OS. However, prior to a final decision on the acceptance/rejection of everolimus, reassessment of the whole therapeutic group might be needed to construct an economically rational treatment strategy within the mRCC field.",2013-01-14695,24238790,Clin Ther,Jovan Mihajlovic,2013,35 / 12,1909-22,Yes,24238790,"Jovan Mihajlovic; Petros Pechlivanoglou; Ana Sabo; Zdenko Tomic; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness of everolimus for second-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Serbia, Clin Ther, ; 35(12):1879-114X; 1909-22",QALY,Serbia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Everolimus vs. best supportive care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 3 years",3.00,1.50,86978,Euro,2013,128339.41
12096,A model-based economic evaluation of improved primary care management of patients with type 2 diabetes in Australia,"BACKGROUND: There are few studies investigating the economic value of the Australian practice nurse workforce on the management of chronic conditions. This is particularly important in Australia, where the government needs evidence to inform decisions on whether to maintain or redirect current financial incentives that encourage practices to recruit practice nurses. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with two models of practice nurse involvement in clinical-based activities (high and low level) in the management of type 2 diabetes within the primary care setting. METHODS: A previously validated state transition model (the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model) was adapted, which uses baseline prognostic factors (e.g. gender, haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) to predict the risk of occurrence of diabetes-related complications (e.g. stroke). The model was populated by data from Australian and UK observational studies. Costs and utility values associated with complications were summed over patients'' lifetimes to estimate costs and QALY gains from the perspective of the health care system. All costs were expressed in 2011 Australian dollars (AU$). The base-case analysis assumed a 40-year time horizon with an annual discount rate of 5 %. RESULTS: Relative to low-level involvement of practice nurses in the provision of clinical-based activities, the high-level model was associated with lower mean lifetime costs of management of complications (-AU$8,738; 95 % confidence interval [CI] -AU$12,522 to -AU$4,954), and a greater average gain in QALYs (0.3; 95 % CI 0.2-0.4). A range of sensitivity analyses were performed, in which the high-level model was dominant in all cases. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the high-level model is a dominant management strategy over the low-level model in all modelled scenarios. These findings indicate the need for effective primary care-based incentives to encourage general practices not only to employ practice nurses, but to better integrate them into the provision of clinical services.",2013-01-14699,24243516,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Hossein Haji Ali Afzali,2013,11 / 6,661-70,Yes,24243516,"Hossein Haji Ali Afzali; Jodi Gray; Justin Beilby; Christine Holton; Jonathan Karnon; A model-based economic evaluation of improved primary care management of patients with type 2 diabetes in Australia, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 11(6):1179-1896; 661-70",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,High level of practice nurse involvement vs. Low level of practice nurse involvement,Not Stated,75 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,5.00,5.00,-29126.67,Australia,2011,-34626.71

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A decision-tree model compared three treatment options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients over 18 months from a societal perspective in 2012 USD. Chance nodes included baseline pain as a severity indicator, significant adverse effects (neutropenia, cardiac events, or seizures), and survival. Probabilities, survival rates, and health utilities were from clinical trials (COU-AA, TROPIC, and AFFIRM) and other published studies. Survival of enzalutamide was adjusted to match placebo groups across trials. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, acceptability curves and net benefit calculations were performed. RESULTS: Abiraterone was the most cost-effective of the treatments ($123.4 K/quality-adjusted life year) compared to placebo, enzalutamide was $437.6 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to abiraterone, and cabazitaxel was $351.9 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide and cabazitaxel were not cost-effective compared to placebo at $154.3 K/quality-adjusted life year and $163.2 K/quality-adjusted life year, respectively.

The model was sensitive to changes in cost of the drugs, life expectancy, and survival rate. Sensitivity analysis shows that enzalutamide can become the most cost-effective option if the price of the medication decreased by 26% and other drug costs remained the same.

12100,"Are lifestyle interventions in primary care cost-effective?--An analysis based on a Markov model, differences-in-differences approach and the Swedish Bjorknas study","BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions affect patients'' risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MeSy), a pre-stage to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and related complications. An effective lifestyle intervention is the Swedish Bjorknas intervention, a 3-year randomized controlled trial in primary care for MeSy patients. To include future disease-related cost and health consequences in a cost-effectiveness analysis, a simulation model was used to estimate the short-term (3-year) and long-term (lifelong) cost-effectiveness of the Bjorknas study. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A Markov micro-simulation model was used to predict the cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for MeSy-related diseases based on ten risk factors. Model inputs were levels of individual risk factors at baseline and at the third year. The model estimated short-term and long-term costs and QALYs for the intervention and control groups. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was assessed using differences-in-differences approach to compare the changes between the groups in the health care and societal perspectives, using a 3% discount rate. A 95% confidence interval (CI), based on bootstrapping, and sensitivity analyses describe the uncertainty in the estimates. In the short-term, costs are predicted to increase over time in both groups, but less in the intervention group, resulting in an average cost saving/reduction of US$-700 (in 2012, US$1=six point five seven SEK) and US$-500, in the societal and health care perspectives. The long-term estimate also predicts increased costs, but considerably less in the intervention group: US$-7,300 (95% CI: US$-19,700 to US$-1,000) in the societal, and US$-1,500 (95% CI: US$-5,400 to US$2,650) in the health care perspective. As intervention costs were US$211 per participant, the intervention would result in cost saving. Furthermore, in the long-term an estimated 0.46 QALYs (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.69) per participant would be gained.
