3801,The long-term cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator,"AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P) is an effective treatment for patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony with moderate or severe symptoms despite pharmacological therapy. The addition of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) function may further reduce the risk of sudden death. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of CRT-P compared with medical therapy (MT) alone, and the cost-effectiveness of CRT-ICD + MT compared with CRT-P + MT, on incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and life year using data from two landmark clinical trials. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation to assess costs, life years, and QALYs associated with CRT (+/- ICD) and MT in patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony, on the basis of a UK healthcare perspective was constructed. NYHA class distribution and transitions, associated health utilities, rates and cause of hospitalization and death were estimated from individual patient data from the CArdiac REsychronization in Heart Failure (CARE-HF trial). The estimated additional benefit on survival of an ICD was based on results from COMPANION. The base case analysis used 10 000 individual life-time simulations assuming a battery life of 6 years for CRT-P and 7 years for CRT-ICD. From a life-time perspective in a 65-year-old patient, the incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-P compared with MT is 7538 euros (95% CI 5325-11,784 euros) per QALY gained and 7011euros (95% CI 5346-10,003 euros) per life year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-ICD compared with CRT-P is 47,909 euros (95% CI 35,703-79,438 euros) per QALY gained, and 35,864 euros (95% CI 26,709-56,353 euros) per life year gained. CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with CRT-P appears cost-effective compared with MT alone. From a life-time perspective, assuming a reasonable life expectancy when receiving effective treatment for heart failure, CRT-ICD may also be considered cost-effective when compared with CRT-P + MT.",2007-01-02351,17110403,Eur Heart J,Guiqing Yao,2007,28 / 1,42-51,No,17110403,"Guiqing Yao; Nick Freemantle; Melanie J Calvert; Stirling Bryan; Jean-Claude Daubert; John G F Cleland; Nick Freemantle; Melanie J Calvert; Stirling Bryan; Jean-Claude Daubert; John G F Cleland; The long-term cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, Eur Heart J, 2007-Jan; 28(1):0195-668X; 42-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiac resynchronization therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (CRT+ICD) + medical therapy,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,19450,Euro,2005,32086.65

3807,Prevention of adhesion formation after radical hysterectomy using a sodium hyaluronate-carboxymethylcellulose (HA-CMC) barrier: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an adhesion prevention strategy compared to routine care, in which no adhesion prevention measures are taken, through a decision analysis model in the clinical setting of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for Stage IB cervical cancer. METHODS: A decision analysis model compared two strategies to manage the risk of adhesion-related morbidity following radical hysterectomy for Stage IB cervical cancer: (1) routine care with no adhesion prevention measures, and (2) the intervention strategy with a HA-CMC anti-adhesion barrier. The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was evaluated from the perspective of society and that of a third party payer. RESULTS: From the perspective of society, the HA-CMC strategy had an overall cost per patient of $1932 and effectiveness of 7.901 QALYs and dominated the routine care strategy, which had a cost per patient of $3043 and effectiveness of 7.805 QALYs. From the perspective of a third party payer, the HA-CMC strategy had an overall cost per patient of $1247 and effectiveness of 7.987 QALYs and dominated the routine care strategy, which had a cost per patient of $1629 and effectiveness of 7.970 QALYs.

3809,Modeling for cost-effective-adjuvant aromatase inhibitor strategies for postmenopausal women with breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: To determine cost-effective (CE) strategies comparing adjuvant upfront aromatase inhibitor (AI) with sequential tamoxifen (TAM) AI in postmenopausal (PM) women with breast cancer (BC). Design: A Markov model was constructed to calculate cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for upfront AI and TAM-AI in a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old PM women with BC. Costs, utilities and probabilities were derived from the literature. The hazard ratios (HRs) of AI strategies were applied to a baseline cancer recurrence risk (RR) to determine CE strategies at the $50,000/QALY gain threshold. A direct payer perspective is utilized, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Two-way sensitivity analyses are presented to determine CE strategies across a wide range of HRs and in different clinical scenarios including varying RRs (low, average, high and very high). TAM-AI is the preferred CE strategy at low and average RR, while upfront AI is CE at very high RR. The CE strategy in patients with high RR was dependent on the scenario examined.

3810,"Persistence, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to improve the quality of osteoporosis care after a fracture of the wrist: results of a controlled trial","INTRODUCTION: Older patients with fragility fractures are not commonly tested or treated for osteoporosis. Compared to usual care, a previously reported intervention led to 30% absolute increases in osteoporosis treatment within 6 months of wrist fracture. Our objective was to examine longer-term outcomes, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of this intervention. METHODS: We conducted an extended analysis of a non-randomized controlled trial with blinded ascertainment of outcomes that compared a multifaceted intervention to usual care controls. Patients >50 years with a wrist fracture treated in two Emergency Departments in the province of Alberta, Canada were included; those already treated for osteoporosis were excluded. Overall, 102 patients participated in this study (55 intervention and 47 controls; median age: 66 years; 78% were women). The interventions consisted of faxed physician reminders that contained osteoporosis treatment guidelines endorsed by opinion leaders and patient counseling. Controls received usual care; at 6-months post-fracture, when the original trial was completed, all controls were crossed-over to intervention. The main outcomes were rates of osteoporosis testing and treatment within 6 months (original study) and 1 year (delayed intervention) of fracture, and 1-year persistence with treatments started. From the perspective of the healthcare payer, the cost-effectiveness (using a Markov decision-analytic model) of the intervention was compared with usual care over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: Overall, 40% of the intervention patients (vs. 10% of the controls) started treatment within 6 months post-fracture, and 82% (95%CI: 67-96%) had persisted with it at 1-year post-fracture. Delaying the intervention to controls for 6 months still led to equivalent rates of bone mineral density (BMD) testing (64 vs. 60% in the original study; p = 0.72) and osteoporosis treatment (43 vs. 40%; p = 0.77) as previously reported. Compared with usual care, the intervention strategy was dominant - per patient, it led to a $13 Canadian (U.S. $9) cost savings and a gain of 0.012 quality-adjusted life years. Base-case results were most sensitive to assumptions about treatment cost; for example, a 50% increase in the price of osteoporosis medication led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $24,250 Canadian (U.S. $17,218) per quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: A pragmatic intervention directed at patients and physicians led to substantial improvements in osteoporosis treatment, even when delivered 6-months post-fracture. From the healthcare payer's perspective, the intervention appears to have led to both cost-savings and gains in life expectancy.",2007-01-02367,17086470,Osteoporos Int,S R Majumdar,2007,18 / 3,261-70,No,17086470,"S R Majumdar; J A Johnson; D A Lier; A S Russell; D A Hanley; S Blitz; I P Steiner; W P Maksymowych; D W Morrish; B R Holroyd; B H Rowe; J A Johnson; D A Lier; A S Russell; D A Hanley; S Blitz; I P Steiner; W P Maksymowych; D W Morrish; B R Holroyd; B H Rowe; Persistence, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to improve the quality of osteoporosis care after a fracture of the wrist: results of a controlled trial, Osteoporos Int, 2007-Mar; 18(3):0937-941X; 261-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Intervention consisted of physician reminders, local opinion leader endorsed treatment guidelines, and patient education",Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-1083,Canada,2004,-1141.99
3811,Home-based cardiac rehabilitation versus hospital-based rehabilitation: a cost effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Home-based cardiac rehabilitation offers an alternative to traditional, hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation. AIM: To compare the cost effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation and hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: 104 patients with an uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction and without major comorbidity were randomized to receive home-based rehabilitation (n=60) i.e. nurse facilitated, self-help package of 6 weeks' duration (the Heart Manual) or hospital-based rehabilitation for 8-10 weeks (n=44). Complete economic data were available in 80 patients (48 who received home-based rehabilitation and 32 who received hospital-based rehabilitation). Healthcare costs, patient costs, and quality of life (EQ-5D4.13) were assessed over the 9 months of the study. RESULTS: The cost of running the home-based rehabilitation programme was slightly lower than that of the hospital-based programme (mean (95% confidence interval) difference - 30 pounds sterling (- 45 pounds sterling to - 12 pounds sterling) [-44 euro, -67 euro to -18 euro] per patient. The cost difference was largely the result of reduced personnel costs. Over the 9 months of the study, no significant difference was seen between the two groups in overall healthcare costs (78 pounds sterling, - 1102 pounds sterling to 1191 pounds sterling [-115 euro, -1631 euro to -1763 euro] per patient) or quality adjusted life-years (-0.06 (-0.15 to 0.02)). The lack of significant difference between home-based rehabilitation and hospital-based rehabilitation did not alter when different costs and different methods of analysis were used. CONCLUSIONS: The health gain and total healthcare costs of the present hospital-based and home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes for patients after myocardial infarction appear to be similar.

3812,Increasing tobacco taxes: A cheap tool to increase public health,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have estimated health effects resulting from tobacco tax increases. However, studies on the cost effectiveness of tobacco taxes are scarce. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of tobacco tax increases from a health care perspective, explicitly considering medical costs in life years gained. METHODS: The effects of a tax increase were translated into effects on smoking quit rates. A dynamic population model then projected incidence, prevalence and health care costs of the major chronic diseases conditional on smoking status over time. Comparing to a current practice scenario, the differences in healthcare costs, tax revenues, life years and QALYs from a tobacco tax increase resulting in a price increase of 10% increase were estimated. RESULTS: Including effects on health care costs in life years gained, the tax increase costs about euro2500 per QALY gained. Only 3% of additional tax revenues are enough to compensate additional health care costs in life years gained. CONCLUSIONS: Even if the health care costs in life years gained are taken into account and even if additional tax revenues do not flow to the health care sector a tax increase is a cost-effective intervention to increase public health from a health care perspective.",2007-01-02392,17050031,Health Policy,Pieter H M van Baal,2007,82 / 2,142-52,No,17050031,"Pieter H M van Baal; Werner B F Brouwer; Rudolf T Hoogenveen; Talitha L Feenstra; Werner B F Brouwer; Rudolf T Hoogenveen; Talitha L Feenstra; Increasing tobacco taxes: A cheap tool to increase public health, Health Policy, 2007-Jul; 82(2):0168-8510; 142-52",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tobacco tax resulting in a price increase of 10%,Not Stated,Not Stated,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,100 Years,4.00,1.50,2500,Euro,2004,4260.37
3813,"Paternity leave in Sweden: costs, savings and health gains","OBJECTIVES: The initial objective is to examine the relationship between paternity leave in 1978-1979 and male mortality during 1981-2001, and the second objective is to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the 1974 parental insurance reform in Sweden. METHODS: Based on a population of all Swedish couples who had their first child together in 1978 (45,801 males), the risk of death for men who took paternity leave, compared with men who did not, was estimated by odds ratios. The cost-effectiveness analysis considered costs for information, administration and production losses, minus savings due to decreased sickness leave and inpatient care, compared to health gains in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: It is demonstrated that fathers who took paternity leave have a statistically significant decreased death risk of 16%. Costs minus savings (discounted values) stretch from a net cost of EUR 19 million to a net saving of EUR 11 million, and the base case cost-effectiveness is EUR 8000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that that the right to paternity leave is a desirable reform based on commonly stated public health, economic, and feminist goals.

3814,Cost-effectiveness of exemestane versus tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer after 2-3 years treatment with tamoxifen in Sweden,"Aromatase inhibitors are rapidly becoming the cornerstone of endocrine treatment for advanced disease and are now also used as adjuvant treatment in early-stage disease. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with exemestane versus tamoxifen for early-stage breast cancer after 2-3 years treatment with tamoxifen in Sweden.The results are based on findings in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES). IES was a randomized controlled trial in which postmenopausal women who had received 2-3 years of tamoxifen therapy following primary treatment of early-stage breast cancer, were randomized to either continue on tamoxifen therapy or be switched to exemestane therapy. The results showed a disease-free survival hazard ratio of exemestane relative to tamoxifen in IES of 0.69. A Markov state-transition model was developed to simulate consequences after the end of the clinical trial, and to integrate the trial data with external data on mortality, costs and quality of life specific for Swedish women.The cost per QALY gained was about euro 20,000 in the base case analysis without inclusion of consequences of coronary heart disease. Inclusion of these events increased the cost-effectiveness ratio to about euro 31,000. This means that, based on our assumption, sequential exemestane treatment in early breast cancer is a cost-effective option compared with tamoxifen alone, although more long-term data on overall survival and consequences of adverse events would be valuable to increase the validity of the analysis further.",2007-01-02399,17033927,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Jonas Lundkvist,2007,102 / 3,289-99,No,17033927,"Jonas Lundkvist; Nils Wilking; Stig Holmberg; Linus Jönsson; Nils Wilking; Stig Holmberg; Linus Jönsson; Cost-effectiveness of exemestane versus tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer after 2-3 years treatment with tamoxifen in Sweden, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2007-May; 102(3):0167-6806; 289-99",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Switch to 25 mg exemestane daily therapy after 2-3 years tamoxifen therapy,Not Stated,64 Years,64 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,20358,Euro,2005,33584.58
3815,Potential for bone turnover markers to cost-effectively identify and select post-menopausal osteopenic women at high risk of fracture for bisphosphonate therapy,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Over half of all fractures among post-menopausal women occur in those who do not have osteoporosis by bone density criteria. Measurement of bone turnover may cost-effectively identify a subset of women with T-score >-2.5 for whom anti-resorptive drug therapy is cost-effective. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for five years of oral bisphosphonate compared to no drug therapy for osteopenic post-menopausal women aged 60 to 80 years with a high (top quartile) or low (bottom 3 quartiles) level of a bone turnover marker. RESULTS: For women with high bone turnover, the cost per QALY gained with alendronate compared to no drug therapy among women aged 70 years with T-scores of -2.0 or -1.5 were $58,000 and $80,000 (U.S. 2004 dollars), respectively. If bisphosphonates therapy also reduced the risk of non-vertebral fractures by 20% among osteopenic women with high bone turnover, then the costs per QALY gained were $34,000 and $50,000 for women age 70 with high bone turnover and T-scores of -2.0 and -1.5, respectively. CONCLUSION: Measurement of bone turnover markers has the potential to identify a subset of post-menopausal women without osteoporosis by bone density criteria for whom bisphosphonate therapy to prevent fracture is cost-effective.

It is not clear whether these guidelines apply to the Japanese population with a different epidemiology of CAD. This study evaluates the applicability of the U.S. guidelines to Japan, taking account of cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was performed to measure the clinical benefit and cost of CAD screening in asymptomatic patients with diabetes and additional atherogenic risk factors. We evaluated cohorts of patients stratified by age, gender, and atherogenic risks. The incremental cost-effectiveness of not screening, exercise electrocardiography, exercise echocardiography, and exercise single-photon emission-tomography (SPECT) was calculated. The data used were obtained from the literature. Outcomes are expressed as US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Compared with not screening, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of exercise electrocardiography was $31,400/QALY for 60-year-old asymptomatic diabetic men, and 46,600 for 65-year-old women with hypertension and smoking. The ICER of exercise echocardiography was $31,500/QALY and of SPECT was $326,000/QALY, compared with the next dominant strategy.

3831,Individual fracture risk and the cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates in patients using oral glucocorticoids,"OBJECTIVES: There are few data on the cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates with oral glucocorticoids (GCs). An individual patient-based pharmaco-economic model was developed. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cohort of oral GC users aged 40+ (n = 190 000) in the UK General Practice Research Database. Individualized fracture and mortality risks were calculated specific for age, sex, daily and cumulative GC dose, indication and other clinical risk factors. UK costs of medication and direct costs of fracture were obtained from National Institute for Clinical Excellence and used to estimate costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and fracture prevented for bisphosphonates in patients treated for 5 yrs with GCs. RESULTS: With the use of 5 mg GCs daily, the cost per one QALY gained with bisphosphonates was 41k UK pounds (95% confidence intervals 22-72k) in women aged <60 [men 40k pounds (29-54k)], 17k pounds (13-24k) in women aged 60-79 [men 43k pounds (31-60k)], 5k pounds(3-6k) in women aged 80+ [men 35k pounds (25-46k)]. With 15 mg GC, these figures were 17k pounds (14-21k), 13k pounds (10-16k) and 15k pounds (9-26k) in women and 22k pounds (17-26k), 34 pounds (23-53k) and 33k pounds (27-42k) in men, respectively. When stratifying by overall fracture risk and life expectancy at the start of GC therapy, cost per QALY increased with decreasing life expectancy. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had comparatively better cost-effectiveness, given higher fracture risk and better life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates varied substantially.

UK costs of medication and direct costs of fracture were obtained from National Institute for Clinical Excellence and used to estimate costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and fracture prevented for bisphosphonates in patients treated for 5 yrs with GCs. RESULTS: With the use of 5 mg GCs daily, the cost per one QALY gained with bisphosphonates was 41k UK pounds (95% confidence intervals 22-72k) in women aged <60 [men 40k pounds (29-54k)], 17k pounds (13-24k) in women aged 60-79 [men 43k pounds (31-60k)], 5k pounds(3-6k) in women aged 80+ [men 35k pounds (25-46k)]. With 15 mg GC, these figures were 17k pounds (14-21k), 13k pounds (10-16k) and 15k pounds (9-26k) in women and 22k pounds (17-26k), 34 pounds (23-53k) and 33k pounds (27-42k) in men, respectively. When stratifying by overall fracture risk and life expectancy at the start of GC therapy, cost per QALY increased with decreasing life expectancy. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had comparatively better cost-effectiveness, given higher fracture risk and better life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates varied substantially. Bisphosphonates can be considered cost-effective in patients with higher fracture risks, such as elderly patients (with a life expectancy over 5 yrs), and younger patients with a fracture history, low body mass index, rheumatoid arthritis or using high GC doses.",2007-01-02500,16899499,Rheumatology (Oxford),T P van Staa,2007,46 / 3,460-6,No,16899499,"T P van Staa; P Geusens; B Zhang; H G M Leufkens; A Boonen; C Cooper; P Geusens; B Zhang; H G M Leufkens; A Boonen; C Cooper; Individual fracture risk and the cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates in patients using oral glucocorticoids, Rheumatology (Oxford), 2007-Mar; 46(3):1462-0324; 460-6",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,5 mg biphosphonates in addition to oral glucocorticoids,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,6 Years,6.00,1.50,23000,United Kingdom,2004,57761.82
3835,Cost-utility of adjuvant hormone therapies for breast cancer in post-menopausal women: sequential tamoxifen-exemestane and upfront anastrozole,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant Anastrozole (ANA) for 5 years and Tamoxifen followed by Exemestane (TAM-EXE) for 2.5 years each have become acceptable alternatives to 5 years of Tamoxifen (TAM) for post-menopausal women with breast cancer. As these newer options are associated with higher drug costs as well as improved outcomes, an economic evaluation was undertaken to compare the cost-utility of ANA and TAM-EXE relative to TAM alone and to each other in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to calculate monthly costs and outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of post-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Baseline rates of cancer recurrence and adverse effects with TAM, and hazard ratios associated with ANA and EXE, were derived from the ATAC and IES trials. Patients received hormonal therapy for 5 years and benefit was modeled to persist 5 years beyond treatment. The analysis took a direct payer perspective with a 20-year time horizon. Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3%. Costs are in 2005 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: ANA and TAM-EXE were associated with increased costs and QALYs, though the cost-utility of both relative to TAM alone was strongly favourable (<$50,000/QALY). Based on an indirect comparison of ANA and TAM-EXE, using TAM alone as a common comparator, the cost-utility of ANA relative to TAM-EXE appears unfavourable.

3838,The cost effectiveness of behavioural graded activity in patients with osteoarthritis of hip and/or knee,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether exercise treatment based on behavioural graded activity comprising booster sessions is a cost-effective treatment for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee compared with usual care. METHODS: An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was carried out alongside a randomised trial involving 200 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee. Outcome measures were pain, physical functioning, self-perceived change and quality of life, assessed at baseline, 13, 39 and 65 weeks. Costs were measured using cost diaries for the entire follow-up period of 65 weeks. Cost and effect differences were estimated using multilevel analysis. Uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness ratios was estimated by bootstrapping and graphically represented on cost-effectiveness planes. RESULTS: 97 patients received behavioural graded activity, and 103 patients received usual care. At 65 weeks, no differences were found between the two groups in improvement with respect to baseline on any of the outcome measures. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference in total costs between the groups was -euro773 (-euro2360 to euro772)--that is, behavioural graded activity resulted in less cost but this difference was non-significant. As effect differences were small, a large incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 51,385 per quality adjusted life year was found for graded activity versus usual care. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence that behavioural graded activity is either more effective or less costly than usual care. Yielding similar results to usual care, behavioural graded activity seems an acceptable method for treating patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee.",2007-01-02513,16880195,Ann Rheum Dis,Veerle M H Coupé,2007,66 / 2,215-21,No,16880195,"Veerle M H Coupé; Cindy Veenhof; Maurits W van Tulder; Joost Dekker; Johannes W J Bijlsma; Cornelia H M Van den Ende; Cindy Veenhof; Maurits W van Tulder; Joost Dekker; Johannes W J Bijlsma; Cornelia H M Van den Ende; The cost effectiveness of behavioural graded activity in patients with osteoarthritis of hip and/or knee, Ann Rheum Dis, 2007-Feb; 66(2):0003-4967; 215-21",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Behavioral graded therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,65 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,51385,Euro,2003,81821.93
3839,"The cost-effectiveness of radon-proof membranes in new homes: a case study from Brixworth, Northamptonshire, UK","Installing radon-proof membranes in new homes can reduce the exposure of those living in the properties to the radiation caused by a build up of radon gas. This paper considers whether doing so is cost-effective for a group of new houses constructed in the village of Brixworth, Northamptonshire, UK. The measure of cost-effectiveness used is cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Brixworth is situated in a high-radon area of the UK. As a result, all properties built there must comply with building regulations that require installation of membranes. When compared with a number of medical interventions and a well-established threshold value for cost-effectiveness, the use of membranes in new properties in the village is shown to be cost-effective. This result also pertains when adjustment is made for a number of assumptions adopted in estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research to establish whether or not the use of membranes in new properties in other areas would be cost-effective.",2007-01-02534,16854498,Health Policy,Thomas Coskeran,2007,81 / 2-3,195-206,No,16854498,"Thomas Coskeran; Antony Denman; Paul Phillips; Roger Tornberg; Antony Denman; Paul Phillips; Roger Tornberg; The cost-effectiveness of radon-proof membranes in new homes: a case study from Brixworth, Northamptonshire, UK, Health Policy, 2007-May; 81(2-3):0168-8510; 195-206",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Installation of radon-proof membranes in newly constructed houses,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,Not Stated,3.00,6182,United Kingdom,2004,15525.37
3840,Cost-effectiveness of letrozole in the extended adjuvant treatment of women with early breast cancer,"Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for 5 years reduces recurrence in hormone receptor positive, post-menopausal women with early breast cancer, but offers no advantage when prolonged to another 5 years, during which the risk of recurrence remains high. Treating patients, who remain disease-free after 5 years of tamoxifen, with letrozole significantly reduces recurrence, regardless of nodal status. This study evaluated the life-time cost-utility of extended adjuvant letrozole therapy in 62-year-old patients from a third-party payer perspective. A Markov model incorporated locoregional, contralateral, and metastatic recurrences. The comparator was placebo. Event rates were based on published trials. Utility values were taken from a clinical trial and published literature. Costs were obtained from published literature, provincial payment schedules, cancer agencies, and drug plans formularies. Resource use reflected Canadian treatment patterns. Robustness of the model was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Extended adjuvant letrozole therapy of a cohort consisting of 50% node-negative and 50% node-positive patients prolonged their lives on average by 0.466 years or 0.267 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an additional cost of Can$8,031 per patient, yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $34,058 per QALY. Letrozole was more cost-effective in node-positive than in node-negative patients (Can$26,553 vs Can$46,049 per QALY). Results were robust to variations in age, healthcare costs, and utilities. The degree of confidence that the cost per QALY would be below Can$50,000 reached 100% for node-positive and 77% for node-negative patients.

The aim of this study is to perform a cost-utility analysis of surgical and nonsurgical treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniation. Ninety-two individuals in a cohort of 1,146 Swedish subjects underwent lumbar disc herniation surgery during a 2-year study. Each person operated on was individually matched with one treated conservatively. The effects and costs of the treatments were determined individually. By estimating quality of life before and after the treatment, the number of quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained with and without surgery was calculated. The medical costs were much higher for surgical treatment; however, the total costs, including disability costs, were lower among those treated surgically. Surgery meant fewer recurrences and less permanent disability benefits. The gain in QALY was ten times higher among those operated. Lower total costs and better utility resulted in a better cost utility for surgical treatment. Surgery for lumbar disc herniation was cost-effective. The total costs for surgery were lower due to lower recurrence rates and fewer disability benefits, and surgery improved quality of life much more than nonsurgical treatments.",2007-01-02675,16683121,Eur Spine J,Elisabeth Hansson,2007,16 / 3,329-37,No,16683121,"Elisabeth Hansson; Tommy Hansson; Tommy Hansson; The cost-utility of lumbar disc herniation surgery, Eur Spine J, 2007-Mar; 16(3):0940-6719; 329-37",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgical treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,5.00,Not Stated,-4648.32,Sweden,2005,-827.18

The role of RFA is still being defined; however, if long-term survival proves to be promising, then this study lends support to the conduct of randomized controlled trials in the future.",2007-01-02881,18333112,HPB (Oxford),Andrew McKay,2007,9 / 1,42-51,No,18333112,"Andrew McKay; Trish Kutnikoff; Mark Taylor; A cost-utility analysis of treatments for malignant liver tumours: a pilot project, HPB (Oxford), 2007; 9(1):1365-182X; 42-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Resection,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,6974,Canada,2001,6582.62
3847,ISSLS prize winner: cost-effectiveness of two forms of circumferential lumbar fusion: a prospective randomized controlled trial,"STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a prospective, randomized controlled trial from a secondary care National Health Service (NHS) perspective. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of titanium cages (TC) compared with femoral ring allografts (FRA) in circumferential lumbar spinal fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A randomized controlled trial has shown the use of TC to be clinically inferior to the established practice of using FRA in circumferential lumbar fusion. Health economic evaluation is urgently needed to justify the continued use of TC, given that this treatment is less effective and, all things being equal, is assumed more costly than FRA. METHODS: Eighty-three patients were randomly allocated to receive either the TC or FRA as part of a circumferential lumbar fusion between 1998 and 2002. NHS costs related to the surgery and revision surgery needed during the trial period were monitored and adjusted to the base year (2005-2006 Pounds Sterling). The Short Form-6D (SF-6D) was administered before surgery and at 6, 12 and 24 months in order to elicit patient utility and subsequently Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for the trial period. Return to paid employment was also monitored. Bootstrapped mean differences in discounted costs and benefits were generated in order to explore cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: A significant cost difference of pound 1950 (95% CI, pound 849 to pound 3145) in favor of FRA was found. Mean QALYs per patient over the 24-month trial period were 0.0522 (SD, 0.0326) in the TC group and 0.1914 (SD, 0.0398) in the FRA group, producing a significant difference of -0.1392 (95% CI, -0.2349 to -0.0436). With regard to employment, incremental productivity costs were estimated at pound 185,171 in favor of FRA. CONCLUSION: From an NHS perspective, the trial data show that TC is not cost-effective in circumferential lumbar fusion. The use of FRA was both cheaper and generated greater QALY gains. In addition, FRA patients reported a greater return to work rate.",2007-01-02885,18246014,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Brian J C Freeman,2007,32 / 25,2891-7,No,18246014,"Brian J C Freeman; Nicholas A Steele; Tracey H Sach; James Hegarty; Rikke Soegaard; ISSLS prize winner: cost-effectiveness of two forms of circumferential lumbar fusion: a prospective randomized controlled trial, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 2007-Dec-01; 32(25):1528-1159; 2891-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Titanium cages,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Months,3.50,3.50,-13721.26,United Kingdom,2005,-33100.53
3848,Cost-Effectiveness Model for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Comparing Early and Late Treatment with Pegaptanib Sodium Based on Visual Acuity,"Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of pegaptanib and usual care within three distinct cohorts of subfoveal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NV-AMD) patients, that is, those with early, moderate, and late disease, using a comprehensive economic model. Methods: A Markov framework was used to model lifetime movement of a subfoveal NV-AMD cohort through health states based on visual acuity. The model takes a US payer perspective of patients over the age of 65 years. Clinical efficacy was based on published results for the 0.3 mg pegaptanib and usual care groups. Expert interviews were conducted to determine adverse event treatment patterns and vision rehabilitation resource use. Incidence and costs of comorbidities such as depression and fractures associated with the effects of declining visual acuity were based on our previously published analysis of Medicare data. Transition probabilities were derived from published clinical trial data for each 3-month cycle. Utilities were derived from published sources. Three runs of the model were conducted with cohorts of newly diagnosed patients. Patients were classified as having early, moderate, or late NV-AMD defined as visual acuity in the better-seeing eye of 20/40 to more than 20/80, 20/80 to more than 20/200, and 20/200 to more than 20/400, respectively. Costs and outcomes were discounted 3.0% per annum. Results: Incremental costs per vision-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for early NV-AMD patients were approximately one-third those of patients with late disease ($15,279 vs. $57,230 and $36,282 vs. $132,381, respectively). On average, patients treated early with either pegaptanib or usual care incurred lower lifetime total direct costs than those treated later. Sensitivity analysis showed that base-case incremental costs per QALY gained for pegaptanib versus usual care were relatively robust.

3851,A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Cost-Utility of Second-Generation Antipsychotics in People with Psychosis and Eligible for Clozapine,"Objective: To assess whether clozapine is likely to be more cost-effective than other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in people with schizophrenia. Methods: An integrated clinical and economic multicenter, rater-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared clozapine to the class of other SGAs, using the perspectives of the National Health Service, social support services, and patients. The practice setting was secondary and primary care in the United Kingdom; patients were followed for 1 year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), net benefit statistics, and cost acceptability curves were estimated. Results: The ICER for clozapine was pound33,240 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (range pound23,000-70,000 for the sensitivity analyses). The proportion of simulations when clozapine was more cost-effective than other SGAs reached 50% if decision-makers are prepared to pay pound30,000 to pound35,000 per QALY. This is at the top of the range of acceptable willingness-to-pay values per QALY implied by decisions taken by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Conclusions: This study adds to a limited body of evidence comparing clozapine to other SGAs and is the first economic and clinical RCT to compare clozapine to the class of other SGAs using the lower cost of generic clozapine and a pragmatic trial design. Policy decisions by the NICE suggest that additional reasons would be needed to accept clozapine as effective and efficient if it had a high probability of having ICERs more than pound35,000 per QALY.

3852,Cost-Utility Analysis of Rimonabant in the Treatment of Obesity,"Objective: To estimate the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of rimonabant 20 mg/day in the treatment of obesity from a third-party payer's perspective. Methods: Pooled data from three randomized clinical trials were used to develop a decision tree with five treatment alternatives: 1- and 2-year treatment with rimonabant, 2-year placebo, 1-year rimonabant followed by 1-year placebo, and no treatment. All alternatives, except no treatment, were accompanied by lifestyle interventions. Treatment benefits included gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and reduced incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease (CHD). Drug acquisition cost was based on the average wholesale price of a comparator drug minus 15%. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the base-case results. Results: One-year rimonabant and 1-year rimonabant followed by placebo were extendedly dominated. Rimonabant for 2 years showed an average weight reduction of 8.49 kg, a body mass index reduction of 2.98 kg/m(2) and reduced waist circumference by 8.24 cm (placebo: 3.55 kg, 1.22 kg/m(2), 4.18 cm). Two-year rimonabant was associated with a relative reduction in the 5-year incidence of CHD by 7.15% and of diabetes by 9.28%.

3858,The Internet for weight control in an obese sample: results of a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Rising levels of obesity coupled with the limited success of currently available weight control methods highlight the need for investigation of novel approaches to obesity treatment. This study aims to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an Internet-based resource for obesity management. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial conducted in a community setting, where obese volunteers (n = 221) were randomly assigned to Internet group (n = 111) or usual care group (n = 110). Objective measures of weight and height were obtained. Questionnaires were used to collect dietary, lifestyle, physical activity and quality of life data. Data were collected at baseline, six months and 12 months. RESULTS: Data were collected on 54 (49%) participants in the Internet group and 77 (70%) participants in the usual care group at 12 months. Based on analysis conducted on all available data, the Internet group lost 1.3 kg, compared with 1.9 kg weight loss in the usual care group at 12 months, a non-significant difference (difference = 0.6 kg; 95% CI: -1.4 to 2.5, p = 0.56). No significant differences in change in secondary outcome measures between the two groups at six or 12 months were revealed. Total costs per person per year were higher in the Internet group than the usual care group ( pound992.40 compared to pound276.12), primarily due to the fixed costs associated with setting up the website, and QALYs were similar (0.78 and 0.77) for both groups. CONCLUSION: This trial failed to show any additional benefit of this website in terms of weight loss or secondary outcome measures compared with usual care. High attrition and low compliance limits the results of this research. The results suggest that the Internet-based weight control resource was not a cost-effective tool for weight loss in the obese sample studied.

3860,"Circumferential fusion is dominant over posterolateral fusion in a long-term perspective: cost-utility evaluation of a randomized controlled trial in severe, chronic low back pain","STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility evaluation of a randomized, controlled trial with a 4- to 8-year follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) when comparing circumferential fusion to posterolateral fusion in a long-term, societal perspective. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The cost-effectiveness of circumferential fusion in a long-term perspective is uncertain but nonetheless highly relevant as the ISSLS prize winner 2006 in clinical studies reported the effect of circumferential fusion superior to the effect of posterolateral fusion. A recent trial found no significant difference between posterolateral and circumferential fusion reporting cost-effectiveness from a 2-year viewpoint. METHODS: A total of 146 patients were randomized to posterolateral or circumferential fusion and followed 4 to 8 years after surgery. The mean age of the cohort was 46 years (range, 20-65 years); 61% were females, 49% were smokers, 30% had primary diagnosis of isthmic spondylolisthesis, 35% had disc degeneration and no previous surgery, and 35% had disc degeneration and previous surgery. Eighty-two percent of patients have had symptoms for more than 2 years and 50% were out of the labor market due to sickness. The EQ-5D instrument was applied for the measurement of health-related quality of life and costs (2004 U.S. dollars) were measured in a full-scale societal perspective. Productivity costs were valued by the Friction Cost method, and both costs and effects were discounted. Arithmetic means and 95% bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals were reported. Nonparametric statistics were used for tests of statistical significance. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted and reported using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The circumferential group demonstrated clinical superiority over the posterolateral fusion group in functional outcome (P < 0.01), fusion rate (P < 0.04), and number of reoperations (P < 0.01) among others. Cost-utility analysis demonstrated circumferential fusion dominant over posterolateral fusion, that is, for each QALY gained performing circumferential fusion, the incremental saving was estimated at U.S. $49,306 (95% confidence interval, $27,183-$2,735,712). Results proved to be strong to various sensitivity analyses; only a differentiated underestimation of patients' need for postoperative household help against the circumferential approach could alter the dominance; however, still the probability of cost-effectiveness was >0.85 given a threshold for willingness to pay of U.S. $50,000 per QALY.

3864,"Pharmacogenomic testing to prevent aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in cystic fibrosis patients: potential impact on clinical, patient, and economic outcomes","BACKGROUND: Aminoglycosides are commonly used in cystic fibrosis patients to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections. Aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss may occur in 1%-15% of patients with cystic fibrosis, ranging from mild to severe. Recently, a genetic test to identify patients with a mitochondrial mutation (A1555G) that may predispose patients to this adverse event has become available. Although the A1555G variant is very rare, it seems to confer a high risk of severe hearing loss in patients exposed to aminoglycosides. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the potential clinical, patient, and economic outcomes associated with the use of A1555G testing in a cystic fibrosis population, and explore data gaps and uncertainty in its clinical implementation. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate a hypothetical cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis from a societal perspective. Clinical and economic data were derived primarily from a critical literature review. The incidence of aminoglycoside-induced severe hearing loss, quality-adjusted life-years, and total health care costs were evaluated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate uncertainty in our results. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, A1555G testing decreased the risk of severe aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss by 0.12% in the cystic fibrosis population. The discounted incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained was $79,300, but varied widely from $33,000 to testing being dominated by the no testing strategy (higher costs and lower quality-adjusted life-years with testing) in sensitivity analyses. If avoidance of aminoglycosides in patients testing positive leads to an absolute increase in the lifetime risk of death from Pseudomonas infection of 0.8% or greater, A1555G testing would lead to a decrease in quality-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our analysis suggest that there are significant data gaps and uncertainty in the outcomes with A1555G testing, but it is not likely cost-effective, and could lead to worse patient outcomes due to avoidance of first-line therapy in the >95% of patients who are false-positives. Additional research is needed before pharmacogenetic testing for the A1555G mitochondrial mutation can be recommended, even in a population with a high likelihood of exposure to aminoglycosides.",2007-01-02917,18073583,Genet Med,David L Veenstra,2007,9 / 10,695-704,No,18073583,"David L Veenstra; Julie Harris; Ronald L Gibson; Margaret Rosenfeld; Wylie Burke; Carolyn Watts; Pharmacogenomic testing to prevent aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in cystic fibrosis patients: potential impact on clinical, patient, and economic outcomes, Genet Med, ; 9(10):1098-3600; 695-704",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Testing for A1555G genetic mutation vs. No testing for A1555G genetic mutation,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,79342.73,United States,2006,101858.98
3865,"The cost-effectiveness of the treatment of high risk women with osteoporosis, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in Sweden","This paper assessed the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of high risk women with osteoporosis, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in Sweden, using one model and a societal perspective. Cost-effective scenarios were found in all these chronic disorders. These findings are of relevance for decisions on the efficient allocation of health care resources. INTRODUCTION: There is a need to assess the cost-effectiveness (CE) of treatment of osteoporosis from a societal perspective and to relate this to the CE of interventions in other disease areas. This is of relevance for decisions on the efficient allocation of health care resources within and between disease areas. The purpose of the paper was to estimate the CE of the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and to put that into the perspective of treating hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The CE was assessed for different high risk female populations aged 50-80 years. METHODS: The estimation of CE was based on a model populated with data for Sweden. RESULTS: Compared to no intervention, a 5-year treatment of osteoporosis, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia, is cost effective for most of the assessed high risk female populations. The cost per gained quality adjusted life year (QALY) for the treatment of a 70-year-old woman never exceeded SEK 330,000 (US$ 44,000), which is generally judged as an acceptable cost for a gained QALY.

3875,"The cost-effectiveness of the treatment of high risk women with osteoporosis, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in Sweden","This paper assessed the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of high risk women with osteoporosis, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in Sweden, using one model and a societal perspective. Cost-effective scenarios were found in all these chronic disorders. These findings are of relevance for decisions on the efficient allocation of health care resources. INTRODUCTION: There is a need to assess the cost-effectiveness (CE) of treatment of osteoporosis from a societal perspective and to relate this to the CE of interventions in other disease areas. This is of relevance for decisions on the efficient allocation of health care resources within and between disease areas. The purpose of the paper was to estimate the CE of the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and to put that into the perspective of treating hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The CE was assessed for different high risk female populations aged 50-80 years. METHODS: The estimation of CE was based on a model populated with data for Sweden.

3877,Influence of intraoperative conversion from off-pump to on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting on costs and quality of life: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery has become a widely accepted alternative to standard coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass; however, the influence of intraoperative conversion from OPCAB to standard CABG on costs and quality of life is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether intraoperative conversion affects costs and quality of life. DESIGN: A decision-analysis model and Monte Carlo simulation. SETTING: The US healthcare system over a maximum 10-year lifetime horizon. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old male patients undergoing elective OPCAB surgery or standard CABG surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient was entered into the decision tree with varying transition probabilities. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs in US dollars. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In base-case analysis, OPCAB surgery led to a discounted lifetime cost of $91,282 and 7.64 discounted QALYs, and standard CABG surgery led to $91,685 and 7.52 QALYs. Patients who required conversion from off-pump to on-pump surgery incurred a cost of $103,909 and gained 6.63 QALYs. OPCAB is dominant (less costly and more effective) if the conversion rate is below 8.5%, whereas costs increase exponentially if the probability of conversion exceeds 15%. Sixty-one percent of the Monte Carlo simulations favored cost-effectiveness of the OPCAB strategy. CONCLUSION: In low-risk patients, OPCAB surgery, in comparison to standard CABG surgery, would increase QALYs by reducing complications related to cardiopulmonary bypass, but it would result in lifetime costs similar to those of standard CABG surgery. The benefit of OPCAB may be offset by the risk of intraoperative conversion.",2007-01-02921,18068054,J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,Toshiya Shiga,2007,21 / 6,793-9,No,18068054,"Toshiya Shiga; Christian C Apfel; Zen'ichiro Wajima; Yoko Ohe; Influence of intraoperative conversion from off-pump to on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting on costs and quality of life: a cost-effectiveness analysis, J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth, 2007-Dec; 21(6):1053-0770; 793-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-3528,United States,2005,-4675.3
3879,Tailored psychotherapy for patients with functional neurological symptoms: a pilot study,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess whether individually tailored psychotherapy for patients with functional neurological symptoms is associated with improvements in patient-centered measures of emotional well-being, quality of life, as well as somatic symptoms and whether this treatment modality is likely to be cost-effective. METHODS: We conducted an uncontrolled prospective pilot study of consecutive patients with functional symptoms referred from neurology outpatient clinics to a single psychotherapist using validated questionnaires [Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), Short Function (SF)-36 Health Survey, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-15]. Patients had a median of 6 treatment sessions (range=1-24). Ninety-one patients completed questionnaires at referral, 63 did at the end of treatment, and 34 did at follow-up after 6 months. Significant improvements were seen on all measures and were maintained at follow-up (CORE-OM, P=.003; SF-36, P<.001; PHQ-15, P=.001). Significance was not lost in an intention-to-treat analysis. Of all the patients, 49.2% improved by at least 1 S.D. in at least one of the measures. The number of patients needed to be treated to see an improvement of at least 1 S.D. in one of the three outcome measures was 2; that in two measures, 3.9; and that in all measures, 7. The mean cost of the intervention was pound231; the cost per quality-adjusted life year was estimated as pound5,328. RESULTS: Psychotherapy was associated with significant improvements in patient-centered measures, which seemed to be achieved at a comparatively low cost.

3885,Health economic evaluation of controlled and maintained physical exercise in the prevention of cardiovascular and other prosperity diseases,"OBJECTIVES: Several studies and reports support the health benefits of frequent physical exercise, on the condition that this exercise is controlled and maintained. Given the scarce resources that can be spent on health and health care, the objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term health and economic outcomes of controlled and maintained physical exercise in a fitness setting. METHODS: A 25-year Markov model with a 12-month cycle-length and states representing diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, colon cancer and breast cancer was developed to predict cumulative costs and QALYs (quality adjusted life years) for three defined population cohorts, of different risk levels. Physical exercise was thereby compared with no intervention. Reduced risks associated with physical exercise, cost of diseases and loss of quality of life in case of disease were obtained from published literature. Costs were taken from a societal perspective; Belgium was selected as the setting. One way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. RESULTS: For each of the cohorts, physical exercise is predicted to increase the QALYs and to offset a large part of the initial investment. The cost per QALY varies from 2000 to 15,000 Euro per QALY depending on the risk levels, which is better compared with a majority of secondary preventions that are currently publicly financed.

METHODS: QALYs and costs related to monoHT witk cyproterone acetate (CYP) (42 patients); bicalutamide (BIC) (41 patients); LHRH-a (96 patients) and complete androgenic blockade (CAB) with: CYP (CYP CAB) (50 patients); BIC (BIC CAB) (46 patients) were compared via a cost-utility analysis (CUA) adopting the Italian National Healthcare Service (INHS) viewpoint. RESULTS: As no statistical significant difference among the mean QALYs gained with the different HTs was detected (p = 0.116), CUA was replaced by a cost minimization analysis (CMA). However, the lowest and the highest mean QALYs gained per patient were registered for BIC CAB (0.59; 95% CI: 0.50; 0.68) and for for CYP (0.75; 95% CI: 0.68; 0.82), respectively. CYP was the least costly HT, reaching the lowest and the highest savings when compared to LHRH-a (-Euros 974.99; 95% CI: -Euros 1066.86; -Euros 883.12; p<0.0001) and to monoHT with BIC (-Euros 5887.81; 95% CI: -Euros 6143.99; -Euros 5631.64; p<0.0001).

METHODS: QALYs and costs related to monoHT witk cyproterone acetate (CYP) (42 patients); bicalutamide (BIC) (41 patients); LHRH-a (96 patients) and complete androgenic blockade (CAB) with: CYP (CYP CAB) (50 patients); BIC (BIC CAB) (46 patients) were compared via a cost-utility analysis (CUA) adopting the Italian National Healthcare Service (INHS) viewpoint. RESULTS: As no statistical significant difference among the mean QALYs gained with the different HTs was detected (p = 0.116), CUA was replaced by a cost minimization analysis (CMA). However, the lowest and the highest mean QALYs gained per patient were registered for BIC CAB (0.59; 95% CI: 0.50; 0.68) and for for CYP (0.75; 95% CI: 0.68; 0.82), respectively. CYP was the least costly HT, reaching the lowest and the highest savings when compared to LHRH-a (-Euros 974.99; 95% CI: -Euros 1066.86; -Euros 883.12; p<0.0001) and to monoHT with BIC (-Euros 5887.81; 95% CI: -Euros 6143.99; -Euros 5631.64; p<0.0001). A nonparametric bootstrap sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the base case CMA. CONCLUSION: CYP is an interesting option for curbing the INHS drug expenditure for PC patients, with a trend towards increasing the mean number of QALYs gained.",2007-01-02946,18041359,Arch Ital Urol Androl,Carlo Lazzaro,2007,79 / 3,104-7,No,18041359,"Carlo Lazzaro; Riccardo Bartoletti; Giorgio Guazzoni; Fausto Orestano; Giovanni L Pappagallo; Domenico Prezioso; Filiberto Zattoni; Economic evaluation of different hormonal therapies for prostate cancer.

3890,Cost-effectiveness of pegaptanib compared to photodynamic therapy with verteporfin and to standard care in the treatment of subfoveal wet age-related macular degeneration in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by loss of central vision and is the leading cause of blindness among persons over the age of 50 years in Canada. The wet form of AMD has 3 subtypes-occult, minimally classic, and predominantly classic. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin is indicated only for the category of predominantly classic wet AMD. Currently, there are no treatments available for the other AMD subtypes. Pegaptanib sodium was the first pharmacologic therapy approved in Canada for the treatment of subfoveal wet AMD regardless of subtype. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of pegaptanib versus PDT with verteporfin and versus standard care for the treatment of subfoveal wet AMD in patients aged 65 years in Canada. METHODS: A Markov model based on visual acuity in the better-seeing eye was developed. Clinical efficacy was taken from the clinical trials. Costs of treatment, comorbidities (eg, depression, fractures, need for assisted living), vision rehabilitation, visual aids, and adverse events were considered. Costs, utilities, and mortality were estimated from data from the available published literature. Costs were reported in 2004 Canadian dollars, and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and vision years gained (VYGs) were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine model robustness. RESULTS: Patients who received pegaptanib experienced more QALYs gained (4.17) and VYGs (3.83) compared with patients who received PDT (3.87 and 3.01, respectively) or standard care (3.96 and 3.26). Mean total costs per patient were greater in patients who received pegaptanib compared to those who received PDT or standard care ($20,016 vs $15,345 or $7669, respectively). The incremental cost per QALY in patients receiving pegaptanib compared to those receiving PDT was $49,052 and $59,039 for patients receiving pegaptanib versus standard care. The incremental cost per VYG was $20,401 and $21,559 with pegaptanib versus PDT and standard care, respectively. Sensitivity analyses found that the model was relatively robust to changes in various model parameters. CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis suggest that in Canada, pegaptanib is a cost-effective treatment for subfoveal wet AMD in elderly patients, regardless of lesion subtype, compared to PDT with verteporfin and to standard care.",2007-01-02951,18035208,Clin Ther,Stephanie R Earnshaw,2007,29 / 9,2096-106; discussion 2094-5,Yes,18035208,"Stephanie R Earnshaw; Yola Moride; Sophie Rochon; Cost-effectiveness of pegaptanib compared to photodynamic therapy with verteporfin and to standard care in the treatment of subfoveal wet age-related macular degeneration in Canada, Clin Ther, 2007-Sep; 29(9):1879-114X; 2096-106; discussion 2094-5",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Pegaptanib sodium vs. Standard of care (Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin if appropriate, otherwise placebo)",Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,59039,Canada,2004,62254.78
3891,Cost-effectiveness of tipranavir versus comparator protease inhibitor regimens in HIV infected patients previously exposed to antiretroviral therapy in the Netherlands,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: This study compares the costs and effects of a regimen with ritonavir-boosted tipranavir (TPV/r) to a physician-selected genotypically-defined standard-of-care comparator protease inhibitor regimen boosted with ritonavir (CPI/r) in HIV infected patients that were previously exposed to antiretroviral therapy in the Netherlands. METHODS: We compared the projected lifetime costs and effects of two theoretical groups of 1000 patients, one receiving a standard of care regimen with TPV/r as a component and the other receiving a standard of care regimen with CPI/r. A 3-stage Markov model was formulated to represent three different consecutive HAART regimens. The model uses 12 health states based on viral load and CD4+ count to simulate disease progression. The transition probabilities for the Markov model were derived from a United States cohort of treatment experienced HIV patients. Furthermore, the study design was based on 48-week data from the RESIST-2 clinical trial and local Dutch costing data. Cost and health effects were discounted at 4% and 1.5% respectively according to the Dutch guideline. The analysis was conducted from the Dutch healthcare perspective using 2006 unit cost prices. RESULTS: Our model projects an accumulated discounted cost to the Dutch healthcare system per patient receiving the TPV/r regimen of euro167,200 compared to euro145,400 for the CPI/r regimen. This results in an incremental cost of euro21,800 per patient. The accumulated discounted effect is 7.43 life years or 6.31 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient receiving TPV/r, compared to 6.91 life years or 5.80 QALYs per patient receiving CPI/r. This translates into an incremental effect of TPV/r over CPI/r of 0.52 life years gained (LYG) or 0.51 QALYs gained. The corresponding incremental cost effectiveness ratios (iCERs) are euro41,600 per LYG and euro42,500 per QALY. CONCLUSION: We estimated the iCER for TPV/r compared to CPI/r at approximately euro40,000 in treatment experienced HIV-1 infected patients in the Netherlands. This ratio may well be in range of what is acceptable and warrants reimbursement for new drug treatments in the Netherlands, in particular in therapeutic areas as end-stage oncology and HIV and other last-resort health-care interventions.",2007-01-02952,18034881,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Gijs Aa Hubben,2007,5 /,15,Yes,18034881,"Gijs Aa Hubben; Jasper M Bos; Christa A Veltman-Starkenburg; Simon Stegmeijer; Henrik W Finnern; Bregt S Kappelhoff; Kit N Simpson; Andrea Tramarin; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness of tipranavir versus comparator protease inhibitor regimens in HIV infected patients previously exposed to antiretroviral therapy in the Netherlands, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2007; 5():1478-7547; 15",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,TPV/r vs. Physician-selected standard of care protease inhibitor regimen boosted with ritonavir(CPI/r),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,42500,Euro,2006,68544.4
3892,The Cost-Effectiveness of an Early Interventional Strategy in Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome Based on the RITA 3 Trial,"Background Evidence suggests that an early interventional strategy for patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) can improve health outcomes but also increase costs when compared with a conservative strategy. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of an early interventional strategy in different risk groups from a UK health-service perspective. DESIGN: Decision-analytic model based on randomised clinical trial data. Main outcome measures Costs in UK Sterling at 2003/2004 prices and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) combined into an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Methods Data from the third Randomised Intervention Trial of unstable Angina (RITA 3) was employed to estimate rates of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction, costs and health-related quality of life. Cost-effectiveness was estimated over patients' lifetimes within the decision-analytic model. Results The mean incremental cost per QALY gained for an early interventional strategy was approximately GBP55,000, GBP22,000 and GBP12,000 for patients at low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The early interventional strategy is approximately 1%, 35% and 95% likely to be cost-effective for patients at low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, at a threshold of GBP20,000 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of early intervention in low-risk patients is sensitive to assumptions about the duration of the treatment effect.
