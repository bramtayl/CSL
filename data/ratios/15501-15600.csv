15501,Lung Volume Reduction Coil Treatment vs Usual Care in Patients With Severe Emphysema: The REVOLENS Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE: Therapeutic options for severe emphysema are limited. Lung volume reduction using nitinol coils is a bronchoscopic intervention inducing regional parenchymal volume reduction and restoring lung recoil. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of nitinol coils in treatment of severe emphysema. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter 1:1 randomized superiority trial comparing coils with usual care at 10 university hospitals in France. Enrollment of patients with emphysema occurred from March to October 2013, with 12-month follow-up (last follow-up, December 2014). INTERVENTIONS: Patients randomized to usual care (n = 50) received rehabilitation and bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids and oxygen; those randomized to bilateral coil treatment (n = 50) received usual care plus additional therapy in which approximately 10 coils per lobe were placed in 2 bilateral lobes in 2 procedures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was improvement of at least 54 m in the 6-minute walk test at 6 months (1-sided hypothesis test). Secondary outcomes included changes at 6 and 12 months in the 6-minute walk test, lung function, quality of life as assessed by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (range, 0-100; 0 being the best and 100 being the worst quality of life; minimal clinically important difference, >/=4), morbidity, mortality, total cost, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Among 100 patients, 71 men and 29 women (mean age, 62 years) were included. At 6 months, improvement of at least 54 m was observed in 18 patients (36%) in the coil group and 9 patients (18%) in the usual care group, for a between-group difference of 18% (1-sided 95% CI, 4% to infinity; P = .03). Mean between-group differences at 6 and 12 months in the coil and usual care groups were +0.09 L (95% CI, 0.05 L to infinity) (P = .001) and +0.08 L (95% CI, 0.03 L to infinity) (P = .002) for forced expiratory volume in the first second, +21 m (95% CI, -4 m to infinity) (P = .06) and +21 m (95% CI, -5 m to infinity) (P = .12) for 6-minute walk distance, and -13.4 points (95% CI, -8 points to infinity) and -10.6 points (95% CI, -5.8 points to infinity) for St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (1-sided P < .001 for both). Within 12 months, 4 deaths occurred in the coil group and 3 in the usual care group. The mean total 1-year per-patient cost difference between groups was $47,908 (95% CI, $47,879-$48,073) (P < .001); the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $782,598 per additional quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this preliminary study of patients with severe emphysema followed up for 6 months, bronchoscopic treatment with nitinol coils compared with usual care resulted in improved exercise capacity with high short-term costs. Further investigation is needed to assess durability of benefit and long-term cost implications.

15502,Structural Uncertainty of Markov Models for Advanced Breast Cancer: A Simulation Study of Lapatinib,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of structural uncertainty of Markov models in modeling cost-effectiveness for the treatment of advanced breast cancer (ABC). METHODS: Four common Markov models for ABC were identified and examined. Markov models 1 and 2 have 4 health states (stable-disease, responding-to-therapy, disease-progressing, and death), and Markov models 3 and 4 only have 3 health states (stable-disease, disease-progressing, and death). In models 1 and 3, the possibility of death can occur in any health state, while in models 2 and 4, the chance of dying can only occur in the disease-progressing health state. A simulation was conducted to examine the impact of using different model structures on cost-effectiveness results in the context of a combination therapy of lapatinib and capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive ABC. Model averaging with an assumption of equal weights in all 4 models was used to account for structural uncertainty. RESULTS: Markov model 3 yielded the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $303,909 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), while Markov model 1 produced the highest ICER ($495,800/QALY). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY, the probabilities that the combination therapy is considered to be cost-effective for Markov models 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 14.5%, 14.1%, 21.6%, and 17.0%, respectively. When using model averaging to synthesize different model structures, the resulting ICER was $389,270/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that modeling ABC with different Markov model structures yielded a wide range of cost-effectiveness results, suggesting the need to investigate structural uncertainty in health economic evaluation. When applied in the context of HER2-positive ABC treatment, the combination therapy with lapatinib is not cost-effective, regardless of which model was used and whether uncertainties were accounted for.",2016-01-20340,26753626,Med Decis Making,Quang A Le,2016,36 / 5,629-40,No,26753626,"Quang A Le; Structural Uncertainty of Markov Models for Advanced Breast Cancer: A Simulation Study of Lapatinib, Med Decis Making, 2016 Jul; 36(5):0272-989X; 629-40",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lapatinib + Capecitabine vs. Capecitabine alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,389270,United States,2013,432471.91
15503,Cost-Effectiveness of Osteoporosis Screening Strategies for Men,"Osteoporosis affects many men, with significant morbidity and mortality. However, the best osteoporosis screening strategies for men are unknown. We developed an individual-level state-transition cost-effectiveness model with a lifetime time horizon to identify the cost-effectiveness of different osteoporosis screening strategies for US men involving various screening tests (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]; the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool [OST]; or a fracture risk assessment strategy using age, femoral neck bone mineral density [BMD], and Vertebral Fracture Assessment [VFA]); screening initiation ages (50, 60, 70, or 80 years); and repeat screening intervals (5 years or 10 years). In base-case analysis, no screening was a less effective option than all other strategies evaluated; furthermore, no screening was more expensive than all strategies that involved screening with DXA or the OST risk assessment instrument, and thus no screening was ""dominated"" by screening with DXA or OST at all evaluated screening initiation ages and repeat screening intervals. Screening strategies that most frequently appeared as most cost-effective in base-case analyses and one-way sensitivity analyses when assuming willingness-to-pay of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) or $100,000/QALY included screening initiation at age 50 years with the fracture risk assessment strategy and repeat screening every 10 years; screening initiation at age 50 years with fracture risk assessment and repeat screening every 5 years; and screening initiation at age 50 years with DXA and repeat screening every 5 years. In conclusion, expansion of osteoporosis screening for US men to initiate routine screening at age 50 or 60 years would be expected to be effective and of good value for improving health outcomes. A fracture risk assessment strategy using variables of age, femoral neck BMD, and VFA is likely to be the most effective of the evaluated strategies within accepted cost-effectiveness parameters. DXA and OST are also reasonable screening options, albeit likely slightly less effective than the evaluated fracture risk assessment strategy.

15505,"Cost-Effectiveness of Bronchial Thermoplasty, Omalizumab, and Standard Therapy for Moderate-to-Severe Allergic Asthma","BACKGROUND: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a recently developed treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. A few studies have suggested the clinical efficacy of this intervention. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BT compared to other alternative treatments for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma, which currently include omalizumab and standard therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of standard therapy, BT, and omalizumab for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma in the USA. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model with weekly cycles was developed to reflect the course of asthma progression over a 5-year time horizon. The study population was adults with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma whose asthma remained uncontrolled despite using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS, with or without long-acting beta-agonists [LABA]). A perspective of the health-care system was adopted with asthma-related costs as well as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and exacerbations as the outcomes. RESULTS: For standard therapy, BT, and omalizumab, the discounted 5-year costs and QALYs were $15,400 and 3.08, $28,100 and 3.24, and $117,000 and 3.26, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BT versus standard therapy and omalizumab versus BT was $78,700/QALY and $3.86 million/QALY, respectively. At the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY, the probability of BT being cost-effective was 9%, and 67%, respectively. The corresponding expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was $155 and $1,530 per individual at these thresholds. In sensitivity analyses, increasing the costs of BT from $14,900 to $30,000 increased its ICER relative to standard therapy to $178,000/QALY, and decreased the ICER of omalizumab relative to BT to $3.06 million/QALY. Reducing the costs of omalizumab by 25% decreased its ICER relative to BT by 29%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, our study suggests that there is more than 60% chance that BT becomes cost-effective relative to omalizumab and standard therapy at the WTP of $100,000/QALY in patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.

15507,A cost-effectiveness model for the use of a cannabis-derived oromucosal spray for the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis,"BACKGROUND: Severity of spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS) directly correlates with the level and cost of care required. This study assessed whether a tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) oromucosal spray for treatment of moderate-severe MS spasticity is a cost-effective use of healthcare resources in Wales. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare THC/CBD plus standard of care (SoC) treatments with SoC alone. RESULTS: At 30 years, total incremental cost for THC/CBD plus SoC treatment was estimated at pound3,836/patient (ICER: pound10,891/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). Hospital admission costs had the greatest effect on the base case ICER. Inclusion of carer cost led to incremental cost of - pound33,609/patient (ICER: - pound95,423/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: The THC/CBD spray was found to be cost-effective for the treatment of spasticity in MS, and dominant, if home carer costs were included.

15508,Cost-effectiveness of Corticosteroid Nasal Spray vs Surgical Therapy in Patients With Severe to Extreme Anatomical Nasal Obstruction,"IMPORTANCE: Health insurance companies commonly require a trial of corticosteroid nasal spray prior to authorizing nasal surgery, even in patients with severe to extreme anatomical nasal obstruction, despite lack of data supporting such medical therapy. OBJECTIVES: To provide a model for the comparative analysis of medical vs surgical treatment for nasal obstruction to help maximize health care benefit per dollar spent and to explore the cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid nasal spray in patients with severe to extreme nasal airway obstruction on Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scores. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cost-efficiency frontier economic evaluation was performed. The economic perspective was that of the health care third-party payer. Effectiveness data were obtained from NOSE score questionnaires in 179 patients. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was determined from the cost and efficacy data. Comparative treatment groups were medical therapy with corticosteroid nasal spray vs surgical therapy for nasal airway obstruction. The study was conducted between January 1, 2011, and December 30, 2013. The time horizon included 1, 2, and 5 years. Data analysis was completed June 1, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). A modified Markov decision tree model was used. Costs were obtained from the Medicare 2015 physician fee schedule, and the mean was determined (owing to geographic disparity) along with wholesale and generic pharmaceutical pricing. RESULTS: Among 100 men and 79 women evaluated (mean [SD] age, 37.9 [12.9] years), surgical repair of severe nasal airway obstruction cost $6537 and produced a total of 1.15 QALYs at 1 year. Medical treatment involved a trial of corticosteroid nasal sprays, which cost $520 and produced a total of 1.03 QALYs. The surgical approach was markedly more effective but at greater short-term cost. In cases of extreme nasal obstruction, medical treatment cost $520.73 with 1.004 QALYs, demonstrating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $354693 per QALY compared with no treatment. Conversely, surgical treatment cost $6536.64 and produced 1.136 QALYs, with an ICER of $45633 compared with medical therapy. At 5 years, the ICER decreased from $45634 to $8110 per QALY for surgical treatment of extreme nasal obstruction. The medical treatment ICER decreased from $354693 per QALY at 1 year to $273704 per QALY at 5 years. An ICER was performed and demonstrated a cost threshold of $50554 per QALY for surgical treatment compared with $67518 per QALY for medical treatment at 1 year for severe nasal obstruction. If the evaluation is extended to 5 years, surgical treatment cost $8984 per QALY compared with $52571 per QALY for medical treatment. Owing to the improved effectiveness outcomes, greater cost savings per ICER was demonstrated in patients with extreme nasal obstruction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surgical treatment for patients with severe to extreme anatomical nasal obstruction demonstrates increased short-term expense but is cost-effective in the long term.

Costs were obtained from the Medicare 2015 physician fee schedule, and the mean was determined (owing to geographic disparity) along with wholesale and generic pharmaceutical pricing. RESULTS: Among 100 men and 79 women evaluated (mean [SD] age, 37.9 [12.9] years), surgical repair of severe nasal airway obstruction cost $6537 and produced a total of 1.15 QALYs at 1 year. Medical treatment involved a trial of corticosteroid nasal sprays, which cost $520 and produced a total of 1.03 QALYs. The surgical approach was markedly more effective but at greater short-term cost. In cases of extreme nasal obstruction, medical treatment cost $520.73 with 1.004 QALYs, demonstrating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $354693 per QALY compared with no treatment. Conversely, surgical treatment cost $6536.64 and produced 1.136 QALYs, with an ICER of $45633 compared with medical therapy. At 5 years, the ICER decreased from $45634 to $8110 per QALY for surgical treatment of extreme nasal obstruction. The medical treatment ICER decreased from $354693 per QALY at 1 year to $273704 per QALY at 5 years. An ICER was performed and demonstrated a cost threshold of $50554 per QALY for surgical treatment compared with $67518 per QALY for medical treatment at 1 year for severe nasal obstruction. If the evaluation is extended to 5 years, surgical treatment cost $8984 per QALY compared with $52571 per QALY for medical treatment. Owing to the improved effectiveness outcomes, greater cost savings per ICER was demonstrated in patients with extreme nasal obstruction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surgical treatment for patients with severe to extreme anatomical nasal obstruction demonstrates increased short-term expense but is cost-effective in the long term. These data suggest that treatment with corticosteroid nasal spray in patients with documented severe to extreme anatomical nasal obstruction is unnecessary and results in a delay in treatment.

15511,Cost-effectiveness of Corticosteroid Nasal Spray vs Surgical Therapy in Patients With Severe to Extreme Anatomical Nasal Obstruction,"IMPORTANCE: Health insurance companies commonly require a trial of corticosteroid nasal spray prior to authorizing nasal surgery, even in patients with severe to extreme anatomical nasal obstruction, despite lack of data supporting such medical therapy. OBJECTIVES: To provide a model for the comparative analysis of medical vs surgical treatment for nasal obstruction to help maximize health care benefit per dollar spent and to explore the cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid nasal spray in patients with severe to extreme nasal airway obstruction on Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scores. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cost-efficiency frontier economic evaluation was performed. The economic perspective was that of the health care third-party payer. Effectiveness data were obtained from NOSE score questionnaires in 179 patients. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was determined from the cost and efficacy data. Comparative treatment groups were medical therapy with corticosteroid nasal spray vs surgical therapy for nasal airway obstruction. The study was conducted between January 1, 2011, and December 30, 2013. The time horizon included 1, 2, and 5 years. Data analysis was completed June 1, 2015.

15512,Cost-Effectiveness of Ranibizumab Versus Aflibercept for Macular Edema Secondary to Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion: A UK Healthcare Perspective,"INTRODUCTION: Ranibizumab and aflibercept are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents licensed for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The aim of this study was to estimate, from a UK healthcare payer's perspective, the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab versus aflibercept in this indication. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the outcomes and costs of treating BRVO. Patient baseline characteristics and efficacy data for ranibizumab were obtained from the BRAVO trial. The relative efficacy of aflibercept was derived from a published network meta-analysis. Injection frequencies were derived from ranibizumab and aflibercept studies included in the network meta-analysis. Health states were defined by increments of 10 letters in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Patients could gain or lose a maximum of two health states between cycles. The first cycle was 6 months, followed by monthly cycles. Different utility values were assigned to the better-seeing and worse-seeing eyes based on BCVA. A 2-year treatment time frame and a lifetime time horizon were used. Future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The lifetime cost per patient treated was pound15,273 with ranibizumab and pound17,347 with aflibercept. Ranibizumab was dominant over aflibercept, producing incremental health gains of 0.0120 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost savings of pound2074. Net monetary benefit for ranibizumab at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/QALY was pound2314. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to variations in model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab provides greater health gains at a lower overall cost than aflibercept in the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to BRVO. Ranibizumab is therefore cost-effective from a UK healthcare payer's perspective.

We sought cost and toxicity thresholds that would make NGFi a cost-effective treatment for moderate-to-severe knee OA. DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NGFi compared to standard of care (SOC) in OA, using Tanezumab as an example. Efficacy and rates of accelerated OA progression were based on published studies. We varied the price/dose from $200 to $1000. We considered self-administered subcutaneous (SC) injections (no administration cost) vs provider-administered intravenous (IV) infusion ($69-$433/dose). Strategies were defined as cost-effective if their incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was less than $100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In sensitivity analyses we varied efficacy, toxicity, and costs. RESULTS: SOC in patients with high levels of pain led to an average discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy of 11.15 QALYs, a lifetime risk of total knee replacement surgery (TKR) of 74%, and cumulative discounted direct medical costs of $148,700. Adding Tanezumab increased QALYs to 11.42, reduced primary TKR utilization to 63%, and increased costs to between $155,400 and $199,500. In the base-case analysis, Tanezumab at $600/dose was cost-effective when delivered outside of a hospital. At $1000/dose, Tanezumab was not cost-effective in all but the most optimistic scenario. Only at rates of accelerated OA progression of 10% or more (10-fold higher than reported values) did Tanezumab decrease QALYs and fail to represent a viable option.

15515,A cemented cup with acetabular impaction bone grafting is more cost-effective than an uncemented cup in patients under 50 years,"PURPOSE: Acetabular deficiencies in young patients can be restored in several ways during total hip arthroplasty. Currently, cementless cups are most frequently used. Impaction bone grafting of acetabular defects is a more biological approach, but is it cost-effective in young patients on the long term? METHODS: We designed a decision model for a cost-utility analysis of a cemented cup with acetabular impaction bone grafting versus an uncemented cup, in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for the young adult with acetabular bone deficiency, in need for a primary total hip arthroplasty. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre and the Norwegian Hip Register. Multiple sensitivity analyses were used to assess the contribution of the included variables in the model's outcome. RESULTS: Cemented cups with impaction bone grafting were more cost-effective compared to the uncemented option in terms of costs per QALY. A scenario suggesting equal primary survival rates of both cemented and uncemented cups still showed an effect gain of the cemented cup with impaction bone grafting, but at higher costs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, the first choice of treatment of the acetabular bone deficient osteoarthritic hip in a young patient is reconstruction with impaction bone grafting and a cemented cup.",2016-01-20362,26743037,Hip Int,Vincent J J F Busch,2016,26 / 1,43-9,No,26743037,"Vincent J J F Busch; Joost Verschueren; Eddy M Adang; Stein A Lie; Leif I Havelin; Berend W Schreurs; A cemented cup with acetabular impaction bone grafting is more cost-effective than an uncemented cup in patients under 50 years, Hip Int, 2016 Feb 8; 26(1):1724-6067; 43-9",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cemented cup with acetabular impaction bone grafting vs. Standard/Usual Care- Uncemented cup with acetabular impaction bone grafting,Require total hip replacement in Osteoarthritis,49 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,-3104.21,Euro,2014,-4512.47
15516,Cost Effectiveness of First-Line Oral Therapies for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: A Modelling Study,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, a significant number of costly oral therapies have become available for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Funding decisions for these therapies requires weighing up their effectiveness and costs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of monotherapy with oral PAH-specific therapies versus supportive care as initial therapy for patients with functional class (FC) II and III PAH in Canada. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis, from the perspective of a healthcare system and based on a Markov model, was designed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with bosentan, ambrisentan, riociguat, tadalafil, sildenafil and supportive care for PAH in treatment-naive patients.

Transition probabilities, based on the relative risk of improving and worsening in FC with treatment versus placebo, were derived from a recent network meta-analysis. Utility values and costs were obtained from published data and clinical expert opinion. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Analysis suggests that sildenafil is the most cost-effective therapy for PAH in patients with FC II or III.

METHODS: A cost-utility analysis, from the perspective of a healthcare system and based on a Markov model, was designed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with bosentan, ambrisentan, riociguat, tadalafil, sildenafil and supportive care for PAH in treatment-naive patients. Separate analyses were conducted for cohorts of patients commencing therapy at FC II and III PAH. Transition probabilities, based on the relative risk of improving and worsening in FC with treatment versus placebo, were derived from a recent network meta-analysis. Utility values and costs were obtained from published data and clinical expert opinion. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Analysis suggests that sildenafil is the most cost-effective therapy for PAH in patients with FC II or III. Sildenafil was both the least costly and most effective therapy, thereby dominating all other treatments. Tadalafil was also less costly and more effective than supportive care in FC II and III; however, sildenafil was dominant over tadalafil. Even given the uncertainty within the clinical inputs, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that apart from sildenafil and tadalafil, the other PAH therapies had negligible probability of being the most cost effective.

15528,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Follow-up Strategies for Thunderclap Headache Patients With Negative Noncontrast CT,"OBJECTIVES: Accurate diagnosis of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is critical in thunderclap headache patients due to high morbidity and mortality associated with missed aneurysmal bleeds. The objective of this study was to determine the utility of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in managing patients with acute, severe headaches and negative noncontrast CT and assess the cost-effectiveness of three different screening strategies-no follow up, CTA, and lumbar puncture (LP). METHODS: A modeling-based economic evaluation was performed with a time horizon of 1 year for thunderclap headache patients in the emergency department with negative noncontrast CT for SAH. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of sensitivity of CT and the prevalence of SAH on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Lumbar puncture follow-up has the lowest cost and the highest utility in the mathematical model. The Monte Carlo simulation shows noncontrast CT with LP follow-up to be the most cost-effective strategy in 85.3% of all cases even at a $1 million/quality-adjusted life-years willingness-to-pay. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that LP follow-up should be performed, except for when CT sensitivity exceeds 99.2% and the SAH prevalence is below 3.2%, where no follow-up may be considered.

15530,A Cost-Effectiveness Comparison Between Open Transforaminal and Minimally Invasive Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusions Using the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio at 2-Year Follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Direct cost comparisons between minimally invasive spine surgeries and the open options are rare. OBJECTIVE: To compare healthcare costs associated with open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and to calculate the thresholds for minimum clinically important difference and minimum cost-effective difference for patient-reported outcome measures at the 2-year follow-up. METHODS: Forty-five patients who underwent single-level TLIF and 29 patients who underwent single-level stand-alone LLIF were included in the comparison. All costs from diagnosis through the 2-year follow-up were available from a comprehensive single-center data bank within a unified hospital system. Payment provided for all spine-related medical resource use from the time of diagnosis through 2 years was recorded. A 0% discount rate was applied. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated from the EuroQol-5D collected in an unbiased manner. Difference in total cost per QALY gained for LLIF minus that for TLIF was assessed as the estimate of the ICER from a US perspective. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed at the 2-year follow-up for both TLIF and LLIF with the Short Form-36 physical component summary, Oswestry Disability Index, visual analog scale back pain and leg pain scores, and EuroQol-5D. ICER calculations revealed similar mean cumulative QALYs gained at the 2-year interval (0.67 for TLIF and 0.60 for LLIF; P = .33). Median total costs of care after TLIF and LLIF were $44 068 and $45 574, respectively (P = .96). Minimum cost-effective difference thresholds with an anchor of <$50 000 per QALY were higher than minimum clinically important difference thresholds for all patient-reported outcome measures. Total mean cost and EuroQol-5D were statistically equivalent between the 2 treatment groups. CONCLUSION: TLIF and LLIF produced equivalent 2-year patient outcomes at an equivalent cost-effectiveness profile.

Treatment records as well as hospital and outpatient charts of 49 patients with brain metastases between 2008 and 2012 who underwent S + Cs-131 (n = 24) and S + SRS (n = 25) were retrospectively reviewed. Hospital charges were compared for the single treatment in question. Means and curves of survival time were defined by the Kaplan-Meier estimator, with the cost analysis focusing on the time period of the relevant treatment. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) and Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for each treatment option as a measure of cost-effectiveness. The direct hospital costs of treatments per patient were: S + Cs131 = $19,271 and S + SRS = $44,219. The median survival times of S + Cs-131 and S + SRS were 15.5 and 11.3 months, and the 12 month survival rates were 61 % and 49 % (P = 0.137).

15533,Cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion,"BACKGROUND: Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) disorders are common in patients with chronic lower back pain. Minimally invasive surgical options have been shown to be effective for the treatment of chronic SIJ dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive SIJ fusion. METHODS: Data from two prospective, multicenter, clinical trials were used to inform a Markov process cost-utility model to evaluate cumulative 5-year health quality and costs after minimally invasive SIJ fusion using triangular titanium implants or non-surgical treatment. The analysis was performed from a third-party perspective. The model specifically incorporated variation in resource utilization observed in the randomized trial. Multiple one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: SIJ fusion was associated with a gain of approximately 0.74 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of US$13,313 per QALY gained. In multiple one-way sensitivity analyses all scenarios resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <$26,000/QALY. Probabilistic analyses showed a high degree of certainty that the maximum ICER for SIJ fusion was less than commonly selected thresholds for acceptability (mean ICER =$13,687, 95% confidence interval $5,162-$28,085). SIJ fusion provided potential cost savings per QALY gained compared to non-surgical treatment after a treatment horizon of greater than 13 years. CONCLUSION: Compared to traditional non-surgical treatments, SIJ fusion is a cost-effective, and, in the long term, cost-saving strategy for the treatment of SIJ dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SIJ disruption.",2016-01-20396,26719717,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Daniel J Cher,2016,8 /,1-14,No,26719717,"Daniel J Cher; Melissa A Frasco; Renee Jg Arnold; David W Polly; Cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2016; 8():1178-6981; 1-14",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) fusion surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Non-surgical treatment,Not Stated,70 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,13313,United States,2014,14554.4
15534,Cost-Effectiveness of Diagnostic Lobectomy Versus Observation for Thyroid Nodules >4 cm,"BACKGROUND: The management of thyroid nodules >4 cm with benign cytology after fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is controversial. FNAB is associated with a high false-negative rate in this setting, and may result in a delayed diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer. However, the majority of these nodules are benign. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the cost-utility of observation versus surgical management for thyroid nodules >4 cm with benign cytology after FNAB. METHODS: A microsimulation model comparing routine thyroid lobectomy with observation for low-risk patients with >4 cm thyroid nodules with benign FNAB cytology was constructed. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and life-years gained were calculated over a lifetime time horizon from a U.S. Medicare perspective. RESULTS: The proportion of patients undergoing thyroid lobectomy for benign final pathology was 40% in the observation strategy versus 66% in the surgical strategy (p < 0.001). Overall, the surgical strategy was associated with higher lifetime costs compared with the observation strategy (incremental difference: + US$12,992 [confidence interval (CI) 13,042-13,524]), but also more QALYs (+0.12 QALYs [CI 0.02-0.24]) and longer life expectancy (+1.67 years [CI 1.00-2.41]). Incremental lifetime costs were lower for patients <55 years compared with those >/=55 years (+11,181 vs. +14,811, p < 0.001). The probability of cost-effectiveness of the surgical strategy was 49% at a $100k/QALY threshold or 65% at a $100k/life-year gained threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Routine thyroid lobectomy is associated with improved outcomes at an acceptable cost compared with observation for thyroid nodules >4 cm with benign cytology after FNAB.

15535,Cost-effectiveness of droxidopa in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: post-hoc economic analysis of Phase 3 clinical trial data,"OBJECTIVE: Falls are associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and are an economic burden on the US healthcare system. Droxidopa is approved by the US FDA to treat symptomatic nOH. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of droxidopa vs standard of care from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was used to predict numbers of falls and treatment responses using data from a randomized, double-blind trial of patients with Parkinson's disease and nOH who received optimized droxidopa therapy or placebo for 8 weeks. The severity of falls, utility values, and injury-related costs were derived from published studies. Model outcomes included number of falls, number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and direct costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Outcomes were extrapolated over 12 months. RESULTS: Patients receiving droxidopa had fewer falls compared with those receiving standard of care and gained 0.33 QALYs/patient. Estimated droxidopa costs were $30,112, with estimated cost savings resulting from fall avoidance of $14,574 over 12 months. Droxidopa was cost-effective vs standard of care, with ICERs of $47,001/QALY gained, $24,866 per avoided fall with moderate/major injury, and $1559 per avoided fall with no/minor injury. The main drivers were fall probabilities and fear of fall-related inputs. LIMITATIONS: A limitation of the current study is the reliance on falls data from a randomized controlled trial where the placebo group served as the proxy for standard of care. Data from a larger patient population, reflecting 'real-life' patient use and/or comparison with other agents used to treat nOH, would have been a useful complement, but these data were not available.

15536,Cost-effectiveness of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF, also known as gastro-resistant DMF), an effective therapy for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), compared with glatiramer acetate and fingolimod, commonly used treatments in the US. METHODS: A Markov model was developed comparing delayed-release DMF to glatiramer acetate and fingolimod using a US payer perspective and 20-year time horizon. A cohort of patients, mean age 38 years, with relapsing-remitting MS and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0-6 entered the model. Efficacy and safety were estimated by mixed-treatment comparison of data from the DEFINE and CONFIRM trials and clinical trials of other disease-modifying therapies. Data from published studies were used to derive resource use, cost, and utility inputs. Key outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Alternative scenarios tested in a sensitivity analysis included drug efficacy, EDSS-related or relapse-related costs, alternative perspectives, drug acquisition costs, and utility. RESULTS: Base-case results with a 20-year time horizon indicated that delayed-release DMF increased QALYs +0.450 or +0.359 compared with glatiramer acetate or fingolimod, respectively. Reductions in 20-year costs with delayed-release DMF were -$70,644 compared with once-daily glatiramer acetate and -$32,958 compared with fingolimod. In an analysis comparing delayed-release DMF to three-times-weekly glatiramer acetate and assuming similar efficacy and safety to the once-daily formulation, 20-year costs with delayed-release DMF were increased by $15,806 and cost per QALY gained was $35,142. The differences in costs were most sensitive to acquisition cost and inclusion of informal care costs and productivity losses. The differences in QALYs were most sensitive to the impact of delayed-release DMF on disease progression and the EDSS utility weights.

15538,Early Cholecystectomy for Acute Cholecystitis Offers the Best Outcomes at the Least Cost: A Model-Based Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The application of early cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis remains inconsistent across hospitals worldwide. Given the constrained nature of health care spending, careful consideration of costs relative to the clinical consequences of alternative treatments should support decision making. We present a cost-utility analysis comparing alternative time frames of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model with a 5-year time horizon was developed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from 3 alternative management strategies for the treatment of acute cholecystitis: early cholecystectomy (within 7 days of presentation), delayed elective cholecystectomy (8 to 12 weeks from presentation), and watchful waiting, where cholecystectomy is performed urgently only if recurrent symptoms arise. Model inputs were selected to reflect patients with uncomplicated acute cholecystitis-without concurrent common bile duct obstruction, pancreatitis, or severe sepsis. Real-world outcome probability and cost estimates included in the model were derived from analysis of population-based administrative databases for the province of Ontario, Canada. The QALY values were derived from utilities identified in published literature. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Early cholecystectomy was less costly (C$6,905 per person) and more effective (4.20 QALYs per person) than delayed cholecystectomy (C$8,511; 4.18 QALYs per person) or watchful waiting (C$7,274; 3.99 QALYs per person). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed early cholecystectomy was the preferred management in 72% of model iterations, given a cost-effectiveness threshold of C$50,000 per QALY.

15540,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Deep Brain Stimulation in Patients with Parkinson's Disease in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical option for treating Parkinson''s disease (PD). DBS is invasive, with a high initial cost. In Japan, questions have been raised about its cost-effectiveness and the resulting improvements in outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBS for PD in Japan, particularly whether early or late DBS is more cost-effective. METHODS: We used a Markov cohort simulation to follow the clinical course of DBS for PD. We conducted a survey to capture QOL scores among healthy Japanese volunteers. Transition probabilities were estimated from randomized clinical trials. We determined direct medical costs from the perspective of the Japanese health care system. Outcomes were assessed as quality-adjusted life years. We conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: DBS costs an additional 10.3 million Japanese yen (US$85,100; exchange rate on October 28, 2015 was 121 yen to $1) for a gain of 3.2 quality-adjusted life years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 3.1 million yen ($25,600).

15543,Optimal use of colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test for population-based colorectal cancer screening: a cost-effectiveness analysis using Japanese data,"OBJECTIVE: There have been few cost-effectiveness analyses of population-based colorectal cancer screening in Japan, and there is no consensus on the optimal use of total colonoscopy and the fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer screening with regard to cost-effectiveness and total colonoscopy workload. The present study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening using Japanese data to identify the optimal use of total colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening offered to an average-risk population aged 40 years or over. The cost, quality-adjusted life-years and number of total colonoscopy procedures required were evaluated for three screening strategies: (i) a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy; (ii) a total colonoscopy-based strategy; (iii) a strategy of adding population-wide total colonoscopy at 50 years to a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy. RESULTS: All three strategies dominated no screening. Among the three, Strategy 1 was dominated by Strategy 3, and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained for Strategy 2 against Strategies 1 and 3 were JPY 293 616 and JPY 781 342, respectively. Within the Japanese threshold (JPY 5-6 million per QALY gained), Strategy 2 was the most cost-effective, followed by Strategy 3; however, Strategy 2 required more than double the number of total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The total colonoscopy-based strategy could be the most cost-effective for population-based colorectal cancer screening in Japan. However, it requires more total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies.

The cost, quality-adjusted life-years and number of total colonoscopy procedures required were evaluated for three screening strategies: (i) a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy; (ii) a total colonoscopy-based strategy; (iii) a strategy of adding population-wide total colonoscopy at 50 years to a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy. RESULTS: All three strategies dominated no screening. Among the three, Strategy 1 was dominated by Strategy 3, and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained for Strategy 2 against Strategies 1 and 3 were JPY 293 616 and JPY 781 342, respectively. Within the Japanese threshold (JPY 5-6 million per QALY gained), Strategy 2 was the most cost-effective, followed by Strategy 3; however, Strategy 2 required more than double the number of total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The total colonoscopy-based strategy could be the most cost-effective for population-based colorectal cancer screening in Japan. However, it requires more total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies. Depending on total colonoscopy capacity, the strategy of adding total colonoscopy for individuals at a specified age to a fecal immunochemical test-based screening may be an optimal solution.",2016-01-20481,26685321,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Masau Sekiguchi,2016,46 / 2,116-25,No,26685321,"Masau Sekiguchi; Ataru Igarashi; Takahisa Matsuda; Minori Matsumoto; Taku Sakamoto; Takeshi Nakajima; Yasuo Kakugawa; Seiichiro Yamamoto; Hiroshi Saito; Yutaka Saito; Optimal use of colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test for population-based colorectal cancer screening: a cost-effectiveness analysis using Japanese data, Jpn J Clin Oncol, 2016 Feb; 46(2):1465-3621; 116-25",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,A total colonoscopy-based strategy vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-256364.05,Japan,2013,-2922.95

15549,Comparative Effectiveness of Esophagectomy Versus Endoscopic Treatment for Esophageal High-grade Dysplasia,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of esophagectomy versus endoscopic mucosal resection followed by radiofrequency ablation (EMR-RFA) for the treatment of Barrett esophagus with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). BACKGROUND: HGD of the esophagus may be managed by surgical resection or EMR-RFA. National guidelines suggest that EMR-RFA is effective at eradicating HGD. The comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EMR-RFA versus esophagectomy for HGD remains unclear. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was constructed to represent 3 management strategies for HGD: (1) esophagectomy, (2) EMR-RFA, and (3) endoscopic surveillance. Estimates for model variables were obtained from literature review, and costs were estimated from Medicare fee schedules. Costs and utilities were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The baseline model was adjusted for alternative age groups and high-risk dysplastic variants. One-way and multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: For a 65-year-old patient, compared to esophagectomy, EMR-RFA yields equivalent utility (11.5 vs 11.4 discounted quality-adjusted life years) with lower total cost ($52.5K vs $74.3K) over the first 20 years. Dominance of EMR-RFA over esophagectomy persists for all age groups. Patients with diffuse or ulcerated HGD are more effectively treated with esophagectomy. Model outcomes are sensitive to estimated rates of disease progression and postintervention utility parameters.

15552,The cost-effectiveness of screening for gestational diabetes mellitus in primary and secondary care in the Republic of Ireland,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in primary and secondary care settings, compared with a no-screening option, in the Republic of Ireland. METHODS: The analysis was based on a decision-tree model of alternative screening strategies in primary and secondary care settings. It synthesised data generated from a randomised controlled trial (screening uptake) and from the literature. Costs included those relating to GDM screening and treatment, and the care of adverse outcomes. Effects were assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The impact of the parameter uncertainty was assessed in a range of sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Screening in either setting was found to be superior to no screening, i.e. it provided for QALY gains and cost savings. Screening in secondary care was found to be superior to screening in primary care, providing for modest QALY gains of 0.0006 and a saving of euro21.43 per screened case. The conclusion held with high certainty across the range of ceiling ratios from zero to euro100,000 per QALY and across a plausible range of input parameters.

15555,Cost-Effectiveness Modelling of Sofosbuvir-Containing Regimens for Chronic Genotype 5 Hepatitis C Virus Infection in South Africa,"BACKGROUND: The recently launched nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir represents a significant turn in the treatment paradigm of chronic hepatitis C. While effective, sofosbuvir is also associated with a considerable cost. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of sofosbuvir-containing regimens in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 5 (HCV-G5) mono-infection in South Africa (SA). DESIGN: We constructed a lifetime horizon decision-analytic Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection to evaluate the cost effectiveness of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) monotherapy against sofosbuvir triple therapy (SOF-TT) (sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon and ribavirin [peg-INF/RBV]) and the current standard of care (SOC) (peg-INF/RBV) for patients with chronic HCV-G5 in the South African context. The model was populated with data from published literature, expert opinion and South African private sector cost data. The price modelled for sofosbuvir was the predicted South African private sector price of 82,129.32 South African rand (R) (US$7000) for 12 weeks. The analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were discounted and undiscounted costs (in 2015 South African rand and US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Outcomes from the cost-effectiveness model show that SOF/LDV yields the most favourable future health economic outcomes compared with SOF-TT and the current SOC in SA. Findings relating to the lifetime incremental cost per QALY gained for patients infected with HCV-G5 indicate that SOF/LDV dominated both SOF-TT and SOC, i.e. SOF/LDV is less costly and more effective. CONCLUSION: Outcomes from this analysis suggest that at a price of R123,190 ($US10,500) for 12 weeks of SOF/LDV might be cost effective for South African patients infected with HCV-G5.",2016-01-20510,26666639,Pharmacoeconomics,Ilanca Fraser,2016,34 / 4,403-17,Yes,26666639,"Ilanca Fraser; Johanita Burger; Martie Lubbe; George Dranitsaris; Mark Sonderup; Tienie Stander; Cost-Effectiveness Modelling of Sofosbuvir-Containing Regimens for Chronic Genotype 5 Hepatitis C Virus Infection in South Africa, Pharmacoeconomics, 2016 Apr; 34(4):1179-2027; 403-17",QALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sofosbuvir-ledipasvir vs. Sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon and ribavirin,"Treatment-naïve, HIV-negative patients",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-86287.36,South Africa,2015,-7425.23

DESIGN: We constructed a lifetime horizon decision-analytic Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection to evaluate the cost effectiveness of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) monotherapy against sofosbuvir triple therapy (SOF-TT) (sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon and ribavirin [peg-INF/RBV]) and the current standard of care (SOC) (peg-INF/RBV) for patients with chronic HCV-G5 in the South African context. The model was populated with data from published literature, expert opinion and South African private sector cost data. The price modelled for sofosbuvir was the predicted South African private sector price of 82,129.32 South African rand (R) (US$7000) for 12 weeks. The analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were discounted and undiscounted costs (in 2015 South African rand and US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Outcomes from the cost-effectiveness model show that SOF/LDV yields the most favourable future health economic outcomes compared with SOF-TT and the current SOC in SA. Findings relating to the lifetime incremental cost per QALY gained for patients infected with HCV-G5 indicate that SOF/LDV dominated both SOF-TT and SOC, i.e. SOF/LDV is less costly and more effective. CONCLUSION: Outcomes from this analysis suggest that at a price of R123,190 ($US10,500) for 12 weeks of SOF/LDV might be cost effective for South African patients infected with HCV-G5.",2016-01-20510,26666639,Pharmacoeconomics,Ilanca Fraser,2016,34 / 4,403-17,Yes,26666639,"Ilanca Fraser; Johanita Burger; Martie Lubbe; George Dranitsaris; Mark Sonderup; Tienie Stander; Cost-Effectiveness Modelling of Sofosbuvir-Containing Regimens for Chronic Genotype 5 Hepatitis C Virus Infection in South Africa, Pharmacoeconomics, 2016 Apr; 34(4):1179-2027; 403-17",QALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon and ribavirin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Pegylated interferon and ribavirin,"Treatment-naïve, HIV-negative patients",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-77242.07,South Africa,2015,-6646.86

15558,The Cost-effectiveness and Budget Impact of 2-Drug Dolutegravir-Lamivudine Regimens for the Treatment of HIV Infection in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Recommended human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment regimens in the United States contain 3 antiretroviral agents, costing >$30 000/person/year. Pilot studies are evaluating the efficacy of dual therapy with dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC). We examined the potential cost-effectiveness and budget impact of DTG + 3TC regimens in the United States. METHODS: Using a mathematical model, we projected the clinical and economic outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive patients under 4 strategies: (1) no ART (for modeling comparison); (2) 2-drug: initial regimen of DTG + 3TC; (3) induction-maintenance: 48-week induction regimen of 3 drugs (DTG/abacavir [ABC]/3TC), followed by DTG + 3TC maintenance if virologically suppressed; and (4) standard of care: 3-drug regimen of DTG/ABC/3TC. Strategy-dependent model inputs, varied widely in sensitivity analyses, included 48-week virologic suppression (88%-93%), subsequent virologic failure (0.1%-0.6%/month), and Medicaid-discounted ART costs ($15 200-$39 600/year). A strategy was considered cost-effective if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was <$100 000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: The 3 ART strategies had the same 5-year survival rates (90%). The ICER was $22 500/QALY for induction-maintenance and >$500 000/QALY for standard of care. Two-drug was the preferred strategy only when DTG + 3TC 48-week virologic suppression rate exceeded 90%.

15561,Retrospective economic evaluation of childhood 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Australia: Uncertain herd impact on pneumonia critical,"BACKGROUND: Retrospective cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccination programs using routinely collected post-implementation data are sparse by comparison with pre-program analyses. We performed a retrospective economic evaluation of the childhood 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) program in Australia. METHODS: We developed a deterministic multi-compartment model that describes health states related to invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease. Costs (Australian dollars, A$) and health effects (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were attached to model states. The perspective for costs was that of the healthcare system and government. Where possible, we used observed changes in the disease rates from national surveillance and healthcare databases to estimate the impact of the PCV7 program (2005-2010). We stratified our cost-effectiveness results into alternative scenarios which differed by the outcome states included. Parameter uncertainty was explored using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The PCV7 program was estimated to have prevented approximately 5900 hospitalisations and approximately 160 deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Approximately half of these were prevented in adults via herd protection. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately A$161,000 per QALY gained when including only IPD-related outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of PCV7 remained in the range A$88,000-$122,000 when changes in various non-invasive disease states were included. The inclusion of observed changes in adult non-invasive pneumonia deaths substantially improved cost-effectiveness ( approximately A$9000 per QALY gained). CONCLUSION: Using the initial vaccine price negotiated for Australia, the PCV7 program was unlikely to have been cost-effective (at conventional thresholds) unless observed reductions in non-invasive pneumonia deaths in the elderly are attributed to it. Further analyses are required to explore this finding, which has significant implications for the incremental benefit achievable by adult PCV programs.",2016-01-20525,26657187,Vaccine,A T Newall,2016,34 / 3,320-7,Yes,26657187,"A T Newall; J F Reyes; P McIntyre; R Menzies; P Beutels; J G Wood; Retrospective economic evaluation of childhood 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Australia: Uncertain herd impact on pneumonia critical, Vaccine, 2016 Jan 12; 34(3):1873-2518; 320-7",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Childhood 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) (Limits impact to those outcomes which flow directlyfrom IPD notification changes across all ages) vs. None,Not Stated,2 Years,0 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,166172,Australia,2005,167949.85
15562,Cost-Effectiveness of Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy with Low Glucose Suspend Versus Standard Insulin Pump Therapy in Two Different Patient Populations with Type 1 Diabetes in France,"BACKGROUND: Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) provides a useful adjunct relative to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) alone. It can provide early warning of the onset of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and has the functionality to suspend insulin delivery if sensor glucose levels fall below a predefined threshold. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SAP with low glucose suspend (LGS) versus CSII alone in type 1 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the CORE Diabetes Model, using published clinical input data. The analysis was performed in two cohorts: one with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin at baseline and one at elevated risk for hypoglycemic events. The analysis was conducted from a healthcare payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon; future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 4% per annum. RESULTS: In patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin at baseline, SAP + LGS resulted in improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) versus CSII (10.55 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] vs. 9.36 QALYs) but higher mean lifetime direct costs (euro84,972 vs. euro49,171) resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro30,163 per QALY gained.

15564,UK Lung Cancer RCT Pilot Screening Trial: baseline findings from the screening arm provide evidence for the potential implementation of lung cancer screening,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT (LDCT) was shown to reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% in the National Lung Screening Trial. METHODS: The pilot UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) is a randomised controlled trial of LDCT screening for lung cancer versus usual care. A population-based questionnaire was used to identify high-risk individuals. CT screen-detected nodules were managed by a pre-specified protocol. Cost effectiveness was modelled with reference to the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial mortality reduction. RESULTS: 247 354 individuals aged 50-75 years were approached; 30.7% expressed an interest, 8729 (11.5%) were eligible and 4055 were randomised, 2028 into the CT arm (1994 underwent a CT). Forty-two participants (2.1%) had confirmed lung cancer, 34 (1.7%) at baseline and 8 (0.4%) at the 12-month scan. 28/42 (66.7%) had stage I disease, 36/42 (85.7%) had stage I or II disease. 35/42 (83.3%) had surgical resection. 536 subjects had nodules greater than 50 mm(3) or 5 mm diameter and 41/536 were found to have lung cancer. One further cancer was detected by follow-up of nodules between 15 and 50 mm(3) at 12 months. The baseline estimate for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of once-only CT screening, under the UKLS protocol, was pound8466 per quality adjusted life year gained (CI pound5542 to pound12 569). CONCLUSIONS: The UKLS pilot trial demonstrated that it is possible to detect lung cancer at an early stage and deliver potentially curative treatment in over 80% of cases. Health economic analysis suggests that the intervention would be cost effective-this needs to be confirmed using data on observed lung cancer mortality reduction.

15567,Cost-utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in cT1-T2N0 oral cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To calculate the cost-utility of different strategies for the detection of occult lymph node metastases in cT1-T2N0 oral cancer. METHODS: A decision tree followed by a Markov model was designed to compare the cost-utility of the following strategies: (a) USgFNAC (ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology), (b) SLNB (sentinel lymph node biopsy), (c) USgFNAC and, if negative, SLNB (d) END (elective neck dissection). Data was collected from 62 patients in four Dutch head and neck centres. Utilities were measured with the EQ5D questionnaire and resource use was recorded from patient charts. Costs were calculated from a hospital perspective. Uncertainty was explored with scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: With a 5- or 10-year time horizon, SLNB results in the highest number of additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs, 0.12 and 0.26, respectively) for the smallest additional costs (euro56 and euro74, respectively) compared to USgFNAC. With a lifetime horizon END results in the highest number of additional QALYs (0.55) for an additional euro1.626 per QALY gained compared to USgFNAC. When we make different assumptions regarding the duration of disutilities (5 years) or the improvement (3%) of sensitivity of SLNB, SLNB is the most favourable strategy from all time horizons. CONCLUSION: SLNB is a good diagnostic strategy to evaluate cT1-T2N0 oral cancer. SLNB is the preferred strategy in a 5- or 10-year time horizon. From a lifetime horizon, END may be preferred.

15580,Comparative cost-effectiveness of 11 oral antipsychotics for relapse prevention in schizophrenia within Singapore using effectiveness estimates from a network meta-analysis,"This study modelled the cost-effectiveness of 11 oral antipsychotics for relapse prevention among patients with remitted schizophrenia in Singapore. A network meta-analysis determined the relative efficacy and tolerability of 11 oral antipsychotics (amisulpride, aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sulpiride, trifluoperazine and ziprasidone). The clinical estimates were applied in a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years gained. Quality-of-life data were obtained from published literature. Resource utilization and cost data were retrieved from local hospital databases. The annual direct cost of healthcare services for a patient experiencing a relapse episode was three-fold that of a patient not in relapse of schizophrenia. The most favourable pharmacological treatment for relapse prevention was olanzapine with an annual probability of relapse of 0.24 (0.13-0.38) with placebo as a reference of 0.75 (0.73-0.78). Olanzapine emerged as the dominant treatment with the highest quality-adjusted life-years gained and lowest lifetime costs.

15581,An economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet versus care as usual in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy: An interim analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the cost-effectiveness of the ketogenic (KD) diet compared with care as usual (CAU) in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy, we conducted an economic evaluation from a societal perspective, alongside a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Participants from a tertiary epilepsy center were randomized into KD (intervention) group or CAU (control) group. Seizure frequency, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), health care costs, production losses of parents and patient, and family costs were assessed at baseline and during a 4-month study period and compared between the intervention and control groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e., cost per QALY and cost per responder), and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were calculated and presented. RESULTS: In total, 48 children were included in the analyses of this study (26 KD group). At 4 months, 50% of the participants in the KD group had a seizure reduction >/=50% from baseline, compared with 18.2 of the participants in the CAU group. The mean costs per patient in the CAU group were euro15,245 compared to euro20,986 per patient in the KD group, resulting in an ICER of euro18,044 per responder. We failed, however, to measure any benefits in terms of QALYs and therefore, the cost per QALY rise high above any acceptable ceiling ratio. It might be that the quality of life instruments used in this study were not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes, or it might be that being a clinical responder is not sufficient to improve a patient's quality of life. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses and nonparametric bootstrapping were performed and demonstrated the robustness of our results. SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that the KD reduces seizure frequency. The study did not find any improvements in quality of life and, therefore, unfavorable cost per QALY ratio's resulted.",2016-01-20603,26617284,Epilepsia,Reina J A de Kinderen,2016,57 / 1,41-50,No,26617284,"Reina J A de Kinderen; Danielle A J E Lambrechts; Ben F M Wijnen; Debby Postulart; Albert P Aldenkamp; Marian H J M Majoie; Silvia M A A Evers; An economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet versus care as usual in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy: An interim analysis, Epilepsia, 2016 Jan; 57(1):0013-9580; 41-50",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ketogenic Diet vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,1913666.63,Euro,2013,2823689.31
15582,Cost-effectiveness of national mandatory screening of all admissions to English National Health Service hospitals for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a mathematical modelling study,"BACKGROUND: In December, 2010, National Health Service (NHS) England introduced national mandatory screening of all admissions for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this policy, from a regional or national health-care decision makers' perspective, compared with alternative screening strategies. METHODS: We used an individual-based dynamic transmission model parameterised with national MRSA audit data to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of admission screening of patients in English NHS hospitals compared with five alternative strategies (including no screening, checklist-activated screening, and high-risk specialty-based screening), accompanied by patient isolation and decolonisation, over a 5 year time horizon. We evaluated strategies for different NHS hospital types (acute, teaching, and specialist), MRSA prevalence, and transmission potentials using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of screening all admissions was pound89 000-148 000 (range pound68 000-222 000), and this strategy was consistently more costly and less effective than alternatives for all hospital types. At a pound30 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and current prevalence, only the no-screening strategy was cost effective. The next best strategies were, in acute and teaching hospitals, targeting of high-risk specialty admissions (30-40% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] pound45 200 [range pound35 300-61 400] and pound48 000/QALY [ pound34 600-74 800], respectively) and, in specialist hospitals, screening these patients plus risk-factor-based screening of low-risk specialties (a roughly 20% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean ICER pound62 600/QALY [ pound48 000-89 400]). As prevalence and transmission increased, targeting of high-risk specialties became the optimum strategy at the NHS willingness-to-pay threshold ( pound30 000/QALY). Switching from screening all admissions to only high-risk specialty admissions resulted in a mean reduction in total costs per year (not considering uncertainty) of pound2.7 million per acute hospital, pound2.9 million per teaching, and pound474 000 per specialist hospital for a minimum rise in infections (about one infection per year per hospital). INTERPRETATION: Our results show that screening all admissions for MRSA is unlikely to be cost effective in England at the current NHS willingness-to-pay threshold, and our findings informed modified guidance to NHS England in 2014. Screening admissions to high-risk specialties is likely to represent better resource use in terms of cost per QALY gained.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this policy, from a regional or national health-care decision makers' perspective, compared with alternative screening strategies. METHODS: We used an individual-based dynamic transmission model parameterised with national MRSA audit data to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of admission screening of patients in English NHS hospitals compared with five alternative strategies (including no screening, checklist-activated screening, and high-risk specialty-based screening), accompanied by patient isolation and decolonisation, over a 5 year time horizon. We evaluated strategies for different NHS hospital types (acute, teaching, and specialist), MRSA prevalence, and transmission potentials using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of screening all admissions was pound89 000-148 000 (range pound68 000-222 000), and this strategy was consistently more costly and less effective than alternatives for all hospital types. At a pound30 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and current prevalence, only the no-screening strategy was cost effective. The next best strategies were, in acute and teaching hospitals, targeting of high-risk specialty admissions (30-40% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] pound45 200 [range pound35 300-61 400] and pound48 000/QALY [ pound34 600-74 800], respectively) and, in specialist hospitals, screening these patients plus risk-factor-based screening of low-risk specialties (a roughly 20% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean ICER pound62 600/QALY [ pound48 000-89 400]). As prevalence and transmission increased, targeting of high-risk specialties became the optimum strategy at the NHS willingness-to-pay threshold ( pound30 000/QALY). Switching from screening all admissions to only high-risk specialty admissions resulted in a mean reduction in total costs per year (not considering uncertainty) of pound2.7 million per acute hospital, pound2.9 million per teaching, and pound474 000 per specialist hospital for a minimum rise in infections (about one infection per year per hospital). INTERPRETATION: Our results show that screening all admissions for MRSA is unlikely to be cost effective in England at the current NHS willingness-to-pay threshold, and our findings informed modified guidance to NHS England in 2014.

The next best strategies were, in acute and teaching hospitals, targeting of high-risk specialty admissions (30-40% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] pound45 200 [range pound35 300-61 400] and pound48 000/QALY [ pound34 600-74 800], respectively) and, in specialist hospitals, screening these patients plus risk-factor-based screening of low-risk specialties (a roughly 20% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean ICER pound62 600/QALY [ pound48 000-89 400]). As prevalence and transmission increased, targeting of high-risk specialties became the optimum strategy at the NHS willingness-to-pay threshold ( pound30 000/QALY). Switching from screening all admissions to only high-risk specialty admissions resulted in a mean reduction in total costs per year (not considering uncertainty) of pound2.7 million per acute hospital, pound2.9 million per teaching, and pound474 000 per specialist hospital for a minimum rise in infections (about one infection per year per hospital). INTERPRETATION: Our results show that screening all admissions for MRSA is unlikely to be cost effective in England at the current NHS willingness-to-pay threshold, and our findings informed modified guidance to NHS England in 2014. Screening admissions to high-risk specialties is likely to represent better resource use in terms of cost per QALY gained.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this policy, from a regional or national health-care decision makers' perspective, compared with alternative screening strategies. METHODS: We used an individual-based dynamic transmission model parameterised with national MRSA audit data to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of admission screening of patients in English NHS hospitals compared with five alternative strategies (including no screening, checklist-activated screening, and high-risk specialty-based screening), accompanied by patient isolation and decolonisation, over a 5 year time horizon. We evaluated strategies for different NHS hospital types (acute, teaching, and specialist), MRSA prevalence, and transmission potentials using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of screening all admissions was pound89 000-148 000 (range pound68 000-222 000), and this strategy was consistently more costly and less effective than alternatives for all hospital types.
