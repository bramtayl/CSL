21601,Reducing caesarean delivery: An economic evaluation of routine induction of labour at 39 weeks in low-risk nulliparous women,"BACKGROUND: Clinical interventions known to reduce the risk of caesarean delivery include routine induction of labour at 39 weeks, caseload midwifery and chart audit, but they have not been compared for cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assesses the cost-effectiveness of three different interventions known to reduce caesarean delivery rates compared to standard care; and conduct a budget impact analysis. METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model was constructed to compare the costs and outcomes produced by the different interventions. Costs included all costs to the health system, and outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. A budget impact analysis was undertaken using this model to quantify the costs (in Australian dollars) over three years for government health system funders. RESULTS: All interventions, plus standard care, produced similar health outcomes (mean of 1.84 QALYs gained over 105 weeks). Caseload midwifery was the lowest cost option at $15 587 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15 269, 15 905), followed by routine induction of labour ($16 257, 95% CI 15 989, 16 536), and chart audit ($16 325, 95% CI 15 979, 16 671). All produced lower costs on average than standard care ($16 905, 95% CI 16 551, 17 259). Caseload midwifery would produce the greatest savings of $172.6 million over three years if implemented for all low-risk nulliparous women in Australia.

21604,Impact of Treating Oral Disease on Preventing Vascular Diseases: A Model-Based Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Periodontal Treatment Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: Previous randomized trials found that treating periodontitis improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), thus lowering the risks of developing T2D-related microvascular diseases and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Some payers in the U.S. have started covering nonsurgical periodontal treatment for those with chronic conditions, such as diabetes. We sought to identify the cost-effectiveness of expanding periodontal treatment coverage among patients with T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate lifetime costs and health gains using a stochastic microsimulation model of oral health conditions, T2D, T2D-related microvascular diseases, and CVD of the U.S. POPULATION: Model parameters were obtained from the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2009-2014) and randomized trials of periodontal treatment among patients with T2D. RESULTS: Expanding periodontal treatment coverage among patients with T2D and periodontitis would be expected to avert tooth loss by 34.1% (95% CI -39.9, -26.5), and microvascular diseases by 20.5% (95% CI -31.2, -9.1), 17.7% (95% CI -32.7, -4.7), and 19.2% (95% CI -18.4, -3.5) for nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, respectively. Providing periodontal treatment to the target population would be cost saving from a health care perspective at a total net savings of 5,904 USD (95% CI -6,039, -5,769) with an estimated gain of 0.6 QALYs per capita (95% CI 0.5, 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Providing nonsurgical periodontal treatment to patients with T2D and periodontitis would be expected to significantly reduce tooth loss and T2D-related microvascular diseases via improved glycemic control. Encouraging patients with T2D and poor oral health conditions to receive periodontal treatment would improve health outcomes and still be cost saving or cost-effective.",2019-01-30911,31882408,Diabetes Care,Sung Eun Choi,2019,/,,No,31882408,"Sung Eun Choi; Ally Murji; Mohamed Bedaiwy; Sukhbir Sony Singh; Olga Bougie; CAPTURE Registry Steering Commit; Impact of Treating Oral Disease on Preventing Vascular Diseases: A Model-Based Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Periodontal Treatment Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes, Diabetes Care, 2019 Jun 12; ():0149-5992",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Other",expanding periodontal treatment coverage vs. Standard Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-10357.89,United States,2019,-10485.68
21605,An economic analysis of different treatments for bleeding in patients with acquired haemophilia,"BACKGROUND: Acquired haemophilia A (AHA), with potentially high risk of morbidity and mortality, occurs as a result of inhibitors against factor VIII. Bleeding due to AHA can be treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC), recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) or recently, recombinant porcine-sequence factor VIII (rpFVIII). We extended our previous cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) comparing rpFVIII against the available traditional options. METHODS: For high-titred, haemorrhaging AHA patients treated with either aPCC, rFVIIa or rpFVIII, over the course of 6-days, a Markov simulation was conducted to evaluate the outcomes when these patients transitioned into any of the four following health states: (1) continuous bleeding, (2) thrombosis, (3) stop bleeding and (4) death, with states (2), (3) and (4) modelled as absorbing states. All model parameters were obtained from the medical literature, except the costs of aPCC, rFVIIa and the factor VIII assay, which came from our institutional data. RESULTS: Excluding the cost of the initial treatment on day 0, the total subsequent treatment cost of rFVIIa was substantially more than the costs of aPCC and rpFVIII ($13 925 vs. $1778 vs. $6957, respectively). The average quality-adjusted life days (QALDs) gained from rpFVIII was lowest (4.89 vs. 4.9 for rFVIIa and 4.91 for aPCC). Overall, aPCC dominated the other two treatments. The model was determined to be robust across the tested ranges for all input variables.

21607,Obesity negatively effects cost efficiency and outcomes following adult spinal deformity surgery,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Obesity has risen to epidemic proportions within the United States. As the rates of obesity have increased, so has its prevalence among patients undergoing adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. The effect of obesity on the cost efficiency of corrective procedures for ASD has not been effectively evaluated. PURPOSE: To investigate differences in cost efficiency of ASD surgery for patients stratified by body mass index (BMI). STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of a single center ASD database. PATIENT SAMPLE: 505 ASD patients OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications, revisions, costs, EuroQol-5D (EQ5D), quality adjusted life years (QALYS), cost per QALY. METHODS: ASD patients (scoliosis>/=20 degrees , SVA>/=5cm, PT>/=25 degrees , or TK >/=60 degrees ) >/=18, undergoing >/=4 level fusions were included. Patients were stratified into NIH-defined obesity groups based on their preoperative BMI: underweight 18.5< (U), normal 18.5-24.9 (N), overweight 25.0-29.9 (O), obese I 30.0-34.9 (OI), obese II 35.0-39.9 (OII), and obesity class III 40.0+(OIII). Total surgery costs for each ASD obesity group were calculated. Costs were calculated using the PearlDiver database, which reflects both private insurance and Medicare reimbursement claims. Overall complications (CC) and major complications (MCC) were assessed according to CMS. DEFINITIONS: QALYs and cost per QALY for obesity groups were calculated using an annual 3% discount up to life expectancy (78.7 years). RESULTS: In all, 505 patients met inclusion criteria. Baseline demographics and surgical details were: age 60.8 +/- 14.8, 67.6% female, BMI 28.8 +/- 7.30, 81.0% posterior approach, 18% combined approach, 10.1 +/- 4.2 levels fused, op time 441.2 +/- 146.1 minutes, EBL 1903.8 +/- 1594.7 cc, LOS 8.7 +/- 10.7 days. There were 17 U, 154 N patients, 151 O patients, 100 OI, 51 OII, and 32 OIII patients. Revision rates by obesity group were: 0% U, 3% N patients, 3% O patients, 5% OI, 4% OII, and 6% for OIII patients. The total surgery costs by obesity group were: $48,757.86 U, $49,688.52 N, $47,219.93 O, $50,467.66 OI, $51,189.47 OII, and $53,855.79 OIII. In an analysis of patients with baseline and 1Y EQ5D follow up, the cost per QALY by obesity group was: $153,737.78 U, $229,222.37 N, $290,361.68 O, $493,588.47 OI, $327,876.21 OII, and $171,680.00 OIII.

CONCLUSIONS: Among adult spinal deformity patients, those with BMIs in the obesity I, obesity II, or obesity class III range had more expensive total surgery costs.

Patients were stratified into NIH-defined obesity groups based on their preoperative BMI: underweight 18.5< (U), normal 18.5-24.9 (N), overweight 25.0-29.9 (O), obese I 30.0-34.9 (OI), obese II 35.0-39.9 (OII), and obesity class III 40.0+(OIII). Total surgery costs for each ASD obesity group were calculated. Costs were calculated using the PearlDiver database, which reflects both private insurance and Medicare reimbursement claims. Overall complications (CC) and major complications (MCC) were assessed according to CMS. DEFINITIONS: QALYs and cost per QALY for obesity groups were calculated using an annual 3% discount up to life expectancy (78.7 years). RESULTS: In all, 505 patients met inclusion criteria. Baseline demographics and surgical details were: age 60.8 +/- 14.8, 67.6% female, BMI 28.8 +/- 7.30, 81.0% posterior approach, 18% combined approach, 10.1 +/- 4.2 levels fused, op time 441.2 +/- 146.1 minutes, EBL 1903.8 +/- 1594.7 cc, LOS 8.7 +/- 10.7 days. There were 17 U, 154 N patients, 151 O patients, 100 OI, 51 OII, and 32 OIII patients. Revision rates by obesity group were: 0% U, 3% N patients, 3% O patients, 5% OI, 4% OII, and 6% for OIII patients. The total surgery costs by obesity group were: $48,757.86 U, $49,688.52 N, $47,219.93 O, $50,467.66 OI, $51,189.47 OII, and $53,855.79 OIII. In an analysis of patients with baseline and 1Y EQ5D follow up, the cost per QALY by obesity group was: $153,737.78 U, $229,222.37 N, $290,361.68 O, $493,588.47 OI, $327,876.21 OII, and $171,680.00 OIII. If that benefit was sustained to life expectancy, the cost per QALY was $8,588.70 U, $12,805.72 N, $16,221.32 O, $27,574.77 OI, $18,317.11 OII, and $9,591.06 for OIII. CONCLUSIONS: Among adult spinal deformity patients, those with BMIs in the obesity I, obesity II, or obesity class III range had more expensive total surgery costs. When assessing 1 year cost per quality adjusted life year, obese patients had costs 32% higher than non-obese patients ($224,440.61 vs. $331,048.23).

21613,Lead-I ECG for detecting atrial fibrillation in patients attending primary care with an irregular pulse using single-time point testing: A systematic review and economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with increased risk of stroke and congestive heart failure. Lead-I electrocardiogram (ECG) devices are handheld instruments that can detect AF at a single-time point. PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic test accuracy, clinical impact and cost effectiveness of single-time point lead-I ECG devices compared with manual pulse palpation (MPP) followed by a 12-lead ECG for the detection of AF in symptomatic primary care patients with an irregular pulse. METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print and MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment Database) were searched to March 2018. Two reviewers screened the search results, extracted data and assessed study quality. Summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy were calculated using bivariate models. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using an economic model consisting of a decision tree and two cohort Markov models. RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy The diagnostic accuracy (13 publications reporting on nine studies) and clinical impact (24 publications reporting on 19 studies) results are derived from an asymptomatic population (used as a proxy for people with signs or symptoms of AF). The summary sensitivity of lead-I ECG devices was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.2% to 97.4%) and summary specificity was 96.5% (95% CI: 90.4% to 98.8%). Cost effectiveness The de novo economic model yielded incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The results of the pairwise analysis show that all lead-I ECG devices generate ICERs per QALY gained below the pound20,000- pound30,000 threshold. Kardia Mobile is the most cost effective option in a full incremental analysis. Lead-I ECG tests may identify more AF cases than the standard diagnostic pathway. This comes at a higher cost but with greater patient benefit in terms of mortality and quality of life. LIMITATIONS: No published data evaluating the diagnostic accuracy, clinical impact or cost effectiveness of lead-I ECG devices for the target population are available. CONCLUSIONS: The use of single-time point lead-I ECG devices in primary care for the detection of AF in people with signs or symptoms of AF and an irregular pulse appears to be a cost effective use of NHS resources compared with MPP followed by a 12-lead ECG, given the assumptions used in the base case model.

PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic test accuracy, clinical impact and cost effectiveness of single-time point lead-I ECG devices compared with manual pulse palpation (MPP) followed by a 12-lead ECG for the detection of AF in symptomatic primary care patients with an irregular pulse. METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print and MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment Database) were searched to March 2018. Two reviewers screened the search results, extracted data and assessed study quality. Summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy were calculated using bivariate models. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using an economic model consisting of a decision tree and two cohort Markov models. RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy The diagnostic accuracy (13 publications reporting on nine studies) and clinical impact (24 publications reporting on 19 studies) results are derived from an asymptomatic population (used as a proxy for people with signs or symptoms of AF). The summary sensitivity of lead-I ECG devices was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.2% to 97.4%) and summary specificity was 96.5% (95% CI: 90.4% to 98.8%). Cost effectiveness The de novo economic model yielded incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The results of the pairwise analysis show that all lead-I ECG devices generate ICERs per QALY gained below the pound20,000- pound30,000 threshold. Kardia Mobile is the most cost effective option in a full incremental analysis. Lead-I ECG tests may identify more AF cases than the standard diagnostic pathway. This comes at a higher cost but with greater patient benefit in terms of mortality and quality of life. LIMITATIONS: No published data evaluating the diagnostic accuracy, clinical impact or cost effectiveness of lead-I ECG devices for the target population are available. CONCLUSIONS: The use of single-time point lead-I ECG devices in primary care for the detection of AF in people with signs or symptoms of AF and an irregular pulse appears to be a cost effective use of NHS resources compared with MPP followed by a 12-lead ECG, given the assumptions used in the base case model.

21619,Cost effectiveness of therapeutic drug monitoring for imatinib administration in chronic myeloid leukemia,"BACKGROUND: Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a first-line treatment option for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Patients who fail or are intolerant to IM therapy are treated with more expensive second and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients show wide variation in trough concentrations in response to standard dosing. Thus, many patients receive subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic doses. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may improve dose management that, in turn, may reduce costs and improve outcomes. However, TDM also adds to the cost of patient care. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of TDM for generic IM therapy. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model for the trough plasma concentration of IM which is related to a cytogenetic or molecular response. We compared two cohorts: one with TDM and one without TDM (NTDM). The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the effectiveness measure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The lifetime cost and QALY of treatment with TDM were $2,137K [95% Ci: 2,079K; 2,174K] and 12.37 [95% CI: 12.07; 12.55], respectively.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that TDM was cost-effective relative to NTDM in 90% of the tested scenarios at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY.

21623,Cost-effectiveness of routine transoesophageal echocardiography during cardiac surgery: a discrete-event simulation study,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to simulate and compare the healthcare and economic outcomes associated with routine use of intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with those associated with a scenario where TOE is not routinely used. METHODS: The impact of TOE on surgical decision-making was estimated through a systematic literature review. Individual short-term morbidity and mortality estimates were generated by application of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk calculator. Long-term event rates, unit costs, and utility weights were sourced from published literature and expert opinion. A discrete-event simulation model was then constructed to simulate both the in-hospital and post-discharge outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Robustness of the base case results was examined through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained was assumed to represent acceptable cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Routine use of intraoperative TOE was associated with lower costs and higher benefits per patient, which indicates that use of TOE is a dominant strategy. The intervention resulted in the avoidance of 299 cardiac complications, 20 strokes, and 11 all-cause deaths per 10 000 patients. Routine intraoperative TOE was associated with an increased occurrence of bleeding owing to more valvular surgery and subsequent long-term anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Routine intraoperative TOE is a cost-effective procedure for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, leading to lower overall costs. It was associated with a decrease in long-term complications including stroke, cardiac complications, and death, although there was a slight increase in extracranial bleeding events.",2019-01-30959,31866001,Br J Anaesth,Jan M Dieleman,2019,/,,No,31866001,"Jan M Dieleman; Jaya Prasad Tripathy; Cost-effectiveness of routine transoesophageal echocardiography during cardiac surgery: a discrete-event simulation study, Br J Anaesth, 2019 Dec 19; ():1471-6771",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Medical Procedure, Surgical",Transoesophageal echocardiography during cardiac surgery vs. None,Requiring and undergoing cardiac surgery,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 10 years",3.00,3.00,-44083.33,Euro,2017,-52598.87

21629,Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness modelling study,"BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports individualised decision-making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in men aged 55-69. Knowing how the potential benefits and harms of screening vary by an individual''s risk of developing prostate cancer could inform decision-making about screening at both an individual and population level. This modelling study examined the benefit-harm tradeoffs and the cost-effectiveness of a risk-tailored screening programme compared to age-based and no screening. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A life-table model, projecting age-specific prostate cancer incidence and mortality, was developed of a hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years with follow-up to age 90. Risk thresholds were based on age and polygenic profile. We compared no screening, age-based screening (quadrennial PSA testing from 55 to 69), and risk-tailored screening (men aged 55 to 69 years with a 10-year absolute risk greater than a threshold receive quadrennial PSA testing from the age they reach the risk threshold).

Age-based screening was the least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP pound20,000 (US$26,000) and pound30,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of risk-tailored screening improved as the threshold rose.

Age-based screening was the least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP pound20,000 (US$26,000) and pound30,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively.

Our analysis should be considered cautiously in light of limitations related to our model''s cohort-based structure and the uncertainty of input parameters in mathematical models. Compared to no screening over 35 years follow-up, age-based screening prevented the most deaths from prostate cancer (39,272, 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 16,792-59,685) at the expense of 94,831 (95% UI: 84,827-105,630) overdiagnosed cancers. Age-based screening was the least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP pound20,000 (US$26,000) and pound30,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of risk-tailored screening improved as the threshold rose. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this modelling study, offering screening to men at higher risk could potentially reduce overdiagnosis and improve the benefit-harm tradeoff and the cost-effectiveness of a prostate cancer screening program.

21646,Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness modelling study,"BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports individualised decision-making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in men aged 55-69. Knowing how the potential benefits and harms of screening vary by an individual''s risk of developing prostate cancer could inform decision-making about screening at both an individual and population level. This modelling study examined the benefit-harm tradeoffs and the cost-effectiveness of a risk-tailored screening programme compared to age-based and no screening. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A life-table model, projecting age-specific prostate cancer incidence and mortality, was developed of a hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years with follow-up to age 90. Risk thresholds were based on age and polygenic profile. We compared no screening, age-based screening (quadrennial PSA testing from 55 to 69), and risk-tailored screening (men aged 55 to 69 years with a 10-year absolute risk greater than a threshold receive quadrennial PSA testing from the age they reach the risk threshold). The analysis was undertaken from the health service perspective, including direct costs borne by the health system for risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for parameter uncertainty and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5% per year. Our analysis should be considered cautiously in light of limitations related to our model''s cohort-based structure and the uncertainty of input parameters in mathematical models.

However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating fulvestrant into the first-line setting is unknown. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to assess the costs and clinical outcomes of fulvestrant plus anastrozole compared with anastrozole as a first-line therapy in a cohort of patients with advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. The transition probabilities were estimated from the fitted survival curves in the S0226 trial. Health care costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for fulvestrant plus anastrozole compared with anastrozole from US payer''s perspective. RESULTS: Fulvestrant plus anastrozole led to an improvement of 0.11 QALYs compared with treatment with anastrozole alone. However, incorporating fulvestrant into the first-line therapy produced significantly higher health care costs ($72,496 vs. $38,959 for all eligible patients, and $73,728 vs. $37,239 for patients with no previous hormonal adjuvant therapy), resulting in ICERs of $300,564 and $194,450/QALY, respectively. Two-way sensitivity analysis showed that when the cost of fulvestrant decreased to $1.5/mg for all eligible patients or $3.5/mg for patients with no previous hormonal adjuvant therapy, at the perfect health in progression-free status, the ICER became $141,320 and $145,543 per QALY.

21649,Is Immediate Lymphatic Reconstruction Cost-effective?,"OBJECTIVE: This manuscript is the first to employ rigorous methodological criteria to critically appraise a surgical preventative technique for breast cancer-related lymphedema from a cost-utility standpoint. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Breast cancer-related lymphedema is a well-documented complication of breast cancer survivors in the US. In this study, we conduct a cost-utility analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the LYMPHA. METHODS: Lymphedema rates after each of the following surgical options: (1) ALND, (2) ALND + LYMPHA, (3) ALND + RLNR, (4) ALND + RLNR + LYMPHA were extracted from a recently published meta-analysis. Procedural costs were calculated using Medicare reimbursement rates. Average utility scores were obtained for each health state using a visual analog scale, then converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A decision tree was generated and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) were calculated. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate our findings. RESULTS: ALND with LYMPHA was more cost-effective with an ICUR of $1587.73/QALY. In the decision tree rollback analysis, a clinical effectiveness gain of 1.35 QALY justified an increased incremental cost of $2140. Similarly, the addition of LYMPHA to ALND with RLNR was more cost-effective with an ICUR of $699.84/QALY. In the decision tree rollback analysis, a clinical effectiveness gain of 2.98 QALY justified a higher incremental cost of $2085.00.

21651,Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Gastric Cancer: Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Purpose: The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) for localized gastric cancer (GC) after D2-gastrectomy has been clearly demonstrated. However, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of treatment for GC after D2-gastrectomy. Materials and methods: Stage IB-IIICGC patients who had received adjuvant CRT or CT, or who had just been observed after D2-gastrectomy were retrospectively selected. Therapeutic strategy after surgery, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), adverse events and costs were recorded retrospectively. A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of GC after D2-gastrectomy. Health outcomes were measured using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was regarded as the primary outcome. Results: A total of 254 patients were selected. Three year OS and DFS were 83.02 and 64.15% in the adjuvant CRT group, 74.19 and 63.54% in the adjuvant CT group, and 45.45 and 43.35% in the observation group. Total grade 3 or 4 toxicity was higher in the CRT group than in the CT group (54.72% vs. 37.10%, p < 0.05). The ICER of the CT and CRT groups vs. the observation group were $10,571.55 and $11,467.41/QALY, respectively.

Conclusions: Adjuvant CRT was associated with improved OS and DFS compared with adjuvant CT and postoperative observation.

21653,"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of First-Line Cetuximab Plus Leucovorin, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) versus FOLFOX-4 in Patients with RAS Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","Purpose: Compared with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) alone, cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 has shown superior performance in terms of efficacy and tolerability in patients with RAS wide-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the TAILOR trial (Trial No.: EMR62202-057; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01228734). Thus, we aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of these two first-line regimens in patients with RAS wt mCRC from the Chinese societal perspective. Methods: For the sake of executing the analysis, we used a Markov model containing three health states (progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death) to simulate the process of RAS wt mCRC. The data regarding efficacy and safety were derived from the TAILOR trial. Transition probabilities were converted from the PFS and overall survival (OS) of both groups. Utility scores of the health states were obtained from previously published studies. Costs were computed from the perspective of Chinese society. The primary health outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analysis was utilized to investigate the effect of uncertainties on the Markov model. Results: Treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 was estimated to provide an increase in quality adjusted-life years (QALYs) of 0.15 QALYs at an increased cost of $19,079 compared with FOLFOX-4 alone, resulting in an ICER of $127,193/QALY, which exceeded the threshold of willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $27,934/QALY in China. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of PFS in the cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 arm was the most influential factor in the Markov model.

21656,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of a work-place smoking cessation intervention with and without financial incentives,"AIMS: To perform an economic evaluation of a work-place smoking cessation group training programme with incentives compared with a training programme without incentives. DESIGN: A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) from a societal perspective and an employer''s perspective. SETTING: Sixty-one companies in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 604 tobacco-smoking employees. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: A 7-week work-place smoking cessation group training programme. The intervention group earned gift vouchers of euro350 for 12 months'' continuous abstinence. The comparator group received no incentives. MEASUREMENTS: Online questionnaires were administered to assess quality of life (EQ-5D-5 L) and resource use during the 14-month follow-up period (2-month training period plus 12-month abstinence period). For the CEA the primary outcome measure was carbon monoxide (CO)-validated continuous abstinence; for the CUA the primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Bootstrapping and sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) tables were used to determine cost-effectiveness from a life-time perspective. FINDINGS: Of the participants in the intervention group, 41.1% had quit smoking compared with 26.4% in the control group. From a societal perspective with a 14-month follow-up period, the ICER per quitter for an intervention with financial incentives compared with no incentives was euro11 546. From an employer''s perspective, the ICER was euro5686. There was no significant difference in QALYs between the intervention and control group within the 14-month follow-up period. The intervention was dominated by the comparator in the primary analysis at a threshold of euro20 000 per QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, these results were uncertain.

21657,Cost-Effectiveness of Extended and One-Time Screening Versus No Screening for Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation in the USA,"BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the clinical and cost benefits of screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) with electrocardiogram (ECG) in asymptomatic adults. METHODS: We adapted a previously published Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of one-time screening for non-valvular AF (NVAF) with a single 12-lead ECG and a 14-day extended screening with a hand-held ECG device (Zenicor single-lead ECG, Z14) compared with no screening. Clinical events considered included ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeds, myocardial infarction, and death. Epidemiology and effectiveness data for extended screening were from the STROKESTOP study. Risks of clinical events in NVAF patients were derived from ARISTOTLE. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer, considering a population with undiagnosed NVAF, aged 75 years in the USA. Costs and utilities were discounted at a 3% annual rate. Parameter uncertainty was formally considered via deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA). Structural uncertainty was assessed via scenario analyses. RESULTS: In a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients followed over their lifetimes, the number of additional AF diagnoses was 54 with 12-lead ECG and 255 with Z14 compared with no screening. Both screening strategies led to better health outcomes (ischemic strokes avoided: ECG 12-lead, 9.8 and Z14, 42.2; quality-adjusted life-years gained: ECG 12-lead, 31 and Z14, 131). Extended screening and one-time screening were cost effective compared with no screening at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained ($58,728/QALY with ECG 12-lead and $47,949/QALY with Z14 in 2016 US dollars). ICERs remained below $100,000 per QALY in all DSA, most PSA runs, and in all scenario analyses except for a scenario assuming low anticoagulation persistence.

21665,"Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Term, Targeted OnabotulinumtoxinA versus Peripheral Trigger Site Deactivation Surgery for the Treatment of Refractory Migraine Headaches","BACKGROUND: Chronic migraines affect approximately 2% of the United States population and cost an estimated $17 billion per year. OnabotulinumtoxinA (BoNTA) is an FDA-approved prophylactic medication for chronic migraine headaches and is best injected in a targeted fashion into specific trigger sites. The purpose of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of long-term, targeted BoNTA versus peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery for the treatment of migraine headaches. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to examine long-term, targeted BoNTA versus peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery. Costs, utilities, and other model inputs were identified from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio under $50,000 per quality adjusted life year was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: The mean cost of peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery was $10,303 with an effectiveness of 7.06, while the mean cost of long term, targeted BoNTA was $36,071 with an effectiveness of 6.34. Trigger site deactivation surgery is more effective and less costly over the time horizon of the model. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that surgery is the most cost-effective treatment in patients requiring treatment for greater than 6.75 years. CONCLUSION: Based on this model, peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery is the more cost-effective option for treating refractory migraine headaches requiring treatment beyond 6.75 years. The model reveals that peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery is more effective and less costly than long term, targeted BoNTA over the course of a patient''s lifetime.",2019-01-31035,31842121,Plast Reconstr Surg,Anna R Schoenbrunner,2019,/,,No,31842121,"Anna R Schoenbrunner; Lieven Moke; Thomas Overbergh; Pieter Severijns; Sebastiaan Schelfaut; Pierre Moens; Kristel Van de Loock; Lore Hermans; Guy Molenaers; Ilse Jonkers; Lennart Scheys; Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Term, Targeted OnabotulinumtoxinA versus Peripheral Trigger Site Deactivation Surgery for the Treatment of Refractory Migraine Headaches, Plast Reconstr Surg, 2019 Jun 25; ():0032-1052",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Surgical","long-term, targeted botulinum toxin type a injection vs. Peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery",Refractory Migraine Headache,43.5 Years,43.5 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-35788.89,United States,2019,-36230.41
21666,Modeling Cost-Effectiveness of On-Demand Treatment for Hereditary Angioedema Attacks,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency disease. Low levels of functional C1-INH can lead to recurrent attacks of severe swelling occurring in areas such as the limbs, face, gastrointestinal tract, and throat. These attacks are both painful and disabling and, if not treated promptly and effectively, can result in hospitalization or death. Agents targeting the specific physiologic pathway of HAE attacks can offer improved outcomes with limited side effects compared with nonspecific therapies. However, these treatments display varying efficacy in HAE patients, including the need to redose or seek additional care if the treatment does not resolve symptoms effectively. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the expected cost and utility per HAE attack when treated on-demand with HAE therapies indicated for the treatment of acute attacks. METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed using TreeAge Pro software. Four on-demand HAE treatments were included: ecallantide, icatibant, plasma-derived (pd)C1-INH, and recombinant human (rh)C1-INH. The model uses probabilities for redosing, self-administration versus health care provider administration, and risk of hospitalization. Costs within the model consisted of the HAE treatments and associated health care system expenses. Nonattack baseline utility and attack utility were implemented for effectiveness calculations; time to attack resolution was considered as well. Effectiveness and overall costs per attack were calculated and used to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Variability and ranges in cost-effectiveness were determined using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, a budget impact model for a health plan with 1 million covered lives was also developed. RESULTS: The base case model outputs show costs and calculated effectiveness per attack at $12,905 and 0.806 for rhC1-INH, $14,806 and 0.765 for icatibant, $14,668 and 0.769 for pdC1-INH, and $21,068 and 0.792 for ecallantide, respectively. Cost per QALY was calculated using 26.9 attacks per person-year, leading to results of $420,941 for rhC1-INH, $488,349 for icatibant, $483,892 for pdC1-INH, and $689,773 for ecallantide. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that redose rates (from 3% for rhC1-INH to 44% for icatibant) are a primary driver of variability in cost-effectiveness. Annual health plan costs from the budget impact model are calculated as $6.94 million for rhC1-INH, $7.97 million for icatibant, $7.90 million for pdC1-INH, and $11.33 million for ecallantide.

21667,Modeling Cost-Effectiveness of On-Demand Treatment for Hereditary Angioedema Attacks,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency disease. Low levels of functional C1-INH can lead to recurrent attacks of severe swelling occurring in areas such as the limbs, face, gastrointestinal tract, and throat. These attacks are both painful and disabling and, if not treated promptly and effectively, can result in hospitalization or death. Agents targeting the specific physiologic pathway of HAE attacks can offer improved outcomes with limited side effects compared with nonspecific therapies. However, these treatments display varying efficacy in HAE patients, including the need to redose or seek additional care if the treatment does not resolve symptoms effectively. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the expected cost and utility per HAE attack when treated on-demand with HAE therapies indicated for the treatment of acute attacks. METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed using TreeAge Pro software. Four on-demand HAE treatments were included: ecallantide, icatibant, plasma-derived (pd)C1-INH, and recombinant human (rh)C1-INH. The model uses probabilities for redosing, self-administration versus health care provider administration, and risk of hospitalization. Costs within the model consisted of the HAE treatments and associated health care system expenses. Nonattack baseline utility and attack utility were implemented for effectiveness calculations; time to attack resolution was considered as well. Effectiveness and overall costs per attack were calculated and used to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Variability and ranges in cost-effectiveness were determined using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, a budget impact model for a health plan with 1 million covered lives was also developed. RESULTS: The base case model outputs show costs and calculated effectiveness per attack at $12,905 and 0.806 for rhC1-INH, $14,806 and 0.765 for icatibant, $14,668 and 0.769 for pdC1-INH, and $21,068 and 0.792 for ecallantide, respectively.

21670,Glatiramer acetate as a clinically and cost-effective treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis over 10 years of use within the National Health Service: Final results from the UK Risk Sharing Scheme,"Background: The UK Risk Sharing Scheme (RSS) provided information on the effect of first-line multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments on long-term disability. Objective: The aim is to provide results specific to glatiramer acetate (GA; Copaxone(R)) from the final 10-year analysis of the RSS. Methods: A Markov model was used to assess clinical effectiveness measured as Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression and utility loss. Untreated patients from the British Columbia MS cohort (1980-1995) were used as a ''virtual comparator'' group. A separate Markov model assessed cost-effectiveness, based on a 50-year time horizon (with a 50% treatment waning effect imposed at 10 years) and using NHS list price ( pound513.95 per 28 days). Results were expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results: In total, 755 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) received GA, with a mean follow-up of 7.1 (standard deviation 1.3) years. EDSS progression was reduced by 23% (progression ratio 76.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 69.0-84.3) and utility loss by 39% (progression ratio 61.0, 95% CI 52.7-69.3) compared with no treatment. There was no persistent waning in GA treatment effect over time (EDSS: p = 0.093; utilities: p = 0.119). The cost per QALY was pound17,841.

21671,The cost-utility of pitolisant as narcolepsy treatment,"OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of available pharmacological treatments for narcolepsy is largely unknown. Available pharmacological treatments are associated with tolerability, abuse and adherence issues. Pitolisant is the first inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor to be prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Studies suggest that pitolisant is both as effective as previously introduced drugs and is associated with fewer adverse effects. The objective in this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of pitolisant as monotherapy, and pitolisant as an adjunctive treatment to modafinil, compared to standard treatment. MATERIALS & METHODS: Calculations were performed using a Markov model with a 50-year time horizon. Healthcare utilisation and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each treatment alternative were calculated assuming no treatment effect on survival. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for treatment effectiveness and healthcare cost parameters. RESULTS: The cost per additional quality-adjusted life year was estimated at SEK 356 337 (10 SEK approximately 1 Euro) for pitolisant monotherapy, and at SEK 491 128 for pitolisant as an adjunctive treatment, as compared to standard treatment. The cost-effectiveness measure was demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to the assumptions made concerning indirect effects on total healthcare utilization and the pitolisant treatment cost. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below the unofficial willingness-to-pay threshold at SEK 500 000.

21673,Cost-effectiveness of implementing objective diagnostic verification of asthma in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Asthma diagnosis in the community is often made without objective testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a stepwise objective diagnostic verification algorithm among patients with community-diagnosed asthma in the United States (US). METHODS: We developed a probabilistic time-in-state cohort model that compared a stepwise asthma verification algorithm based on spirometry and methacholine challenge test against the current standard of care over 20 years. Model input parameters were informed from the literature and with original data analyses when required. The target population was US adults (>/=15 y/o) with physician-diagnosed asthma. The final outcomes were costs (in 2018 $) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were undertaken to examine the effect of alternative assumptions and uncertainty in model parameters on the results. RESULTS: In a simulated cohort of 10,000 adults with diagnosed asthma, the stepwise algorithm resulted in the removal of diagnosis in 3,366. This was projected to be associated with savings of $36.26 million in direct costs and a gain of 4,049.28 QALYs over 20 years. Extrapolating these results to the US population indicated an undiscounted potential savings of $56.48 billion over 20 years. Results were robust against alternative assumptions and plausible changes in values of input parameters.

DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, using data from the Preventing infection using Antimicrobial Impregnated Long Lines (PREVAIL) randomised controlled trial linked to routine healthcare data, supplemented with published literature. The model assumes that LOI increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in the UK National Health Service (NHS). PATIENTS: Infants born </=32 weeks gestational age, requiring a 1 French gauge PICC. INTERVENTIONS: AM-PICC and S-PICC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs over the infants'' expected lifetime. RESULTS: Severe NDI reduces life expectancy by 14.79 (95% CI 4.43 to 26.68; undiscounted) years, 10.63 (95% CI 7.74 to 14.02; discounted) QALYs and costs pound19 057 (95% CI pound14 197; pound24697; discounted) to the NHS.

21676,"Oral Semaglutide Versus Empagliflozin, Sitagliptin and Liraglutide in the UK: Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness Analyses Based on the PIONEER Clinical Trial Programme","INTRODUCTION: The PIONEER trial programme showed that, after 52 weeks, the novel oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide 14 mg was associated with significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) versus a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 25 mg), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin 100 mg) and an injectable GLP-1 analogue (liraglutide 1.8 mg). The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of oral semaglutide 14 mg versus each of these comparators in the UK setting. METHODS: Analyses were performed from a healthcare payer perspective using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model, in which outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes (50 years). Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were based on 52-week data from the PIONEER 2, 3 and 4 randomised controlled trials, comparing oral semaglutide with empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide, respectively. Treatment switching occurred when HbA1c exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Utilities, treatment costs and costs of diabetes-related complications (in pounds sterling [GBP]) were taken from published sources. The acquisition cost of oral semaglutide was assumed to match that of once-weekly semaglutide. RESULTS: Oral semaglutide was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus empagliflozin, 0.20 QALYs versus sitagliptin and 0.07 QALYs versus liraglutide. Direct costs over a patient''s lifetime were GBP 971 and GBP 963 higher with oral semaglutide than with empagliflozin and sitagliptin, respectively, but GBP 1551 lower versus liraglutide. Oral semaglutide was associated with a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications versus all comparators. Therefore, oral semaglutide 14 mg was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of GBP 11,006 and 4930 per QALY gained versus empagliflozin 25 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg, respectively, and was more effective and less costly (dominant) versus liraglutide 1.8 mg.

21679,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for previously untreated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in the USA,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus standard chemotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the US payer perspective. DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Health outcomes were estimated in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost information was from Medicare in 2018. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses examined the impact of uncertainty and assumptions on the results. SETTING: The US payer perspective. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical US cohort of patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations. INTERVENTIONS: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy expressed as cost per QALY gained compared with chemotherapy RESULTS: The base case analysis demonstrated that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy provided an additional 0.78 QALYs at incremental cost of $151 409, resulting in an ICER of $194 372/QALY. ICER for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was >$149 680/QALY in all of our univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DTG (DTG + TDF/3TC) compared to efavirenz (EFV + TDF/3TC) in treatment-naive and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r + TDF/3TC) in first-line ART failure HIV-1-infected patients in China. Methods: A dynamic Markov model comprising of 5 response states and 6 CD4+ count-based health states was used. Efficacy, estimated as probability of virologic suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) at 48 weeks, was obtained from a published network meta-analysis for ART-naive patients and from the DAWNING study for patients failing first-line ART. Baseline cohort characteristics were informed using DTG phase 3 studies and the DAWNING study data, respectively. Health state utilities were derived from DTG phase 3 studies. A 5-year cost-effectiveness analyses was conducted using the societal perspective. Outcomes were quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs), incremental cost per QALYs (ICER). Results: The viral suppression rates for DTG + TDF/3TC were higher than EFV + TDF/3TC (75.3% vs 64.0%) in treatment-naive and LPV/r + TDF/3TC (74.8% vs 58.4%) in first-line ART failure patients. This resulted in higher QALYs for DTG + TDF/3TC in treatment-naive (4.232 vs 4.227) and first-line failure settings (4.224 vs 4.221). Total discounted cost for DTG + TDF/3TC patients (RMB 219.259 in treatment-naive and RMB 238,746 in first-line failures) were lower than comparators (EFV + TDF/3TC:RMB 221,605; LPV/r + TDF/3TC:RMB 244,364), thereby DTG dominated in both settings. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated the probability of DTG + TDF/3TC being cost effective was 98.2% in treatment-naive setting and 100% in first-line failure setting at a willingness to pay threshold of RMB 100,000/QALY.

METHODS: A Markov model was created based on previous results reported at the 2016 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium to evaluate mFOLFIRI and mFOLFOX7 for advanced GC quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were examined as the primary outcomes. RESULTS: For the evaluable 128 patients, treatment efficacy was 0.59 QALYs for the IRI arm and 0.70 QALYs for the OXA arm, with a total cost of $13,861.34 for the IRI arm and $14,127.30 for the OXA arm. Hence, the ICER was $2,417.82 per QALY the OXA arm, which was below the threshold of 3 x per capita GDP of China. For subgroup analysis of those receiving mFOLFIRI followed by mFOLFOX7 (the IRI arm) and the reverse (the OXA arm), the OXA arm gained 0.44 more QALYs than the IRI arm with a total cost of $28,890.09 for the IRI arm and $31,147.30 for the OXA arm. However, the cost per QALY was also lower for the OXA arm than for the IRI arm, and the cost per QALY gained was $5,129.55 (below the Chinese WTP).

21684,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Of EGFR Mutation Testing And Afatinib Versus Gemcitabine-Cisplatin As First-Line Therapy For Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer In China,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the combined use of afatinib and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing versus gemcitabine-cisplatin as the first-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. Methods: A decision-analytic model, based on clinical phase III trials, was developed to simulate patient transitions. Direct costs were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated over a 5-year lifetime horizon. Model robustness was conducted in sensitivity analyses. Results: For the base case, EGFR mutation testing followed by afatinib treatment for advanced NSCLC increased 0.15 QALYs compared with standard chemotherapy at an additional cost of $5069.12. The ICER for afatinib maintenance was $33,416.39 per QALY gained. The utility of PFS and the cost of afatinib had the most important impact on the ICER. Scenario analyses suggested that when a patient assistance program (PAP) was available, ICER decreased to $22,972.52/QALY lower than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of China ($26,508/QALY).

21685,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Adjunctive Therapy of Ivabradine for the Treatment of Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction,"Background: The benefit of ivabradine as an adjunctive therapy to conventional treatment in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a reduction in both cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of ivabradine plus standard treatment compared with standard treatment alone. Methods and results: An analytical decision model was used to analyze lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from a healthcare perspective. The study cohort comprised HFrEF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35%, with subgroup analysis of those with baseline heart rate >/=77 bpm. Clinical inputs were obtained from a landmark trial. All cost-related data, risk of non-cardiovascular death and readmission rate were based on Thai data. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% and presented as 2018 values. Findings were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Ivabradine plus standard treatment costs more than standard treatment (71,071 vs 18,736 THB or 2,161.54 vs 569.82 USD), and is more effective (6.08 QALYs vs 5.84 QALYs), yielding an ICER of 214,219 THB/QALY (6,515.16 USD/QALY). Ivabradine was not cost-effective at the Thai willingness to pay threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY. The results were sensitive to risk of non-hospitalization cardiovascular death, and costs of HF hospitalization and ivabradine. However, the ICER of subgroup was below the threshold (86,317 THB/QALY or 2,625.20 USD/QALY).

Ivabradine plus standard treatment costs more than standard treatment (71,071 vs 18,736 THB or 2,161.54 vs 569.82 USD), and is more effective (6.08 QALYs vs 5.84 QALYs), yielding an ICER of 214,219 THB/QALY (6,515.16 USD/QALY). Ivabradine was not cost-effective at the Thai willingness to pay threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY. The results were sensitive to risk of non-hospitalization cardiovascular death, and costs of HF hospitalization and ivabradine. However, the ICER of subgroup was below the threshold (86,317 THB/QALY or 2,625.20 USD/QALY). Conclusion: This study revealed the addition of ivabradine to standard treatment to be a cost-effective treatment strategy in HFrEF patients with a heart rate >/=77 bpm.",2019-01-31081,31824183,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Rungroj Krittayaphong,2019,11 /,767-777,No,31824183,"Rungroj Krittayaphong; Anand S Ahankari; Laila J Tata; Andrew W Fogarty; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Adjunctive Therapy of Ivabradine for the Treatment of Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2019; 11():1178-6981; 767-777",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"ivabradine vs. Standard/Usual Care- carvedilol (6.25 mg twice daily), enalapril (10 mg twice daily), losartan (50 mg once daily), and spironolactone (25 mg once daily).",Not Stated,Not Stated,61 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2613.57,United States,2018,2693.76
21687,Deterioration of Cortical and Trabecular Microstructure Identifies Women With Osteopenia or Normal Bone Mineral Density at Imminent and Long-Term Risk for Fragility Fracture: A Prospective Study,"More than 70% of women sustaining fractures have osteopenia or ""normal"" bone mineral density (BMD). These women remain undetected using the BMD threshold of -2.5 SD for osteoporosis. As microstructural deterioration increases bone fragility disproportionate to the bone loss producing osteopenia/normal BMD, we hypothesized that the structural fragility score (SFS) of >/=70 units, a measure capturing severe cortical and trabecular deterioration, will identify these women. Distal radial images were acquired using high-resolution peripheral quantitative tomography in postmenopausal French women, mean age 67 years (range 42-96 years); 1539 women were followed for 4 years (QUALYOR) and 561 women followed for 8 years (OFELY). Women with osteopenia or normal BMD accounted for ~80% of fractures. Women >/=70 years, 29.2% of the cohort, accounted for 39.2% to 61.5% of fractures depending on follow-up duration. Women having fractures had a higher SFS, lower BMD, and a higher fracture risk assessment score (FRAX) than women remaining fracture-free. In each BMD category (osteoporosis, osteopenia, normal BMD), fracture incidence was two to three times higher in women with SFS >/=70 than <70. In multivariable analyses, associations with fractures remained for BMD and SFS, not FRAX. BMD was no longer, or weakly, associated with fractures after accounting for SFS, whereas SFS remained associated with fracture after accounting for BMD. SFS detected two-to threefold more women having fractures than BMD or FRAX. SFS in women with osteopenia/normal BMD conferred an odds ratio for fracture of 2.69 to 5.19 for women of any age and 4.98 to 12.2 for women >/=70 years. Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analyses showed a significant area under the curve (AUC) for SFS, but not BMD or FRAX for the women >/=70 years of age. Targeting women aged >/=70 years with osteopenia indicated that treating 25% using SFS to allocate treatment conferred a cost-effectiveness ratio < USD $21,000/QALY saved.

21690,Cost Effectiveness of Ceritinib and Alectinib Versus Crizotinib in First-Line Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-Positive Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib improved survival in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) arrangement non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the long-term economic outcomes of using ceritinib and alectinib versus crizotinib are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of ceritinib and alectinib versus crizotinib in the Chinese healthcare setting. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project the economic and health outcomes for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with ceritinib, alectinib or crizotinib. A network meta-analysis was performed to calculate the hazard ratios of ceritinib and alectinib versus crizotinib by pooling published trials. Cost and utility values were obtained from the literature, and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the robustness of the model outcomes. The primary outputs included total cost, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Treatment with alectinib and ceritinib yielded an additional 1.00 and 1.09 QALYs and incremental costs of $62,232 and $15,165, resulting in an ICER of $62,231 and $13,905 per QALY compared with crizotinib, respectively. Parameters related to drug costs and progression-free survival were the main drivers of the model outcomes. From the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ceritinib and alectinib had a 99.9% and 0% probability of being cost effective, respectively, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$28,410/QALY.

Methods: Baseline inputs and treatment effects from IMPACT were populated into the validated GALAXY-COPD disease progression model. Canadian unit costs and drug costs (Canadian dollars [C$], 2017) were applied to healthcare resource utilization and treatments. Future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 1.5% annually.

U.S. vaccination policy on use of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in adult women and men is being reviewed. Objective: To evaluate the added population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of extending the current U.S. HPV vaccination program to women aged 27 to 45 years and men aged 22 to 45 years. Design: The analysis used HPV-ADVISE (Agent-based Dynamic model for VaccInation and Screening Evaluation), an individual-based transmission dynamic model of HPV infection and associated diseases, calibrated to age-specific U.S. data. Data Sources: Published data. Target Population: Women aged 27 to 45 years and men aged 22 to 45 years in the United States. Time Horizon: 100 years. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: 9-valent HPV vaccination. Outcome Measures: HPV-associated outcomes prevented and cost-effectiveness ratios. Results of Base-Case Analysis: The model predicts that the current U.S. HPV vaccination program will reduce the number of diagnoses of anogenital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or 3 and cases of cervical cancer and noncervical HPV-associated cancer by 82%, 80%, 59%, and 39%, respectively, over 100 years and is cost saving (vs. no vaccination). In contrast, extending vaccination to women and men aged 45 years is predicted to reduce these outcomes by an additional 0.4, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. Vaccinating women and men up to age 30, 40, and 45 years is predicted to cost $830 000, $1 843 000, and $1 471 000, respectively, per quality-adjusted life-year gained (vs. current vaccination). Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results were most sensitive to assumptions about natural immunity and progression rates after infection, historical vaccination coverage, and vaccine efficacy. Limitation: Uncertainty about the proportion of HPV-associated disease due to infections after age 26 years and about the level of herd effects from the current HPV vaccination program. Conclusion: The current HPV vaccination program is predicted to be cost saving.

Data Sources: Published data. Target Population: Women aged 27 to 45 years and men aged 22 to 45 years in the United States. Time Horizon: 100 years. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: 9-valent HPV vaccination. Outcome Measures: HPV-associated outcomes prevented and cost-effectiveness ratios. Results of Base-Case Analysis: The model predicts that the current U.S. HPV vaccination program will reduce the number of diagnoses of anogenital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or 3 and cases of cervical cancer and noncervical HPV-associated cancer by 82%, 80%, 59%, and 39%, respectively, over 100 years and is cost saving (vs. no vaccination). In contrast, extending vaccination to women and men aged 45 years is predicted to reduce these outcomes by an additional 0.4, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. Vaccinating women and men up to age 30, 40, and 45 years is predicted to cost $830 000, $1 843 000, and $1 471 000, respectively, per quality-adjusted life-year gained (vs. current vaccination). Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results were most sensitive to assumptions about natural immunity and progression rates after infection, historical vaccination coverage, and vaccine efficacy. Limitation: Uncertainty about the proportion of HPV-associated disease due to infections after age 26 years and about the level of herd effects from the current HPV vaccination program. Conclusion: The current HPV vaccination program is predicted to be cost saving. Extending vaccination to older ages is predicted to produce small additional health benefits and result in substantially higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than the current recommendation.

21700,Optimizing Management of Patients with Barrett's Esophagus and Low-grade or No Dysplasia Based On Comparative Modeling: Optimizing Barrett's esophagus management,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic treatment is recommended for patients with Barrett''s esophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia, yet clinical management recommendations are inconsistent for patients with BE without dysplasia (NDBE) or with low-grade dysplasia (LGD). We used a comparative modeling analysis to identify optimal management strategies for these patients. METHODS: We used 3 independent population-based models to simulate cohorts of 60-year-old individuals with BE in the United States. We followed each cohort until death without surveillance and treatment (natural disease progression), compared with 78 different strategies of management for patients with NDBE or LGD. We determined the optimal strategy using cost-effectiveness analyses, at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: In the 3 models, the average cumulative incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma was 111 cases, with costs totaling $5.7 million per 1000 men with BE. Surveillance and treatment of men with BE prevented 23%-75% of cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma , but increased costs to $6.2-$17.3 million per 1000 men with BE. The optimal strategy was surveillance every 3 years for men with NDBE and treatment of LGD after confirmation by repeat endoscopy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $53,044/QALY). The average results for women were consistent with the results for men for LGD management, but the optimal surveillance interval for women with NDBE was 5 years (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $36,045/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Based on analyses from 3 population-based models, the optimal management strategy for patient with BE and LGD is endoscopic eradication, but only after LGD is confirmed by a repeat endoscopy. The optimal strategy for patients with NDBE is endoscopic surveillance, using a 3-year interval for men and a 5-year interval for women.",2019-01-31103,31816445,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Amir-Houshang Omidvari,2019,/,,No,31816445,"Amir-Houshang Omidvari; Yuri Wanderley Cavalcanti; Leopoldina de Fatima Dan de Almeida; Edson Hilan Gomes de Lucena; Livia Fernandes Probst; Denise de Fatima Barros Cavalcante; Antonio Carlos Frias; Jaqueline Vilela Bulgareli; Antonio Carlos Pereira; Optimizing Management of Patients with Barrett's Esophagus and Low-grade or No Dysplasia Based On Comparative Modeling: Optimizing Barrett's esophagus management, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2019 Jun 18; ():1542-3565",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Procedure, Surgical","no surveillance, endoscopic eradication therapy for low-grade dysplasia after confirmation vs. None",Whites with non-dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia,Not Stated,60 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2476,United States,2015,2703.67
