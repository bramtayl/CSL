32654,Cost-effectiveness analysis of biodegradable polymer versus durable polymer drug-eluting stents incorporating real-world evidence,"AIM: Compared with second-generation durable polymer drug-eluting stents (DP-DES), the cost-effectiveness of biodegradable polymer drug-eluting stents (BP-DES) remains unclear in the real-world setting. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of BP-DES in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of BP-DES to DP-DES over 1 year and 5 years from healthcare payer perspective. Relative treatment effects during the first year post-PCI were obtained from a real-world population analysis while clinical event risks in the subsequent 4 years were derived from a meta-analysis of published studies. RESULTS: At 1 year, based on the clinical data analysis of 497 propensity-score matched pairs of patients, BP-DES were associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD20 503 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. At 5 years, BP-DES yielded an ICER of USD4062 per QALY gained. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of USD50 400 (one gross domestic product per capita in Singapore in 2015), BP-DES were cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of stents had a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness of BP-DES. Threshold analysis demonstrated that if the cost difference between BP-DES and DP-DES exceeded USD493, BP-DES would not be cost-effective in patients with 1 year of follow-up.

32656,Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against cytomegalovirus (CMV) in adolescent girls to prevent infections in pregnant women living in France,"BACKGROUND: CMV infections are the most frequent congenital infections worldwide. AIM: Assess the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies of adolescent girls vs. current practice (hygiene counseling) to prevent CMV seroconversions during pregnancy in France. METHOD: A Markov decision-tree model simulated overtime the trajectory of a single fictive cohort of 390,000 adolescent women aged 14years old, living in France. Impact of vaccination was explored until the end of their reproductive live 40years later. STRATEGIES COMPARED: ""S1: No vaccination"" (current practice); ""S2: Routine vaccination""; ""S3: Screening and vaccination of the seronegative"". MODEL PARAMETERS: Seroconversion rate without vaccination (0.035%/pregnant woman-week); fetal transmission risk (41%). Vaccine vs. no vaccination: a 50% decrease in maternal seroconversions. OUTCOMES: Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) of the cohort-born babies; discounted costs; Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). RESULTS: S2 was the most effective strategy (with 35,000 QALYs gained) and the most expensive (euro211,533,000); S1 was the least effective and least costly (euro75,423,000). ICERs of strategy S3 vs. S1, and S2 vs. S3 were 6,000euro/QALY gained (95% uncertainty range [2700-13,300]) and 16,000euro/QALY [negative ICER (S3 dominated by S2) - 94,000] gained, respectively; highly cost-effective because ICER<1 *France''s GPD/capita=euro30,000. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: If the seroprevalence was >62% (vs. 20% in the base case), S3 would become the most efficient strategy.

32666,Comparing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy laser lithotripsy for treatment of urinary stones smaller than 2 cm: a cost-utility analysis in the Spanish clinical setting,"PURPOSE: To analyze the efficiency and cost-utility profile of ureteroscopy versus shock wave lithotripsy for treatment of reno-ureteral stones smaller than 2 cm. METHODS: Patients treated for urinary stones smaller than 2 cm were included in this study (n?=?750) and divided into two groups based on technique of treatment. To assess the cost-utility profile a sample of 48 patients (50% of each group) was evaluated. Quality of life survey (Euroqol 5QD-3L) before-after treatment was applied, Markov model was designed to calculate quality of life in each status of the patients (stone or stone-free with and without double-J stent) and to estimate the incremental cost-utility. Monte carlo simulation was conducted for a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Chi-square was used for comparing qualitative variables and T student''s for continuous variables. RESULTS: Shock wave lithotripsy group had 408 (54.4%) and ureteroscopy group had 342 (45.6%) patients. Of them, 56.3% were treated for renal stones and 43.7% for ureteral stones. Ureteroscopy produced slightly higher overall quality of patients'' life, but produced a significant higher overall cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) than shock wave lithotripsy, exceeding the cost-utility threshold (20,000€/QALY).

32669,Comparative Cost-Effectiveness of Tofacitinib With Continuing Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs for Active Rheumatoid Arthritis in South Korea,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of initiating treatment with tofacitinib and subsequently incorporating it into a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD) treatment sequence and to compare the cost-effectiveness of this sequence with that of continuing csDMARDs alone in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two tofacitinib treatment sequences compared with that of continuing the csDMARD treatment sequence over a lifetime. Of the two tofacitinib sequences, the first consisted of initial tofacitinib treatment followed by biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and the second consisted of csDMARD treatments followed by tofacitinib. A third treatment sequence, continuing the csDMARD treatment sequence before starting bDMARDs, was used as a comparator. Efficacy was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates (ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70) after 6 months, which were converted to changes in the health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI) score. Utility was estimated by mapping from the HAQ-DI score, costs were analyzed from a Korean societal perspective, and outcomes were considered in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over a lifetime for starting with tofacitinib and incorporating tofacitinib into the csDMARD treatment sequence versus continuing csDMARDs only were US$14,537 per QALY and US$7,086 per QALY, respectively.

32671,EXPRESS: Cost-effectiveness of an enhanced Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment (PASTA) during emergency stroke care: economic results from a pragmatic cluster randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: The Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment (PASTA) trial evaluated an enhanced emergency care pathway which aimed to facilitate thrombolysis in hospital. A pre-planned health economic evaluation was included. The main results showed no statistical evidence of a difference in either thrombolysis volume (primary outcome) or 90-day dependency. However, counter-intuitive findings were observed with the intervention group showing fewer thrombolysis treatments but less dependency. AIMS: Cost-effectiveness of the PASTA intervention was examined relative to Standard Care (SC). METHODS: A within trial cost-utility analysis estimated mean costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over 90 daysâ time horizon. Cost were derived from resource utilisation data for individual trial participants. QALYs were calculated by mapping modified Rankin scale scores to EQ-5D-3L utility tariffs. A post-hoc subgroup analysis examined cost-effectiveness when trial hospitals were divided into compliant and non-compliant with recommendations for a stroke specialist thrombolysis rota. RESULTS: The trial enrolled 1214 patients: 500 PASTA and 714 SC. There was no evidence of a QALY difference between groups [0Â·007 (95%CI -0Â·003 to 0Â·018) favouring PASTA] but costs were lower in the PASTA group [-Â£1473 (95%CI: -Â£2736 to -Â£219)]. There was over 97.5% chance that the PASTA pathway would be considered cost-effective. There was no evidence of a difference in costs at seven thrombolysis rota compliant hospitals but costs at eight non-complaint hospitals costs were lower in PASTA with more dominant cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses indicate that the PASTA pathway may be considered cost-effective, particularly if deployed in areas where stroke specialist availability is limited.

32672,Cost-effectiveness of olaparib versus routine surveillance in the maintenance setting for patients with BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in Singapore,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of olaparib as a maintenance treatment versus routine surveillance (RS) in patients with BRCA mutated (BRCAm) advanced ovarian cancer (OC) following response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in Singapore. METHODS: A 4-health state partitioned survival model was developed to simulate the lifetime (50 years) incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of olaparib versus RS from a healthcare payer perspective. Progression-free survival, time to second disease progression, and overall survival were estimated using SOLO-1 data and extrapolated beyond the trial period using parametric survival models. Any patient who remained progression-free at year 7 was assumed to be no longer at risk of progression. Mortality rates were based on all-cause mortality, adjusted based on BRCA1/2 mutation. Health state utilities and adverse event frequencies were from SOLO-1. Drug costs were from local public healthcare institutions. Healthcare resource usage and costs were from local clinician input and publications. A 3% discount rate was applied to costs and outcomes. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: The base-case analysis of olaparib maintenance therapy versus RS resulted in an ICER of Singapore dollar (SGD) 19,822 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The ICER was most sensitive to variations in the discount rate. PSA demonstrated that olaparib had an 87% probability of being cost-effective versus RS at a willingness-to-pay of SGD 60,000 per QALY gained.

32685,A cost-effectiveness analysis of South Africa's seasonal influenza vaccination programme,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza imposes a significant health and economic burden in South Africa, particularly in populations vulnerable to severe consequences of influenza. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of South Africa''s seasonal influenza vaccination strategy, which involves vaccinating vulnerable populations with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) during routine facility visits. Vulnerable populations included in our analysis are persons aged = 65 years; pregnant women; persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), persons of any age with underlying medical conditions (UMC) and children aged 6-59 months. METHOD: We employed the World Health Organisation''s (WHO) Cost Effectiveness Tool for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (CETSIV), a decision tree model, to evaluate the 2018 seasonal influenza vaccination campaign from a public healthcare provider and societal perspective. CETSIV was populated with existing country-specific demographic, epidemiologic and coverage data to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) by comparing costs and benefits of the influenza vaccination programme to no vaccination. RESULTS: The highest number of clinical events (influenza cases, outpatient visits, hospitalisation and deaths) were averted in PLWHA and persons with other UMCs. Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$ 3400 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), our findings suggest that the vaccination programme is cost-effective for all vulnerable populations except for children aged 6-59 months. ICERs ranged from ~US$ 1 750 /QALY in PLWHA to ~US$ 7500/QALY in children. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the vaccination programme was cost-effective in pregnant women, PLWHA, persons with UMCs and persons aged =65 years in >80% of simulations. These findings were robust to changes in many model inputs but were most sensitive to uncertainty in estimates of influenza-associated illness burden.

32695,COMPARING COST-UTILITY OF DMARDs IN AUTOANTIBODY-NEGATIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 1-year cost-effectiveness between three different initial treatment strategies in autoantibody-negative rheumatoid arthritis(RA-) patients, according to 2010 criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this analysis we selected all RA- patients within the intermediate probability stratum of the tREACH trial. The tREACH had a treat-to-target approach, aiming for low disease activity(DAS<2.4) and treatment adjustments could occur every 3 months. Initial treatment strategies consisted of methotrexate 25mg/week(iMTX), hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day(iHCQ) or an oral glucocorticoids tapering scheme without DMARDs(iGCs). Data on Quality adjusted life-years(QALYs), measured with the EQ-5D-3L, healthcare and productivity costs were used. RESULTS: Average QALYs(sd), for iMTX, iHCQ and iGCs were respectively 0.71(0.14), 0.73(0.14) and 0.71(0.15). The average total costs(sd) for iMTX, iHCQ and iGCs were respectively €10.832(14.763), €11.208 (12.801) and €10.502(11.973). Healthcare costs were mainly determined by biological costs, which were significantly lower in the iHCQ group compared to iGCs(p<.05). However, costs due to presenteeism were the highest in the iHCQ group(55%) followed by iMTX(27%) and iGCs(18%). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios(ICERs) did not differ between treatment strategies. At a willingness-to-pay level of €50.000, the Dutch threshold for reimbursement of medical care, iHCQ had the highest probability(38.7%) of being cost-effective, followed by iGCs(31.1%) and iMTX(30.2%). CONCLUSIONS: iHCQ had the lowest healthcare and highest productivity costs, resulting in a non-significant ICER. However, iHCQ had the highest chance of being cost-effective at the Dutch WTP-threshold for healthcare reimbursement. Therefore, we believe that iHCQ is a good alternative for iMTX in autoantibody-negative RA patients, but validation is needed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this analysis we selected all RA- patients within the intermediate probability stratum of the tREACH trial. The tREACH had a treat-to-target approach, aiming for low disease activity(DAS<2.4) and treatment adjustments could occur every 3 months. Initial treatment strategies consisted of methotrexate 25mg/week(iMTX), hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day(iHCQ) or an oral glucocorticoids tapering scheme without DMARDs(iGCs).

32698,Corneal cross-linking versus conventional management for keratoconus: a lifetime economic model,"AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) versus no CXL for keratoconus in the United States (US). METHODS: A discrete-event microsimulation was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of corneal cross-linking (CXL, Photrexa?+?KXL combination product) versus no CXL for patients with keratoconus. The lifetime model was conducted from a US payor perspective. The source for CXL efficacy and safety data was a 12-month randomized, open-label, sham-controlled, multi-center, pivotal trial comparing CXL versus no CXL. Other inputs were sourced from the literature. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Costs (2019 USD) and effects were discounted 3% annually. The impacts of underlying uncertainty were evaluated by scenario, univariate, and probabilistic analyses. RESULTS: Starting at a mean baseline age of 31 years and considering a mixed population consisting of 80% slow-progressors and 20% fast-progressors, the CXL group was 25.9% less likely to undergo penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and spent 27.9 fewer years in advanced disease stages. CXL was dominant with lower total direct medical costs (-$8,677; $30,994 versus $39,671) and more QALYs (1.88; 21.80 versus 19.93) compared to no CXL. Considering the impact of reduced productivity loss in an exploratory scenario, CXL was associated with a lifetime cost-savings of $43,759 per patient. CXL was cost-effective within 2 years and cost-saving within 4.5 years. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include those that are common to similar pharmacoeconomic models that rely on disparate sources for inputs and extrapolation on short-term outcomes to a long-term analytical horizon. CONCLUSIONS: Keratoconus is a progressive and life-altering disease with substantial clinical, economic, and humanistic consequences.
