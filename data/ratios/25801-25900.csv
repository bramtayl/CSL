25801,Reducing the global burden of hazardous alcohol use: a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis,"Intervention strategies are available for reducing the high global burden of hazardous alcohol use as a risk factor for disease, but little is known about their potential costs and effects at a population level. This study set out to estimate these costs and effects.Analyses were carried out for 12 epidemiological World Health Organization subregions of the world. A population model was used to estimate the impact of evidence-based personal and nonpersonal interventions--including brief physician advice, taxation, roadside random breath testing, restricted sales access and advertising bans. Costs were measured in international dollars (I$); population-level intervention effects were gauged in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) were computed.The most costly interventions to implement are brief advice in primary care and roadside breath testing of drivers. In populations with a high prevalence of heavy drinkers (more than 5%, such as Europe and North America), the most effective and cost-effective intervention was taxation (more than 500 DALYs averted per 1 million population; CER < I$500 per DALY averted). In populations with a lower prevalence of heavy drinking, however, taxation is estimated to be less cost effective overall than other, more targeted strategies, such as brief physician advice, roadside breath testing and advertising bans.The most efficient public health response to the burden of alcohol use depends on the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use, which is related to overall per capita consumption. Population-wide measures, such as taxation, are expected to represent the most cost-effective response in populations with moderate or high levels of drinking, whereas more targeted strategies are indicated in populations with lower rates of hazardous alcohol use.",2004-99-13944,15700517,J Stud Alcohol,Dan Chisholm,2004,65 / 6,782-93,No,15700517,"Dan Chisholm; J?rgen Rehm; Mark van Ommeren; Maristela Monteiro; Reducing the global burden of hazardous alcohol use: a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis, J Stud Alcohol, ; 65(6):0096-882X; 782-93",DALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Legislation / Regulation",Roadside breath testing for alcohol vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,1522,United States,2002,2189.61

25807,Incremental cost-effectiveness of supplementary immunization activities to prevent neonatal tetanus in Pakistan,"This study aimed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of supplementary immunization activities to prevent neonatal tetanus in the Loralai district of Pakistan. The supplemental immunization activities were carried out in two phases during 2001-03.A state-transition model was used to estimate the effect of routine vaccination with tetanus toxoid as well as vaccination with tetanus toxoid during supplementary immunization activities. The model follows each woman in the target population from birth until the end of her childbearing years, using age-specific fertility data and vaccination history to determine the number of births at risk for neonatal tetanus. Recently published data on the incidence of neonatal tetanus from Loralai were used to determine the number of cases occurring with and without supplementary immunization activities. Data on the costs of the activities were collected from the UNICEF office in Balochistan and from the Provincial Health Department.Using base-case assumptions we estimated that the supplementary immunization activities would prevent 280 cases of neonatal tetanus and 224 deaths from neonatal tetanus between 2001 and 2034. Implementation of the supplementary activities was relatively inexpensive. The cost per tetanus toxoid dose delivered was 0.40 U.S. dollars. In the base-case analysis the cost per death averted was 117.00 U.S. dollars (95% confidence interval (CI) = 78-205 U.S. dollars) and the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted was 3.61 U.S. dollars (95% Cl = 2.43-6.39 U.S. dollars).Compared with similar analyses of other interventions, the cost per DALY averted is a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio. However, if routine diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccination coverage in the Loralai district had been higher (at a coverage rate of about 80%) the cost-effectiveness of the intervention would have been even more favourable, at 2.65 U.S. dollars per DALY averted.",2004-99-13933,15628201,Bull World Health Organ,Ulla K Griffiths,2004,82 / 9,643-51,No,15628201,"Ulla K Griffiths; Lara J Wolfson; Arshad Quddus; Mohammed Younus; Rehan A Hafiz; Incremental cost-effectiveness of supplementary immunization activities to prevent neonatal tetanus in Pakistan, Bull World Health Organ, ; 82(9):0042-9686; 643-51",DALY,Pakistan,Not Stated,Immunization,"Children given DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) Vaccine at 6, 10, and 14 weeks; pregnant women receive tetanus shot at first contact with health system and 2nd dose 4 weeks after vs. Standard/Usual Care- Routine immunization",Pregnant women and their children in Loralai district of Pakistan,64 Years,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,3.61,United States,2002,5.19
25808,"Intracranial haemorrhage due to late onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding in Hanoi province, Vietnam","BACKGROUND: In many developing countries vitamin K prophylaxis is not routinely administered at birth. There are insufficient data to assess the cost effectiveness of its implementation in such countries. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of intracranial haemorrhage caused by late onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding in Hanoi, Vietnam. METHODS: Cases of intracranial haemorrhage in infants aged 1-13 weeks were identified in Hanoi province for 5 years (1995-1999), and evidence for vitamin K deficiency was sought. The data were compared with those on vitamin K deficiency bleeding in developed countries and used to obtain an approximation to the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage caused by vitamin K deficiency bleeding in Hanoi. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of late onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding in infants who received no prophylaxis was unexpectedly high (116 per 100,000 births) with 142 and 81 per 100,000 births in rural and urban areas respectively. Mortality was 9%. Of the surviving infants, 42% were neurologically abnormal at the time of hospital discharge. Identified associations were rural residence, male sex, and low birth weight. A significant reduction in the incidence was observed in urban Hanoi during 1998 and 1999, after vitamin K prophylaxis was introduced at one urban obstetric hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K deficiency bleeding is a major public health problem in Hanoi. The results indicate that routine vitamin K prophylaxis would significantly reduce infant morbidity and mortality in Vietnam and, costing an estimated 87 US dollars (48 pounds, 72 Euro) per disability adjusted life year saved, is a highly cost effective intervention.",2004-XX-00128,15499152,Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,N Danielsson,2004,89 / 6,F546-50,No,15499152,"N Danielsson; D P Hoa; N V Thang; Theo Vos; P M Loughnan; D P Hoa; N V Thang; T Vos; P M Loughnan; Intracranial haemorrhage due to late onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding in Hanoi province, Vietnam, Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed, 2004-Nov; 89(6):1359-2998; F546-50",DALY,Viet Nam,Not Stated,"Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Other",Vitamin K prophylaxis vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,87,United States,2004,119.2
25809,Iron fortification and iron supplementation are cost-effective interventions to reduce iron deficiency in four subregions of the world,"Iron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world, affecting millions of people in both nonindustrialized and industrialized countries. We estimated the costs, effects, and cost-effectiveness of iron supplementation and iron fortification interventions in 4 regions of the world. The effects on population health were arrived at by using a population model designed to estimate the lifelong impact of iron supplementation or iron fortification on individuals benefiting from such interventions. The population model took into consideration effectiveness, patient adherence, and geographic coverage. Costs were based on primary data collection and on a review of the literature. At 95% geographic coverage, iron supplementation has a larger impact on population health than iron fortification. Iron supplementation would avert <12,500 disability adjusted life years (DALY) annually in the European subregion, with very low rates of adult and child mortality, to almost 2.5 million DALYs in the African and Southeast Asian subregions, with high rates of adult and child mortality. On the other hand, fortification is less costly than supplementation and appears to be more cost effective than iron supplementation, regardless of the geographic coverage of fortification. We conclude that iron fortification is economically more attractive than iron supplementation. However, spending the extra resources to implement iron supplementation is still a cost-effective option. The results should be interpreted with caution, because evidence of intervention effectiveness predominantly relates to small-scale efficacy trials, which may not reflect the actual effect under expected conditions.",2004-99-00147,15465766,J Nutr,Rob Baltussen,2004,134 / 10,2678-84,No,15465766,"Rob Baltussen; Cécile Knai; Mona Sharan; Cécile Knai; Mona Sharan; Iron fortification and iron supplementation are cost-effective interventions to reduce iron deficiency in four subregions of the world, J Nutr, 2004-Oct; 134(10):0022-3166; 2678-84",DALY,"Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Togo",Not Stated,Other,Iron supplementation vs. None,Pregnant,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,30,United States,2000,45.09

At 95% geographic coverage, iron supplementation has a larger impact on population health than iron fortification. Iron supplementation would avert <12,500 disability adjusted life years (DALY) annually in the European subregion, with very low rates of adult and child mortality, to almost 2.5 million DALYs in the African and Southeast Asian subregions, with high rates of adult and child mortality. On the other hand, fortification is less costly than supplementation and appears to be more cost effective than iron supplementation, regardless of the geographic coverage of fortification. We conclude that iron fortification is economically more attractive than iron supplementation. However, spending the extra resources to implement iron supplementation is still a cost-effective option.

25817,The cost-effectiveness of technology transfer using telemedicine,"The high burden of disease in developing countries often makes it difficult for health systems in these countries to attain the same level of specialist skills as industrialized countries. Technology transfer is one way to improve specialist skills whilst at the same time reducing the burden of disease. This paper describes the use of teleophthalmology, a form of telemedicine, as a mode of technology transfer between the United Kingdom and South Africa. As the burden of eye disease in South Africa is high, the country cannot afford the level of ophthalmic specialization achieved in the UK. The paper estimates the cost-effectiveness of the technology transfer project in terms of a cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted. We found the technology transfer project to be cost-effective in reducing the burden of eye disease, and that practitioners in South Africa also learned novel procedures that could help future patients and improve cost-effectiveness.

Simulation-modelling techniques are used to present a 95% uncertainty interval (UI) around the cost-effectiveness ratios.Compared to current practice, CBT by public psychologists is the most cost-effective intervention for MDD in children and adolescents at A$9000 per DALY saved (95% UI A$3900 to A$24 000). SSRIs and CBT by other providers are less cost-effective but likely to be less than A$50 000 per DALY saved (> 80% chance). CBT is more effective than SSRIs in children and adolescents, resulting in a greater total health benefit (DALYs saved) than could be achieved with SSRIs. Issues that require attention for the CBT intervention include equity concerns, ensuring an adequate workforce, funding arrangements and acceptability to various stakeholders.Cognitive behavioural therapy provided by a public psychologist is the most effective and cost-effective option for the first-line treatment of MDD in children and adolescents. However, this option is not currently accessible by all patients and will require change in policy to allow more widespread uptake. It will also require ""start-up"" costs and attention to ensuring an adequate workforce.",2004-99-13809,15298580,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,Michelle M Haby,2004,38 / 8,579-91,No,15298580,"Michelle M Haby; Bruce Tonge; Lyn Littlefield; Rob Carter; Theo Vos; Cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for major depression in children and adolescents, Aust N Z J Psychiatry, ; 38(8):0004-8674; 579-91",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical",Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as second line treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,23000,Australia,2000,20102.03
25837,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cataract surgery: a global and regional analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the population health effects, costs and cost effectiveness of selected cataract surgery interventions in areas of the world with different epidemiological profiles. METHODS: Effectiveness estimates are based on a review of the literature taking into account factors such as operative failure, complications and patient non-compliance. A population model was applied to follow the lifelong impact on individuals having cataract surgery. Costing estimates are based on primary data collected in 14 epidemiological subregions by regional costing teams and on a literature review. Costings were estimated for different geographical coverage levels using non-linear cost functions. FINDINGS: Intra- and extra-capsular cataract surgeries are cost-effective ways to reduce the impact of cataract-blindness. Extra-capsular cataract surgery is more cost-effective than intra-capsular surgery in all regions considered. Providing extra-capsular cataract surgery to 95% of those who need it (95% coverage level) would avert over 3.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per year globally. The cost-effectiveness ranges from 57 International dollars (1 dollar) per DALY in the WHO South-East Asia Region where there is high overall child and adult mortality to 1 dollar 2307 per DALY in the WHO Western Pacific Region where there is low overall child and adult mortality.

METHODS: Effectiveness estimates are based on a review of the literature taking into account factors such as operative failure, complications and patient non-compliance. A population model was applied to follow the lifelong impact on individuals having cataract surgery. Costing estimates are based on primary data collected in 14 epidemiological subregions by regional costing teams and on a literature review. Costings were estimated for different geographical coverage levels using non-linear cost functions. FINDINGS: Intra- and extra-capsular cataract surgeries are cost-effective ways to reduce the impact of cataract-blindness. Extra-capsular cataract surgery is more cost-effective than intra-capsular surgery in all regions considered. Providing extra-capsular cataract surgery to 95% of those who need it (95% coverage level) would avert over 3.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per year globally.

Most attention has been given to preventing vertical transmission based on analysis showing nevirapine to be inexpensive and cost-effective.The following were determined using data from eight African countries: national program costs and impact on infant infections; reductions in adult HIV prevalence and unintended pregnancies among HIV-infected women that would have equivalent impact on infant HIV infections averted as the nevirapine intervention; and the cost threshold for drugs with greater efficacy than nevirapine yielding an equivalent cost per DALY saved.Average national annual program cost was 4.8 million dollars.

Despite this, such interventions are not routinely delivered in Australian mental health services. The objective of the current study is to investigate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of introducing three types of family interventions, namely: behavioural family management (BFM); behavioural intervention for families (BIF); and multiple family groups (MFG) into current mental health services in Australia.The ICER of each of the family interventions is assessed from a health sector perspective, including the government, persons with schizophrenia and their families/carers using a standardized methodology. A two-stage approach is taken to the assessment of benefit. The first stage involves a quantitative analysis based on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The second stage involves application of 'second filter' criteria (including equity, strength of evidence, feasibility and acceptability to stakeholders) to results. The robustness of results is tested using multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis.The most cost-effective intervention, in order of magnitude, is BIF (8000 Australian dollars per DALY averted), followed by MFG (21,000 Australian dollars per DALY averted) and lastly BFM (28,000 Australian dollars per DALY averted).

25873,Pertussis vaccination strategies for neonates--an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis,"Hospitalisation and death from pertussis in highly immunised populations largely occurs before the first vaccination at 2 months. A Markov model was constructed to estimate the costs and health consequences of three strategies to reduce pertussis over the first 6 months of an infant's life. Earlier vaccination (at either birth or 1 month in addition to current practice) or vaccination of the parents soon after birth was compared with the current practice of vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months. The model was populated using data on the incidence and costs from Australia. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were used as the primary outcome measure. The cost to the Australian public health system was chosen as the economic perspective, and Monte-Carlo simulations were used to accommodate uncertainties in the variables. Vaccination at birth was estimated to cost (S.D.) an additional A$33.21 (A$1.60) per infant and to reduce cases, deaths and DALYs by 45%. Vaccination at 1 month was estimated to cost an additional A$43.24 (A$8.98) per infant and to reduce morbidity by approximately 25%. Parental vaccination at birth was the most expensive alternative, costing an additional A$73.38 (A$4.98) per infant and reducing pertussis morbidity by 38%. The costs per DALY averted were A$330,175 (A$15,461) A$735,994 (A$147,679) and A$787,504 (A$48,075) for the birth, 1 month and parental vaccination strategies, respectively. Changing the estimated factor by which hospitalisations and deaths are under-reported, and the efficacy of early vaccination, had large effects on results.

25875,Pertussis vaccination strategies for neonates--an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis,"Hospitalisation and death from pertussis in highly immunised populations largely occurs before the first vaccination at 2 months. A Markov model was constructed to estimate the costs and health consequences of three strategies to reduce pertussis over the first 6 months of an infant's life. Earlier vaccination (at either birth or 1 month in addition to current practice) or vaccination of the parents soon after birth was compared with the current practice of vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months. The model was populated using data on the incidence and costs from Australia. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were used as the primary outcome measure. The cost to the Australian public health system was chosen as the economic perspective, and Monte-Carlo simulations were used to accommodate uncertainties in the variables. Vaccination at birth was estimated to cost (S.D.) an additional A$33.21 (A$1.60) per infant and to reduce cases, deaths and DALYs by 45%. Vaccination at 1 month was estimated to cost an additional A$43.24 (A$8.98) per infant and to reduce morbidity by approximately 25%. Parental vaccination at birth was the most expensive alternative, costing an additional A$73.38 (A$4.98) per infant and reducing pertussis morbidity by 38%. The costs per DALY averted were A$330,175 (A$15,461) A$735,994 (A$147,679) and A$787,504 (A$48,075) for the birth, 1 month and parental vaccination strategies, respectively.

Aims To estimate the population-level cost-effectiveness of evidence-based depression interventions and their contribution towards reducing current burden. METHOD: Primary-care-based depression interventions were modelled at the level of whole populations in 14 epidemiological subregions of the world. Total population-level costs (in international dollars or I$) and effectiveness (disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted) were combined to form average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Evaluated interventions have the potential to reduce the current burden of depression by 10-30%. Pharmacotherapy with older antidepressant drugs, with or without proactive collaborative care, are currently more cost-effective strategies than those using newer antidepressants, particularly in lower-income subregions. CONCLUSIONS: Even in resource-poor regions, each DALYaverted by efficient depression treatments in primary care costs less than 1 year of average per capita income, making such interventions a cost-effective use of health resources.
